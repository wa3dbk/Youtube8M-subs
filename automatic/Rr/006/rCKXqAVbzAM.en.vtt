little bit give you a tour
we've<00:00:12.840> had<00:00:13.019> eight<00:00:13.230> row<00:00:13.410> heads<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> long

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
we've had eight row heads for a long

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.680 
we've had eight row heads for a long
time<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:15.540> we're<00:00:15.750> going<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> 12

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
time and now we're going up to a 12

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:24.800 
time and now we're going up to a 12
let's<00:00:18.690> see<00:00:18.869> how<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.140> works<00:00:23.420> see<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.600> hole

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
let's see how it works see the hole

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.330 
let's see how it works see the hole
right<00:00:25.080> here<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> course<00:00:25.920> where<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
right here that's of course where the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.810 
right here that's of course where the
combine<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.510> plugs<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:28.699> you<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.789> a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
combine kind of plugs in you have a

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.979 
combine kind of plugs in you have a
drive<00:00:30.150> shaft<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:31.279> either<00:00:32.279> side<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:33.809> that's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
drive shaft on either side and that's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
drive shaft on either side and that's
how<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.230> whole<00:00:34.380> machine<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.070> powered<00:00:35.280> is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
how the whole machine is powered is

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.780 
how the whole machine is powered is
through<00:00:36.480> pto<00:00:37.020> off<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.129> combine<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:40.640> got<00:00:41.640> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
through pto off the combine and got this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.420 
through pto off the combine and got this
what<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.149> call<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> single<00:00:42.660> point<00:00:43.020> connection

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
what you call a single point connection

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.069 
what you call a single point connection
that<00:00:44.430> plugs<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.180> combine<00:00:45.600> takes<00:00:45.960> care

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
that plugs into the combine takes care

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.060 
that plugs into the combine takes care
of<00:00:46.260> all<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.500> hydraulic<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> electrical

through the machine you just want an get

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.709 
through the machine you just want an get
a<00:02:04.140> few<00:02:04.380> leaves<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.009> most<00:02:05.219> part<00:02:05.540> but<00:02:06.540> the

damage the stock a little bit and start

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.080 
damage the stock a little bit and start

before<00:04:05.610> we<00:04:05.970> get<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.239> put<00:04:06.360> it<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.540> work<00:04:08.000> but

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
before we get to put it to work but

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.100 
before we get to put it to work but
that'll<00:04:10.890> be<00:04:10.980> pretty<00:04:11.160> exciting<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.730> go<00:04:12.110> start

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
that'll be pretty exciting to go start

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.190 
that'll be pretty exciting to go start
running<00:04:13.379> 12<00:04:13.650> rows<00:04:13.860> instead<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.340> eight<00:04:15.019> we<00:04:16.019> also

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
running 12 rows instead of eight we also

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.569 
running 12 rows instead of eight we also
have<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> new<00:04:16.859> platform<00:04:17.160> a<00:04:17.870> Flex<00:04:18.870> Draper

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
have a new platform a Flex Draper

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.129 
have a new platform a Flex Draper
cutting<00:04:20.579> soybeans<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.209> wheat<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.720> maybe<00:04:21.989> I'll

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
cutting soybeans and wheat so maybe I'll

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.890 
cutting soybeans and wheat so maybe I'll
get<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.380> video<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.479> explain<00:04:24.479> how<00:04:24.690> that

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
get a video on that to explain how that

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.870 
get a video on that to explain how that
works

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
works

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.120
