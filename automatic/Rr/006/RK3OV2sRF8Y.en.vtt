00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
know it it's I like the bottom it's just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490

to<00:01:34.560> stick<00:01:34.829> there<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.479> it's<00:01:36.479> probably<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> lot

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
to stick there and it's probably a lot

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.280 
to stick there and it's probably a lot
easier<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.740> keep<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:38.040> making<00:01:38.159> big<00:01:38.520> mistakes

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
easier to keep from making big mistakes

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.690 
easier to keep from making big mistakes
there<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.560> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.189> made<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> mistake
