00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.820 
over the dog
I<00:01:32.430> made<00:01:33.430> sure<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:34.330> dog<00:01:34.600> was<00:01:34.900> spotlessly

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
clean properly bathe properly dried so

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.749 
clean properly bathe properly dried so
that<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.300> hair<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.720> as<00:01:40.900> straight<00:01:41.440> as<00:01:41.650> possible

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
that the hair is as straight as possible

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.690 
that the hair is as straight as possible
because<00:01:42.759> if<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.240> hair<00:01:43.450> is<00:01:43.600> really<00:01:44.310> has<00:01:45.310> any

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
because if the hair is really has any

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.340 
because if the hair is really has any

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.500 
little higher in the rear than they are
in<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.959> shoulder<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:22.040> what<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:23.090> is

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
in the shoulder so what you can do is

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.210 
in the shoulder so what you can do is
use<00:02:24.410> your<00:02:24.560> comb<00:02:24.830> backwards<00:02:25.730> against<00:02:27.220> just

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
use your comb backwards against just

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.610 
use your comb backwards against just
over<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> hip<00:02:29.000> area<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:29.750> what<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.230> will<00:02:30.380> do

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
over the hip area and what that will do

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.820 
over the hip area and what that will do
is<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.800> will<00:02:31.160> shorten<00:02:31.760> it<00:02:32.349> just<00:02:33.349> in<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.769> one

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
is that will shorten it just in that one

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.650 
is that will shorten it just in that one
area<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.430> little<00:02:37.670> longer<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:38.450> and

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
area so it's a little longer here and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.809 
area so it's a little longer here and
it's<00:02:38.870> shorter<00:02:39.349> there<00:02:39.620> which<00:02:39.920> helps<00:02:40.280> give<00:02:40.519> us<00:02:40.670> a

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
it's shorter there which helps give us a

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:50.920 
it's shorter there which helps give us a
more<00:02:41.030> level<00:02:41.480> top<00:02:41.720> line

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.989
