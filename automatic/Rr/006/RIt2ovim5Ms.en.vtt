00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 Welcome to Bake the traffic today 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.210
 with the plugin animated frames with 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.160
 this plugin we can do a frame 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.750
 create a picture frame for what 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.769
 grab animated gifs on it if you like 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.030
 you watch the video then you see 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.929
 the short I show it but now synonymous 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.429
 right in the game 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.049
 we just need this plug-in 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 download link is and as always in 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.500
 the video description and we need 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.939
 red letters in any case 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.680
 packet list ap 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.960
 These we need these my plugins 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.550
 Download this game and at 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519
 I have you in the plug-in folder 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.579
 made one of the frames and the packet 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.410
 listens she needs jauch then stops 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
 and restarted your servers and then 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.890
 the folder is created up here as well 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.450
 animated frames here we have the frame 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.160
 there so if we animated gifs are 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.719
 Be there on the server 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.100
 they saved and a little config 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.170
 Let's go to the end of the video 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.570
 again in the game you have to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.980
 first build a frame 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.149
 I did a lot, I have one 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.780
 you can take black wool with you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.579
 to describe 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.829
 you have to definitely a item frame 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.210
 be here as a item frame and that is allowed 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.460
 do not include item 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 otherwise whole plugin does not work that way 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.070
 what do you have to prepare first 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.110
 I made it a bit bigger 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 because i have different big pictures 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 have tried and how do we get 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.170
 now an animated gif in there 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.939
 I looked at one on the internet 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.040
 picked out this is this one 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.659
 nobody knows about adventure time here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.130
 figurines and up here we only have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.210
 Of course , this could also be in front of yours 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.740
 save server 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.409
 locally on the servers would have to be natural 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.640
 Specifying the path is quite good here 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.200
 we can also just make the picture out of the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.210
 Internet take if the picture is no more 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.030
 then it's just off this picture 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.810
 is a hundred times 400 becomes big in the game 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.060
 less computes data frame not 400 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.549
 blocks times 400 so it costs 400 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.439
 Frames times 400 but that will be all in 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.810
 play converted as well as copy us 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.619
 above the url out and go back to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.689
 in the game 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.180
 there we give the command animated 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.270
 create blank frames and then the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.189
 url of the poison I have seen 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.659
 you have the p media blah blah blah and am 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.610
 end is vip.de press like renter 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.619
 now the plug-in says we have to go down 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.299
 make left again right click on it 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.979
 So if we press on it now 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.540
 she stands the picture on this frame 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.580
 I 'll do it now 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.739
 right click and now it's building like that 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.360
 Slowly the picture on her see frames closely 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.740
 brought together so that there are no gaps 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 and as you see 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.460
 it's just an animated gif like that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.110
 can you really write now 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.000
 animated writing on your server for 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.310
 social games or similar easy 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.960
 now with animated things and make 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.650
 that just looks really cool lay out 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.500
 but not is hardly eats performance 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.640
 and how it looks really awesome the whole 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.860
 Of course, one disappears 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.680
 Certain reach if you are now 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.030
 Going further away then is his way 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.130
 how you see how beautiful the whole frames 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.850
 because now synonymous for the plug-in then 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.540
 are visible 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.980
 that happened two frames he owns 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.750
 The range could be the corresponding one 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.550
 Settings not so big you 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.930
 could screw it down if it was 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.610
 you or any people yet 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.920
 once lay there as you can see that is going on here 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.780
 Everything really super fluid and we have 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 no mistakes here if we could do that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.200
 want to go out now we give 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.600
 just an animated frames remove 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 press enter and go down here 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.200
 to the corner and just press again 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.000
 right click on and the frame is already there 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.440
 deleted here it goes again briefly in 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.270
 the plaques in folder and open there 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.890
 how to mainframes folder 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.010
 here we have the config in there 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.600
 We open the animated here 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.310
 distance that is 32 blocks distance 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.660
 we can see the whole 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.940
 course pants down like it screw 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.980
 because you are the best fit for you 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 let on 230 or halt your unstable 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.550
 customize so with this plugin you can 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.260
 definitely do a lot of things 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.880
 You can really write you can 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.740
 animations you can for rpg server 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.960
 make any signposts 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.790
 create any quests where stop 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.800
 any ads are created or 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.540
 any gifts or whatever 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.130
 always there is so much possible with these 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.960
 things and it looks even more cool 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.520
 so if you are really good with photoshop 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.410
 side or with gimp or whatever 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.540
 or you have a designer you 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.310
 this is what animated writing looks like 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.140
 every case really cool so so 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.370
 you can definitely from various 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.380
 lobbies then take off 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.520
 that was the plug-in animated frames 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.110
 leave it up here on everyone 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.940
 continue if you do not miss 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.310
 want to move here now on this abo 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.170
 bucket and everything important is as always 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.850
 below in the video description so 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.850
 then until the next video ciao
