00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.780

think<00:03:49.790> according<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:50.960> PV<00:03:51.320> I<00:03:51.530> guess<00:03:52.340> Luca

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
think according to this PV I guess Luca

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.760 
think according to this PV I guess Luca
and<00:03:52.910> Kaito<00:03:53.540> are<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:53.960> the<00:03:54.110> two<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.440> this<00:03:54.530> one

and Kaito are like the two in this one

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.570 
and Kaito are like the two in this one
the<00:03:55.250> two<00:03:56.320> protagonists<00:03:57.320> not<00:03:57.500> protagonists<00:03:58.250> by

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
the two protagonists not protagonists by

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.440 
the two protagonists not protagonists by

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.500 
going I want to try explain during this
PV<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.160> think<00:04:10.490> instead<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.060> just<00:04:11.210> like<00:04:11.360> the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
PV I think instead of just like the

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.430 
PV I think instead of just like the
songs<00:04:11.810> PV<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:14.630> I'm<00:04:14.720> guessing<00:04:15.020> in<00:04:15.080> this<00:04:15.230> case

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
songs PV so I'm guessing in this case

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.680 
songs PV so I'm guessing in this case
Mika<00:04:16.160> are<00:04:16.340> not<00:04:16.520> Miku<00:04:16.820> Luca<00:04:17.239> she's<00:04:17.540> going

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
Mika are not Miku Luca she's going

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.240 
Mika are not Miku Luca she's going
through<00:04:17.840> a<00:04:17.930> piece<00:04:18.170> of<00:04:18.200> relationship<00:04:19.100> with

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
through a piece of relationship with

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.610 
through a piece of relationship with
Kaito<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:20.299> she<00:04:20.419> can't<00:04:20.600> handle<00:04:20.780> it<00:04:21.049> anymore

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
Kaito and she can't handle it anymore

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.250 
Kaito and she can't handle it anymore
but<00:04:22.280> then<00:04:22.430> Kaito<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.210> she<00:04:23.570> keeps<00:04:23.810> going<00:04:24.050> back

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
but then Kaito but she keeps going back

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.820 
but then Kaito but she keeps going back
to<00:04:24.320> kite

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
to kite

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.969 
to kite
why<00:04:25.220> we<00:04:25.610> don't<00:04:25.879> know<00:04:26.289> sometimes<00:04:27.289> people<00:04:27.680> are

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
why we don't know sometimes people are

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.850 
why we don't know sometimes people are
just<00:04:28.129> like<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.520> just<00:04:28.960> they<00:04:29.960> just<00:04:30.530> can't<00:04:30.710> get

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
just like that just they just can't get

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.249 
just like that just they just can't get
out<00:04:30.949> of<00:04:31.039> that<00:04:31.069> broken<00:04:31.940> relationship<00:04:32.930> that

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
out of that broken relationship that

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.040 
out of that broken relationship that
abusive<00:04:33.680> relationship<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:35.090> I<00:04:35.389> guess<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.870> this

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
abusive relationship so I guess in this

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.770 
abusive relationship so I guess in this
case<00:04:36.289> yeah<00:04:36.800> Luka<00:04:37.280> it's<00:04:37.370> like<00:04:37.580> she<00:04:38.330> doesn't

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780
