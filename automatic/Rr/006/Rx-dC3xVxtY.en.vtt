00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
dialysis or a kidney transplant and so

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.350 
dialysis or a kidney transplant and so
it's<00:01:21.689> serious<00:01:22.170> stuff<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.970> thing<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it's serious stuff and the thing is that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.109 
it's serious stuff and the thing is that
doctors<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.409> often<00:01:25.740> trained<00:01:26.280> very<00:01:26.790> well

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
doctors are not often trained very well

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.899 
doctors are not often trained very well
on<00:01:27.500> natural<00:01:28.500> things<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.549> think<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
on natural things and so they think the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.340 
on natural things and so they think the
only<00:01:29.939> thing<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.360> available<00:01:30.479> are<00:01:30.990> these

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
only thing that's available are these

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
only thing that's available are these
synthetic<00:01:31.920> drugs<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:33.090> they<00:01:33.180> don't

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
synthetic drugs because they don't

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.789 
synthetic drugs because they don't
really<00:01:33.420> study<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> lot<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> nutrition<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really study a lot of nutrition and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.200 
really study a lot of nutrition and
natural<00:01:34.890> medicine<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.579> medical<00:01:35.970> school

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
natural medicine in medical school

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.270 
natural medicine in medical school
there's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> bias<00:01:36.750> against<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> unfortunately

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
there's a bias against it unfortunately

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.370 
there's a bias against it unfortunately
so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> doctors<00:01:39.900> fault<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.229> just

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so it's not the doctors fault they just

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.039 
so it's not the doctors fault they just
haven't<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.950> seen<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> evidence<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.960> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
haven't really seen the evidence but I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.840 
haven't really seen the evidence but I
can<00:01:43.229> tell<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.340> lifestyle

conditions<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.840> significant<00:01:48.840> it's

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
conditions is really significant it's

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
important and there's proven things that

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.100 
important and there's proven things that
can<00:01:51.180> make<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> big<00:01:51.450> difference

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
can make a big difference

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
can make a big difference
it<00:01:52.439> starts<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:52.979> knowing<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.939> an

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
it starts with knowing when an

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
it starts with knowing when an
anti-inflammatory<00:01:54.570> diet<00:01:55.259> looks<00:01:55.680> like<00:01:55.860> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
anti-inflammatory diet looks like you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
anti-inflammatory diet looks like you
have<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.880> raw<00:01:57.119> materials<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.990> of
