solution that has been come up with is
to<00:01:18.670> use<00:01:18.940> this<00:01:19.750> type<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.140> adapter<00:01:21.100> cable<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.540> I'm

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
to use this type of adapter cable so I'm

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.540 
to use this type of adapter cable so I'm
going<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.080> show<00:01:23.290> you<00:01:23.350> how<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:23.770> use<00:01:24.130> this

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
going to show you how to use this

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.540 
going to show you how to use this
adapter<00:01:24.970> cable<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:25.930> you<00:01:26.140> receive<00:01:26.620> this<00:01:26.950> cable

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
adapter cable and you receive this cable

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.870 
adapter cable and you receive this cable
it's<00:01:27.820> fat<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:29.500> tempted<00:01:30.010> just<00:01:30.220> to<00:01:30.370> put<00:01:30.700> in

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
it's fat you're tempted just to put in

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.330 
it's fat you're tempted just to put in
the<00:01:31.180> connection<00:01:31.690> like<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.230> and<00:01:32.590> like<00:01:33.070> this

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
the connection like this and like this

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.430 
the connection like this and like this
and<00:01:33.640> but<00:01:34.420> there's<00:01:34.690> two<00:01:34.900> problem<00:01:35.230> three

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
and but there's two problem three

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.440 
and but there's two problem three
problems<00:01:35.710> first<00:01:36.220> biggest<00:01:36.760> problem<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.150> it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
problems first biggest problem is it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.960 
problems first biggest problem is it
will<00:01:37.750> work<00:01:37.810> when<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.590> try<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:38.860> second<00:01:39.640> problem

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
will work when you try it second problem

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.710 
will work when you try it second problem
is<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.700> side<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:42.940> connector<00:01:43.270> won't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
is that this side of the connector won't

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.040 
is that this side of the connector won't
fit<00:01:44.080> in<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.520> third<00:01:45.700> problem<00:01:46.000> is<00:01:46.300> that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
fit in and the third problem is that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.560 
fit in and the third problem is that
it's<00:01:47.650> a<00:01:47.890> little<00:01:48.070> bit<00:01:48.190> offset<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:49.180> where<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
it's a little bit offset so where the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.350 
it's a little bit offset so where the
connections<00:01:50.110> supposed<00:01:50.620> to<00:01:50.800> be<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:52.030> there's<00:01:52.270> a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
connections supposed to be so there's a

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.260 
connections supposed to be so there's a
proper<00:01:52.930> way<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.500> do<00:01:53.860> this<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.640> proper<00:01:54.670> way<00:01:55.240> to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
proper way to do this the proper way to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.300 
proper way to do this the proper way to
do<00:01:55.570> this<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.740> take<00:01:56.979> this<00:01:57.460> cable

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
do this is to take this cable

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.000 
do this is to take this cable
to<00:01:59.939> fold<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:01.320> so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.560 

the<00:02:07.010> way<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.250> can<00:02:07.430> tell<00:02:07.700> if<00:02:07.880> it's<00:02:08.030> folded

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
the way you can tell if it's folded

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.010 
the way you can tell if it's folded
right<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.289> there's<00:02:09.710> this<00:02:11.020> harder

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
right is that there's this harder

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.430 
right is that there's this harder
plastic<00:02:12.370> orange<00:02:13.370> tab<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:14.090> top<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.990> as

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
plastic orange tab on top and as

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.870 
plastic orange tab on top and as
supposed<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.160> stay<00:02:16.550> on<00:02:16.850> top<00:02:18.220> once<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.430> fold<00:02:19.700> it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
supposed to stay on top once you fold it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.210 
supposed to stay on top once you fold it
like<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.920> put<00:02:22.250> connector<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.950> you

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
like this you put connector in and you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.030 
like this you put connector in and you
put<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.550> here<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.780> it's<00:02:27.110> lines<00:02:27.500> up<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
put it here and now it's lines up and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.699 
put it here and now it's lines up and
everything<00:02:28.940> will<00:02:29.120> work<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:29.900> cable<00:02:30.470> from

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
everything will work so your cable from

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.949 
everything will work so your cable from
the<00:02:30.860> laptop<00:02:31.340> will<00:02:31.730> go<00:02:32.000> here<00:02:32.270> and<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.690> plug<00:02:32.900> it
