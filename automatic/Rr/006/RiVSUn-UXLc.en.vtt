00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello how good is a makeup 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.290
 of halloween for guys like 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:17.519
 close dates have placed an order 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.920
 I have been sent this photo the truth that 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.310
 I liked very much and good waiting 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.619
 that if there are many that you encourage 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.679
 disguise you a little this halloween well 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.970
 Well I decided to make that makeup 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:34.590
 so nothing here I leave you step by step 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.990
 we started by putting white on 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.470
 face although if you do not want to wear the 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:43.440
 face so clear you can also use a 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.630
 makeup base tone that is a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.820
 little bit clearer than yours or 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.820
 even your skin tone 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.850
 like the makeup of the account that I 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:16.170
 they have sent a haul that brings the face 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:19.340
 white in my case the son in white with 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.550
 a translucent volvo I will go nuanced 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:36.890
 the area of ​​the eyes 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:39.110
 but this of the face also for the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.460
 eyes let's start with the pencil in 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 black 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.520
 leaving darker lashes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:58.830
 and we are going to make a half circle that 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:02:02.000
 then it diffuses from mobile the part 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.330
 we're going to work below 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.750
 flush with the lower lashes joining 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:16.520
 with the top at the end and 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.370
 taking advantage of that we continue with the pencil 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:26.030
 let's work the water line in the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:38.720
 lower part and in the upper part and 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:46.160
 we work the same in the other eye we go 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:55.700
 to begin to blur it leaving more 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:57.790
 dark flush with the eyelashes and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.160
 we started to apply the black shadow 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.459
 over what we have done with the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.459
 pencil 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.660
 once you have put the intensity that 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.660
 we want to start blurring it 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.670
 we are a little more intense in the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:39.799
 inner area of ​​the eye blurring and 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:43.129
 raising them towards the eyebrow the part 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:47.859
 inferior the same where we have worked 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.859
 the black pencil we are going to apply the shadow 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.579
 and now with a shadow in a garnet tone 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.189
 let's go where we had finished 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.629
 blur the black and we're going 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.629
 rising little by little upwards 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:25.710
 the same we mark the eyebrow with shadow 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:31.350
 black you can use pencil if you want more 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:34.020
 intensity and we finish with the mask 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.340
 of tabs and if you want more intensity 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.280
 in the look 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.470
 you can mark with a black eyeliner all 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.710
 contour 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.630
 we had just simply followed the 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.969
 same way that I was carrying the girl of the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.699
 image 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.829
 marking on the outside filling with pencil 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:56.379
 and then with a brush that the bar 

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:56.379
 lips so that it is more contoured 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:07.860
 we mark more white a circle 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:10.410
 of the cheeks and first with a pencil and 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:17.970
 go marking little by little the shape of the 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:23.420
 spiral to then with the bar 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.420
 lips a thin brush mark the reddest 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:57.030
 then with the white paint and filled 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:06:00.350
 the interior and also all the exterior and 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.350
 we will see this exterior 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.800
 and now with a black shadow we are going to 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:18.290
 board the edge and blur it 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:26.410
 little bit that way it's going to look like 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:30.680
 the moflete highlights more and to finish 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:32.830
 we make two black lines below the 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.830
 mouth 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:42.779
 the extensions as this is the 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:44.520
 good result I've placed myself this way 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:47.039
 white with the bow tie how to carry the 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.779
 girl the jacket so nothing 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.029

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.860
