so<00:00:04.400> we<00:00:05.400> call<00:00:05.640> conventional<00:00:06.120> heart<00:00:06.930> bypass

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
so we call conventional heart bypass

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.110 
so we call conventional heart bypass
surgery<00:00:07.470> would<00:00:08.130> be<00:00:08.280> done<00:00:08.490> through<00:00:08.910> an

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
surgery would be done through an

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.000 
surgery would be done through an
incision<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.080> chest<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.679> that's<00:00:10.860> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
incision in the chest so that's a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.640 
incision in the chest so that's a
sternotomy<00:00:11.580> incision<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.599> incision<00:00:13.349> is

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
sternotomy incision that incision is

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.860 
sternotomy incision that incision is
typically<00:00:14.420> somewhere<00:00:15.420> in<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.599> range<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
typically somewhere in the range of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
typically somewhere in the range of
about<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.410> long<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.430> somewhere<00:00:17.699> about<00:00:17.880> 8

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
about that long so somewhere about 8

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.779 
about that long so somewhere about 8
inches<00:00:18.270> long<00:00:18.590> we<00:00:19.590> would<00:00:19.710> also<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.340> small

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
inches long we would also have a small

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.750 
inches long we would also have a small
incision<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.449> leg<00:00:21.750> where<00:00:22.710> vein<00:00:23.310> from<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
incision in the leg where vein from the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.349 
incision in the leg where vein from the
leg<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.539> taken<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:26.400> operation<00:00:27.000> itself

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
leg is taken the operation itself

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.040 
leg is taken the operation itself
consists<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:29.210> getting<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.420> mammary

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
consists of first getting the mammary

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.080 
consists of first getting the mammary
artery<00:00:31.380> prepared<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> art<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.969> we

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
artery prepared so that's the art of we

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.940 
artery prepared so that's the art of we
used<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.450> do<00:00:33.570> bypass<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> same<00:00:34.649> time

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
used to do bypass and at the same time

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.720 
used to do bypass and at the same time
we're<00:00:35.280> taking<00:00:36.120> vein<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> leg<00:00:36.930> once<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
we're taking vein from the leg once that

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
we're taking vein from the leg once that
process<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:39.000> been<00:00:39.329> taken<00:00:39.930> care<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
process has been taken care of then the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.950 
process has been taken care of then the
patient<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.730> put<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> heart-lung<00:00:42.660> bypass

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
patient is put on a heart-lung bypass

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.369 
patient is put on a heart-lung bypass
machine<00:00:44.329> they're<00:00:45.329> given<00:00:45.690> heparin<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
machine they're given heparin so the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.810 
machine they're given heparin so the
blood<00:00:46.530> doesn't<00:00:46.590> clot<00:00:46.920> during<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.579> period

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
blood doesn't clot during that period

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.850 
blood doesn't clot during that period
put<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> heart-lung<00:00:48.660> bypass<00:00:48.690> machine<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
put on a heart-lung bypass machine and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.779 
put on a heart-lung bypass machine and
then<00:00:50.570> while<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.840> heart<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:53.039> still<00:00:53.520> and

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
then while the heart is is still and

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.750 
then while the heart is is still and
quiet<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.660> sew<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.559> vein<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
quiet we would sew the vein to the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
quiet we would sew the vein to the
arteries<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> heart<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> idea<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
arteries on the heart and the idea is is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
arteries on the heart and the idea is is
actually<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.660> bypassing<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
actually we're actually bypassing the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
actually we're actually bypassing the
blockages<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> heart<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:02.699> not

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
blockages on the heart so we're not

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.939 
blockages on the heart so we're not
doing<00:01:03.090> anything<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.840> areas<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.769> are

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
doing anything to the areas that are

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.120 
doing anything to the areas that are
narrow<00:01:05.610> themselves<00:01:06.450> were<00:01:06.680> placing<00:01:07.680> our<00:01:07.799> blood

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
narrow themselves were placing our blood

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.950 
narrow themselves were placing our blood
a<00:01:08.310> route<00:01:08.549> for<00:01:08.820> blood<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.390> around<00:01:09.689> those

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
a route for blood to go around those

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.429 
a route for blood to go around those
blockages<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:12.450> patients<00:01:12.900> may<00:01:13.049> need<00:01:13.110> two

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
blockages and some patients may need two

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
blockages and some patients may need two
others<00:01:13.830> three<00:01:14.220> others<00:01:14.670> four<00:01:14.909> or<00:01:15.060> five

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
others three others four or five

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
others three others four or five
bypasses<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.650> individual<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
bypasses and it's it's individual it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.539 
bypasses and it's it's individual it's
based<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.900> patient's<00:01:19.680> arteries<00:01:20.369> are

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
based on how the patient's arteries are

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.700 
based on how the patient's arteries are
configured<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> how

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
configured and how

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.300 
configured and how
blockages<00:01:22.430> they<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:23.230> that<00:01:24.230> whole<00:01:24.470> procedure

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
blockages they have that whole procedure

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.060 
blockages they have that whole procedure
of<00:01:25.690> doing<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.780> bypasses<00:01:27.230> in<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.650> procedure

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
of doing the bypasses in the procedure

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.500 
of doing the bypasses in the procedure
takes<00:01:28.430> somewhere<00:01:28.730> between<00:01:28.910> three<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.300> four

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
takes somewhere between three and four

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.770 
takes somewhere between three and four
hours<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:30.080> do<00:01:33.460> almost<00:01:34.460> every<00:01:35.330> patient<00:01:35.750> that

high blood pressure high cholesterol so

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.630 
high blood pressure high cholesterol so
these<00:01:59.600> are<00:01:59.780> all<00:01:59.930> indications<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.190> person

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
these are all indications that a person

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.940 
these are all indications that a person
has<00:02:01.820> risk<00:02:02.240> factors<00:02:02.690> for<00:02:02.930> that<00:02:03.050> on<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.830> other

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
has risk factors for that on the other

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.350 
has risk factors for that on the other
hand<00:02:04.190> certainly<00:02:04.550> there<00:02:04.729> are<00:02:04.759> patients<00:02:05.240> who

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
hand certainly there are patients who

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.930 
hand certainly there are patients who
have<00:02:05.740> have<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:06.979> those<00:02:07.130> risk<00:02:07.399> factors<00:02:07.460> and

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940

tell somebody is that certainly at least

the day of surgery the day after surgery

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.509 
the day of surgery the day after surgery
you<00:02:56.629> know<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.930> pain<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.230> discomfort<00:02:57.709> is

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
you know the pain and discomfort is

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.250 
you know the pain and discomfort is
there<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.560> we<00:03:00.560> we<00:03:00.980> use<00:03:01.569> pain<00:03:02.569> medicine<00:03:03.079> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
there and we we use pain medicine to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.379 
there and we we use pain medicine to
make<00:03:03.440> sure<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.829> it's<00:03:04.060> controlled<00:03:05.060> as<00:03:05.209> well

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
make sure that it's controlled as well

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.360 
make sure that it's controlled as well
as<00:03:05.540> possible<00:03:06.109> and<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.799> think<00:03:07.010> most<00:03:07.190> people

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
as possible and I think most people

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
as possible and I think most people
who've<00:03:07.700> had<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.150> procedure<00:03:08.450> would<00:03:08.780> say<00:03:08.959> that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
who've had the procedure would say that

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.140 
who've had the procedure would say that
after<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.500> couple<00:03:09.769> days<00:03:10.040> they're<00:03:10.909> very

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
after a couple days they're very

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.410 
after a couple days they're very
comfortable<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:12.920> oral<00:03:13.549> pain<00:03:13.790> medicine

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
comfortable on just oral pain medicine

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.479 
comfortable on just oral pain medicine
and<00:03:14.629> they<00:03:14.780> go<00:03:14.930> home<00:03:15.109> on<00:03:15.349> that<00:03:15.560> patients

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
and they go home on that patients

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.339 
and they go home on that patients
typically<00:03:16.940> don't<00:03:17.090> need<00:03:17.359> pain<00:03:17.629> medicine<00:03:18.079> after

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
typically don't need pain medicine after

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.680 
typically don't need pain medicine after
two<00:03:18.530> or<00:03:18.680> three<00:03:18.709> weeks<00:03:19.190> but<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.209> think<00:03:20.449> it<00:03:20.569> would

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
two or three weeks but I think it would

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.569 
two or three weeks but I think it would
be<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.379> ask<00:03:21.590> most<00:03:21.889> people<00:03:22.280> who've<00:03:22.459> had

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
be if you ask most people who've had

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.339 
be if you ask most people who've had
bypass<00:03:23.060> surgery<00:03:23.090> they'd<00:03:23.540> say<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.989> they

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
bypass surgery they'd say that they

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.750 
bypass surgery they'd say that they
still<00:03:24.650> had<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:24.829> little<00:03:24.980> bit<00:03:25.099> of<00:03:25.220> soreness<00:03:25.639> a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
still had a little bit of soreness a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.039 
still had a little bit of soreness a
little<00:03:25.970> bit<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.150> comfort<00:03:26.389> and<00:03:26.629> that<00:03:26.750> may<00:03:26.900> have

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
little bit of comfort and that may have

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.599 
little bit of comfort and that may have
continued<00:03:27.530> on<00:03:27.680> for<00:03:27.949> several<00:03:28.220> weeks<00:03:28.250> after

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
continued on for several weeks after

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.659 
continued on for several weeks after
surgery<00:03:29.199> they<00:03:30.199> should<00:03:30.650> typically<00:03:31.040> be<00:03:31.280> back<00:03:31.489> to

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
surgery they should typically be back to

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.430 
surgery they should typically be back to
their<00:03:31.819> normal<00:03:31.940> activities<00:03:32.750> anywhere<00:03:33.169> from

their normal activities anywhere from
three<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.739> four<00:03:34.010> weeks<00:03:34.280> after<00:03:34.579> surgery<00:03:34.910> some

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
three to four weeks after surgery some

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.770 
three to four weeks after surgery some
people<00:03:35.870> are<00:03:36.049> ready<00:03:36.319> sooner<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.569> usually

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
people are ready sooner and it's usually

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.689 
people are ready sooner and it's usually
a<00:03:38.989> couple<00:03:39.379> months<00:03:39.709> through<00:03:40.010> when<00:03:40.430> we<00:03:40.549> do<00:03:40.669> a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
thing for patients but the change in

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.670 
thing for patients but the change in
medications<00:04:04.360> patients<00:04:05.360> are<00:04:05.420> doing<00:04:05.680> better

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
medications patients are doing better

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.920 
medications patients are doing better
without<00:04:07.519> having<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.450> need<00:04:08.599> for<00:04:08.629> bypass

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
without having the need for bypass

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.080 
without having the need for bypass
surgery<00:04:09.200> but<00:04:09.769> certainly<00:04:10.400> as<00:04:10.580> people<00:04:10.940> get

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
surgery but certainly as people get

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.550 
surgery but certainly as people get
older<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.680> population<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.840> have<00:04:14.840> other

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
older in the population and have other

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.189 
older in the population and have other
diseases<00:04:15.980> like<00:04:16.370> diabetes<00:04:16.720> etc<00:04:17.720> they<00:04:17.900> end<00:04:18.079> up

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
diseases like diabetes etc they end up

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.349 
diseases like diabetes etc they end up
those<00:04:18.620> times<00:04:18.979> needing<00:04:19.310> heart<00:04:19.519> bypass<00:04:19.699> surgery

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
those times needing heart bypass surgery

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.480 
those times needing heart bypass surgery
and<00:04:20.389> the<00:04:20.959> good<00:04:21.139> news<00:04:21.350> we<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.709> form<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.250> that

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
and the good news we have form is that

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.969 
and the good news we have form is that
people<00:04:23.120> are<00:04:23.240> doing<00:04:23.510> well<00:04:23.690> with<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.020> I'm<00:04:24.710> said

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
people are doing well with it I'm said

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.950 
people are doing well with it I'm said
by<00:04:25.100> press<00:04:25.340> surgery<00:04:25.669> has<00:04:25.850> progressed<00:04:26.240> quite<00:04:26.900> a

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
by press surgery has progressed quite a

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.440 
by press surgery has progressed quite a
bit<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.650> know<00:04:27.680> certainly<00:04:28.040> back<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.520> 1970s

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
bit you know certainly back in the 1970s

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.200 
bit you know certainly back in the 1970s
when<00:04:29.510> things<00:04:29.900> were<00:04:30.430> first<00:04:31.430> bypass<00:04:31.850> surgeries

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
when things were first bypass surgeries

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.650 
when things were first bypass surgeries
were<00:04:32.360> initiated<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.950> know<00:04:34.070> results<00:04:34.729> were

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
were initiated you know results were

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.659 
were initiated you know results were
relatively<00:04:36.260> unknown<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:36.950> then<00:04:37.040> in<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.220> 1980s

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
relatively unknown and then in the 1980s

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.560 
relatively unknown and then in the 1980s
brought<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:39.190> important<00:04:40.190> changes<00:04:41.120> like<00:04:41.360> using

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
brought in important changes like using

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.260 
brought in important changes like using
an<00:04:41.900> internal<00:04:42.650> mammary<00:04:42.919> artery<00:04:43.580> which<00:04:43.940> really

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
an internal mammary artery which really

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.790 
an internal mammary artery which really
has<00:04:44.539> made<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.810> difference<00:04:44.930> in<00:04:45.380> terms<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.710> the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
has made a difference in terms of the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.010 
has made a difference in terms of the
long<00:04:45.979> term<00:04:46.220> success<00:04:46.729> rate<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.300> really<00:04:47.900> more

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
long term success rate and really more

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.050 
long term success rate and really more
recently<00:04:48.530> I<00:04:48.560> think<00:04:48.710> in<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.039> 90s<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:49.699> in<00:04:49.850> this

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
recently I think in the 90s and in this

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.010 
recently I think in the 90s and in this
decade<00:04:50.740> we've<00:04:51.740> seen<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:53.030> survival

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
decade we've seen that the survival

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.290 
decade we've seen that the survival
rates<00:04:54.260> for<00:04:54.380> bypass<00:04:54.919> surgery<00:04:54.950> are<00:04:55.580> extremely

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
rates for bypass surgery are extremely

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.110 
rates for bypass surgery are extremely
good<00:04:56.570> so<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:57.139> all<00:04:57.590> across<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:58.130> country<00:04:58.280> only

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
good so that all across the country only

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.779 
good so that all across the country only
greater<00:04:59.510> than<00:04:59.720> 98%<00:05:00.169> close<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.950> 99%<00:05:01.400> of

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
greater than 98% close to 99% of

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.640 
greater than 98% close to 99% of
patients<00:05:01.970> will<00:05:02.419> survive<00:05:02.840> surgery<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.470> do

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
patients will survive surgery and do

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.310 
patients will survive surgery and do
very<00:05:04.370> well<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.940> and<00:05:05.599> I<00:05:05.690> think<00:05:05.930> that<00:05:06.139> the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
very well and and I think that the

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.020 
very well and and I think that the
long-term<00:05:06.530> results<00:05:07.190> of<00:05:07.280> bypass<00:05:07.639> surgery<00:05:07.940> are

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
long-term results of bypass surgery are

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.450 
long-term results of bypass surgery are
also<00:05:08.210> quite<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:09.349> think<00:05:09.440> what<00:05:09.800> we<00:05:10.010> can<00:05:10.039> say

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
also quite I think what we can say

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.409 
also quite I think what we can say
safely<00:05:11.450> and<00:05:12.320> fairly<00:05:12.860> that<00:05:13.099> patients<00:05:14.000> can<00:05:14.180> get

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
safely and fairly that patients can get

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.200 
safely and fairly that patients can get
an<00:05:14.660> excellent<00:05:15.080> bypass<00:05:15.919> operation<00:05:16.639> all<00:05:16.880> across

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
an excellent bypass operation all across

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.700 
an excellent bypass operation all across
the<00:05:17.419> country<00:05:17.539> at<00:05:17.930> different<00:05:18.289> kind<00:05:18.440> of<00:05:18.470> medical

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
the country at different kind of medical

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.140 
the country at different kind of medical
centers<00:05:19.160> there's<00:05:19.370> no<00:05:19.520> question<00:05:19.970> about<00:05:20.030> that

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
centers there's no question about that

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.210 
centers there's no question about that
the<00:05:21.570> difference<00:05:22.140> between<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.620> medical<00:05:22.980> center

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
the difference between a medical center

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.940 
the difference between a medical center
like<00:05:23.370> ours<00:05:23.520> is<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.480> we<00:05:25.080> have<00:05:25.320> physicians

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
like ours is that we have physicians

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.480 
like ours is that we have physicians
here<00:05:26.520> who<00:05:26.850> are<00:05:27.860> experienced<00:05:28.860> with<00:05:28.920> not<00:05:29.220> only

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
here who are experienced with not only

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.230 
here who are experienced with not only
bypass<00:05:29.910> surgery<00:05:30.390> but<00:05:30.600> with<00:05:31.760> more<00:05:32.760> complicated

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
bypass surgery but with more complicated

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.480 
bypass surgery but with more complicated
types<00:05:34.200> of<00:05:34.440> technologies<00:05:35.130> and<00:05:35.370> procedures

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
types of technologies and procedures

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.700 
types of technologies and procedures
that<00:05:35.850> some<00:05:36.450> patients<00:05:36.690> who<00:05:37.050> have<00:05:37.230> bypass

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
that some patients who have bypass

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.770 
that some patients who have bypass
surgery<00:05:38.130> may<00:05:38.310> need<00:05:38.550> for<00:05:39.000> example<00:05:39.390> there<00:05:39.750> are

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
surgery may need for example there are

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.740 
surgery may need for example there are
patients<00:05:40.350> who<00:05:40.440> have<00:05:40.650> very<00:05:41.270> low<00:05:42.270> heart

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
patients who have very low heart

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.080 
patients who have very low heart
function<00:05:43.290> who<00:05:43.830> need<00:05:44.010> bypass<00:05:44.520> surgery<00:05:44.970> and

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
function who need bypass surgery and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.430 
function who need bypass surgery and
those<00:05:45.180> patients<00:05:45.450> might<00:05:45.870> need<00:05:46.140> some

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
those patients might need some

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.600 
those patients might need some
additional<00:05:46.650> help

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
additional help

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.400 
additional help
before<00:05:48.030> or<00:05:48.180> after<00:05:48.210> surgery<00:05:48.720> with<00:05:49.140> their

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
before or after surgery with their

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.040 
before or after surgery with their
support<00:05:50.250> of<00:05:50.310> their<00:05:50.460> circulation<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.360> we<00:05:51.510> have

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
support of their circulation and we have

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.570 
support of their circulation and we have
an<00:05:52.170> excellent<00:05:52.440> program<00:05:52.830> in<00:05:53.430> heart<00:05:54.419> device<00:05:55.580> and

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
an excellent program in heart device and

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.730 
an excellent program in heart device and
heart<00:05:56.790> transplantation<00:05:57.600> and<00:05:58.320> I<00:05:58.410> think<00:05:58.590> that

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
heart transplantation and I think that

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.450 
heart transplantation and I think that
additional<00:05:59.280> expertise<00:05:59.930> really<00:06:01.190> provides<00:06:02.190> the

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
additional expertise really provides the

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.490 
additional expertise really provides the
difference<00:06:02.910> for<00:06:03.180> for<00:06:03.870> those<00:06:04.020> types<00:06:04.380> of

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
difference for for those types of

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.930 
difference for for those types of
patients<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:05.010> I<00:06:05.100> think<00:06:05.130> for<00:06:05.460> patients<00:06:05.850> who

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
patients and I think for patients who

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.260 
patients and I think for patients who
don't<00:06:06.390> even<00:06:06.750> need<00:06:06.870> that<00:06:06.930> we<00:06:07.890> have<00:06:08.190> a<00:06:08.760> center

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
don't even need that we have a center

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.570 
don't even need that we have a center
that<00:06:09.300> does<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.660> lot<00:06:09.930> of<00:06:09.990> heart<00:06:10.410> surgery<00:06:10.590> has

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
that does a lot of heart surgery has

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.240 
that does a lot of heart surgery has
excellent<00:06:12.120> results<00:06:12.570> across<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.770> breadth<00:06:14.040> of

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
excellent results across the breadth of

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.400 
excellent results across the breadth of
the<00:06:14.520> spectrum<00:06:15.480> of<00:06:15.600> heart<00:06:15.810> surgery<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.350> I

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
the spectrum of heart surgery and I

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.220 
the spectrum of heart surgery and I
think<00:06:16.650> that's<00:06:16.830> a<00:06:17.010> reason<00:06:17.340> to<00:06:17.540> that<00:06:18.540> patients

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
think that's a reason to that patients

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:20.510 
think that's a reason to that patients
should<00:06:19.260> feel<00:06:19.530> comfortable<00:06:19.740> having<00:06:20.310> their

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
should feel comfortable having their

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.940 
should feel comfortable having their
operation
