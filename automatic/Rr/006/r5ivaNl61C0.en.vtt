00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
long it felt like hours we are a little
kids<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:22.950> sure<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> probably<00:01:23.400> wasn't

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
kids but I'm sure it probably wasn't

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
kids but I'm sure it probably wasn't
more<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.090> 30<00:01:24.420> minutes<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.650> we

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
more than 30 minutes and just as we

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.140 
more than 30 minutes and just as we
thought<00:01:25.799> they'd<00:01:26.220> eventually<00:01:26.310> remembered

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
thought they'd eventually remembered

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.429 
thought they'd eventually remembered
that<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.630> were<00:01:27.720> supposed<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> come<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.380> us

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
that they were supposed to come get us

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.319 
that they were supposed to come get us
and<00:01:28.860> met<00:01:29.220> us<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.520> back<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.939> same<00:01:30.180> spot

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and met us right back at that same spot

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.410 
and met us right back at that same spot
and<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:31.110> were<00:01:31.229> still<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:32.520> remember<00:01:33.299> them

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and we were still there I remember them

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
and we were still there I remember them
being<00:01:33.509> angry<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.020> us<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.470> understanding<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
being angry at us but understanding that

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190 
being angry at us but understanding that
they<00:01:35.520> were<00:01:35.640> probably<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.119> shaken<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
they were probably just shaken up and I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.390 
they were probably just shaken up and I
mean<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.470> wasn't<00:01:37.680> our<00:01:37.829> fault<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.250> just

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
mean it wasn't our fault so we just

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
mean it wasn't our fault so we just
apologized<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.450> went<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.780> our<00:01:40.049> vacation
