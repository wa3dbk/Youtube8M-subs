00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
 Today it became known about the first in 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.650
 human history cosmic crash 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.890
 Tuesday evening at about 800 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.280
 kilometers on the territory of Siberia 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.120
 a major collision occurred 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.719
 aircraft near the grain 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.400
 orbit did not divide the Russian and 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.219
 American satellite zealously Russian 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.150
 ceremonial new spent his 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.830
 the term but the American seemed 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.680
 acting link system which 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.789
 enjoyed by civilian and military 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 departments including the pentagon 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.130
 debris satellites according to experts do not 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.570
 the earth intends to ec not threatening yet 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.880
 but as made constantin 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.119
 the goldenzweig future can deliver 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.990
 a lot of trouble 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.640
 rare inhabitants of the Taimyr Peninsula 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.650
 slept soundly when on Tuesday at 23 thousand 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.319
 spain 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.769
 eight hundred kilometers on days not 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.079
 two satellites collided in Russian 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.869
 chips troops of such orbital 

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.989
 disasters will not remember the group of the century 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.489
 threshold field in the sure category 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.339
 rector rubles 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.820
 On Tuesday, a political scientist notes to the office 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 this is a spacecraft which 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.050
 definitely something the region will believe 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.570
 her students 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510
 cat breeding enterprise 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.720
 22 recalculated and two satellites 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.040
 American weighing 500 kilograms 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250
 Russian ton feeds each other on 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.700
 high speed at an angle of 90 degrees 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.900
 collided sharply and formed the cosmos 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.350
 giant cloud sued hundreds of wreckage 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 astronauts say chances to see over 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.120
 alien land and who will start above with 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.380
 that this is quite a lot of space and 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.440
 talk because vaccines 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.980
 just faced citroen 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.859
 the likelihood of a very small effect 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.919
 quite a lot of space incident 

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.559
 complicated by the fact that one of 

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.409
 participants of this space accident 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.189
 speaking the language of earthlings 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.649
 lost control of the road domestic 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.689
 space apparatus 22.1 was still 95 meters out of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.779
 the composition of the Russian orbital 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:45.789
 groupings and these lands and not 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.340
 controlled image file such 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.450
 unmanaged spacecraft threat 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.549
 crossing the orbit of american 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.109
 satellite specialists to usa 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:54.979
 would give labor but shame too 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.409
 the danger seemed incredible 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.030
 of a similar collision 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.310
 when half a century ago the queen team 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.240
 started in the early days of the forest of travelers with 1 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.729
 few thought that they would soon be 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.840
 tens of hundreds and then the question is what with 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.349
 they were usually promised to just do 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.300
 sweep away everything quietly falls and 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.709
 flare up the layers of the atmosphere but that is 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.000
 and the thing is taken out of control 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.940
 spacecraft fall for years if not 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.930
 the interlocutor and what seemed to be 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.769
 beautiful epithet space junk 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.469
 today is reality and threat 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.369
 these are computer models and that kind of 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.050
 fantasy artists 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.310
 here so today looks 5 sleep that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.840
 he cosmic clavus that dangles 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.600
 limits under two thousand kilometers from 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.790
 land and recent years any start 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.030
 any spacecraft live people 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.290
 on board it is also the most complicated calculations 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.100
 scientists how to slip past dangerous junk 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.290
 tracking system 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.590
 space objects in orbit 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.719
 If she 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.040
 effectively enough 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.719
 functioning but to say what it gives 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.019
 one hundred percent guarantee 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.969
 collision warning between 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.749
 space objects yet to 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:02:59.929
 regret not 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.429
 among the potential victims of the accident 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:03.039
 some experts called 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:04.890
 international space station 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.600
 but in Russia he immediately hurried to reassure 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.950
 preparation if different flight and 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.199
 new hire in november as they say 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.189
 I will give such an example of kilometers from the station 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.859
 ms are on payouts preferred 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.679
 because there are no kilometers 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.119
 most likely payment to go soon 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.839
 time 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:26.659
 for tank capacious it will not be until 2009 the most 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.569
 the biggest and most dubious contribution to 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.719
 matter of space pollution belonged 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.450
 China 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.849
 two years ago as part of the space 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.400
 rocket tests from cameras destroyed 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.269
 companion of the business after such 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.950
 targeted explosion amount 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.800
 debris in space immediately increased 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.920
 20 percent yesterday's course 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.769
 happen because of the fault in the cosmos of america and 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.830
 Russia is hardly a subgroup chane record 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.209
 the chinese but the old question is how to fly in 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.200
 space they do not litter the space only 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.569
 aggravate how then her own critics of frost
