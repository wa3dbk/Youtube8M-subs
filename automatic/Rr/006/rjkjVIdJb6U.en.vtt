I have no idea from what I was told by
family<00:01:16.109> I've<00:01:16.619> pretty<00:01:17.039> much<00:01:17.130> been<00:01:17.399> drawing

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
family I've pretty much been drawing

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.880 
family I've pretty much been drawing
since<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.179> learned<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.539> hold<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.899> pen<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.500> was

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
since I learned how to hold a pen I was

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.980 
since I learned how to hold a pen I was
drawing<00:01:20.070> before<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.460> could<00:01:20.670> speak<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.719> walls

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
drawing before I could speak the walls

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.889 
drawing before I could speak the walls
suffered<00:01:22.710> books<00:01:23.429> and<00:01:23.789> documents<00:01:24.270> suffered

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
suffered books and documents suffered

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.410 
suffered books and documents suffered
nothing<00:01:25.409> was<00:01:25.829> safe<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.880> guess<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.240> safe<00:01:27.359> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
nothing was safe so I guess it's safe to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.109 
nothing was safe so I guess it's safe to
say<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.780> I've<00:01:28.109> taken<00:01:28.350> my<00:01:28.979> whole<00:01:29.159> life<00:01:29.459> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
say that I've taken my whole life to

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.300 
say that I've taken my whole life to
develop<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.990> skills<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.709> lot<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> practice
