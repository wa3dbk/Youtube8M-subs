through a button or a bead whatever you
want<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> put<00:01:49.710> at<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.950> end<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.790> close<00:01:52.220> for<00:01:53.220> your

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
want to put at the end to close for your

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.760 
want to put at the end to close for your
closure<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.180> button<00:01:54.450> here<00:01:54.960> make<00:01:55.560> sure

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
closure like this button here make sure

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
closure like this button here make sure
that<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> loop<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.909> large<00:01:57.240> enough<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that the loop is large enough for that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.789 
that the loop is large enough for that
so<00:01:58.340> I<00:02:00.290> am<00:02:01.290> NOT<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:07.020> no<00:02:07.320> idea<00:02:07.649> if

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
so I am NOT like this I have no idea if

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.290 
so I am NOT like this I have no idea if
you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.220> me<00:02:08.340> tying<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.700> knot<00:02:08.759> it's

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you can see me tying this knot it's

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.570 
you can see me tying this knot it's
really<00:02:09.660> awkward<00:02:09.860> because<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.430> now

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
really awkward because I'm just now

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.550 
really awkward because I'm just now
starting<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:12.180> shoot<00:02:12.300> videos<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.050> hopefully

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
starting to shoot videos so hopefully

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.010 
starting to shoot videos so hopefully
you<00:02:14.190> can<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:15.000> or<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.629> how<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.810> tie<00:02:15.989> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you can see or you know how to tie a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.820 
you can see or you know how to tie a
simple<00:02:16.470> knot<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:18.260> think<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.470> figure<00:02:19.680> it

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
simple knot I think you can figure it

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.170 
simple knot I think you can figure it
out<00:02:21.110> like<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.680> then<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.910> go<00:02:24.030> ahead

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
out like that and then you can go ahead

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.240 
out like that and then you can go ahead
and<00:02:24.330> clip<00:02:24.569> off<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.080> couple<00:02:25.680> inches<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.980> tail

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
and clip off that couple inches of tail

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.979 
and clip off that couple inches of tail

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.559 

just<00:02:32.910> clip<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.180> close<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.970> knot<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.510> just

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
easier for me and I started out by just

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.530 
easier for me and I started out by just
braiding<00:03:03.480> about<00:03:03.870> an<00:03:04.050> inch<00:03:04.519> and<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:06.330> actually

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.470 
attached a toggle clasp to it you can do
it<00:03:11.099> that<00:03:11.340> way<00:03:11.459> or<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.700> can<00:03:11.819> just<00:03:11.879> do<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.269> loop

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.760 
you've got your beads in place and
you've<00:04:56.150> kept<00:04:56.390> a<00:04:56.630> good<00:04:56.870> tension<00:04:57.110> on<00:04:57.380> there<00:04:57.560> it's

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
you've kept a good tension on there it's

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.980 
you've kept a good tension on there it's
pretty<00:04:58.040> awkward<00:04:58.510> even<00:04:59.510> though<00:04:59.600> it's<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.810> simple

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
pretty awkward even though it's a simple

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.020 
pretty awkward even though it's a simple
braid<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:01.100> depends<00:05:01.550> on<00:05:01.610> what<00:05:01.790> kind<00:05:01.970> of

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
braid it's it depends on what kind of

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.810 
braid it's it depends on what kind of
string<00:05:02.390> you're<00:05:02.540> working<00:05:02.870> with<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:04.490> beads

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
string you're working with and the beads

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.270 
string you're working with and the beads
it's<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.930> stiffness<00:05:06.410> of<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.680> string<00:05:06.980> it

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
it's the stiffness of the string it

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.830 
it's the stiffness of the string it
takes<00:05:07.670> a<00:05:07.790> little<00:05:07.940> bit<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.300> get<00:05:08.420> used<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.720> the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
takes a little bit to get used to the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.690 
takes a little bit to get used to the
tension<00:05:09.080> that<00:05:09.680> you<00:05:09.800> need<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.040> keep<00:05:10.220> on<00:05:10.370> it<00:05:10.550> and

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
tension that you need to keep on it and

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.370 
tension that you need to keep on it and
it's<00:05:10.820> different<00:05:11.360> for<00:05:11.570> each<00:05:11.600> project<00:05:12.230> if<00:05:12.350> you

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
it's different for each project if you

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.830 
it's different for each project if you
change<00:05:12.710> your<00:05:12.860> materials<00:05:13.340> so<00:05:13.610> just<00:05:13.910> play<00:05:14.690> with

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
change your materials so just play with

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.910 
change your materials so just play with
it<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.290> have<00:05:15.350> fun<00:05:16.630> here<00:05:17.630> I'm<00:05:18.230> gonna<00:05:18.410> stop

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
it and have fun here I'm gonna stop

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.730 
it and have fun here I'm gonna stop
braiding<00:05:19.730> and<00:05:20.800> go<00:05:21.800> ahead<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.190> add<00:05:22.340> my<00:05:23.740> second

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
braiding and go ahead and add my second

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:33.019 
braiding and go ahead and add my second
part<00:05:24.920> of<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.160> closure

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.850 

and<00:05:34.029> I'll<00:05:34.180> just<00:05:34.419> slide<00:05:35.020> this<00:05:35.259> on<00:05:35.469> here<00:05:35.830> and

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
and I'll just slide this on here and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.670 
and I'll just slide this on here and
knot<00:05:36.430> it<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.879> I'll<00:05:37.479> have<00:05:37.509> a<00:05:37.960> very<00:05:38.379> pretty

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
knot it and I'll have a very pretty

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.179 
knot it and I'll have a very pretty
