to the same theme of keeping things
simple<00:00:54.909> here<00:00:55.629> i'm<00:00:56.290> just<00:00:56.500> using<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:56.920> box<00:00:57.189> and<00:00:57.839> you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
simple here i'm just using a box and you

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.910 
simple here i'm just using a box and you
know<00:00:58.960> i<00:00:59.309> can't<00:01:00.510> stress<00:01:01.510> enough<00:01:01.780> just<00:01:02.379> that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
know i can't stress enough just that

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.719 
know i can't stress enough just that
people<00:01:03.400> just<00:01:03.610> start<00:01:04.089> with<00:01:04.299> simple<00:01:04.510> shapes

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
people just start with simple shapes

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.950 
people just start with simple shapes
absolutely<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:07.240> what<00:01:07.360> you're<00:01:07.509> doing<00:01:07.750> here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
absolutely and what you're doing here

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.969 
absolutely and what you're doing here
with<00:01:08.170> starting<00:01:08.500> out<00:01:08.590> with<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.740> simple

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
with starting out with a simple

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.330 
with starting out with a simple
primitive<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.790> simple<00:01:10.180> default'<00:01:10.780> box<00:01:11.320> or<00:01:12.040> cube

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
primitive a simple default' box or cube

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.149 
primitive a simple default' box or cube
in<00:01:12.640> Maya<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.240> think<00:01:14.049> that's<00:01:14.229> just<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.830> know<00:01:14.920> it

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
in Maya I think that's just you know it

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.310 
in Maya I think that's just you know it
just<00:01:15.700> makes<00:01:15.909> sense<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.479> work<00:01:16.689> with<00:01:16.960> blocking

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
just makes sense to work with blocking

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.760 
just makes sense to work with blocking
in<00:01:17.650> forms<00:01:18.189> on<00:01:18.460> something<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:18.939> a<00:01:19.000> hand

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
in forms on something like a hand

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.410 
in forms on something like a hand
working<00:01:20.770> with<00:01:20.920> things<00:01:21.189> like<00:01:21.310> extrusions<00:01:22.150> and

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
working with things like extrusions and

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.940 
working with things like extrusions and
then<00:01:22.540> shaping<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.140> like<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.470> are<00:01:23.619> with<00:01:23.770> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
then shaping it like you are with the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.770 
then shaping it like you are with the
verts<00:01:24.189> there<00:01:24.520> I<00:01:24.729> mean<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> way<00:01:25.509> to<00:01:25.570> do

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
verts there I mean this is the way to do

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.600 
verts there I mean this is the way to do
it<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.530> know<00:01:26.619> just<00:01:26.650> start<00:01:27.040> breaking<00:01:27.490> out

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
it but you know just start breaking out

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.090 
it but you know just start breaking out
and<00:01:27.670> blocking<00:01:28.300> in<00:01:28.450> those<00:01:29.350> forms<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:29.980> those

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
and blocking in those forms and those

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.860 
and blocking in those forms and those
structures<00:01:30.310> adding<00:01:31.120> your<00:01:31.270> edge<00:01:31.390> loops<00:01:31.659> where

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
structures adding your edge loops where

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.520 
structures adding your edge loops where
you<00:01:31.990> need<00:01:32.140> them<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:34.300> certainly<00:01:35.020> does<00:01:35.320> make

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
you need them and it certainly does make

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.100 
you need them and it certainly does make
sense<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:36.150> start<00:01:37.150> out<00:01:37.330> with<00:01:37.450> something<00:01:37.690> simple

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
sense to start out with something simple

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.570 
sense to start out with something simple
like<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.260> basic<00:01:38.530> primitive<00:01:39.040> like<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.190> cube

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
like a basic primitive like a cube

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.219 
like a basic primitive like a cube
definitely<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.270> get<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.630> where<00:01:40.810> you're<00:01:40.930> going

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
definitely to get to where you're going

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.350 
definitely to get to where you're going
here<00:01:41.409> that's<00:01:41.860> what<00:01:42.070> point<00:01:42.280> 0<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.400> here<00:01:42.610> you're

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
here that's what point 0 is here you're

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.300 
here that's what point 0 is here you're
using<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.780> number<00:01:44.080> 3<00:01:44.440> hockey<00:01:44.860> there<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.130> Maya

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
using the number 3 hockey there in Maya

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.149 
using the number 3 hockey there in Maya
to<00:01:45.610> do<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> UH<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:47.290> know<00:01:47.350> as<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.560> smooth<00:01:47.950> match

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
to do a UH you know as a smooth match

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
your mesh is going to look like when

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
it's subdivided that's something

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.830 
it's subdivided that's something
important<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.610> do<00:01:54.760> I<00:01:55.120> mean<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.690> certainly

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840

low res sometimes if you have

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.190 
low res sometimes if you have
overlapping<00:02:27.280> vertices<00:02:27.640> or<00:02:27.939> unwell<00:02:28.780> did<00:02:28.959> verts

to<00:02:54.850> split<00:02:55.360> tools<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:56.440> have<00:02:56.470> kind<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.010> an

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to split tools you have kind of an

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.370 
to split tools you have kind of an
automatic<00:02:57.730> split<00:02:58.030> tool<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.570> then<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.110> have

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
automatic split tool and then you have

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.140 
automatic split tool and then you have
the<00:02:59.620> split<00:02:59.950> tool<00:03:00.130> that's<00:03:00.340> been<00:03:00.400> around<00:03:00.580> for<00:03:01.120> a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
the split tool that's been around for a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.990 
the split tool that's been around for a
long<00:03:01.510> long<00:03:01.570> time<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.830> will<00:03:02.980> not<00:03:03.100> find<00:03:03.460> that<00:03:03.640> in

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
long long time you will not find that in

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.440 
long long time you will not find that in
under<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.140> edit<00:03:05.530> mesh<00:03:05.740> actually<00:03:06.670> it's<00:03:06.910> under

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
under the edit mesh actually it's under

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.750 
under the edit mesh actually it's under
the<00:03:08.140> original<00:03:08.620> split<00:03:08.890> tool<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.310> actually

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
the original split tool is actually

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.180 
the original split tool is actually
under<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.240> hotkeys<00:03:11.170> if<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.380> hold<00:03:11.560> shift<00:03:11.890> in

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
under the hotkeys if you hold shift in

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.100 
under the hotkeys if you hold shift in
right<00:03:12.370> mouse<00:03:12.580> button<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.090> that's<00:03:13.750> the<00:03:13.960> one

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
right mouse button and that's the one

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.310 
right mouse button and that's the one
that<00:03:14.980> I've<00:03:15.250> used<00:03:15.610> for<00:03:15.970> many<00:03:16.240> many<00:03:16.690> many<00:03:16.990> years

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
that I've used for many many many years

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.500 
that I've used for many many many years
and<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.890> works<00:03:18.160> really<00:03:18.370> well<00:03:18.520> not<00:03:19.150> to<00:03:19.330> say<00:03:19.480> that

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
and it works really well not to say that

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.980 
and it works really well not to say that
the<00:03:19.750> automatic<00:03:20.230> one<00:03:20.260> doesn't<00:03:20.830> but<00:03:21.900> using<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
the automatic one doesn't but using a

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.290 
the automatic one doesn't but using a
combination<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.770> both<00:03:23.980> will<00:03:24.310> really<00:03:24.670> help<00:03:25.000> you

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
combination of both will really help you

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.560 
combination of both will really help you
now<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.920> was<00:03:26.950> doing<00:03:27.430> this<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:27.790> constantly

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
now as I was doing this I'm constantly

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.690 
now as I was doing this I'm constantly
going<00:03:28.870> back<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.320> looking<00:03:29.530> at<00:03:29.920> my<00:03:30.160> own<00:03:30.310> hand

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
going back and looking at my own hand

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.240 
going back and looking at my own hand
right<00:03:31.210> and<00:03:31.480> right<00:03:32.170> here<00:03:32.200> we're<00:03:32.620> focused<00:03:33.040> start

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
right and right here we're focused start

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.010 
right and right here we're focused start
and<00:03:33.370> focus<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> thumb<00:03:34.150> look<00:03:34.750> at<00:03:34.840> your

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
and focus on the thumb look at your

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.190 
and focus on the thumb look at your
thumb<00:03:35.260> remember<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.610> thumb<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.210> not<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.780> finger

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
thumb remember the thumb is not a finger

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.000 
thumb remember the thumb is not a finger
and<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.730> actually<00:03:40.030> has<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.360> little<00:03:40.720> rotation

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
and it actually has a little rotation

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.110 
and it actually has a little rotation
kind<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.160> depending<00:03:42.700> on<00:03:42.790> how<00:03:42.910> you're<00:03:43.030> holding

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
kind of depending on how you're holding

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.180 
kind of depending on how you're holding
but<00:03:43.510> kind<00:03:43.900> of<00:03:44.020> towards<00:03:44.380> back<00:03:44.740> towards<00:03:45.070> your

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
but kind of towards back towards your

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.360 
but kind of towards back towards your
body<00:03:45.430> look<00:03:46.030> how<00:03:46.180> those<00:03:46.390> are<00:03:46.570> rotated<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.370> you

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
body look how those are rotated and you

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.420 
body look how those are rotated and you
know<00:03:48.490> i<00:03:48.790> was<00:03:49.240> talking<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.660> craig<00:03:50.250> before<00:03:51.250> we

even started recording this you know
again<00:03:54.220> it's<00:03:54.280> practicing<00:03:55.180> there's<00:03:55.660> really<00:03:55.960> no

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410

art to doing a hand I've done a lot of

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.040 
art to doing a hand I've done a lot of
research<00:04:00.640> looking<00:04:00.670> at<00:04:01.210> different<00:04:01.660> methods

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
research looking at different methods

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.260 
research looking at different methods

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
or an edge or a verte near you're not

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.850 
or an edge or a verte near you're not
you<00:05:16.690> don't<00:05:16.720> have<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.080> switch<00:05:17.350> back<00:05:17.590> and<00:05:17.620> forth

between<00:05:18.250> those<00:05:18.490> component<00:05:19.000> loads<00:05:19.230> better

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
between those component loads better

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:04.930 
we're starting to open up the back of

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.870 
we're starting to open up the back of
the<00:06:04.990> wrist<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.530> we're<00:06:06.370> just<00:06:06.580> about<00:06:06.730> done

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
the wrist and we're just about done

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.440 
the wrist and we're just about done
modeling<00:06:07.480> our<00:06:07.870> hand<00:06:08.170> and<00:06:09.270> essentially<00:06:10.270> what

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
modeling our hand and essentially what

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.500 
modeling our hand and essentially what
we<00:06:10.540> can<00:06:10.720> do<00:06:10.870> at<00:06:11.020> this<00:06:11.170> point<00:06:11.290> is<00:06:12.000> take<00:06:13.000> our<00:06:13.210> hand

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
we can do at this point is take our hand

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.020 
we can do at this point is take our hand
in<00:06:13.720> and<00:06:13.960> just<00:06:14.530> like<00:06:14.770> all<00:06:15.010> of<00:06:15.400> the<00:06:15.520> other<00:06:15.640> tools

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
in and just like all of the other tools

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.480 
in and just like all of the other tools
we've<00:06:16.330> done<00:06:16.570> attached<00:06:17.470> it<00:06:17.710> into<00:06:17.950> our<00:06:17.980> model

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
we've done attached it into our model

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.840 
we've done attached it into our model
and<00:06:18.670> merge<00:06:19.510> the<00:06:19.750> vertices<00:06:20.050> so<00:06:20.440> a<00:06:20.650> lot<00:06:21.220> of<00:06:21.250> it<00:06:21.610> is

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
and merge the vertices so a lot of it is

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.720 
and merge the vertices so a lot of it is
rinse<00:06:22.240> wash<00:06:22.510> repeat<00:06:22.720> right<00:06:23.290> great<00:06:23.730> yeah

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
rinse wash repeat right great yeah

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.390 
rinse wash repeat right great yeah
exactly<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:26.620> what<00:06:26.770> you're<00:06:26.890> doing<00:06:27.130> there<00:06:27.250> by

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
exactly and what you're doing there by

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.060 
exactly and what you're doing there by
duplicating<00:06:27.670> what<00:06:28.180> you've<00:06:28.360> done<00:06:28.630> I<00:06:29.010> mean<00:06:30.010> this

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
duplicating what you've done I mean this

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.710 
duplicating what you've done I mean this
is<00:06:30.190> why<00:06:30.370> we<00:06:30.520> have<00:06:30.640> 3d<00:06:31.000> tools<00:06:31.150> so<00:06:31.450> we<00:06:31.480> have

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 
is why we have 3d tools so we have

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.810 
is why we have 3d tools so we have
software<00:06:32.140> right<00:06:32.410> is<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:33.340> ability<00:06:33.550> to

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
software right is the ability to

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.700 
software right is the ability to
duplicate<00:06:34.390> and<00:06:34.630> replicate<00:06:35.410> what<00:06:35.590> you've

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
duplicate and replicate what you've

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.140 
duplicate and replicate what you've
already<00:06:35.860> done<00:06:36.130> why<00:06:36.370> reinvent<00:06:36.700> the<00:06:36.940> wheel

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
already done why reinvent the wheel

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.210 
already done why reinvent the wheel
repeatedly<00:06:37.750> for<00:06:37.960> those<00:06:38.080> fingers<00:06:38.470> absolutely

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
repeatedly for those fingers absolutely

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.310 
repeatedly for those fingers absolutely

that<00:06:41.710> you've<00:06:41.800> done<00:06:41.950> there<00:06:42.160> and<00:06:42.310> repeating<00:06:42.790> it

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
that you've done there and repeating it
