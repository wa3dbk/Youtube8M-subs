00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
which is a lot of bacteria and we know

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
which is a lot of bacteria and we know
from<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> previous<00:00:43.559> trainings<00:00:44.219> we've<00:00:44.370> done

the trick to making compost tea is

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.950 
the trick to making compost tea is
you've<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> figure<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> way<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.720> get

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
you've got to figure out a way to get

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920 
you've got to figure out a way to get
this<00:01:07.220> steeping<00:01:08.220> down<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.760> water<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.689> water

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this steeping down your water the water

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
this steeping down your water the water
needs<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.530> good<00:01:10.560> access<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.430> oxygen<00:01:11.610> sure

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
needs to have good access to oxygen sure

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.899 
needs to have good access to oxygen sure
hopefully<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.380> aerate<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.880> least

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
hopefully you can aerate it or at least

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
hopefully you can aerate it or at least
stir<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> once<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> while<00:01:16.200> yeah<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.650> are

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
stir it once in a while yeah what are

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.380 
stir it once in a while yeah what are
this<00:01:17.070> would<00:01:17.310> they'd<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.939> stir<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this would they'd have to do is stir it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140 
this would they'd have to do is stir it
yeah<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.259> simple<00:01:19.530> way<00:01:19.799> yeah<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
yeah not in a simple way yeah and you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
yeah not in a simple way yeah and you
got<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> keep<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> oxygen<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
got to keep that oxygen to the to the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.760 
got to keep that oxygen to the to the
yes<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.720> activity<00:01:25.229> that's<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.619> there

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
yes all the activity that's in there

yes all the activity that's in there
they<00:01:25.950> need<00:01:26.159> oxygen<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.729> survive

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they need oxygen to survive

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
they need oxygen to survive

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
absolutely okay and in order to get more

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
absolutely okay and in order to get more
bacteria<00:01:30.960> growing<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.350> might<00:01:31.500> want<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> add

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
bacteria growing you might want to add

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.030 
bacteria growing you might want to add
something<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.390> unsalted<00:01:33.390> molasses<00:01:34.200> organic

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
something like unsalted molasses organic

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.830 
something like unsalted molasses organic
molasses<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.610> that'll<00:01:35.820> grow<00:01:36.150> more<00:01:36.329> bacteria

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
molasses and that'll grow more bacteria

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
molasses and that'll grow more bacteria
so<00:01:37.409> when<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.619> use<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.159> plants<00:01:38.490> that's
