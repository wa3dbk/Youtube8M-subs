00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello guys son of indole son here in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.580
 company with nick that there is a box like 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.510
 see the 3ds xl the special edition of 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.040
 animal crossing 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.470
 so i'll leave you the word nic 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.980
 nothing i'll wait for this guy 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 since 2005 for five years 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.890
 let us therefore proceed to unboxing this 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.840
 produced by maximum the door is also there 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.880
 in the back we see how pretty it is here 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.180
 very nice because so white with all 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.550
 are all doodles and very stylish if 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.070
 it seems that it always seems to have seemed 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 it seemed to eat almost does not make me come 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.590
 hunger will be that there is nine in the morning 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:56.989
 I ate nothing but ok now 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.989
 we must affect the critical points 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.719
 now it should be the first unboxing 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 and nicola therefore yesterday I usually do a 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.830
 slaughter that you have no idea when 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.580
 things are also quite neat there 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.229
 I know how they are but there is a time there 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 let's see then here there is type a code 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:26.729
 pin cards of rea cards look like 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.560
 let's see what's here from the bales 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.090
 and we come to the crucial second point 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.270
 the bulk of the side style 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 you are right you see that many are discovered 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.149
 things working with gamestar.it la 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.579
 found 2 is slow as pretty a 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.100
 brush is really your own 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.100
 shiny and beautiful 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:07.040
 we are at the side door as you see 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:12.040
 we are in the shop so this 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.040
 ps we are cutting there is 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.440
 I would say that as we see we see how 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.110
 pretty important thing like le 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.420
 features of 3ds yes no 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.920
 let's look at a tree the feature 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.230
 however the game is the game already has 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.420
 pre-installed inside these sd from 4 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.680
 gigabytes if I show you that you don't 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.800
 is seen 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.900
 it's called fire, in fact there is no game 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.200
 in physical copy but it is pre-installed 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.200
 in this 4 gigabyte sd 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.890
 convenient re put inside jackie 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.010
 nicola so we play him mori 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.740
 now I play it so much that i 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.840
 here keys help us in mere inter 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.520
 they will become made to find to light it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:10.040
 throat is not usually load a bit and yes 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:15.680
 magi and see if he does something if he greets 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.140
 with animal crossing or not with ravalle 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.959
