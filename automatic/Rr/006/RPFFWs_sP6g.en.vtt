00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.010
 nice that they have recovered 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.750
 Here we are in 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.060
 a small series on the subject of dry 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.950
 cut the dry cut had yes like 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.660
 already briefly mentioned in the first part 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.340
 very bad call one very indicated one 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.420
 knows this big old double sanding 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.010
 blocks at a high speed 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.160
 with a coarse graining the downright 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.809
 roughly translated from a phase 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.540
 of a chisel can tear out 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.550
 they heat up the whole thing very much 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.920
 the whole thing can turn blue and 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.989
 so that they are all good for snow 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.399
 have lost 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.300
 characterized they are at the right pieces in 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.610
 disrepute 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.200
 in our small mini series we want 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.730
 but show that it is there 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.530
 meanwhile what has done in the direction 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.690
 dry ground and that by means of 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.550
 these two devices in the first part 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.219
 we had this little double beat 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.129
 Here in the use of the 2 changes to 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.550
 classic device of this type 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.380
 brings and the following for a very 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.479
 fine sanding material here in the 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.430
 sanding discs and the second one 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.830
 marked reduced speed 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.299
 which ensures that mine 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.549
 do not cut there so fast 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.689
 become blue 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.100
 Now we come to a second device 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:26.799
 this also applies to dry grinding 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.380
 it also prevents you from cutting 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.780
 gets blue and then especially 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.830
 it gives me reproducible angles 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.299
 always allows very little 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.560
 it has to be abraded 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.610
 here at the device workshop from the usa 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.780
 and as I said it is a dry one 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.850
 cut device quite similar to the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.600
 double punch but the geometry is one 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.009
 completely different 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.140
 we do not have a role here 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:52.299
 to do with a slice but the 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.110
 Rotate screw this out here 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:58.630
 a glass pane is inserted 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.720
 is glued on both sides with the kÃ¶rnung 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 the election as your 120 helper once 400 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.820
 but relatively enemies and once relatively 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.890
 roughly such a glass pane looks in the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.799
 original so shatterproof 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.900
 glass the one and this disc one puts 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.140
 here one 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.370
 if I slice now inserts this 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.430
 do that again with this one 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.130
 Glass pane may feel a little better then 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.620
 The tool has come to grind 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.200
 would like to from below and serve 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
 this pad here 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.890
 This pad has a side 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.740
 limit that is adjustable and that 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.330
 you push yourself that far so far that 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.640
 you just push the tool forward 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.900
 I can and here I have one 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.720
 twisted security and that is very 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.220
 good because then it is a very rigid 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.640
 embedded cutting so to speak and is 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 this cut then hits down here 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.530
 below the disc on the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:57.120
 grinding wheel this bracket is in 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.610
 adjustable to four different angles 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.290
 30 degrees I have chosen here before and 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.989
 can adjust it very pointedly then 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.930
 it can be a bit less sharp 20 degrees 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.940
 adjust from 25 degrees and at can 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.310
 go down to 35 degrees 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.250
 I know that because I know it 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.690
 already have ground with it are 30 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.570
 grad here a small window on 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.320
 which I can see and then 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.090
 is sanded 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.370
 I will now enter my phase here 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.250
 little mark so we equal the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.380
 see abrasion 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.180
 the beautiful is just that is here 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.160
 everything stays very faithful and that 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.019
 I now have a very fast abrasion 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.260
 can expect because I just exactly the 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.549
 surface and the geometry loop the eh 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.190
 already exists 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.450
 that would have to be done relatively quickly now 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.450
 already it is time to 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.290
 And how do you see the color is gone? 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.550
 if I have some behind now 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.750
 I would have to have cut 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.070
 certainly sleep much longer 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.320
 maybe even with the coarser one 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.850
 can 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.180
 I would be here now 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.910
 Of course, keep going 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.260
 the 120s had come just now 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.380
 next finer I'm doing in here now 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.079
 the big jump to 400 is now straight 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.420
 on the screen and then you would 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.950
 just turn it back on and now with 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.210
 the finer drivers can do a little 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.890
 refurbish 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.770
 what he cut the hats known 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.500
 but it clearly increases what you get here now 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.550
 can still see or what you at least 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.740
 it can also feel that there is one here 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.330
 very easy grad emerged for it 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.060
 or against this should be small 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.790
 sandpaper serve here 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.190
 When retiring so says the manufacturer 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.200
 the iron loses its little one 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.460
 it is immediately ready for action 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.480
 works also in a certain frame 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.140
 All right, I have it several times 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.330
 tried out 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.520
 but if you really friend of 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.630
 polished mirror sides is then 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.960
 this sandpaper a bit 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.700
 roughly the standard then 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.410
 you make it easy to call again 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.080
 in the mirror side area and that wants 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.290
 Of course you do not have it 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.640
 otherwise this is a very interesting one 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.290
 example of dry sanding 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.600
 nowadays quite socially acceptable again 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.910
 The device itself can become one 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.950
 still grow or you can also share 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.070
 grow to the conclusion of wide circles 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.080
 of knives and carving iron 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.070
 Etc 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.970
 I do not want that here now 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.560
 thematise 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.540
 I just wanted this variant for a short time 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.850
 show that you also chisel with it 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.640
 and medium wide planing iron very 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.800
 fast again sharp gets so much to 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.630
 dry touch in much success in 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.100
 the workshop and see you next time 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.100
