00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.430
 they must spend a lot of money the effort Saturday 1 and 2 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.690
 the lic in this case we're going to see an application that works both in the 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.890
 expo as there is no bread since it is a universal application means that 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:14.460
 your purchase of this application 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.749
 and it will work 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.979
 between the two platforms respective congresses optimized versions 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.720
 he has a cost of 2 dollars and they can get it that the supply is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.319
 application is called poster 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.069
 intrinsically what allows us to access 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.039
 it's like his name says it says it 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.290
 make poles and other types of graphic applications 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.890
 which we can percent 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.040
 print or we can also share in our social networks such as 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.120
 twitter 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.870
 I explained to facebook st 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 eva counter 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.040
 to see the analysis of this application let's go into it 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.739
 When we started apartheid, we had or did not have great options 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 the first one tells us' breed and a half 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.580
 with which we can create a new home kid 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.369
 oo the other option is that to levy 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.560
 2-4 of the assets that we already have previously 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500
 read from the state 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.730
 the whole bottom part has a small option to access the help 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.259
 and the next 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.620
 is to access or configure our social networks 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.450
 We are inside the crime section 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.870
 By the way, once he's there, he shows us a series of templates that are more 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.870
 of 40 percent which we can customize 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.710
 he economized these images who are we going to choose a profile planet says Frankfurt 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.490
 if once and for all within it adoptions 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.219
 the fenerbahce images from the work chamber of the photo some 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:45.689
 let's choose for example 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.780
 passion of soccer 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.780
 a feeling with the photo that I have in avoiding more robberies 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 this case 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.630
 direct the photograph then with 15 health 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.530
 efe we ​​can locate the felabán to choose 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.890
 we choose agreement 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 in the bottom part we have a series of actions the first one allows us to change 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.049
 the photographs and it was not what we expected 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.429
 the second one also asked 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.429
 the contrast and saturation of our image 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.649
 we have the option of the text 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.359
 where can I change the text obviously 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.509
 and also how to change the size of this one 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.459
 yes we choose station 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.680
 we can do is change the color of the teacher mexico 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.079
 example 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.289
 obviously 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.979
 Institute 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:40.979
 entered again 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.189
 back 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.839
 internally to the option 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.839
 and he was also the acquaintance among others 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:52.149
 we have options 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:56.020
 percent here we can choose a series of papers and filters 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.299
 if we can choose 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.709
 as we can see here there are some crumpled papers 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.929
 he also knows the private sector 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.599
 percent and how 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.229
 the impression that one was 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.189
 old 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.319
 fox and study leave state anzoátegui 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.609
 also if we go down some experts it contains 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.829
 It is different color 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.299
 I could choose 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.749
 in microsoft they are not 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.540
 they always realize that the feeling and the part 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.029
 it seems too 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.399
 and that is the effect 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.159
 who achieve our 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.739
 in this case like this 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.300
 n then we play well 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.189
 Juan Varela 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.849
 if we apply 6 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.169
 we will save it 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.419
 and in our soul 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:42.409
 In our world 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.029
 camargo a control and photographic 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.879
 tonight's appointment 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.010
 we have the option to share it 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.270
 either across the border and suffer from cochabamba 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.109
 courage we already did this 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.529
 we just go back to the game 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:00.379
 I'm going to start 6 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.999
 i then 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.809
 return to the young 

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:08.159
 go back to the conference and I challenge the gallery 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:09.699
 I can see 

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:11.369
 the different 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:16.029
 I lived sr for example in this case I have already made comments 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.849
 the application 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.139
 for example today we have 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:27.070
 itself a fairly easy to use composite 0 40 application 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.150
 I did not take more than a second to prepare the project 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.900
 maybe percent 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.659
 One of its main disadvantages is that we can not vary 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:38.529
 the position of the text 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:39.430
 when 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.789
 percent and zamora template for example if the text highlights we have 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.110
 placed on top will make us behind closed doors 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.419
 good we have to choose carefully with the template who will serve us 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.379
 another of your clients 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.570
 the advantages 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.570
 skip it in the absence of this antilles 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.580
 that does come through the different updates have added 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.090
 in the template for example 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.280
 of the company without it was close to flee they alleged the staff the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.740
 related to this one 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.449
 that moment 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.430
 as for his christ the advantages ease of use 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.719
 and thanks to the non-update allows percent 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.110
 for now the higher resolution images 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.650
 now it is already possible and print them in a post-it campaign which was quite 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.559
 strange in the previous versions 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.240
 that the size of Mars was very small because we could not save it. 

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.339
 we can print with that size 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.349
 but definitely one of the best finite applications 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.740
 in both for the iphone as for ipad 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.759
 to reed perform this kind of 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.759
 of instructions on what kind of graphic applications 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.930
 it's pretty simple 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.770
 it's a pretty tight price 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.300
 that is why those who initially turn down this behavior totally approved by 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.270
 agapito 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.380
 I hope you showed them in the sections 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.770
 the next chapter 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.190
 in the days of visiting our website triple double points avn but 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.969
 uribe 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:09.149
 thank you very much arias
