00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
we had to build up that geometry for the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.150 
we had to build up that geometry for the
shadows<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> occlusion<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.039> the

shadows in the occlusion and the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.590 
shadows in the occlusion and the
reflections<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> freedom

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
reflections you know I think the freedom

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.719 
reflections you know I think the freedom
that<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> had<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:22.619> very<00:01:22.649> beginning<00:01:23.310> be

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
that you had at the very beginning be

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
that you had at the very beginning be
able<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> sort<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.330> architect<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> optic

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
able to sort of architect the optic

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.560 
able to sort of architect the optic
tract<00:01:25.740> system<00:01:26.190> within<00:01:26.550> our<00:01:26.729> building<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.360> well

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
tract system within our building as well

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.060 
tract system within our building as well
tying<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.649> animation

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
tying it in with the animation

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.310 
tying it in with the animation
Department<00:01:29.160> the<00:01:29.640> freedom<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> think

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
Department the freedom they had I think

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.630 
Department the freedom they had I think
played<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.679> to<00:01:31.979> our<00:01:32.070> advantage

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
played it to our advantage

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.830 
played it to our advantage
I<00:01:32.670> mean<00:01:32.789> like<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.000> transformation<00:01:33.270> shot<00:01:33.690> was

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I mean like the transformation shot was

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.219 
I mean like the transformation shot was
one<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.289> biggest<00:01:34.979> shots<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> film<00:01:36.229> for

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
one of the biggest shots in the film for

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.930 
one of the biggest shots in the film for

supervisor<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.950> sort<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> talk

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
supervisor in there to sort of talk

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.609 
supervisor in there to sort of talk
through<00:01:59.790> try<00:02:00.540> things<00:02:00.780> some<00:02:01.079> things<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
through try things some things out in

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.660 
through try things some things out in
real<00:02:01.770> time<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.100> figure<00:02:02.280> out<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.490> was<00:02:02.520> going

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
real time to figure out if it was going

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.639 
real time to figure out if it was going
to<00:02:02.729> work<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> didn't<00:02:03.840> work<00:02:03.960> try<00:02:04.200> something

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
to work if it didn't work try something

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.109 
to work if it didn't work try something
else<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.670> were<00:02:05.759> able<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
else out I think we were able to do a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
else out I think we were able to do a
lot<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> rapid<00:02:06.899> prototyping<00:02:07.590> with<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> motion

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
lot of rapid prototyping with the motion

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.850 
lot of rapid prototyping with the motion
capture<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.940> figure<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.929> before<00:02:10.290> we<00:02:10.560> sat

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
capture to figure that out before we sat

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.979 
capture to figure that out before we sat
down<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.549> made<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.299> scene<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.810> several

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
down and made it a scene for several

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.720 
down and made it a scene for several
days<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.680> then<00:02:13.769> decide<00:02:14.070> whether<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.519> worked

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
days and then decide whether it worked

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.460 
days and then decide whether it worked
or<00:02:14.850> not<00:02:15.000> what<00:02:15.180> kind<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.480> got<00:02:15.600> to<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.930> point<00:02:16.110> a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
or not what kind of got to that point a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.199 
or not what kind of got to that point a
lot<00:02:16.620> sooner<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.370> then<00:02:17.610> from<00:02:17.820> there<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.120> was

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
lot sooner and then from there it was

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.520 
lot sooner and then from there it was
kind<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.540> really<00:02:18.690> good<00:02:18.930> starting<00:02:19.230> point<00:02:19.470> for

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
kind of a really good starting point for

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.360 
kind of a really good starting point for
our<00:02:19.650> animators<00:02:20.280> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
our animators to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.369 
our animators to
work<00:02:21.550> on<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.849> shot<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.300> sort<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.140> more

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
work on the shot is sort of a more

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.470 
work on the shot is sort of a more
advanced<00:02:23.739> starting<00:02:24.730> point<00:02:24.940> or<00:02:25.030> reference

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
advanced starting point or reference

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.270 
advanced starting point or reference
from<00:02:25.900> an<00:02:26.080> animation<00:02:26.379> standpoint<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.069> find

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
from an animation standpoint I find

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.100 
from an animation standpoint I find
myself<00:02:27.430> extremely<00:02:28.060> blessed<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.599> have<00:02:29.080> a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
system that was easy to set up and once

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.670 
system that was easy to set up and once
it<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.430> set<00:02:39.790> up<00:02:39.819> it<00:02:40.150> would<00:02:40.360> see<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.780> use<00:02:41.260> just

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
it was set up it would see to use just

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.289 
it was set up it would see to use just
on<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.069> fly<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.280> have<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> animator<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.239> you
