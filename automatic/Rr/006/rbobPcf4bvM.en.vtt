 Perhaps you know these exercises: you handed the exam, you told you need to fill 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.690
 Of bubbles completely, and then mentioned it - for reasons no one ever explains 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.629
 - You can only use pencil number 2! 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.470
 Now, unless you're an artist, maybe you've never even looked at a pencil that's not a number 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.320
 2, also known as HB pencil outside the United States 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.570
 The thing is, if you use any other type of pencil when I took the record automatically - 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.230
 Test, you probably will be fine. 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 But there are reasons that the test instructions will still tell you to stick to No. 2. And they 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.739
 It has a lot to do with how your devices are rated tests - or at least, how they were. 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.670
 In 1931, a professor of physics at the Reynolds High School was appointed as the examination scores when 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.210
 I wondered if there might be a way to register without actually having to go through 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.379
 Each answer is by hand. 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.780
 He knew that graphite, writing materials in pencils, was electrically conductive. It 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.039
 Made of flat sheets of carbon, its outer electrons are relatively free to move 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.030
 Within the material. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.420
 So Johnson developed a device with several small electric circuits that pass through 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.359
 Answer sheet. If there is a pencil mark on the paper, it will plug the power through 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.030
 One of the circuit, the machine can record it as an answer. 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.860
 In the end, IBM sold the idea, which produced the first mark sensors. 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.760
 But the number 2 thing did not become a case until the next generation of machines 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.270
 It was introduced in the 1960s and 70s. 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.160
 And those light sensor machines are called phototubes, if they do not detect light 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.800
 In a certain spot, they record it as an answer. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.140
 That graphite make particularly useful, because it is best to withhold light from many 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.860
 Inks. Graphite reflects most of the light - this is why the pencil marks are so shiny - it absorbs 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.090
 Rest, which is why it is black. 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.640
 But for a long time, these optical sensor sign machines were very picky. and whereas 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.050
 Different degrees of pencil came in. 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.200
 Graphite is held in clay pencils together, so manufacturers can control how soft 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.330
 Or it is hard, also how dark it is. The softness of the graphite, the darker the pencil 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.720
 Mark. The pencils are labeled accordingly. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.430
 In the United States, those labels are numbers. International manufacturers use different 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.750
 System, with corresponding HB number 2. 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.340
 The number of 2 pencils make signs that are just dark enough to be touched by the machine, however 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.470
 Also light enough to be erased without leaving a mark for reading. 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.100
 These days, the recording machines are using much more advanced sensors that can detect almost any 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.790
 The type of represents you perform, as long as they are in bubbles. 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.370
 So you could potentially take your next exam with any kind of pencil you wanted. But you have 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.060
 The company incurred is probably not the time to test that hypothesis. Maybe bring a few 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.200
 2 just to be safe.
