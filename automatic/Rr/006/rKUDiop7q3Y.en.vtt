00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
battle rather than something where

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.030

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
type of stuff and you kind of have to

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.180 
type of stuff and you kind of have to
use<00:04:38.050> your<00:04:38.230> environment<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.980> your<00:04:39.010> advantage
