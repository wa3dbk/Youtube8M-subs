00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.710
 ahrensburg alexa welcome to one 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.839
 more live comments in call of the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.809
 ghost today a whole new team 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.840
 deathmatch but on the map stonehaven 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.320
 and that can be pretty stupid 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.779
 stonehaven his ebwo is somehow 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.779
 Huge big fucks pons and has 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.180
 no movement and today was yes 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.699
 also proposed among others and the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.349
 class is now displayed then see 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.230
 her what perks her have with her and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.980
 so on and so forth then suspend 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.930
 and if you want you can 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.489
 course, of course, like to build provided 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 you do not like the gameplay here 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.940
 depending on how that works now i have 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.040
 be careful because here 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.590
 actually come some 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.820
 probably cleared away 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.520
 Let's go inside the house 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.520
 a house not yet 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.489
 2 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:06.950
 it was such a short wait until the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 comes out otherwise probably times prior to 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:17.540
 windows must be pink pink 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.540
 where is he where is there 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:28.190
 Here's the sniper left us out 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 possible if I'm a bit scared 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.130
 but also hope that the team 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.640
 with that little something that does not matter 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.640
 the last time 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 and for that the saints holding sa that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.600
 the thumbs in suggestion on a thumb 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.759
 I've got around now 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.270
 happy, the right maps are not enough 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.270
 would like to record 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.409
 as an example sun stonehaven I would 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 Never gamble with the change you 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:07.479
 Incidentally, this is the way care is 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.760
 a ruin of the pont probably now 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.360
 their teams of transports mostly 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.410
 I can speak to the house too 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.200
 you commit actually the spot 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.180
 watching the spots are so bad 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 here 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:28.330
 I can not go one-on-one 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.850
 oh my god why am i there at all 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.660
 yet certain intervals of response 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.380
 So arch are really stonehaven one 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.299
 the worst maps in call of duty 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.160
 In this part here can write 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.959
 what the worst map in your opinion 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.280
 is the gate help me quit 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.590
 usually thought easy now 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.590
 times for the video I'm at times 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.359
 the rain I have the problem 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.940
 The view is pretty strong 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.940
 restricted here by the visor 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.650
 who's inside there 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.050
 Rear over the farm, at least 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.950
 But I have to come first with the bags 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:31.330
 lie down off your house 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:33.040
 No lie, I then 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:43.290
 actually happened to get marca 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:43.290
 right now we're going toburg here 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.200
 of course, no dropouts as 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.040
 specialist works last 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.190
 in between, it still master marksman with 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.190
 in it 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.050
 comcom has that's a sniper of course 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.050
 watch out 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:25.389
 Mr. Sniper come here fast 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.389
 through the open area via a sitcom 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.260
 I do not know where many we see on 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.370
 the card is the problem i have to 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.370
 try to keep someone moving 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:43.690
 Teammate is still taken away 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.690
 not so bad as to be behind the house 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.330
 there comes one more 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.340
 they really are really several 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.690
 People have to go to me 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:02.710
 otherwise here they like to have zero 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:02.710
 chance we should try to make 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.970
 I was already in the house I was already 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.220
 a house so i will feel that 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:21.169
 Dodging here is partly right 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:22.520
 senseless we usually look for 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.560
 you would not go for the opponent 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.560
 at this time is running really 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:42.500
 So we go back to the magical 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:46.750
 house but over the parking lot at 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.750
 simple opponent of the saying helps that 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:06:03.010
 his brain was a fast satcom that was 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.010
 damn close 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:12.910
 marathon behind us here to let that go 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.260
 I want to say 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:20.510
 but I got it, I got it 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:28.639
 but at least I do not have it this time 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:31.699
 incompetent team feeling even calculated 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:36.169
 now that the enemy has so many satcom too 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:39.110
 I've got dropouts so far behind 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:42.280
 says mahler wants to come first but 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.280
 somehow no human being used anymore 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.580
 Already alone in the field was there 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.889
 but one of us would just have him 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:54.190
 can turn off thinking comes comes 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.190
 out 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:13.430
 okay in real happiness we currently only at 

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:15.729
 my god will die like many have there 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.729
 out 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:30.659
 No, I'm going to do that before the last movie 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:33.989
 25.9 yes, the song is clear at the beginning 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:37.039
 better then we are somehow 

00:07:33.989 --> 00:07:40.409
 been too offensive and for the game 

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:42.899
 and yes I told you pleased with the 

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:45.119
 live commented went ratzfatz you have to 

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:47.909
 it was really fast to lift stone for it 

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:51.449
 normally here is normal real time 

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:53.909
 Limit goes around before this ends here 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:55.259
 and he will say that was it now 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:56.399
 the video i hope i liked when said 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:57.989
 yes , but that gives a thumb after 

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.389
 up and flails for the next 

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:02.129
 the next few live interviews in it 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:04.939
 I'm getting out of every video bit 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:09.169
 you want to do what savarin choose here 

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:09.169
 and is off
