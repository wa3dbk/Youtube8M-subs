rims can be a challenge not only are
there<00:00:07.319> tight<00:00:07.529> spaces<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.189> clean<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.639> also

there tight spaces to clean you also
have<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.120> remove<00:00:09.330> brake<00:00:09.719> dusts<00:00:10.230> without

have to remove brake dusts without
scratching<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.000> finish<00:00:12.620> now<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.830> process

scratching the finish now in the process

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.410 
scratching the finish now in the process
of<00:00:14.309> researching<00:00:14.549> all<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.059> found<00:00:15.269> that

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
of researching all this have found that

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.779 
of researching all this have found that
brake<00:00:15.990> dust<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.350> actually<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.010> combination<00:00:17.369> of

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
brake dust is actually a combination of

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.420 
brake dust is actually a combination of
carbon<00:00:18.180> fibers<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:18.840> adhesive<00:00:19.350> from<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
carbon fibers and adhesive from the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.870 
carbon fibers and adhesive from the
brake<00:00:20.609> pads<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.769> metal<00:00:22.769> shavings<00:00:23.070> from<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
brake pads and metal shavings from the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.920 
brake pads and metal shavings from the
rotors<00:00:24.300> which<00:00:25.050> makes<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.470> extremely<00:00:25.710> abrasive

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
rotors which makes it extremely abrasive

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.390 
rotors which makes it extremely abrasive
and<00:00:27.930> when<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.140> mixture<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.619> heated<00:00:28.859> by<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and when the mixture is heated by the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.220 
and when the mixture is heated by the
friction<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.970> pads<00:00:30.240> pressing<00:00:30.929> against

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
friction of the pads pressing against

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.040 
friction of the pads pressing against
the<00:00:31.289> rotors<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.800> also<00:00:32.189> becomes<00:00:32.610> corrosive<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the rotors it also becomes corrosive so

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.690 
the rotors it also becomes corrosive so
you<00:00:34.140> should<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.530> clean<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:35.040> rims<00:00:35.250> often

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270 
protected the finish and it released the
brake<00:02:03.299> dust<00:02:03.509> completely<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.799> never<00:02:04.979> became

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
brake dust completely so it never became

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.809 
brake dust completely so it never became
abrasive<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.439> natural<00:02:07.619> sea<00:02:08.009> sponge<00:02:08.280> isn't

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
abrasive so the natural sea sponge isn't

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
abrasive so the natural sea sponge isn't
just<00:02:09.209> great<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.599> washing<00:02:09.780> your<00:02:10.020> paint<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.530> can

a<00:02:31.260> bit<00:02:31.440> rough<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.159> stiff<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:33.450> once<00:02:33.690> wet<00:02:33.989> it

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
a bit rough and stiff but once wet it

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.640

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
spaces I normally struggle with which

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.349 
spaces I normally struggle with which
really<00:02:56.670> saves<00:02:56.970> me<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> lot<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.329> time<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.840> effort

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
really saves me a lot of time and effort

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.920 
really saves me a lot of time and effort
and<00:03:00.359> it<00:03:01.109> does<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> great<00:03:01.620> job<00:03:02.420> removing<00:03:03.420> all<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
and it does a great job removing all the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:38.280 
and it does a great job removing all the
brake<00:03:04.170> dust

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.860 

now<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.439> you<00:03:39.590> can<00:03:39.769> see<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:41.060> sponge<00:03:41.359> pulled<00:03:41.689> all

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
now as you can see the sponge pulled all

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.780 
now as you can see the sponge pulled all
the<00:03:42.139> dirt<00:03:42.409> and<00:03:42.620> grit<00:03:42.859> deep<00:03:43.249> down<00:03:43.489> into<00:03:43.700> the

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
the dirt and grit deep down into the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.970 
the dirt and grit deep down into the
pores<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.269> away<00:03:44.599> from<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:44.930> surface<00:03:45.379> which

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
pores and away from the surface which

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.459 
pores and away from the surface which
protects<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.670> finish<00:03:46.909> on<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.209> rims<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.659> to

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:48.469 
protects the finish on the rims and to

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.089 
protects the finish on the rims and to
rinse<00:03:48.650> it<00:03:48.799> out<00:03:50.139> just<00:03:51.139> squeeze<00:03:51.499> it<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.709> few<00:03:51.920> times

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
rinse it out just squeeze it a few times

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.970 
rinse it out just squeeze it a few times
in<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.459> rinse<00:03:52.639> water<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:57.109> releases<00:03:57.500> all

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
in the rinse water and it releases all

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.089 
in the rinse water and it releases all
of<00:03:58.639> that<00:03:58.790> abrasive<00:03:59.150> brake<00:03:59.629> dust<00:03:59.959> so<00:04:00.950> it's

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
of that abrasive brake dust so it's

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.770 
of that abrasive brake dust so it's
ready<00:04:01.280> for<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.489> next<00:04:01.549> rim<00:04:02.169> as<00:04:04.359> you<00:04:05.359> can<00:04:05.510> see

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
ready for the next rim as you can see

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.129 
ready for the next rim as you can see
the<00:04:06.469> natural<00:04:06.650> sea<00:04:07.010> sponge<00:04:07.340> does<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.609> great<00:04:07.969> job

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139

yellow here refers to the type of sponge

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.550 
yellow here refers to the type of sponge
not<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.009> color<00:04:19.239> now<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.509> prefer<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.169> sea<00:04:21.380> wool

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
I used to use to clean my rims which

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.680 
I used to use to clean my rims which
saves<00:04:38.960> me<00:04:39.080> money<00:04:39.610> but<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.669> can<00:04:40.880> use<00:04:41.060> my<00:04:41.240> regular
