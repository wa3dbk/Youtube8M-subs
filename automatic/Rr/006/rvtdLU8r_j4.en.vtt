00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.049
 school children in africa 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 clean water and teaches them playfully 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.179
 this project could be completed to live a healthy life 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 stairs gave ex-internationals of 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.730
 Ghana and the Netherlands in Amsterdam Southeast 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.039
 a clinic after that she played just like the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.080
 World Cup selections coming Saturday and 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.789
 mutual match who love it 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920
 how it explains why he otherwise the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.510
 door is from the project 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.420
 well you because it is something you just do 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.270
 an uncas die and africa we like that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.790
 is already struggling with enough diseases 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.610
 that are deadly and yes this is for us 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 actually a very normal thing 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.840
 and that you have clean water but that is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.190
 in in africa fuse the case there 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 sitting ordinary water is not too clean 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.559
 and you can't tap me either 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.989
 drink most of the romea stock you go to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 lives seems ear normally but if you 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.570
 once a europe where driven that see 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.100
 you hear that very well 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.930
 painters in the water and also in it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 ordinary life will therefore not always 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 nice 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.460
 she is going to cook and eat with it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:13.240
 and I think now the time has passed 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.299
 that people start to live less well and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.799
 get good clean water you have 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.229
 not in it or in a game 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.880
 beating from van Nederland netherlands 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.610
 plays and goes against the Netherlands 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.770
 going to have a chance you think I think yes 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.350

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.909

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.100
 previously fed by 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.409
 also in the cockpit and have lost four 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.020

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.789
 wk is the most important thing go go to chance 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.979

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.610
