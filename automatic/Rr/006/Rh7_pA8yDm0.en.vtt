it's<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:49.970> one<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.420> as<00:00:50.629> she<00:00:50.780> tells<00:00:50.989> you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
it's this one and as she tells you

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.150 
it's this one and as she tells you
because<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.340> blue<00:00:52.489> arrow<00:00:56.590> so<00:00:57.590> for<00:00:57.830> me<00:00:57.980> it's

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
because of the blue arrow so for me it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.710 
because of the blue arrow so for me it's
the<00:00:58.250> right<00:00:58.520> thumbstick<00:00:58.820> button<00:00:59.480> which<00:00:59.690> is

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
the right thumbstick button which is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.440 
the right thumbstick button which is
fire<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.470> guns<00:01:00.860> I'm<00:01:01.190> sure<00:01:01.430> for<00:01:01.460> you<00:01:01.850> tell<00:01:02.270> you

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
fire the guns I'm sure for you tell you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.780 
fire the guns I'm sure for you tell you
as<00:01:02.570> well<00:01:02.720> so<00:01:03.250> shouldn't<00:01:04.250> be<00:01:04.339> too<00:01:04.490> hard<00:01:04.520> to

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
as well so shouldn't be too hard to

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.930 
as well so shouldn't be too hard to
figure<00:01:04.910> out<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:07.190> normally<00:01:07.520> only<00:01:07.610> fire

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
figure out you can normally only fire

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.020 
figure out you can normally only fire
the<00:01:08.180> gun<00:01:08.390> bus<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.800> like<00:01:09.860> 1<00:01:10.160> DP<00:01:10.369> 45<00:01:10.790> and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
the gun bus so it's like 1 DP 45 and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.499 
the gun bus so it's like 1 DP 45 and
that<00:01:11.119> will<00:01:11.270> stop<00:01:12.880> or<00:01:13.880> maybe<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:14.300> eight

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
that will stop or maybe it's eight

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.410 
that will stop or maybe it's eight
bursts<00:01:15.050> of<00:01:15.140> 8<00:01:15.290> i'm<00:01:15.530> not<00:01:15.649> sure<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:17.210> take

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
bursts of 8 i'm not sure that you take

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.150 
bursts of 8 i'm not sure that you take
as<00:01:17.570> much<00:01:17.780> time<00:01:17.840> as<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:18.259> want<00:01:18.350> it's<00:01:18.740> no<00:01:18.950> there's

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
as much time as you want it's no there's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.690
