00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.430
 It's good people, let's go back now 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.839
 the quick line of how to export your car 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.310
 for the air test 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.399
 which is used by aebec 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.399
 for the show only future the other pilots 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.019
 here we are on the photoshop screen 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:18.230
 foot 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.880
 you may be able to use any major issues that support monitoring 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.179
 how live award itself took photo front 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:28.050
 because it really is 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.210
 photoshop itself 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.689
 it will not be a class 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.530
 how to paint 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.620
 Let's talk only about exporting to watch 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.240
 because I have a standard painting file 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.200
 in the north the offspring 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.260
 the accident 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.540
 accident vallat 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.890
 open and always wanted to have three post cycles on the teaching site itself were 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.230
 they that in the links also that we put 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.390
 at the beginning of each season 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.290
 we then post with the sea 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.200
 imagine in the Singapore case 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000
 dunga and we speak 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.420
 you will see an image very similar to this when opening this file 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.250
 regional prison 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.130
 walks here next door in which none of this does not deny photoshop layers 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 loop you will see some layers and already predefined 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.360
 this first layer to the 30 basic elements we have for example positions of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.880
 some cage sponsor items automatically appear in an election 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.420
 to 1 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.440
 but as you say are mere 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.579
 P 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.640
 Marcelinho also from the vehicle 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.800
 just by activating and deactivating you can see 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.469
 some functions of these layers 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.069
 has a very interesting face for painting that this shrimp will face 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.399
 your service when the active people it already appears then those lines that 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.670
 show just how the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.840
 the motions of difference you see for example and this 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.409
 line here she along with this one so stay a help to you know 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.409
 where the dry parts the case you want to make a drawing a little more 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.620
 complex with lines that passes from one piece to another 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.730
 but let's go 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.520
 disable this place here so we can not solve or mark the hemicycle 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.810
 live porto-benfica painting and some paintings of the world will see if they leave 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.440
 this layer of roles here already pre-defined patterns have some patterns 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 you can even use as an initial part for painting by choosing and editing 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.600
 things 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.190
 since we will not stick to raul instructions on how to use the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.429
 photoshop to be able to make your paintings 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.969
 let's see takes into consideration that your car is using this painting to 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.959
 company that painting your car 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.329
 already the bread 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.989
 I know that you are able to vote everything prepared if you have to be more 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.180
 here today participation - and was expelled 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.420
 is telling you to activate it before exporting who it is that means 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.480
 accurate recess in this image just needs it here to be able to put paint 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.870
 because all other parts that are not displayed when you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.579
 bedside deactivation 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.450
 they are already automatically entered into the simulator then 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.460
 these images as a lighthouse 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.610
 some details of the details car of d with the brasiliense 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.840
 that the car already has automatically 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.889
 so we just disable this layer 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.209
 and you only had this file now to watch 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.369
 to add 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:23.499
 just mickey on faial 

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:24.689
 severe 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.839
 You will see on the screen much like this one. 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:30.379
 where you will now select the format 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.090
 you will violate the page here and you will find the forms to which the mayor 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.949
 watch 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.869
 selecting total shape and you will place 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.749
 to a file name if you want a 'share' locally for you to see how 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.989
 piscicultura got in your car just put you using the code of the 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.699
 is the code you can see it doing the same 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.039
 continuous 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.689
 and puts that little serial code in the paints folder 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.559
 but how are you working on it here to put nourishes of intention of 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:04.339
 put only team piturca example points deflect 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.619
 exporting when saving 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:12.269
 it will ask you here about after the bit pattern and with pressure 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.650
 just select and 24 bits per pizza and if you injure option buy 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.939
 sspds 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:21.469
 is one with a soul with pressure that it will put in the air that will make a 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.930
 and much lighter than usual. 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.930
 I would run out of your show with pressure 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.550
 then 24-bit airlines 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.990
 only that 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.620
 your article now then be 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.380
 in the same phase who saved the painting example can deviate and this same 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.300
 file that you are going to use so I tried to put on the brakes inmates or 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.490
 put on your map only from your election and can see your painting from 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.710
 The way you would like to see
