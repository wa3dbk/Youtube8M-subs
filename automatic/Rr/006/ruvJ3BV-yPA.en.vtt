00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.020 
the shiver trilogy and you're on the
fence<00:02:35.379> about<00:02:35.620> reading<00:02:36.069> this<00:02:36.219> I<00:02:36.430> would<00:02:36.819> say<00:02:36.969> you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
fence about reading this I would say you

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.250 
fence about reading this I would say you
should<00:02:37.269> read<00:02:37.419> it<00:02:37.540> because<00:02:37.689> since<00:02:38.019> you've

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
should read it because since you've

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.720 
should read it because since you've
already<00:02:38.349> read<00:02:38.620> three<00:02:38.859> other<00:02:39.069> books<00:02:39.250> why<00:02:39.549> not

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
already read three other books why not

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.699 
already read three other books why not
read<00:02:39.909> the<00:02:40.000> last<00:02:40.180> book<00:02:40.359> and<00:02:40.780> if<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.409> haven't

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
read the last book and if you haven't

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.800 
read the last book and if you haven't
read<00:02:41.950> any<00:02:42.129> of<00:02:42.159> the<00:02:42.249> sugar<00:02:42.459> trilogy<00:02:42.969> it's<00:02:43.599> not

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
read any of the sugar trilogy it's not

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.759 
read any of the sugar trilogy it's not
really<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.079> necessity

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
really a necessity

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.379 
really a necessity
I<00:02:44.829> think<00:02:45.159> it<00:02:45.250> probably<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.549> a<00:02:45.669> necessity<00:02:46.030> or

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
I think it probably is a necessity or

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.879 
I think it probably is a necessity or
the<00:02:46.569> Sherwood<00:02:46.870> trilogy<00:02:47.230> before<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.709> read

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
the Sherwood trilogy before you read

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.589 
the Sherwood trilogy before you read
this<00:02:48.040> one<00:02:48.250> but<00:02:48.519> that's<00:02:48.700> just<00:02:49.000> me<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.209> think

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
this one but that's just me I think

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.689 
this one but that's just me I think
maybe<00:02:50.319> you<00:02:50.560> know<00:02:50.680> if<00:02:50.889> you<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.040> plan<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.430> read

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:51.699 
maybe you know if you just plan to read

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.490 
maybe you know if you just plan to read
this<00:02:51.849> one<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:52.389> any<00:02:52.689> of<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.049> short<00:02:53.349> rows

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
this one and not any of the short rows

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.539 
this one and not any of the short rows
you<00:02:53.620> could<00:02:53.709> probably<00:02:53.829> get<00:02:54.040> away<00:02:54.099> with<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.430> no

I'm<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:30.759> trilogy<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.150> know<00:03:31.329> I<00:03:31.359> could<00:03:31.720> have

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
I'm the trilogy you know I could have

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.569 
I'm the trilogy you know I could have
been<00:03:32.019> but<00:03:32.319> it's<00:03:32.470> been<00:03:32.650> such<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.069> long<00:03:33.549> time

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
been but it's been such a long time

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.969 
been but it's been such a long time
since<00:03:34.120> I've<00:03:34.299> read<00:03:34.479> the<00:03:34.659> books<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.169> it's<00:03:35.709> been

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979 
since I've read the books like it's been

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.740 
since I've read the books like it's been
probably<00:03:36.430> over<00:03:36.759> five<00:03:36.970> years<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:37.689> don't

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
probably over five years and I don't

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.509 
probably over five years and I don't
think<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.199> did<00:03:38.379> like<00:03:38.560> her<00:03:38.709> Isabelle<00:03:39.280> on<00:03:39.400> this

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
think I did like her Isabelle on this

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.539 
think I did like her Isabelle on this
book<00:03:39.759> was<00:03:40.319> mean<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.349> think<00:03:41.709> that<00:03:41.889> Isabelle<00:03:42.400> in

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
book was mean I think that Isabelle in

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.099 
book was mean I think that Isabelle in
general<00:03:42.879> she's<00:03:43.060> kind<00:03:43.329> of<00:03:43.419> mean<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.629> I<00:03:43.900> get

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
general she's kind of mean and I get

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.050 
general she's kind of mean and I get
that<00:03:44.349> but<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.769> still<00:03:45.040> felt<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.519> should<00:03:45.970> have

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
that but I still felt like I should have

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.339 
that but I still felt like I should have
we<00:03:46.389> should<00:03:46.540> have<00:03:46.659> seen<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> little<00:03:47.109> bit<00:03:47.290> more

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
we should have seen a little bit more

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.830 
we should have seen a little bit more
growth<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.919> her<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.250> know<00:03:48.669> a<00:03:49.180> lot<00:03:49.659> has<00:03:49.780> happened

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
growth of her I know a lot has happened

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.599 
growth of her I know a lot has happened
to<00:03:50.259> her<00:03:50.439> and<00:03:50.650> she's<00:03:50.949> going<00:03:51.129> through<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> lot<00:03:51.549> of

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
to her and she's going through a lot of

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.689 
to her and she's going through a lot of
stuff<00:03:51.909> but<00:03:52.239> she's<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.199> I<00:03:53.560> don't<00:03:54.340> know<00:03:54.549> I<00:03:54.579> just

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
thing I do like about Isabelle is that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.319 
thing I do like about Isabelle is that
yes<00:03:59.290> she<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.620> mean<00:03:59.979> but<00:04:00.310> she<00:04:00.489> owns<00:04:00.759> up<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.209> that

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
yes she is mean but she owns up to that

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.030 
yes she is mean but she owns up to that
she<00:04:01.629> knows<00:04:01.870> she's<00:04:02.109> mean<00:04:02.290> she<00:04:02.530> knows<00:04:02.680> she<00:04:02.889> can

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
she knows she's mean she knows she can

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.890 
she knows she's mean she knows she can
be<00:04:03.189> a<00:04:03.219> real<00:04:03.479> something<00:04:04.479> something's

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
be a real something something's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.140 
be a real something something's
sometimes<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.590> she<00:04:05.799> is<00:04:06.099> fully<00:04:06.459> aware<00:04:06.849> of<00:04:06.909> that

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
sometimes and she is fully aware of that

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.439 
sometimes and she is fully aware of that
and<00:04:07.359> I<00:04:07.449> like<00:04:07.719> that<00:04:07.989> because<00:04:08.169> some<00:04:08.530> people<00:04:08.859> are

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
and I like that because some people are

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.179 
and I like that because some people are
not<00:04:10.449> like<00:04:10.689> you<00:04:11.590> know<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:11.739> mean<00:04:11.919> like<00:04:12.039> some

not like you know I mean like some
people<00:04:12.430> really<00:04:12.519> need<00:04:12.789> and<00:04:13.060> they<00:04:13.599> don't<00:04:13.840> know

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
people really need and they don't know

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:14.999 
people really need and they don't know
they're<00:04:14.169> really<00:04:14.409> mean<00:04:14.560> they<00:04:14.829> don't

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:15.009 
they're really mean they don't

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.129 
they're really mean they don't
acknowledge<00:04:15.189> it<00:04:15.579> but<00:04:15.729> Isabelle<00:04:16.180> does<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:17.049> the

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139

of a little bit softer and stuff but I

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.590 
of a little bit softer and stuff but I

around<00:04:32.450> her<00:04:32.600> that<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.050> think<00:04:33.620> could<00:04:33.800> eventually

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
around her that I think could eventually

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.360 
around her that I think could eventually
fade<00:04:34.670> away<00:04:34.940> if<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.570> know<00:04:35.690> she<00:04:36.530> was<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.950> work<00:04:37.160> on
