all<00:00:01.290> right<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:01.709> believe<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.280> reached<00:00:02.520> the

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
all right I believe we reached the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.490 
all right I believe we reached the
points<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.689> where<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:03.990> can<00:00:04.110> check<00:00:04.290> our

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
points to where we can check our

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.900 
points to where we can check our
progress<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:06.529> past<00:00:07.529> tutorials<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.610> made

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
progress and past tutorials we have made

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.950 
progress and past tutorials we have made
an<00:00:09.179> eye<00:00:09.599> tracker<00:00:10.610> that<00:00:11.610> was<00:00:11.849> successful<00:00:12.719> and

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
an eye tracker that was successful and

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.289 
an eye tracker that was successful and
if<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> scale<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:14.940> cause<00:00:15.120> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
if you scale it you can cause the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.349 
if you scale it you can cause the
character<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:15.900> cross-eyed<00:00:17.240> we<00:00:18.240> have

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
character to go cross-eyed we have

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.290 
character to go cross-eyed we have
created<00:00:18.810> eyelid<00:00:19.289> controls<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.160> grab<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
created eyelid controls we grab it you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.090 
created eyelid controls we grab it you
can<00:00:21.330> change<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> attitude<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> eyelid

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
can change the attitude of the eyelid

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.640 
can change the attitude of the eyelid
and<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.910> scale<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.930> close<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and if we scale it we can close the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
and if we scale it we can close the
eyelid<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.119> scale<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.900> ask

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
eyelid and if we scale it out we can ask

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:39.799 
eyelid and if we scale it out we can ask
who<00:00:29.599> what<00:00:31.040> what<00:00:32.719> what<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.870> say<00:00:34.079> son<00:00:38.809> type

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
who what what what you say son type

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.130 
who what what what you say son type
thing<00:00:41.540> now<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:43.050> last<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:44.030> little<00:00:45.030> s<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
thing now we last left off little s the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.340 
thing now we last left off little s the
last<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.920> left<00:00:47.160> off<00:00:47.600> we<00:00:48.600> had<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.899> completed

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
last we left off we had just completed

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.430 
last we left off we had just completed
the<00:00:49.559> eyelids<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:51.360> believe<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.930> said<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the eyelids and I believe I said that I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.479 
the eyelids and I believe I said that I
wanted<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:54.030> eyelids<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.660> track<00:00:55.250> some<00:00:56.250> what's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
wanted the eyelids to track some what's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.429 
wanted the eyelids to track some what's
with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.300> eyelid<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> eyeballs<00:01:01.730> so

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:03.439 
with the eyelid with the eyeballs so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:06.080 
with the eyelid with the eyeballs so
what<00:01:04.439> we're<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.400> add<00:01:05.790> another

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
what we're going to do is add another

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.539 
what we're going to do is add another
bone<00:01:07.729> in<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:09.180> neat<00:01:09.390> part<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:13.549> we

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
bone in a neat part of this is that we

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
bone in a neat part of this is that we
don't<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.210> add<00:01:15.420> any<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.229> constraints

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
don't have to add any more constraints

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.630 
don't have to add any more constraints
to<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.549> two<00:01:18.330> new<00:01:18.509> bones<00:01:18.810> we're<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.380> add

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
to the two new bones we're going to add

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
to the two new bones we're going to add
and<00:01:20.640> I'll<00:01:21.509> show<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.810> why<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.890> gonna

and I'll show you why so I'm just gonna
grab<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.640> eye<00:01:23.670> bone<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:25.049> bone<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.439> here

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
grab the eye bone this bone right here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
grab the eye bone this bone right here
go<00:01:27.330> into<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> bone<00:01:27.780> edit<00:01:28.049> mode<00:01:28.369> make<00:01:29.369> sure

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
go into the bone edit mode make sure

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
go into the bone edit mode make sure
that<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.360> cursor<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.960> snapped<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.680> root

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that your cursor is snapped to the root

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.510 
that your cursor is snapped to the root
of<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.579> bone<00:01:35.090> shift<00:01:36.090> D<00:01:38.240> period<00:01:39.240> scale<00:01:40.200> out

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
of this bone shift D period scale out

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:51.930 
of this bone shift D period scale out
and<00:01:42.860> that's<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.390 

and<00:01:52.030> that's<00:01:52.780> what<00:01:53.050> we<00:01:53.260> should<00:01:53.290> get<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.990> see

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
and that's what we should get you see

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.710 
and that's what we should get you see
since<00:01:57.400> these<00:01:57.550> bones<00:01:57.850> duplicated<00:01:58.570> their

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
since these bones duplicated their

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.680 
since these bones duplicated their
constraints<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.740> actually<00:02:00.730> what<00:02:01.390> we

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
constraints this is actually what we

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.750 
constraints this is actually what we
want<00:02:02.370> except<00:02:03.370> for<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:05.040> second<00:02:06.040> one<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.520> green

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
want except for the second one the green

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.900 
want except for the second one the green
bone<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:08.110> going<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.530> get<00:02:08.680> rid<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.310> locked

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
bone I'm going to get rid of the locked

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.120 
bone I'm going to get rid of the locked
track<00:02:10.330> constraints<00:02:11.080> which<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.410> duplicated

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
track constraints which it duplicated

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.330 
track constraints which it duplicated
from<00:02:12.540> its<00:02:13.540> duplicates<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.680> I'm<00:02:14.950> gonna<00:02:15.100> call

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
from its duplicates and I'm gonna call

bones<00:02:46.420> are<00:02:46.600> tracking<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:48.760> stopped

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
bones are tracking and they stopped

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.620 
bones are tracking and they stopped
rotating<00:02:49.330> because<00:02:50.320> they<00:02:50.560> have<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.940> bone<00:02:52.300> has

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
rotating because they have this bone has

that's<00:03:11.800> new<00:03:12.160> in<00:03:12.280> blender<00:03:12.959> what<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.050> couldn't

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
that's new in blender what you couldn't

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.310 
that's new in blender what you couldn't
do<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.650> previous<00:03:15.330> versions<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:16.870> grab

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
do in previous versions you can grab

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.850 
do in previous versions you can grab
multiple<00:03:18.010> bones<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:19.140> then<00:03:20.140> parent<00:03:20.530> them<00:03:20.709> to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
multiple bones and then parent them to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.240 
multiple bones and then parent them to
the<00:03:20.980> same<00:03:21.220> bone<00:03:21.519> at<00:03:21.850> once<00:03:22.360> control<00:03:23.320> P<00:03:23.709> keep

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
the same bone at once control P keep

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.300 
the same bone at once control P keep
offset

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
offset

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.540

voila<00:03:27.420> now<00:03:28.420> we<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.840> tracking<00:03:29.200> eyelids<00:03:29.800> now

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
voila now we have tracking eyelids now

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.130 
voila now we have tracking eyelids now
we<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:31.500> want<00:03:32.500> them<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.830> track<00:03:33.100> up<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.550> down<00:03:34.140> not

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
we I want them to track up and down not

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.520 
we I want them to track up and down not

lock his location rotation and scale

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.940 
lock his location rotation and scale
since<00:03:55.420> we're<00:03:55.630> never<00:03:55.870> actually<00:03:56.170> going<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.860> be

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
since we're never actually going to be

since we're never actually going to be
using<00:03:57.400> this<00:03:57.550> bone<00:03:57.820> at<00:03:58.150> all<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.890> just<00:04:00.190> a

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
using this bone at all this is just a

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.819 
using this bone at all this is just a
helper<00:04:00.670> bone

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:13.780 

and<00:04:08.829> loops<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:11.319> there<00:04:12.319> we<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:12.769> it<00:04:12.950> we<00:04:13.610> have<00:04:13.760> a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
and loops and there we have it we have a

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
and loops and there we have it we have a
working<00:04:14.120> iRig<00:04:17.979> alright<00:04:19.329> now<00:04:20.329> let's<00:04:20.479> go<00:04:20.630> back

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
working iRig alright now let's go back

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.870 
working iRig alright now let's go back
to<00:04:20.959> my<00:04:21.109> formats<00:04:21.590> jaws<00:04:22.630> jaw<00:04:23.770> eyes<00:04:25.419> eyebrows<00:04:26.500> so

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
to my formats jaws jaw eyes eyebrows so

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.110 
to my formats jaws jaw eyes eyebrows so
eyebrows<00:04:28.880> is<00:04:29.120> next<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:31.520> is<00:04:31.580> where<00:04:31.970> we're

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
eyebrows is next and this is where we're

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.360 
eyebrows is next and this is where we're
actually<00:04:32.240> going<00:04:32.600> to<00:04:32.660> be<00:04:32.930> starting<00:04:33.440> which<00:04:34.190> is

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
actually going to be starting which is

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.770 
actually going to be starting which is
where<00:04:34.520> we're<00:04:34.669> actually<00:04:34.789> gonna<00:04:35.090> start<00:04:35.449> using

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
where we're actually gonna start using

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.590 
where we're actually gonna start using
lattices<00:04:36.740> because<00:04:37.550> along<00:04:37.910> with<00:04:38.060> eyebrows

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
lattices because along with eyebrows

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.219 
lattices because along with eyebrows
comes<00:04:39.199> face<00:04:39.639> we're<00:04:40.639> getting<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.300> face<00:04:42.580> so

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
comes face we're getting to the face so

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.980 
comes face we're getting to the face so
that<00:04:45.229> actually<00:04:45.650> concludes<00:04:45.889> this<00:04:46.430> tutorial

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
that actually concludes this tutorial

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.640 
that actually concludes this tutorial
there's<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.139> working<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.770> rigged<00:04:49.039> I<00:04:50.169> use<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.410> I

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
there's a working I rigged I use it I

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.010 
there's a working I rigged I use it I
love<00:04:52.220> it<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:55.510> now<00:04:56.510> you<00:04:56.570> know<00:04:56.930> it's<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:59.020> one

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
love it and now you know it's and one

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.010 
love it and now you know it's and one
more<00:05:00.199> thing<00:05:00.580> you'll<00:05:01.580> notice<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.210> on<00:05:02.539> the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
more thing you'll notice that on the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.089 
more thing you'll notice that on the
bone<00:05:03.229> edit<00:05:03.560> options<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:06.169> have<00:05:06.440> a<00:05:06.470> total<00:05:06.949> of

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
bone edit options you have a total of

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:15.960 
bone edit options you have a total of
see<00:05:08.030> one<00:05:09.699> six<00:05:10.699> seven<00:05:11.210> eight<00:05:12.490> sixteen<00:05:13.490> layers

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.629 

so<00:05:16.970> there's<00:05:17.720> a<00:05:17.810> lot<00:05:18.050> of<00:05:18.080> these<00:05:18.260> bones<00:05:18.680> that<00:05:19.190> are

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
so there's a lot of these bones that are

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.000 
so there's a lot of these bones that are
in<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.940> way<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.680> we're<00:05:21.680> never<00:05:21.800> actually

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
in the way and we're never actually

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.320 
in the way and we're never actually
going<00:05:22.250> to<00:05:22.340> be<00:05:22.430> using<00:05:22.729> these<00:05:22.820> bones<00:05:23.120> and

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
going to be using these bones and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:31.900 
going to be using these bones and
animations<00:05:24.080> so<00:05:24.440> grab<00:05:25.400> all<00:05:25.610> these<00:05:25.789> bones<00:05:30.910> go

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
animations so grab all these bones go

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.540 
animations so grab all these bones go
into<00:05:32.150> edit<00:05:32.479> mode<00:05:32.510> even<00:05:33.020> grab<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.650> main

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
into edit mode even grab the main

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.050 
into edit mode even grab the main
targets<00:05:35.090> and<00:05:35.300> move<00:05:35.840> them<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.169> layer<00:05:36.320> 16<00:05:37.060> now

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
targets and move them to layer 16 now

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.570 
targets and move them to layer 16 now
look<00:05:38.330> how<00:05:38.479> much<00:05:38.539> clay<00:05:39.020> look<00:05:39.680> how<00:05:40.010> much<00:05:40.250> cleaner

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
look how much clay look how much cleaner

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.339 
look how much clay look how much cleaner
that<00:05:40.880> is<00:05:41.440> you<00:05:42.440> can<00:05:42.620> actually<00:05:42.800> see<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:44.150> eyes

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.400 

thing<00:05:48.349> it's

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
thing it's

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.200

another thing you can do and in this new

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.760 
another thing you can do and in this new
version<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.750> blender<00:05:53.960> which<00:05:54.259> you<00:05:54.380> couldn't<00:05:54.650> do

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
version of blender which you couldn't do

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.930 
version of blender which you couldn't do
in<00:05:54.889> old<00:05:55.039> older<00:05:55.729> versions<00:05:56.120> if<00:05:56.870> you<00:05:57.710> if<00:05:57.979> you<00:05:58.729> move

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
in old older versions if you if you move

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.150 
in old older versions if you if you move
bones<00:05:59.389> to<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.020> different<00:06:00.440> layer<00:06:00.590> in<00:06:00.860> the<00:06:00.919> edit

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
bones to a different layer in the edit

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.760 
bones to a different layer in the edit
mode<00:06:01.190> it'll<00:06:02.180> actually<00:06:02.419> move<00:06:02.840> all<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.590> bones

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
mode it'll actually move all the bones

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.879 
mode it'll actually move all the bones
on<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.069> opposite<00:06:04.520> side<00:06:04.789> to<00:06:04.819> that<00:06:05.270> same<00:06:05.539> layer

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
on the opposite side to that same layer

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.339 
on the opposite side to that same layer
ain't<00:06:06.889> blender<00:06:07.400> cool<00:06:08.020> okay

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:18.850 

we<00:06:12.349> are<00:06:12.470> done<00:06:12.740> with<00:06:12.979> eyes<00:06:16.449> next<00:06:17.449> is<00:06:17.900> eyebrows

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
we are done with eyes next is eyebrows

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.660 
we are done with eyes next is eyebrows
and<00:06:19.419> the<00:06:20.419> face
