00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
into a snuggle pillow so you take a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.160 
into a snuggle pillow so you take a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
mean if it's this if it's if you have a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.460 
mean if it's this if it's if you have a
full<00:00:19.830> tube<00:00:20.449> then<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.779> need<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> pass<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> piece

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
full tube then you need to pass a piece

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.109 
full tube then you need to pass a piece
of<00:00:22.500> fabric<00:00:22.800> left<00:00:23.160> sides<00:00:23.430> of<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.670> normal<00:00:23.850> towel

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
but if you use one drinking you could

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.670 
but if you use one drinking you could
probably<00:00:26.519> just<00:00:26.699> use<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> hand<00:00:27.150> towel<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:28.470> some

pulling down and you will get outside

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.949 
pulling down and you will get outside
this<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.530> pretty<00:02:51.680> bad<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:53.150> then<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.780> get<00:02:53.900> a

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
this is pretty bad but then you get a

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.070 
this is pretty bad but then you get a
little<00:02:54.109> tunnel

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.470

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
just have soft towels but this would be

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.920 
just have soft towels but this would be
pretty<00:03:03.450> nice<00:03:03.630> actually<00:03:04.850> but<00:03:05.850> um<00:03:06.150> for<00:03:06.780> me<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
