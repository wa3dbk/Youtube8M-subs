00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.640
 good morning many car owners dream 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.480
 that their machines were unlike any 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.639
 which others 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.740
 sometimes so addicted to tuning that 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.380
 just can't stay in 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.630
 As a result, ordinary cars turn into 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.269
 Africa Mobile Here, for example, see 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:26.740
 cars with a jet engine on the body 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:30.310
 Well, in general, Elliot from here is a straight machine 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.920
 batman details afrik tuning learn in 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.000
 our story well, what is africa inventor 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 how to drive a 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.850
 shocking tuning from where on the hood of a drop 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 of blood 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.420
 blood spray in the car most i'm 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.059
 I was surprised by the fact that the order was 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.470
 Johnsu and how long does the tattoo on 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.470
 car look now 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.829
 blood splattered on the hood terrible sight 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.260
 do not be scared this is the work of the masters 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.509
 autotuning true idea so unusual 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.119
 the paintings are not theirs but the owner and 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.220
 Mash the more unusual looking car than 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.110
 more shocking to those around 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.030
 consider some tuning lovers on 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.330
 I often look at the neighboring 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.899
 cars and pedestrians make round eyes and 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.060
 shocked surprised but this is a fragile girl 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.460
 and there is a car owner with red 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.490
 spotted on the hood saw the picture in 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.220
 internet on 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.850
 same on a similar car and wanted 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.310
 make also the car was Petersburg and in 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.770
 Moscow, my this is not airbrushing 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.340
 red divorces are not drawn on the car 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.439
 on sealed with ice stamp image 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.570
 print on such a transparent film 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.429
 if the picture then yes yes there is an owner 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.000
 car film can be removed as 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.580
 sticker 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.039
 this film is stuck on the car 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.990
 The main color of the car is stored under 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.610
 transparent film but at the same time 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.709
 a drawing appears 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.369
 such a film tattoo can 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:06.340
 stay by car for 2 to 7 years 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.009
 I live a picturesque piece of the brain but they are all 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.360
 car owners are so bloodthirsty more 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.090
 popular with tuning fans 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.410
 animals are used most often 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.019
 order 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.580
 horses of various dogs wolves bears 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.769
 by the way this tuning can be done on 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.750
 car windows first 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.180
 create a computer program and so 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.549
 write the name of our program and headings 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 then all the letters will be cut by the method 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.079
 plotter cutting special machine 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.180
 knife cuts through the film does exactly 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.350
 just baked here without using 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.840
 what kind of paint 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.000
 notice the knife cuts through the film 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.190
 but does not touch the paper backing under it 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.769
 This is the accuracy of the process took less 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.540
 minutes now manual labor has to 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.780
 choose the inside of this 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.299
 The case of the image is quite simple and 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:59.130
 internal elements are easy to select and 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.130
 fast left to stick on the glass 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.450
 suddenly out of nowhere appeared 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.390
 such a tuning 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.430
 guess what the authors have done these 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.830
 patterns 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.340
 take a look at the patterns made up of 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.690
 markers to only about one and a half 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:27.670
 thousands of markers glue 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.380
 several hours of work and your car 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.510
 becomes unique 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 but more about breaking spheres we 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.160
 let's talk some other time not 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.760
 skip next encyclopedia release 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.760
