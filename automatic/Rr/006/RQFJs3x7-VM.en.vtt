everything is perfect it takes a long
time<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> see<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> end

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
time but but the as you can see the end

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.969 
time but but the as you can see the end
result<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.360> wonderful<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.710> doesn't

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
result is is wonderful and it doesn't

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.270 
result is is wonderful and it doesn't
take<00:01:35.130> nine<00:01:35.340> months<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.180> human<00:01:36.570> baby

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
take nine months like with a human baby

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.450 
take nine months like with a human baby
it's<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> lot<00:01:38.490> faster<00:01:38.640> process<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:39.509> right

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's a lot faster process that's right
