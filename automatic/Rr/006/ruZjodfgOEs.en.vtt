00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:50.470 

I<00:00:47.530> think<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.160> main<00:00:49.399> way<00:00:49.610> that<00:00:49.640> I<00:00:49.879> don't<00:00:50.210> think

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
I think the main way that I don't think

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.759 
I think the main way that I don't think
there's<00:00:50.629> really<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.840> way<00:00:50.989> to<00:00:51.050> describe<00:00:51.440> the

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
there's really a way to describe the

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.040 
there's really a way to describe the
style<00:00:52.040> of<00:00:52.370> how<00:00:52.519> you<00:00:52.579> perform<00:00:53.090> perhaps<00:00:53.870> other

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
style of how you perform perhaps other

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.470 
style of how you perform perhaps other
people<00:00:54.350> can<00:00:54.530> do<00:00:54.649> that<00:00:54.769> for<00:00:54.980> me<00:00:55.129> but<00:00:55.449> what<00:00:56.449> I

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
people can do that for me but what I

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.329 
people can do that for me but what I
tried<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:56.809> achieve<00:00:57.140> when<00:00:57.559> they<00:00:57.710> perform<00:00:58.159> is<00:00:58.309> to

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
tried to achieve when they perform is to

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.670 
tried to achieve when they perform is to
show<00:00:58.610> how<00:00:58.909> beautiful<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.390> music<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.050> not<00:01:00.290> how

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
show how beautiful the music is not how

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.049 
show how beautiful the music is not how
beautifully<00:01:01.040> I<00:01:01.070> can<00:01:01.250> play<00:01:01.430> it<00:01:01.550> how<00:01:01.670> well<00:01:01.909> I<00:01:01.940> can

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
beautifully I can play it how well I can

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.149 
beautifully I can play it how well I can
play<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:02.390> how<00:01:02.510> perfect<00:01:02.930> I<00:01:03.050> can<00:01:03.199> play<00:01:03.379> but<00:01:03.440> how

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
play it how perfect I can play but how

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.639 
play it how perfect I can play but how
beautifully<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.729> was<00:01:05.059> composed<00:01:05.449> by<00:01:05.690> by<00:01:06.140> Chopin

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
beautifully it was composed by by Chopin

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.350 
beautifully it was composed by by Chopin
by<00:01:06.800> Mozart<00:01:07.159> by<00:01:07.280> Schumann<00:01:07.610> by<00:01:07.759> whoever<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.240> is

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
by Mozart by Schumann by whoever it is

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.810 
by Mozart by Schumann by whoever it is
and<00:01:08.570> that's<00:01:09.470> truly<00:01:09.710> my<00:01:09.890> goal<00:01:10.100> that's<00:01:10.550> what<00:01:10.790> I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
and that's truly my goal that's what I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.210 
and that's truly my goal that's what I
want<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.330> do<00:01:11.479> not<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:11.960> show<00:01:12.140> how<00:01:12.679> well<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:12.920> can

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
want to do not to show how well I can

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.070 
want to do not to show how well I can
play<00:01:13.399> it<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:13.670> how<00:01:14.390> well<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.750> was<00:01:14.869> written

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
play it but how well it was written

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.749 
play it but how well it was written
because<00:01:15.259> that's<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.950> true<00:01:16.130> artistry<00:01:16.580> that's

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
because that's the true artistry that's

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:24.740 
because that's the true artistry that's
the<00:01:16.970> true<00:01:17.210> mastery<00:01:18.050> is<00:01:18.170> how<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:18.740> composed

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.760 

I<00:01:26.480> don't<00:01:27.480> come<00:01:27.600> from<00:01:27.660> a<00:01:27.810> musical<00:01:27.900> family<00:01:28.260> so

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I don't come from a musical family so

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
I don't come from a musical family so
it's<00:01:28.980> not<00:01:29.160> that<00:01:29.220> Chopin<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.000> running<00:01:30.690> in<00:01:31.020> my

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's not that Chopin is running in my

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's not that Chopin is running in my
family<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.010> not<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.370> heard<00:01:32.640> shopping

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
family it's not that I heard shopping

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.690 
family it's not that I heard shopping
from<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> young<00:01:33.390> age<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.780> home<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.440> I<00:01:35.400> don't

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
from a young age at home and I don't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
from a young age at home and I don't
think<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> fact<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.720> I'm<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:36.990> Polish

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
think really the fact that I'm in Polish

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
think really the fact that I'm in Polish
doesn't<00:01:37.710> mean<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.010> you<00:01:38.160> have<00:01:38.190> Chopin's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
doesn't mean that you have Chopin's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
doesn't mean that you have Chopin's
blood<00:01:39.120> pending<00:01:39.630> somewhere<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> your<00:01:40.290> veins

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
blood pending somewhere in your veins

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.310 
blood pending somewhere in your veins
it's<00:01:40.800> not<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.990> understand<00:01:42.990> his<00:01:43.170> music

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it's not that you understand his music

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
it's not that you understand his music
better<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.850> understand<00:01:45.300> what's

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
better I think you understand what's

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.570 
better I think you understand what's
around<00:01:45.720> his<00:01:45.990> music<00:01:46.260> much<00:01:46.440> better<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.890> he

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
around his music much better and he

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.950 
around his music much better and he
longed<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.150> much<00:01:48.300> for<00:01:48.479> Poland<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> course

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
longed very much for Poland of course

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.040 
longed very much for Poland of course
when<00:01:49.830> he<00:01:49.920> was<00:01:50.070> away<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.460> France<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.210> he<00:01:51.869> always

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
when he was away in France and he always

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.620 
when he was away in France and he always
wanted<00:01:52.410> to<00:01:52.470> return<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.790> his<00:01:54.030> music<00:01:54.450> there's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
wanted to return so in his music there's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.960 
wanted to return so in his music there's
so<00:01:55.350> much<00:01:55.530> so<00:01:55.950> many<00:01:56.100> elements<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.820> can

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
so much so many elements that you can

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.790 
so much so many elements that you can
say<00:01:57.330> are<00:01:57.360> quintessentially<00:01:58.200> polished<00:01:58.590> with

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
say are quintessentially polished with

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.490 
say are quintessentially polished with
the<00:01:59.340> dances<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.210> landscapes<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.200> can<00:02:01.350> almost

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the dances the landscapes you can almost

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
the dances the landscapes you can almost
hear<00:02:01.860> them<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.060> makes<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.330> big

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
hear them and I think it makes a big

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:32.790 
hear them and I think it makes a big
difference<00:02:03.540> if<00:02:03.990> you've<00:02:04.110> experienced<00:02:04.680> them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.080 

the<00:02:33.800> first<00:02:34.010> time<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.250> played<00:02:34.490> at<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> shop<00:02:34.940> in

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
the first time I played at the shop in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.840 
the first time I played at the shop in
Anders<00:02:35.300> Europe<00:02:35.510> festival<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:35.960> was<00:02:36.110> 12<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.850> it

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
Anders Europe festival I was 12 and it

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.970 
Anders Europe festival I was 12 and it
started<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.480> natural<00:02:39.290> way<00:02:39.410> it<00:02:39.470> was<00:02:39.650> not<00:02:39.830> at

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
started in a natural way it was not at

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.590 
started in a natural way it was not at
all<00:02:40.100> because<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.430> my<00:02:40.670> heritage<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.240> wasn't

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
all because of my heritage it wasn't

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.470 
all because of my heritage it wasn't
because<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.170> connections<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.850> was<00:02:43.850> playing<00:02:44.120> in

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
because of connections I was playing in

because of connections I was playing in
Manchester<00:02:45.440> and<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.590> met<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.980> very<00:02:46.280> nice

liked my playing very much and so he

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.710 
liked my playing very much and so he
said<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.520> want<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.940> play<00:02:56.090> with<00:02:56.240> you<00:02:56.360> somewhere
