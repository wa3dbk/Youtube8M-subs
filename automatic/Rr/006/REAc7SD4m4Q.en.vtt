00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.940
 Hi, I am among your friends today, we are going to 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:10.959
 explain how it makes the rich had 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:15.219
 supported do not forgive the flying beams 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:18.280
 found first look at us 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.160
 we bring together programs 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.030
 vittek folder like before but 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.030
 sammy reason 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.580
 play 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 we observe that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.520
 the origin is in training and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.030
 processes are on the right those three 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.620
 I see that both are negative 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.000
 but minus 24 are the artists track and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.289
 it's there it may seem a bit dirty 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.690
 but it is not 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.449
 again say achieve this in addition to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.030
 structures the x vary or go 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.129
 increasing from left to right and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.310
 the videos that I already understand the one that I take 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.680
 the 0 as the origin 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.740
 and the origin is the prototype with which 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.410
 I find that it is an embedment of 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:12.790
 that form did not make him know virtue 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.790
 of life look because the attitude 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.090
 the letters a concentrated that goes from 50 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.600
 down 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.159
 fifty 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.159
 artist a -4 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.280
 a moment that is worth more 20 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.280
 twenty 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.490
 ariza - 4 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:49.480
 a distributed load 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:53.550
 starts on the 4th and goes on 20 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.550
 it ends in -2 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.130
 and it's worth 20 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.390
 of the other eye that goes up is 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.560
 negative 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.540
 another starting charge 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 start at -2 and worth minus 20 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:25.030
 ends in third and is worth less 20 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.030
 also in order 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.970
 we have 50 relationships up and 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.550
 the 60 hours 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.970
 accept to accept who erratic yes 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.340
 and here nothing graphic of constants 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.020
 instead keep in mind that it is a high 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:51.560
 horizontal this employee would be a stretch 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.040
 of another 50 annual 90 sections 2 will see less 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.760
 90 and ends less without ports 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.760
 but he is 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.170
 and from there 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.380
 and I have that there is not a thing 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.030
 told in the previous case look 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.070
 this is a curve 7 the first one is the 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.569
 second what happens is that that curve 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:22.170
 It has very little variety of slope 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.160
 and look like a line of ramirez a curve 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.730
 and the values of 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.590
 where it goes and where it comes and not the point 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.160
 of tangency could go frontal 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.100
 dt is interesting to know is that when the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 starting charge goes down the 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.740
 rector sinks down he clarified 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.980
 start up the rector sinks 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.130
 upwards used to sink the curve 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.290
 as in an intuitive way instead of 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.100
 eat the jar and talk about concluding 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:59.090
 active convinced of very well then here 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.270
 you have the life of that law and well this 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.310
 It is an oyster 6 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.310
 it has its importance 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.900
 it is the ray itself that the direction so 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.240
 back it was like the day 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.550
 calculator and reform is already finished 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.610
 thank you very much I hope that I have 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.610
 liked
