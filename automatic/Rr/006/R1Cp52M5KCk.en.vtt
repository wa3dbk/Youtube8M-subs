00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 for 1946 with the invention of the first 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.279
 large electronic computer 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 built eniac at the University of 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:21.630
 pennsylvania had high speed 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.300
 in digital processing 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 200 calculations per second 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.270
 n is presented that around 18 000 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 valves and occupied a space of one 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.379
 great hall 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.839
 his goal was to help the army 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.190
 during the second war 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.429
 world 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.739
 could calculate the trajectory of the angle of 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.969
 a bomb in 20 seconds 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.859
 still in this generation we have the 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.409
 simplified the programming process and 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.850
 has the ability to store 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:59.579
 information 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.699
 in 1951 specialized companies 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.970
 in the computer trade 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.450
 a level emerged that in the United States 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 and fertile mark 1 in england at a 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.969
 level that launched a computer with the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.600
 same company name processed each 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.579
 digit with more precision to study 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.930
 better the rapid evolution of 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:27.829
 computers from 1946 onwards were 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.340
 divided into generations having the 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.039
 development of the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.500
 responsible for processing the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:42.240
 information as a dividing line between 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.299
 them the first generation 1946 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.689
 computers were based on valves 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.530
 the cited computers 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:59.520
 above are parts of this category and nick 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:03.960
 the level that ad hoc second generation 1957 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.020
 and 1964, computers became 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.729
 using transistors or increasing the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.090
 your speed 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.940
 they were much smaller faster and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.510
 They did not burn so easily to 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.370
 third generation nineteen 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:27.090
 164 1984 transistors evolve to the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.530
 In this generation, there were many types of 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.870
 computers 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.459
 among them was in theo 4004 and 4001 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.660
 where the first 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:43.080
 microprocessor pd and first 8 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.660
 computer successfully marketed 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.959
 the famous minicomputer of the extinct 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 digital deck sales success from 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.260
 of its launch in 1964 it was a 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.930
 short 12-bit machine was small 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.870
 enough to be placed on the table 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.110
 more or less the size of a mini-fridge 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.500
 simple enough to be used 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.070
 by several people as an alternative to 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:19.110
 multiple systems in fourth data centers 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:23.940
 from 1985 onwards. 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.870
 integrations arise microchips reduction 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.610
 in price and capacity increase 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.190
 increasingly powerful computers 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.019
 become part of offices and 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.060
 called microcomputers 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.430
 have a more personal application with 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.489
 an infinity of resources to optimize 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.660
 the life of the user both at work and 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:51.720
 are a network 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.239
 increasing its potential and allowing 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.989
 that many users interact 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.870
 using information technology 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.780
 currently dazzle the fifth generation 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.750
 of computers with an increase in 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.090
 system storage capacity 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.090
 operating with the highest degree of
