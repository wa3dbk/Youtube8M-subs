so I make a drawing on canvas I give a

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.890 
so I make a drawing on canvas I give a
number<00:00:25.340> wash<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.150> we're<00:00:26.270> ready<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:26.570> begin

number wash and we're ready to begin
let's<00:00:27.439> go

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.710 

let<00:00:40.680> me<00:00:40.740> start<00:00:41.040> off<00:00:41.130> by<00:00:41.190> saying<00:00:41.400> what<00:00:41.910> my<00:00:42.150> art

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
let me start off by saying what my art

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.770 
let me start off by saying what my art
professor<00:00:43.080> Winston<00:00:43.880> never<00:00:44.880> draw<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.390> teeth

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
professor Winston never draw the teeth

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.900 
professor Winston never draw the teeth
they're<00:00:46.410> impossible<00:00:49.130> he<00:00:50.130> was<00:00:50.489> right<00:00:50.700> though

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
they're impossible he was right though

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430 
they're impossible he was right though
in<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:51.960> they're<00:00:52.140> really

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
in a way because they're really

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.050 
in a way because they're really
difficult<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.220> you<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> little

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
difficult but you know the little

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.360 
difficult but you know the little
practice<00:00:54.720> and<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.140> tweaks<00:00:55.830> here<00:00:56.130> and<00:00:56.190> there

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
practice and just tweaks here and there

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
practice and just tweaks here and there
you<00:00:56.700> get<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.970> just<00:00:57.090> perfectly<00:00:57.660> fine<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:57.989> in

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you get it just perfectly fine so in

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.800 
you get it just perfectly fine so in
this<00:00:59.220> video<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.580> attempt<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.120> show<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.360> how<00:01:00.750> all

right<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.080> let's<00:01:07.380> look<00:01:07.440> at<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> sketch<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
right so let's look at the sketch and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.700 
right so let's look at the sketch and
compare<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> finished<00:01:09.450> painting<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.410> see

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
compare to the finished painting and see

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.940 
compare to the finished painting and see
what<00:01:11.190> I<00:01:11.220> did<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> we're<00:01:13.200> taking<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> look<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.890> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
what I did so we're taking a look now we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
what I did so we're taking a look now we
get<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> side-by-side<00:01:14.580> comparison<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.840> notice

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
get a side-by-side comparison you notice

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
get a side-by-side comparison you notice
I<00:01:16.229> made<00:01:16.259> these<00:01:16.650> slight<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.729> changes<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I made these slight little changes that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.070 
I made these slight little changes that
makes<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.170> world<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.770> difference<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.660> I<00:01:21.660> want

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
makes a world of difference and I want

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.359 
makes a world of difference and I want
you<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> keep<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.770> mind

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you to keep that in mind

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.830 
you to keep that in mind
that<00:01:23.700> you're<00:01:23.850> gonna<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.180> slight<00:01:24.540> little

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
that you're gonna make slight little

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.330 
that you're gonna make slight little
differences<00:01:25.320> that'll<00:01:25.619> make<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.800> world<00:01:26.130> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
differences that'll make a world of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.280 
differences that'll make a world of
difference<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.060> when<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.750> way

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
difference so when you think your way

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
difference so when you think your way
off<00:01:28.619> you're<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.160> really<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> far<00:01:30.270> off<00:01:30.540> you

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
off you're not really that far off you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.880 
off you're not really that far off you
just<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> make<00:01:31.380> these<00:01:31.619> little

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
just have to make these little

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.120 
just have to make these little
differences<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> change<00:01:33.060> everything<00:01:34.130> what

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
differences that change everything what

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
differences that change everything what
you're<00:01:35.310> basically<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> focus<00:01:36.899> in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you're basically going to do is focus in

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.660 
you're basically going to do is focus in
on<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.460> negative<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.270> positive<00:01:39.409> shapes<00:01:40.670> so

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
on the negative and positive shapes so

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.969 
on the negative and positive shapes so
first<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.270> focus<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.200> negative<00:01:43.650> shapes

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
first I focus in on the negative shapes

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.120 
first I focus in on the negative shapes
and<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.760> how<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> spaces<00:01:46.290> around<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and see like how the spaces around the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.880 
and see like how the spaces around the
teeth<00:01:47.400> look<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> start<00:01:49.229> focusing<00:01:49.409> on

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
teeth look and then I start focusing on

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.390 
teeth look and then I start focusing on
positive<00:01:50.520> form

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.010 

what<00:01:56.970> you're<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> notice<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
what you're going to notice is that I

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.930 
what you're going to notice is that I
use<00:01:58.260> three<00:01:58.590> different<00:01:58.620> colors<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.520> under

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
use three different colors to under

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.720 
use three different colors to under
paint<00:02:00.150> the<00:02:00.270> teeth<00:02:00.480> I<00:02:00.780> use<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.800> mid<00:02:02.070> light<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
paint the teeth I use the mid light a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:10.370 
paint the teeth I use the mid light a
light<00:02:03.660> and<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.200> highlight<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.899> what<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.170> have

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
light and a highlight so what we have

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.230 
light and a highlight so what we have
here<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.830> reference<00:02:11.160> photo<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:12.120> I've

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
here is the reference photo what I've

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.890 
here is the reference photo what I've
done<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.660> I've<00:02:13.100> made<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> black<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.670> white<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
done is I've made a black and white and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.900 
done is I've made a black and white and
I've<00:02:16.020> toned<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> down<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.950> it's<00:02:17.100> really<00:02:17.610> dark

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I've toned it down so it's really dark

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.130 
I've toned it down so it's really dark
and<00:02:18.560> you<00:02:19.560> notice<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> teeth<00:02:21.780> kind<00:02:22.020> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
and you notice that the teeth kind of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
and you notice that the teeth kind of
look<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.410> value<00:02:22.950> chart<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:24.150> keeps<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
look like a value chart that keeps it

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.200 
look like a value chart that keeps it
that<00:02:25.050> makes<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.190> look<00:02:26.370> real<00:02:26.760> er

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
that makes it look real er

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.030 
that makes it look real er
gives<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.020> depth<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.650> keeps<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.010> from

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
gives it depth that keeps you from

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.220 
gives it depth that keeps you from
looking<00:02:29.400> flat<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:33.480> we're<00:02:33.720> going<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.959> have<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
looking flat so we're going to have to

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.260 
looking flat so we're going to have to
use<00:02:34.440> at<00:02:34.650> least<00:02:34.680> three<00:02:35.370> different<00:02:35.610> colors<00:02:36.150> to

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
use at least three different colors to

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.420 
use at least three different colors to
paint<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.780> teeth<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.070> keep<00:02:38.220> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
paint in the teeth so we can keep it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:55.940 
paint in the teeth so we can keep it
natural<00:02:38.730> looking<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:53.900> can't<00:02:54.900> stress<00:02:55.650> enough

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
natural looking I can't stress enough

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.010 
natural looking I can't stress enough
the<00:02:56.520> importance<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.240> structure<00:02:57.780> when<00:02:57.930> it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
the importance of structure when it

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.410 
the importance of structure when it
comes<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.440> painting<00:02:58.680> teeth<00:02:59.040> get<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.030> little<00:03:00.300> bit

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
comes to painting teeth get a little bit

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.270 
comes to painting teeth get a little bit
too<00:03:00.630> far<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.170> left<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.680> Lorraine<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
too far to the left the Lorraine it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.280 
too far to the left the Lorraine it
looks<00:03:02.519> like<00:03:02.700> horse<00:03:03.030> teeth

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
looks like horse teeth

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.530 
looks like horse teeth
so<00:03:04.530> you're<00:03:04.739> gonna<00:03:04.830> have<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.370> get<00:03:06.090> them<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
so you're gonna have to get them in the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.390 
so you're gonna have to get them in the
right<00:03:07.280> place<00:03:09.349> what<00:03:10.349> I<00:03:10.409> do<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.860> measure<00:03:11.220> them

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
right place what I do is I measure them

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.949 
right place what I do is I measure them
and<00:03:11.549> compare<00:03:11.909> them<00:03:12.060> everything<00:03:12.540> around<00:03:12.750> them

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
and compare them everything around them

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.890 
and compare them everything around them
compared<00:03:13.409> to<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> lips<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:15.330> nose<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:16.019> can<00:03:16.790> I

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
compared to the lips the nose I can I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.619 
compared to the lips the nose I can I
compare<00:03:18.900> them<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.140> horizontal<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.879> vertical

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
compare them to horizontal to vertical

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.440 
compare them to horizontal to vertical
do<00:03:22.290> everything<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.769> can<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:23.069> make<00:03:23.250> sure<00:03:23.640> that

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
do everything I can to make sure that

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.930 
do everything I can to make sure that
they<00:03:24.629> come<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:24.989> right<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.830> may<00:03:26.040> seem<00:03:26.549> like<00:03:26.580> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
they come out right it may seem like a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.920 
they come out right it may seem like a
lot<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:27.599> after<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> while<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.950> get<00:03:29.129> used<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.670> it

lot but after a while you get used to it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.180 
lot but after a while you get used to it
and<00:03:30.930> I'm<00:03:31.110> not<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.500> tell<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.069> it's

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
and I'm not going to tell you that it's

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.030 
and I'm not going to tell you that it's
simple<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.730> painting<00:03:33.180> isn't<00:03:33.480> simple<00:03:34.079> if<00:03:34.920> you

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
simple a painting isn't simple if you

simple a painting isn't simple if you
ever<00:03:35.159> try<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.430> follow<00:03:35.730> along<00:03:35.879> with<00:03:36.239> paintings

ever try to follow along with paintings
you<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.780> how<00:03:37.230> not<00:03:38.040> easy<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:40.260> just

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
you know how not easy this it's just

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.880 
you know how not easy this it's just
something<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:42.090> lot<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.510> do

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
something you have to like a lot to do

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.839 
something you have to like a lot to do
basically<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.640> not<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.299> mean

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
basically it's not it I mean

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.280 
basically it's not it I mean
it's<00:03:47.329> simple<00:03:48.019> it's<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.860> not<00:03:49.099> easy<00:03:49.810> the<00:03:50.810> idea

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
it's simple it's just not easy the idea

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.559 
it's simple it's just not easy the idea
is<00:03:51.439> I'm<00:03:51.590> presenting<00:03:52.099> here<00:03:52.250> these<00:03:53.150> simple

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
is I'm presenting here these simple

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.140 
is I'm presenting here these simple
ideas<00:03:54.040> but<00:03:55.040> they're<00:03:55.219> not<00:03:55.340> always<00:03:55.549> easy<00:03:55.969> to

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
ideas but they're not always easy to

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.959 
ideas but they're not always easy to
execute<00:03:57.340> sometimes<00:03:58.340> they<00:03:58.489> take<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.730> lot<00:03:58.939> of

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:58.969 
execute sometimes they take a lot of

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:00.940 
execute sometimes they take a lot of
practice<00:03:59.540> but<00:03:59.569> we<00:03:59.900> know<00:04:00.079> practice<00:04:00.709> makes

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
practice but we know practice makes

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:45.800 
practice but we know practice makes
perfect

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.870 

I<00:04:45.870> use<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.470> bunch<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.919> colors<00:04:47.280> in<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.580> baby

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
I use a bunch of colors in this baby

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.960 
I use a bunch of colors in this baby
around<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.630> eyes<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.470> lips<00:04:49.880> and<00:04:50.880> I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
around the eyes and the lips and I

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.420 
around the eyes and the lips and I
didn't<00:04:51.330> want<00:04:51.720> to<00:04:51.840> dominate<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.740> painting<00:04:53.190> too

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
didn't want to dominate the painting too

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.860 
didn't want to dominate the painting too
much<00:04:53.990> or<00:04:54.990> dominate<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.710> face<00:04:55.950> too<00:04:56.190> much<00:04:56.810> so<00:04:57.810> I

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
much or dominate the face too much so I

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.490 
much or dominate the face too much so I
added<00:04:58.320> some<00:04:58.950> white<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.910> tint<00:05:00.210> it<00:05:00.389> but<00:05:01.380> I've

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
added some white to tint it but I've

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.280 
added some white to tint it but I've
also<00:05:01.710> added<00:05:02.040> Sienna<00:05:02.730> just<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.840> bring<00:05:04.169> them

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
also added Sienna just to bring them

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.930 
also added Sienna just to bring them
down<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.919> a<00:05:05.010> bit<00:05:05.040> so<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.550> wouldn't<00:05:05.790> be<00:05:05.850> too

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
down just a bit so it wouldn't be too

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:17.080 
down just a bit so it wouldn't be too
bright<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:06.450> will<00:05:06.930> dominate<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.650> whole<00:05:07.830> face

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.460 

so<00:05:18.090> for<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.360> teeth<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.810> use<00:05:19.020> three<00:05:19.440> different

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
so for the teeth I use three different

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.730 
so for the teeth I use three different
colors<00:05:20.270> first<00:05:21.270> color<00:05:21.570> I'm<00:05:21.690> gonna<00:05:21.780> use<00:05:22.110> here<00:05:22.470> is

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
colors first color I'm gonna use here is

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.719 
colors first color I'm gonna use here is
a<00:05:23.690> titanium<00:05:24.690> white<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.260> umber<00:05:25.979> or<00:05:26.160> just<00:05:26.610> a

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
a titanium white and umber or just a

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.480 
a titanium white and umber or just a
touch<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.419> amber<00:05:27.570> not<00:05:27.930> too<00:05:28.260> much<00:05:28.500> what<00:05:29.370> you

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
touch of amber not too much what you

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.760 
touch of amber not too much what you
have<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.729> realize<00:05:29.910> is<00:05:30.540> that<00:05:30.780> your<00:05:31.470> bones

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
have to realize is that your bones

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.370 
have to realize is that your bones
aren't<00:05:32.130> way<00:05:32.430> as<00:05:32.910> any<00:05:33.240> doctor<00:05:33.780> any<00:05:33.810> medical

students<00:05:34.919> bones<00:05:35.310> aren't<00:05:35.700> way<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:36.600> your<00:05:36.750> teeth

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
students bones aren't way so your teeth

students bones aren't way so your teeth
aren't<00:05:37.440> bright<00:05:38.070> white<00:05:38.610> unless<00:05:39.030> you<00:05:39.240> believe

aren't bright white unless you believe
stem<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:41.690> use<00:05:42.690> this<00:05:43.050> color<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.680> paint<00:05:43.889> for<00:05:44.100> the

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
stem I use this color to paint for the

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.360 
stem I use this color to paint for the
teeth<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.940> couple<00:05:45.360> of<00:05:45.419> times<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:49.800> second<00:05:50.160> color

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.420 
teeth a couple of times the second color
I<00:05:50.490> use<00:05:50.729> titanium<00:05:51.390> white<00:05:51.660> touch<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.530> number<00:05:53.039> and

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
I use titanium white touch a number and
