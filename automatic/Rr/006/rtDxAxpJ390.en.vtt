talked about in a video in the past
about<00:00:33.900> the<00:00:34.110> bicycle<00:00:34.620> generator<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.580> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
about the bicycle generator and so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.190 
about the bicycle generator and so
that's<00:00:35.879> exactly<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.360> I've<00:00:36.540> done<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.050> now

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that's exactly what I've done and so now

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.930 
that's exactly what I've done and so now
I<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.470> just<00:00:37.620> pull<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> male

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
I can just pull that out of the male

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.869

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.870 
coating and what we're going to do is
strip<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.270> each<00:02:00.480> wire<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:02.040> each<00:02:02.340> side<00:02:02.640> we're

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
strip the each wire on each side we're

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.640 
strip the each wire on each side we're
going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> strip<00:02:03.300> those<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.900> then<00:02:04.500> we're

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
going to strip those and then we're

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.999 
going to strip those and then we're
going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.190> mount<00:02:05.700> those<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.840> our<00:02:06.870> plugs<00:02:07.410> with

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
going to mount those into our plugs with

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.639 
going to mount those into our plugs with
the<00:02:08.160> corresponding<00:02:08.940> sides<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.140> plugs<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the corresponding sides of the plugs so

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.410 
the corresponding sides of the plugs so
that<00:02:10.769> when<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> goes<00:02:11.069> back<00:02:11.310> into<00:02:11.519> place<00:02:11.790> this

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
that when it goes back into place this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.320 
that when it goes back into place this
will<00:02:12.659> let<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.959> power<00:02:13.140> transfer<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.330> our

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
will let the power transfer up to our

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.759 
will let the power transfer up to our
meter<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:16.319> tells<00:02:16.680> us<00:02:17.010> our<00:02:17.280> voltage<00:02:18.500> now<00:02:19.500> once

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
meter that tells us our voltage now once

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.949 
meter that tells us our voltage now once
you've<00:02:19.950> wired<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:20.970> plugs<00:02:21.269> whether<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
you've wired one of the plugs whether it

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.290 
you've wired one of the plugs whether it
be<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> male<00:02:22.409> or<00:02:22.650> female<00:02:23.099> it's<00:02:23.340> totally<00:02:23.760> your

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
be the male or female it's totally your

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.990 
be the male or female it's totally your
decision<00:02:24.390> what<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.319> with<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.700> which

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
decision what you do with it as to which

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.150 
decision what you do with it as to which
side<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.600> put<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> plugs<00:02:28.200> on<00:02:28.440> but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
side that you put the plugs on but

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.700 
side that you put the plugs on but
do<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.430> close<00:02:29.760> up<00:02:30.060> both<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.810> plug<00:02:31.320> until

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
do not close up both the plug until

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.710 
do not close up both the plug until
that<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.980> make<00:02:32.190> sure<00:02:32.490> as<00:02:33.330> you're<00:02:33.540> wearing

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that you make sure as you're wearing

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.110 
that you make sure as you're wearing
each<00:02:34.170> one<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.010> will<00:02:35.220> correspond<00:02:35.970> with

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
each one that they will correspond with

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.210 
each one that they will correspond with
each<00:02:36.270> other<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.470> which<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
each other so that I know which one to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.180 
each other so that I know which one to
mark<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.200> each<00:02:40.380> side<00:02:40.650> because<00:02:40.890> what

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
mark for on the each side because what

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.770 
mark for on the each side because what
I'm<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.640> do<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> I'm<00:02:42.060> going<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.330> make<00:02:42.570> a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
I'm going to do is I'm going to make a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.260 
I'm going to do is I'm going to make a
marking<00:02:43.470> into<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> plug<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.060> put

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
marking into the plug so the one I put

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.000 
marking into the plug so the one I put
this<00:02:45.390> together<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.840> always<00:02:46.110> know<00:02:46.410> which<00:02:46.710> way

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
this together I always know which way

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.750 
this together I always know which way
that<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.850> goes<00:02:48.980> now<00:02:49.980> as<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.250> can<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.430> right

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
that it goes now as you can see right

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.610 
that it goes now as you can see right
here<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.360> plugs<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:51.990> together<00:02:52.320> in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
here I have the plugs put together in

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.280 
here I have the plugs put together in
the<00:02:53.130> wiring<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> appropriate<00:02:54.390> place<00:02:54.630> now

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
the wiring in the appropriate place now

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.260 
the wiring in the appropriate place now
I've<00:02:55.410> made<00:02:55.620> me<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> little<00:02:56.040> drill<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.640> spot<00:02:57.000> on

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
I've made me a little drill out spot on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.670 
I've made me a little drill out spot on
this<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.750> here<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.350> paint

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
this right here so that when I paint

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.380 
this right here so that when I paint
this<00:02:58.860> I'll<00:02:59.100> know<00:02:59.250> exactly<00:02:59.400> how<00:02:59.880> these<00:03:00.060> plugs

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
this I'll know exactly how these plugs

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.390 
this I'll know exactly how these plugs
go<00:03:00.660> back<00:03:00.870> together<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.920> encourage<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.310> to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
go back together and I encourage you to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.520 
go back together and I encourage you to
do<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:02.850> because<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.390> don't<00:03:03.600> your<00:03:04.260> meter

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
do so because if you don't your meter

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.620 
do so because if you don't your meter
will<00:03:04.770> be<00:03:04.920> reading<00:03:05.250> wrong<00:03:05.460> now<00:03:06.120> I've<00:03:06.240> left<00:03:06.450> this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
will be reading wrong now I've left this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.180 
will be reading wrong now I've left this
just<00:03:06.900> partially<00:03:07.380> open<00:03:07.800> because<00:03:07.980> what<00:03:08.100> I'm

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
just partially open because what I'm

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.070 
just partially open because what I'm
going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.370> do<00:03:08.490> now<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.820> trim<00:03:09.150> this<00:03:09.450> protective

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
going to do now is trim this protective

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.990 
going to do now is trim this protective
coating<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.620> I'm<00:03:11.220> gonna<00:03:11.370> put<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.640> back<00:03:11.700> over

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
coating and I'm gonna put that back over

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.670 
coating and I'm gonna put that back over
the<00:03:12.150> wires<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.570> tuck<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.870> down<00:03:12.900> inside<00:03:13.380> on

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the wires and tuck it down inside on

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.010 
the wires and tuck it down inside on
each<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.130> these<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.330> it's<00:03:15.480> good<00:03:15.690> shape

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
each of these so that it's good shape

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.250 
each of these so that it's good shape
for<00:03:16.320> many<00:03:16.530> years<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.980> come<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.900> now<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:18.960> have

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
for many years to come so now we have

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.290 
for many years to come so now we have
our<00:03:19.380> plugs<00:03:19.710> put<00:03:20.040> together<00:03:20.160> and<00:03:20.610> our

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
our plugs put together and our

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.150 
our plugs put together and our
protective<00:03:21.810> coating<00:03:22.170> back<00:03:22.350> into<00:03:22.650> place<00:03:22.890> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
protective coating back into place and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.220 
protective coating back into place and
so<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:23.820> I'm<00:03:23.910> gonna<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.210> now<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.750> since<00:03:25.020> it's

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so what I'm gonna do now is since it's

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.200 
so what I'm gonna do now is since it's
obvious<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.070> bike<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.460> disconnected

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
obvious that the bike is disconnected

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.210 
obvious that the bike is disconnected
and<00:03:27.300> that<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.080> belt<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.530> loose<00:03:28.770> we're<00:03:29.070> going

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
and that the belt is loose we're going

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.370 
and that the belt is loose we're going
to<00:03:29.280> check<00:03:29.490> and<00:03:29.730> make<00:03:29.760> sure<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.900> we<00:03:31.140> have

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
to check and make sure that we have

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.490 
to check and make sure that we have
everything<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:32.430> its<00:03:33.030> appropriate<00:03:33.420> place<00:03:33.959> and

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
everything in its appropriate place and

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.650 
everything in its appropriate place and
I'm<00:03:34.860> gonna<00:03:35.010> hold<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.280> over<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.209> check

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
I'm gonna hold this over this and check

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.440 
I'm gonna hold this over this and check
it<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.040> it<00:03:38.190> looks<00:03:38.430> like<00:03:38.520> we're<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:38.940> business

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
it and it looks like we're in business

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.670 
it and it looks like we're in business
oh<00:03:40.190> yeah<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:42.030> anyway<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.470> great

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
oh yeah so anyway that is just a great

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.550 
oh yeah so anyway that is just a great
way<00:03:43.740> now<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.209> unplug<00:03:45.690> your<00:03:46.290> bike

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
way now that you can unplug your bike

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.150 
way now that you can unplug your bike
and<00:03:47.550> take<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.300> on<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.720> go<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:49.620> now<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:49.980> is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and take it on the go so now this is

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.550 
and take it on the go so now this is
completely<00:03:50.850> separated<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.690> bicycle<00:03:52.380> is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
completely separated the bicycle is

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.160 
completely separated the bicycle is
separated<00:03:53.220> from<00:03:53.459> its<00:03:53.700> mail<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.270> you're<00:03:54.959> ready

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
separated from its mail and you're ready

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.230 
separated from its mail and you're ready
to<00:03:55.350> take<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.100> move<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.610> wherever

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that if you do do this build that I'm

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.090 
that if you do do this build that I'm
gonna<00:04:25.050> actually<00:04:25.230> I'm<00:04:25.620> actually<00:04:25.770> thinking

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
gonna actually I'm actually thinking

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.060 
gonna actually I'm actually thinking
about<00:04:26.460> making<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.970> PVC<00:04:27.660> pop<00:04:28.140> sleeve<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.919> goes

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
about making a PVC pop sleeve that goes

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.920 
about making a PVC pop sleeve that goes
over<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:29.520> just<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.880> protect<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.330> motor<00:04:30.660> and

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
over this just to protect this motor and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.780 
over this just to protect this motor and
that<00:04:31.440> way<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.680> don't<00:04:31.950> ever<00:04:32.130> get<00:04:32.250> banged<00:04:32.550> down

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
that way you don't ever get banged down

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.970 
that way you don't ever get banged down
or<00:04:33.060> anything<00:04:33.270> because<00:04:33.630> actually<00:04:34.500> bump<00:04:34.740> that

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
or anything because actually bump that

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.980 
or anything because actually bump that
one<00:04:35.160> day<00:04:35.310> in<00:04:35.430> one<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.640> these<00:04:35.700> contacts<00:04:36.300> came

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
one day in one of these contacts came

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.570 
one day in one of these contacts came
loose<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.979> just<00:04:38.130> don't<00:04:38.280> want<00:04:38.400> anything

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
loose and you just don't want anything

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.890 
loose and you just don't want anything
have<00:04:38.850> your<00:04:39.060> motor<00:04:39.270> because<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:39.720> is<00:04:39.810> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
have your motor because this is the

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.690 
have your motor because this is the
lifeblood<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.380> your<00:04:40.620> power

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
lifeblood of your power

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.480 
lifeblood of your power
and<00:04:42.030> one<00:04:42.780> other<00:04:42.930> final<00:04:43.350> thing<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.800> I'm<00:04:44.010> so<00:04:44.310> glad

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
and one other final thing is I'm so glad

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.850 
and one other final thing is I'm so glad
that<00:04:44.640> I<00:04:44.850> left<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.240> kickstand<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.650> bike

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
that I left the kickstand on that bike

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.470 
that I left the kickstand on that bike
whenever<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.400> originally<00:04:47.880> built<00:04:48.090> that<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.270> was

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
whenever I originally built that I was

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.120 
whenever I originally built that I was
going<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.780> take<00:04:48.900> that<00:04:48.960> off<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:49.680> I<00:04:49.830> ended<00:04:50.010> up

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
going to take that off and I ended up

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.010 
going to take that off and I ended up
leaving<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.580> that's<00:04:51.060> now<00:04:51.300> that<00:04:51.510> just<00:04:51.690> makes<00:04:51.900> it

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
leaving it that's now that just makes it

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.360 
leaving it that's now that just makes it
so<00:04:52.080> convenient<00:04:52.560> if<00:04:52.890> it's<00:04:53.010> just<00:04:53.190> one<00:04:53.340> person

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
so convenient if it's just one person

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.940 
so convenient if it's just one person
setting<00:04:54.030> this<00:04:54.090> thing<00:04:54.150> up<00:04:54.510> you<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.290> set<00:04:55.860> it

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
setting this thing up you just set it

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.540 
setting this thing up you just set it
over<00:04:56.040> there

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
over there

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.850 
over there
put<00:04:56.730> your<00:04:56.850> kickstand<00:04:57.330> out<00:04:57.510> like<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.960> would

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
put your kickstand out like you would

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.650 
put your kickstand out like you would
with<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.100> normal<00:04:59.460> bike<00:04:59.640> and<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.450> can<00:05:00.540> get

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
with a normal bike and you can get

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.300 
with a normal bike and you can get
everything<00:05:00.870> prepped<00:05:01.290> into<00:05:01.590> place<00:05:01.830> here<00:05:02.160> and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
everything prepped into place here and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.950 
everything prepped into place here and
then<00:05:02.400> I<00:05:02.520> do<00:05:02.580> your<00:05:02.850> wing<00:05:03.000> nuts<00:05:03.240> setting<00:05:03.750> into

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
then I do your wing nuts setting into

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.460 
then I do your wing nuts setting into
place<00:05:04.200> and<00:05:04.500> there<00:05:05.100> you<00:05:05.250> go
