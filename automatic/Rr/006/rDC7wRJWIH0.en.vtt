00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.929 

I'm<00:00:15.160> going<00:00:15.400> to<00:00:15.580> attempt<00:00:16.000> to<00:00:16.560> install<00:00:17.939> the

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
I'm going to attempt to install the

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.940 
I'm going to attempt to install the
thought<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.330> body<00:00:19.510> that<00:00:19.630> I<00:00:19.810> removed<00:00:20.320> to<00:00:20.590> do<00:00:20.770> the

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
thought of body that I removed to do the

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.660 
thought of body that I removed to do the
sparkplugs<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.750> have<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.140> remove<00:00:23.470> two<00:00:24.460> bolts

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
sparkplugs you have to remove two bolts

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.780 
sparkplugs you have to remove two bolts
on<00:00:24.970> top<00:00:25.180> and<00:00:26.080> then<00:00:26.680> there's<00:00:26.860> two<00:00:27.099> nuts<00:00:27.430> on<00:00:27.669> the

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
on top and then there's two nuts on the

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.729 
on top and then there's two nuts on the
bottom<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.529> it's<00:00:29.800> really<00:00:30.039> tricky<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:31.570> have

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:31.739 
bottom and it's really tricky you have

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.630 
bottom and it's really tricky you have
looks<00:00:32.739> like<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.949> got<00:00:33.100> a<00:00:33.129> water<00:00:33.400> line<00:00:33.610> right

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
looks like you got a water line right

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:44.020 
looks like you got a water line right
here

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:54.479 

uses<00:00:44.870> these<00:00:45.019> kind<00:00:45.289> of<00:00:45.320> guys

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.540 

and<00:00:54.579> there's<00:00:55.329> here's<00:00:56.200> another<00:00:56.520> connector<00:00:57.520> I

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
and there's here's another connector I

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.100 
and there's here's another connector I
don't<00:00:57.820> know<00:00:57.879> what<00:00:57.969> it's<00:00:58.059> for<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.510> I

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
don't know what it's for and I

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.310 
don't know what it's for and I
disconnected<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.940> throttle<00:01:02.100> right<00:01:03.100> here<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
disconnected the throttle right here and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.530 
disconnected the throttle right here and
this<00:01:05.830> connector<00:01:06.340> so<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:06.970> looks<00:01:07.119> like<00:01:07.270> four

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
this connector so it looks like four

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.520 
this connector so it looks like four
pieces<00:01:07.860> I'm<00:01:08.860> going<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.280> attempt<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:10.630> put<00:01:11.409> it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
pieces I'm going to attempt to put it

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:20.270 
pieces I'm going to attempt to put it
back<00:01:11.680> on<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.070> way<00:01:12.190> it<00:01:12.340> took<00:01:12.490> it<00:01:12.670> off

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.280 

and<00:01:23.190> that's<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.430> that's<00:01:25.360> how<00:01:25.510> you<00:01:25.630> remove<00:01:26.110> this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
and that's it that's how you remove this

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.330 
and that's it that's how you remove this
total<00:01:26.680> body<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.270> remember<00:01:28.840> your<00:01:29.620> important<00:01:30.190> is

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
total body so remember your important is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.150 
total body so remember your important is
this<00:01:30.910> guy<00:01:31.560> looks<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.710> it's<00:01:32.890> for<00:01:33.070> your

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
this guy looks like it's for your

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.440 
this guy looks like it's for your
adjustable<00:01:36.160> choke<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.910> all<00:01:39.910> these<00:01:40.120> little

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
adjustable choke and all these little

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.880 
adjustable choke and all these little
three<00:01:40.780> little<00:01:40.900> guys<00:01:41.140> they<00:01:41.440> are<00:01:41.560> color-coded

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
three little guys they are color-coded

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.790 
three little guys they are color-coded
black<00:01:42.370> white<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:42.790> clear<00:01:43.330> so<00:01:44.110> they<00:01:44.470> kind<00:01:44.770> of

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
black white and clear so they kind of

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.280 
black white and clear so they kind of
fall<00:01:45.040> right<00:01:45.250> in<00:01:45.370> place

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
fall right in place

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.540 
fall right in place
you<00:01:47.290> sure<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.560> don't<00:01:47.650> damage<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.220> little

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
you sure you don't damage to a little

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.060 
you sure you don't damage to a little
middle<00:01:50.970> gasket<00:01:51.970> this<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:52.990> hose<00:01:53.590> okay<00:01:53.920> that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
middle gasket this is a hose okay that

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.860 
middle gasket this is a hose okay that
connects<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.910> this<00:01:55.420> one<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.720> can

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
connects to here and this one you can

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.270 
connects to here and this one you can
leave<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.260> if<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.590> can<00:01:56.770> work<00:01:56.980> with<00:01:57.130> it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
leave it on if you can work with it

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760 
leave it on if you can work with it
without<00:01:57.580> it<00:01:57.760> on<00:01:58.210> there<00:01:58.810> but<00:01:59.020> I<00:01:59.050> had<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.530> take<00:01:59.740> it

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
without it on there but I had to take it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.210 
without it on there but I had to take it
off<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.400> then<00:02:00.870> pull<00:02:01.870> it<00:02:01.990> out<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:02.800> then<00:02:02.979> pull

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
off and then pull it out and then pull

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.160 
off and then pull it out and then pull
this<00:02:03.370> guy<00:02:03.640> like<00:02:04.090> that<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.570> then<00:02:04.660> tilt<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.050> over

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
this guy like that and then tilt it over

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:33.680 
this guy like that and then tilt it over
right<00:02:05.440> down

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.660 

this<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.380> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.620> be<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.860> tricky<00:02:35.100> part<00:02:35.460> now

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
this is going to be the tricky part now

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
this is going to be the tricky part now
it's<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.240> lot<00:02:36.330> easier<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.810> remove<00:02:37.110> things<00:02:37.380> than

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
it's a lot easier to remove things than

00:02:37.560 --> 00:03:36.729 
it's a lot easier to remove things than
just<00:02:37.800> putting<00:02:38.040> things<00:02:38.190> back<00:02:38.340> on

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.420 

looks<00:03:37.220> like<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:39.200> thing<00:03:39.470> needs<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.189> be

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
looks like this thing needs to be

00:03:40.430 --> 00:04:52.670 
looks like this thing needs to be
located<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.299> a<00:03:41.420> way

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.140 

the<00:04:53.190> best<00:04:53.460> torque<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.840> get<00:04:55.080> as<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:55.320> shortest

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.950 

if<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.300> use<00:05:00.449> a<00:05:00.479> quarter<00:05:01.139> inch<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.500> can<00:05:02.960> you

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
if you use a quarter inch you can you

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.610 
if you use a quarter inch you can you
can<00:05:04.139> here

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.749 

that<00:05:12.160> should<00:05:12.370> work

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.710 

when<00:05:18.759> you<00:05:18.880> got<00:05:19.030> these<00:05:19.270> nuts<00:05:19.570> here<00:05:21.090> they<00:05:22.090> go<00:05:22.389> in

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
when you got these nuts here they go in

00:05:22.720 --> 00:06:32.540 
when you got these nuts here they go in
the<00:05:22.960> back

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.059 

that<00:06:33.550> is<00:06:33.669> your<00:06:33.849> throttle<00:06:34.240> body<00:06:34.650> assembly<00:06:35.650> and

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
that is your throttle body assembly and

that is your throttle body assembly and
