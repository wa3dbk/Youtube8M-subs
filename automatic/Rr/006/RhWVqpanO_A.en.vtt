00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello to all today I propose you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.179
 to show you how to do a time 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.200
 lapse that there is going to be three big say 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:17.490
 steps the photographic material stage 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.310
 is a little editing and tape landscape if we 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.580
 will start with the nice state choose the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.580
 landscape 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 so that's the first step is to 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:40.140
 choose your sun and its landscape is worth 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.460
 when we go in front of me that would be there 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 thought it was already a beautiful and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.120
 all operations look for one of the points 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.120
 of view 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.039
 so once we came on 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.690
 this kind of landscape 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.250
 we think that it can be nice to 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 try a time lapse then the material 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.729
 basic of course these are the camera I 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 advise the gopro who is really cool 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.590
 to do the tablecloth theme relief then 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 the reflex 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 if you use reflex advise you 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.780
 either wide-angle or the zou then the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.009
 tripod to pose the camera 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.570
 and if you use the window the 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.250
 remote fountain so so a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.530
 once you have installed other trip 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 materials in the angle that you like 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.330
 with the view that you like so we have 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.429
 make sure that the tripod is well stabilized 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.149
 because not falling, then 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:29.009
 the remote control 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.229
 age is programmed with a photo 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.819
 every 4 seconds and believes that this 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.710
 program and I believe it's launched and 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.429
 Well here we have to appreciate the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.149
 chocolate and that's what and here I am 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:45.450
 back to do the editing so a 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.670
 once I put my little sd card 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.940
 in my computer i want my file i 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.819
 check that the pictures please me 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.800
 it looks pretty okay so I'm going 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.560
 everything you create a folder that I'm going 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.569
 call time lapse is in i'm going there 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.200

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.590
 sunset 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.640
 so here we see that I'm going to have 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.640
 a lot of photos 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.150
 I make you gopro software suite that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.810
 I will use because he is 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.880
 much simpler 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.490
 I bring a new file on page 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.810
 was there because I just created the 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:44.080
 louvre it takes a few seconds and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.550
 was created good dish a little firm 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.950
 preview we see that it looks ok 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.900
 on the right we have small effects but good 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:57.730
 it's not your place and exports it 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.460
 gives my desire is so time lapse and 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.880
