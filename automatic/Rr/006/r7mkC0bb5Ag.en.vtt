00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
the protein gets to work on we care and

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.970 
the protein gets to work on we care and
tries<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:23.599> rebuild<00:02:24.599> us<00:02:25.019> from<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.409> inside<00:02:25.769> out

to<00:02:55.829> half<00:02:56.040> an<00:02:56.190> hour<00:02:56.340> I'm<00:02:56.640> not<00:02:56.790> sure<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.030> that's

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
to half an hour I'm not sure if that's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.399 
to half an hour I'm not sure if that's
good<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:57.420> bad<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.629> that<00:02:57.840> is<00:02:57.989> what<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> do<00:02:58.290> I

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
good or bad but that is what I do I

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.289 
good or bad but that is what I do I
presume<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.129> longer<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.430> leave<00:02:59.579> it<00:02:59.609> in<00:02:59.819> the

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
presume the longer you leave it in the

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.729 
presume the longer you leave it in the
more<00:03:00.480> it's<00:03:00.720> getting<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.109> work<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.470> really

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
more it's getting to work and really

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.789 
more it's getting to work and really
getting<00:03:01.950> into<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:03.049> root<00:03:04.049> of<00:03:04.230> your<00:03:04.260> hair<00:03:04.379> like

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
getting into the root of your hair like

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.550 
getting into the root of your hair like
right<00:03:05.069> into<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.609> follicles<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.349> what

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
right into the follicles so that is what

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.229 
right into the follicles so that is what
I<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.680> when<00:03:07.980> it's<00:03:08.099> it's<00:03:08.340> recommended<00:03:08.849> to<00:03:08.879> use

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
I do when it's it's recommended to use

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.690 
I do when it's it's recommended to use
it<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:09.720> between<00:03:09.900> 5<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.349> 50<00:03:10.620> minutes<00:03:10.890> texture

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
it for between 5 and 50 minutes texture

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.210 
it for between 5 and 50 minutes texture
wise<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.599> kind<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.930> thick<00:03:13.409> creamy<00:03:13.950> kind

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
wise it is a kind of thick creamy kind

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.789 
wise it is a kind of thick creamy kind
of<00:03:14.370> substance<00:03:14.989> so<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.349> what<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.620> looks

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
of substance so that is what it looks

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.280 
of substance so that is what it looks
like<00:03:16.919> as<00:03:17.310> you<00:03:17.669> can<00:03:17.910> see<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.120> am<00:03:18.450> about<00:03:19.019> halfway

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
need that much of it as you can see it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.369 
need that much of it as you can see it
is<00:03:34.410> really<00:03:34.620> thick<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.840> what<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.169> looks

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
is really thick so that is what it looks

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.640 
is really thick so that is what it looks
like

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
like

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.920 
like
so<00:03:38.160> we<00:03:38.400> last<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:38.790> long<00:03:38.940> time<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.239> that's<00:03:39.690> what<00:03:39.900> I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
so we last a long time so that's what I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.930 
so we last a long time so that's what I
think<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.349> is<00:03:40.379> worth<00:03:40.709> paying<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.190> 20<00:03:41.519> euro

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
think it is worth paying the 20 euro

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.199 
think it is worth paying the 20 euro
because<00:03:42.480> you're<00:03:43.319> not<00:03:43.470> meant<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.799> use<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.280> more

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
because you're not meant to use it more

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.089 
because you're not meant to use it more
basically<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.019> use<00:03:46.199> this<00:03:46.349> kind<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.620> once<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.980> week

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
basically I use this kind of once a week

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.129 
basically I use this kind of once a week
you<00:03:47.370> can't<00:03:47.669> you're<00:03:47.910> not<00:03:48.060> supposed<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.510> overuse

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
you can't you're not supposed to overuse

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.439 
you can't you're not supposed to overuse
these<00:03:49.379> because<00:03:49.859> there<00:03:50.549> is<00:03:50.730> such<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:50.970> thing<00:03:51.060> as

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
these because there is such a thing as

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.599 
these because there is such a thing as
protein<00:03:51.930> overloading<00:03:52.650> your<00:03:52.680> hair<00:03:52.980> too<00:03:53.579> much

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
protein overloading your hair too much

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.400 
protein overloading your hair too much
protein<00:03:54.209> will<00:03:54.449> actually<00:03:54.810> have<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:54.989> reverse

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
protein will actually have the reverse

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.930 
protein will actually have the reverse
effect<00:03:55.620> it<00:03:56.519> will<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:57.629> can<00:03:58.340> break<00:03:59.340> her<00:03:59.549> hair<00:03:59.730> if

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
effect it will it can break her hair if

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.789 
effect it will it can break her hair if
you<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.299> used<00:04:00.480> too<00:04:00.720> much<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.139> I<00:04:01.169> want<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.680> use

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you if used too much so I want to use

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.309 
you if used too much so I want to use
this<00:04:02.010> once<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.609> week<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.840> difference<00:04:04.199> I've

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
this once a week and the difference I've

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.589 
this once a week and the difference I've
noticed<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.879> is<00:04:06.030> really<00:04:06.480> really

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
noticed is it is really really

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:09.170 
noticed is it is really really
astounding<00:04:07.260> when<00:04:08.160> I<00:04:08.220> first<00:04:08.519> started<00:04:08.790> using<00:04:08.940> it

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
astounding when I first started using it

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.970 
astounding when I first started using it
it<00:04:09.389> was<00:04:09.480> kind<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.810> directly<00:04:10.169> after<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.650> owned

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it was kind of directly after I owned

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.770 
it was kind of directly after I owned
braids<00:04:11.190> my<00:04:11.370> own<00:04:11.489> hair<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.329> knew<00:04:12.540> it<00:04:12.690> was

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
braids my own hair and I knew it was

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.470 
braids my own hair and I knew it was
brittle<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.470> could<00:04:14.459> see<00:04:14.699> it<00:04:14.819> breaking<00:04:15.359> and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
brittle I could see it breaking and

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.000 
brittle I could see it breaking and
snapping<00:04:15.840> off<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.320> knew<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.530> needed<00:04:16.949> a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
snapping off and I knew I needed a

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.589 
snapping off and I knew I needed a
protein<00:04:17.459> treatment<00:04:17.820> because<00:04:18.090> there<00:04:18.299> was<00:04:18.389> it

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
protein treatment because there was it

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.069 
protein treatment because there was it
was<00:04:18.750> like<00:04:18.900> all<00:04:19.769> the<00:04:20.010> life<00:04:20.130> had<00:04:20.370> just<00:04:20.400> been

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
was like all the life had just been

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.440 
was like all the life had just been
pulled<00:04:22.079> for<00:04:22.320> my<00:04:22.409> hair<00:04:22.650> um<00:04:23.390> technically<00:04:24.390> I

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
pulled for my hair um technically I

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.969 
pulled for my hair um technically I
suppose<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.870> was<00:04:24.960> because<00:04:25.380> when<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.740> bleach

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
suppose it was because when you bleach

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.450 
suppose it was because when you bleach
your<00:04:26.010> hair

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
your hair

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.920 
your hair
you're<00:04:26.850> taking<00:04:27.150> everything<00:04:27.330> out<00:04:27.509> of<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.780> so

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
you're taking everything out of it so

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.400 
you're taking everything out of it so
basically<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:29.520> was<00:04:29.639> just<00:04:29.880> dead<00:04:30.509> hair<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.199> dead

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
basically it was just dead hair is dead

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.499 
basically it was just dead hair is dead
anyway<00:04:31.680> but<00:04:32.160> there<00:04:33.000> was<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.120> big<00:04:33.210> difference

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
anyway but there was a big difference

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.240 
anyway but there was a big difference
between<00:04:33.600> bleached<00:04:33.960> hair<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.500> natural<00:04:35.070> none

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
between bleached hair and natural none

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.689 
between bleached hair and natural none
non<00:04:36.030> processed<00:04:36.509> hair<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.259> for<00:04:37.650> processed<00:04:38.430> hair

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
non processed hair so for processed hair

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.700 
non processed hair so for processed hair
bleached<00:04:39.120> hair<00:04:39.479> distressed<00:04:40.110> weak<00:04:40.440> hair<00:04:40.680> I

conditioner<00:05:13.199> and<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.160> definitely<00:05:14.370> started

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
conditioner and I definitely started

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.540 
conditioner and I definitely started
seeing<00:05:15.539> results<00:05:15.599> after<00:05:16.410> basically<00:05:17.220> after<00:05:17.400> the

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
seeing results after basically after the

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.589 
seeing results after basically after the
first<00:05:17.789> juice<00:05:18.090> I<00:05:18.990> think<00:05:19.770> I<00:05:19.830> spoke<00:05:20.099> about<00:05:20.130> before

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599

some oils can temper if you if you have

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.460 
some oils can temper if you if you have
split<00:05:24.090> ends<00:05:24.240> they<00:05:24.509> can<00:05:24.660> temporarily<00:05:24.990> seal

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
split ends they can temporarily seal

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.379 
split ends they can temporarily seal
them<00:05:25.770> this<00:05:26.280> definitely<00:05:26.729> does<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.000> it

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
them this definitely does that it

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.879 
them this definitely does that it
smooths<00:05:27.780> down<00:05:28.110> my<00:05:28.259> hair<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.680> kind<00:05:28.800> of

smooths down my hair it kind of

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.129 
smooths down my hair it kind of
temporarily<00:05:29.340> heals<00:05:29.940> pretends<00:05:30.510> you<00:05:30.690> can't<00:05:30.930> use

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
temporarily heals pretends you can't use

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:32.839 
temporarily heals pretends you can't use
villains<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:31.620> have<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:31.860> cut<00:05:32.010> them<00:05:32.130> off<00:05:32.250> but

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
villains you have to cut them off but

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.790 
villains you have to cut them off but
this<00:05:33.000> does<00:05:33.389> temporary<00:05:33.900> seal<00:05:34.320> them

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
this does temporary seal them

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.770 
this does temporary seal them
which<00:05:35.490> obviously<00:05:35.669> straight<00:05:36.240> away<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:36.630> think

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
which obviously straight away you think

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440

looks<00:05:50.880> as<00:05:51.120> as<00:05:51.570> far<00:05:51.960> as<00:05:52.110> I<00:05:52.260> could<00:05:52.320> tell<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.979> did

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
looks as as far as I could tell it did

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.950 
looks as as far as I could tell it did
feel<00:05:53.610> it<00:05:53.849> in<00:05:54.120> that<00:05:54.320> when<00:05:55.320> I<00:05:55.409> brush<00:05:55.650> my<00:05:55.919> hair

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
feel it in that when I brush my hair

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.230 
feel it in that when I brush my hair
less<00:05:57.960> fell<00:05:58.349> out<00:05:58.530> I<00:05:58.860> notice<00:05:59.490> less<00:05:59.729> was<00:05:59.970> snapping

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
less fell out I notice less was snapping

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.170 
less fell out I notice less was snapping
like<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.870> could<00:06:01.020> see<00:06:01.199> to<00:06:01.440> look<00:06:01.590> at<00:06:01.770> us<00:06:02.180> then

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
like I could see to look at us then

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.360 
like I could see to look at us then
looks<00:06:03.419> much<00:06:03.630> smoother<00:06:04.169> but<00:06:04.740> I'm<00:06:04.860> not<00:06:04.979> sure<00:06:05.190> if

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
looks much smoother but I'm not sure if

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.230 
looks much smoother but I'm not sure if
that<00:06:05.400> was<00:06:05.729> to<00:06:05.909> do<00:06:06.090> with<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.419> protein<00:06:08.240> buildup

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
that was to do with the protein buildup

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.659 
that was to do with the protein buildup
from<00:06:09.599> inside<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.680> goodness<00:06:10.979> coming<00:06:11.190> out<00:06:11.370> or

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
from inside the goodness coming out or

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.610 
from inside the goodness coming out or
if<00:06:11.729> it<00:06:11.849> was<00:06:11.970> just<00:06:12.180> sealing<00:06:12.389> the<00:06:12.690> top<00:06:12.930> but

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
if it was just sealing the top but

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.560 
if it was just sealing the top but
there's<00:06:14.460> a<00:06:14.550> big<00:06:14.699> difference<00:06:14.729> between<00:06:15.090> using

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
there's a big difference between using

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.140 
there's a big difference between using
this<00:06:15.930> and<00:06:16.320> using<00:06:16.680> enough<00:06:16.889> and<00:06:17.099> oil<00:06:17.310> which

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
this and using enough and oil which

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.360 
this and using enough and oil which
definitely<00:06:18.449> definitely<00:06:19.320> is<00:06:19.470> more<00:06:19.979> temporary

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
definitely definitely is more temporary

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.790 
definitely definitely is more temporary
this<00:06:20.699> seemed<00:06:21.150> to<00:06:21.300> work<00:06:21.419> for<00:06:21.690> longer<00:06:22.110> my<00:06:22.620> hair

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800

seemed<00:06:23.659> softer<00:06:24.659> it<00:06:24.870> was<00:06:24.990> easier<00:06:25.320> to<00:06:25.470> manage<00:06:25.650> as

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
seemed softer it was easier to manage as

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:27.499 
seemed softer it was easier to manage as
I<00:06:26.039> said<00:06:26.220> from<00:06:26.310> I<00:06:26.460> was<00:06:26.580> brushing<00:06:26.789> it<00:06:27.090> it<00:06:27.210> seemed

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
I said from I was brushing it it seemed

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:31.279 
I said from I was brushing it it seemed
