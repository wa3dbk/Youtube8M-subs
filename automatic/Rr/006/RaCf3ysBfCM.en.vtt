kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.390> class<00:01:09.600> war<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.320> issue<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.740> really<00:01:11.310> do

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
kind of class war but issue I really do

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.929 
kind of class war but issue I really do
I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> matter<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.750> people<00:01:13.939> deciding

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
I think it's a matter of people deciding

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.160 
I think it's a matter of people deciding
that<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:16.140> must<00:01:16.610> eat<00:01:17.720> healthier<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:18.990> can

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that they must eat healthier if they can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.660 
that they must eat healthier if they can
but<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.530> are<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.799> many<00:01:19.979> reasons<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> like

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
but there are so many reasons I like

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.450 
but there are so many reasons I like
junk<00:01:21.000> foods<00:01:21.299> now<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> again<00:01:22.140> gotta<00:01:22.500> gotta<00:01:23.189> be

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
obese I think you know we just need to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.000 
obese I think you know we just need to
be<00:03:09.300> very<00:03:09.570> careful<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.050> don't<00:03:10.080> think<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:10.950> we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
be very careful I don't think that we

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.590 
be very careful I don't think that we
should<00:03:11.040> actually<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.400> taxed<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:11.850> fat<00:03:12.060> people<00:03:12.450> I

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
should actually be taxed in fat people I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.150 
should actually be taxed in fat people I
think<00:03:13.080> we<00:03:13.170> should<00:03:13.200> be<00:03:13.530> much<00:03:13.769> more<00:03:13.950> concerned

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
think we should be much more concerned

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.850 
think we should be much more concerned
about<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.720> kind<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:15.989> health<00:03:16.260> risk<00:03:16.620> and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
about the kind of health risk and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.410 
about the kind of health risk and
therefore<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.280> need<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.090> balance

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
therefore we need to get the balance

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.470 
therefore we need to get the balance
what<00:03:18.870> people<00:03:19.230> do<00:03:19.410> eat<00:03:19.680> well<00:03:20.070> but<00:03:20.880> also<00:03:21.030> we

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
what people do eat well but also we
