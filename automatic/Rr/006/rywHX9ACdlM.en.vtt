00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.760

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.750

 Today tulips have gone but the most 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.590
 such for us was nostalgic here in 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.649

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.539
 there is three years old 4 so I remember this tablet 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.210
 Well, the gums in Moscow in Russian 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:42.549
 it was like a thought 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:45.219
 still valid thought actually there 

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:49.329
 a joke when gas and rain saw such 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 nameplate and we did not go on the lawn 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:58.739
 moving so the very beginning really 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 our way to the botanical garden 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.580
 greenhouses 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.440
 literally grow banal slightly 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.740
 exotic 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.509

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.509
