00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.379
 order dear friends and warmly 

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:06.689
 Welcome back to Navteq I want it 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.520
 again from new york and us 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.070
 We are not busy here today 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:16.169
 in this screenshot can recognize with 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.140
 ios 7.1 beta 3 apple has the new beta 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:23.279
 update cut out it weighs how to do it 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.630
 nice says 100 and 16 mb and who is 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.939
 no longer can remember all I have indeed 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.480
 with the beta 2 had some problems 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.250
 after the ju the attitudes of 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.900
 Apple seemingly revised 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.310
 i had to rebuild my iphone 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.710
 That's why I can help you now 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.810
 unfortunately only with a few screenshots 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940
 from a friend met here 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.780
 I have to help but I have 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 made me still little crafty 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.370
 What's new, what's up for you? 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.900
 in about 2 200 months I think yes 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 come out the final version 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.680
 somewhere direction mid-March and yes it 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.000
 a lot has happened 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.400
 for example, if you like the whole 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 downloaded here we have the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.789
 new icons for facetime imessage and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 phone what so unplanned well 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.009
 not much except that she how should I 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 say a nuance have become darker 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.909
 At least I think in this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.490
 close-up quite well to be in any 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.560
 otherwise we'll see 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.299
 here for example the two keyboards 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.009
 Side by side there it looks now 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.549
 a little bit like apple has one 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.109
 generally a little thicker again or 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.749
 a slightly thicker font fund 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.819
 that was introduced , for example 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.319
 the tools in previous betas 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.179
 or generally in 17 I think so 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:40.679
 already quite feasible kept the beta 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:44.159
 1, however, we must be so 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.979
 at least the beta 3 was probably from the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.889
 option for a permanent darker 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 keyboard also I had a beta 1 

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.399
 briefly presented for the time being again 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.520
 say goodbye because she is in beta 3 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.850
 no longer available otherwise we have 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.700
 here are the new calls draw the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.439
 new phone app has a bit more 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.299
 more similar music hall somehow with 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.170
 So windows 8 so even with it 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.080
 With 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.849
 windows phone os even if i use it 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.270
 So far, we had little to do 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.560
 finally round signs for more exact 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.930
 accept the little ones or 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.569
 reject a call and then too 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.770
 remind me and message quite simple 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.160
 I honestly like that 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.170
 better than these earlier in big two 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.720
 buttons we can see that in too 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.850
 several other moments or 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.160
 situations such as here have 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.319
 We now have the actual phone app 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.900
 times with the numeric keypad there we see 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.480
 so left the old state with 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.810
 the risk button for whatever reason 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.019
 and right then the rounded phone 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.120
 button everything will be back and schwupps 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.239
 and here we also see a round 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.430
 cancel button for the sounds out 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.830
 screen and above I actually think 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.140
 visually pretty made slide to on 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 even now in a rounded version 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.060
 So everything with a circular button 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.170
 otherwise we have the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.840
 Shuffle and repeat so well mix and 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.840
 or mix and repeat button in 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.810
 the ipod app now right here something 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.760
 more prominently highlighted beautifully at this time 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.220
 red background with white letters 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.290
 I do not like it better, which I always do not like 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.260
 so fully understand is the create button 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.940
 because well known when we press on it 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.799
 So in Germany than you just 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.959
 new and the only thing you can do there 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.250
 can make a genius list why 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.810
 you do not just enjoy it 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.609
 written or as formerly what I did 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.010
 still very vividly thought that 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.780
 as on the mac, yes, still existing 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.579
 I would have left jeans a symbol 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.940
 a little bit of katz and the like saved 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.850
 but no matter and last but not least we have 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.680
 yet here is a wallpaper preview the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.730
 From now following also holds 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.140
 I already have a video about that 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.180
 now you will have one 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.190
 a bit easier that is 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.100
 switch off the so-called parallax 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.690
 effects is down here is where motion 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.000
 that is when you enter the beta 3 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.470
 you can fix new wallpaper 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.380
 directly when setting on this 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.840
 button down there if you want the 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.569
 parallax effect to have or just 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.489
 not that in my eyes on everyone 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.979
 very well done and with it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.850
 apart from the usual bugfixes and 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.190
 something similar 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.870
 already in the text at the beginning probably 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.060
 can read briefly even if that only 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.950
 a small cutout was should 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.430
 again from the beta 3 been 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.290
 his 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.600
 here he comes into bugfixes and 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.610
 improvements as usual for everything 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.840
 others just clicked her could now 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.150
 Of course, but not easy here 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.790
 on this nice link here developer 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.990
 apple.com a 7 release notes will be there 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.490
 maybe a little more 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.590
 I also have a few small things 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.590
 did not mention and well as I said 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.980
 we expect the final version somewhere 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.930
 in the direction of march and stay until then 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.820
 I in any form that was now 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.070
 already the third fundamentally different 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.750
 video of the third beta of course for 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.410
 you on the ball like the beta 1 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.000
 promised 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.460
 I hope you like the video though 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.490
 yes just let a thumb after 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.800
 up there or maybe even an abo 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 I would definitely be happy and 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.380
 See you at the next best 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.260
 opportunity again if it means again 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.300
 nerd attack body talk with me 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.770
 jens and thanks for watching 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.770
