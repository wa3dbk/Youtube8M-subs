00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.809
 pros so today I'm happy 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.960
 because I received my storage case 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.520
 for props and magot pro because 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.220
 that otherwise I do not know how one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.070
 was leading because if I'm in a trance at 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.269
 which all put in bulk 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.010
 that's better it's gide series 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:33.660
 it's more screen so on the front 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:39.270
 there are marked sp poor kais with a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.809
 camera so there's a drawing and the 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.420
 eco pro edition 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.239
 this is the closure in all so the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.090
 briefcase did about 35 meters from 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:57.149
 long after 6 cm wide 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.440
 we see to show from the inside in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.450
 this case management I like my 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.250
 camera a little the purpose of this manna is 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:12.470
 so there on the side there is the adapter 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.470
 micro sd to connect to a computer 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:22.619
 so there is so super bike with a the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.619
 articulated arm expected since it was 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:30.990
 tight so there is an articulated arm 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.159
 with the handlebar support and the one that can 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 to put oneself like that on the stage 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.650
 lastly especially the tubes what but they 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.570
 call it support donation and are cgc 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:47.070
 my scooter on my bike it works 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 so here is the gemmi the little accessory 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 locking law that's small 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.850
 accessory you want I want to see 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.850
 show how it works 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.670
 so we have the little accessory so the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.670
 frontal headband 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.700
 here is a basic accessory 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 many people 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.800
 that I will soon have I will stay 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.480
 there the handle that goes in the water is a 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.519
 first copl or something like that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.750
 and when you're here I go back to it 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.250
 the surface and its fleet 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.380
 so what is good and I'm going 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.769
 maybe take me the blur at it back 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.870
 door 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:31.720
 I think it's called this way 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.280
 small orange foam 10 may bad on well 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.730
 exit had come out well what's this 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:41.680
 good enough for that not move too much who gets 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.019
 put on a door like this here that is 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 well it's that once the camera 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.790
 is in the foam is that it moves 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.069
 not too much so there was a little trickle 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.510
 it looks like they transport but no 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:59.290
 in fact no so I put down the cable 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:05.470
 of gopro connection for my camera 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:09.099
 my camera the computer the door 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:13.630
 skeleton we see the key too much I think 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:18.780
 showed you our hands of man 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:24.010
 boxing of macau pro so the gemmi 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.019
 the flat adhesive and let go we'll jump 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.299
 curved bank adhesive 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.190
 that's what I put so I'm going 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.100
 soon sim buy small treats 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.410
 or one or two small batteries 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.780
 here it is for the lcd screen the other 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.940
 I find that stuff is good tightens 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.489
 input you can store accessories 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.569
 donations did not make me for that but 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.540
 good it's okay 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:49.299
 forty years that lcd screen me I 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.030
 take I'll use it no longer knows if 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.000
 you want to use it as a camera like 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.090
 that replacing a camera 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.049
 but less is more for deigned me 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.940
 ski and all so the lcd screen that 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.380
 not serve 3 much so if you 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.040
 want me to show you what is this 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.600
 little lock accessory 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.630
 is called a little like that so 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:19.870
 I like going out my go pro is this what 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:28.390
 magot projects put the little clip what 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:36.430
 go on the adhesives i try to saleh 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:39.930
 had to avoid that here is the little 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.030
 delivers his message on an adhesive 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.770
 so here it is but it is not good 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.220
 clip that's what sent a little 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:05:00.550
 edge for well forced and after but no 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:05:04.650
 without care so that's how it goes and 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:08.190
 the heavens the adhesive 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.080
 so here it is put on the adhesive 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.080
 who gets behind that is the wind and 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.590
 marquette to the pros and behind there 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.880
 marked that's where it's 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.810
 are the little branches of glyphs so 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:33.100
 but the crisis and we pass the screw 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:36.720
 in this way men pass the 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.070
 screw but the gopro is we are screwed 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.440
 jap notice and it does not serve much 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.340
 like that if we unscrew down life 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:49.150
 holds the clip he can not open 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.250
 but suddenly there the branches of the clip that 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.010
 can not move that quickly 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.170
 can the vibrations if the release 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.560
 when you ski or things like 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.840
 that when you stick me and the vibrations 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.880
 and it prevents vibration strength of the room 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.950
 clips and the camera drops that high of 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.020
 waste and then you put your camera 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.780
 get your hands on the adhesive and you 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.430
 find more your camera that it would be 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.680
 annoying anyway so that's for 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.270
