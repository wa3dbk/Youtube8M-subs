00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.550 
especially a guy that he obviously has a
rapport<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.180> an<00:03:18.329> Aaron<00:03:18.600> Rodgers<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:19.350> again

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
rapport with an Aaron Rodgers but again

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.150 
rapport with an Aaron Rodgers but again
so<00:03:19.920> unlike<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.430> Packers<00:03:21.389> to<00:03:22.380> spend<00:03:22.709> that<00:03:22.920> kind

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
so unlike the Packers to spend that kind

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.250 
so unlike the Packers to spend that kind
of<00:03:23.250> money<00:03:23.310> on<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:23.730> free<00:03:24.030> agent<00:03:24.420> we'll<00:03:24.840> see<00:03:25.109> but

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
of money on a free agent we'll see but

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.610 
of money on a free agent we'll see but
that's<00:03:25.380> something<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.799> keep<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.130> mind<00:03:26.389> look

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
that's something to keep in mind look

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.680 
that's something to keep in mind look
the<00:03:28.620> Redskins<00:03:29.130> if<00:03:29.370> he<00:03:30.000> wants<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.329> big<00:03:30.480> deal<00:03:30.660> I
