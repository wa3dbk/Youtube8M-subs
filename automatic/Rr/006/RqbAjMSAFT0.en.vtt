 I 've never sent an old film, but I'm confused even if I'm told about an old one 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.480
 I thought it was a bit slippery yeah 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.509
 Because I thought I might be puzzled , but what is it actually ? 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:36.250
 Because I thought that I might be confused 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:41.250
 Run when there are people who write in comments about the words to the track number and the number of row 0 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:46.890

 Really Is but it is not certain that no news has come to no good but underneath 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.250
 Hmmm what for 5 years 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:24.530
 At that scene over there, his high monologue was good 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.549
 Although it was a long monologue of the first part, it disappeared to the end without getting bored, and such is also great 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.780
 Happy 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:33.720

 Tomorrow is a village because it will be male line 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.280

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:09.210
 I think in various ways 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:11.890
 l After all, I can not bump the theater theory with people who have heard 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.680
 It is the city that after all was said and Tsu not it

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.199
 Already 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.919
 It is true that it is said-the first two generations automatic so 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:44.710

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:09.660
 Even to some people who will write a little Mayuri there was the regrettable 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:14.160
 Of course I 'll accept that too 22 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.940
 It seems that I did n't ask for that and there 's one that's kind of blcd 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.470
 Was one fan 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.260
 Since there is also a place where I g I do not just luck with real others are asking that their 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:27.570
 While putting out 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:29.430
 So I'm the same, but it's kinda cad I have a play together 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:34.650
 Some have returned to a degree 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:40.830

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:43.080

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.830
 It is still less I bl experience because life is you play study much because it is well studying 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:02.910
 I There is also a base running 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:05.560

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:17.090
 Real to real route min 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:23.610
 Oh, I know that I have heard about 18 years old works 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:27.289
 The guy who says that woman is not so realistic after all 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:30.949
 If it is to have been done to that kind of N 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:36.949
 Apart from real to such do Oh Well and Thats not the i5 like this in 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:37.849
 There is a case where it is hoped that there is a gum that is even more likely to be a Revol eyes 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:43.159
 Say is 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:45.820

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:54.060
 It is said that there is demand in the way of play 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:57.830
 I think women's guys are like that, maybe it's something like that 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:08:03.190
 Because a professional is to meet demand 

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:03.190
