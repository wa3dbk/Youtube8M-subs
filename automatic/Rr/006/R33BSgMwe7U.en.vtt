00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:07.800
In this video, we're going to be looking at how to simulate the look of a vibrating speaker diaphragm by using Motion FX inside Houdini!

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.266
Let's double-click to go inside.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.532
And let's select the inner faces here.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:18.466
Just click on the Lasso tool and SHIFT-click and drag to select the faces inside.

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.266
We'll go to the Deform tab and click on Lattice.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.766
You can see that our face selection has changed to points. Just hit the ENTER key.

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:32.232
And there's our lattice! Zoom in and hit the W key.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:36.832
We'll just optimize the lattice division to what we need for this shape.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.566
and go back to shaded view.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.066
In the lattice_bbox_xform node,

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:47.966
if we change the values in the Translate X field, we can mimic the look of the speaker diaphragm vibrating.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:52.532
Just pull this out so we can see the menu.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.699
and we'll put down a Motion FX Wave.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:59.633
Here we get this pop-up window, which gives us visual feedback of the Motion FX Wave,

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.433
as well as parameters to tweak the look of it.

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.766
Just turn on Realtime Playback, and we'll play it back!

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:11.532
So you can see the speaker is moving according to the sine waveform.

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:15.299
We can also change the waveform type,

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.132
and tweak the period,

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.299
lower the amplitude,

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.999
and make the waveform taper off.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:28.399
OK, let's stop the playback and put there another Motion FX waveform that will give it a more random look.

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.366
This time, let's put there a Motion FX Noise.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.066
We can close this window,

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.432
and double-click on the motionfx node.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.332
Here are the nodes that Motion FX made for us!

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.999
Just pin this down first, and split the screen so we can see the Motion FX tab too.

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:50.299
So here is the Motion FX wave that we made first.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.500
And this one is the Motion FX noise.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.866
The noise_add1 node just combines them together.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:59.733
So even though we have both the wave1 and noise1 nodes selected,

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:06.433
we are only seeing the combined waveform of both because our display flag is on the noise_add1 node.

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:09.966
That said, we can set the display flag to multiple nodes here.

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:12.932
Hold down SHIFT and left-mouse button click.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:15.633
And now we can see them too.

00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:21.432
The colours are kind of similar, so let's pick some other ones to differentiate between the 3.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.566
So in the noise_add1 node, we can specify how we want the waveforms in CHOPS to be combined.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:36.233
CHOPS by the way, are the lines we see here. Let's play it back under the Add operation.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.233
And if we change it to Average, the waveform shape updates accordingly.

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:49.566
OK - it's a little tricky with 3 waveforms there so let's just put visibility back to the noise_add1 node.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.133
And let's say that we want to have an actual audio file to drive the motion of the lattice. We can do that too!

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:59.933
Let's delete these guys and put down a file node...

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:08.432
And if you're wondering, this node that we kept here is the one that will connect to the Translate X parameter, so we'll leave it be.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.166
Put there an audio file.

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.899
I found this one off the internet, but feel free to use your own track!

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:19.299
Now we'll add back a math node, which was what that noise_add1 node was earlier.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.999
Let's wire them up!

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:25.632
Put the visibility flag on it.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:28.299
And click on the Audio Panel button.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.800
Go to the Scrub tab, and you'll notice that our CHOP field is empty.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.833
We will need to put down an audio flag, so that Houdini will know to pull our audio file in.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:38.966
There it is!

00:03:38.966 --> 00:03:42.166
So now we need to adjust the timeline to fit the length of the audio.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.666
Just zoom in and click towards the end of the waveform.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.199
And there's our magic number!

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.466
Let's just put down 512 so we don't get a pause when it loops.

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:55.132
And we need to use "Maintain realtime playback, possibly skipping frames" option.

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:57.633
Otherwise, our audio will play back choppy.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:03:59.532
And play it back!

00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:03.166
So we only got the left channel of the audio.

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:08.466
We need to use the Add operation in Combine CHOPS to get both channels.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:15.032
Let's go out of Motion FX and just put there as subdivision node on the speaker geo.

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:19.266
Just put it up one more level,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.033
and move the display flag down to it...

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:25.932
Hit SPACEBAR+B to maximize the scene view...

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.533
And play it back!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.266
But nothing is happening!

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:33.999
Hit SPACEBAR+B to get back our panels and let's have a look.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.133
Double-click on the motionfx node, and there's our problem!

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:42.233
We don't have the export flag assigned. So no data is going out to drive our lattice!

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:44.499
Let's give it a try now...

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.733
And that's Motion FX inside Houdini!
