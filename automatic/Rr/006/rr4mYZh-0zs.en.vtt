00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:10.380
 so hello everyone together 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.849
 Today I show you how you an ipad 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.920
 make stylus pen out of whole 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:25.490
 simple things very simple with her 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:31.099
 then write on your ipad so 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:41.059
 quite simply it consists of five things 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:47.039
 elements and indeed a scissors to polish 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 tesafilm a ballpoint pen of your choice 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.860
 like you want a pen and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 a sponge, preferably a scrape 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.820
 few somehow cut off like that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.210
 simply piece of a weak 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.030
 isolated 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.400
 wet and with a cloth 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.260
 a sheet of paper so kitchen paper 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 I bluntly say it like that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:26.930
 dry is not too dry like that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:30.299
 that you can see that so that you can do it 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:39.720
 you can not see any other 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:46.409
 pen so you can see for example you 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.930
 so you can paint and it is whole 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.759
 easy to do 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.119
 Of course, the end result 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:57.619
 end result not a perfect stylus 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.689
 is like bamboo from wacom bamboo or 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:05.280
 other things also over 20 30 euro 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.350
 But often it is enough 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.110
 First of all I would like to prevent 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.500
 Let's cut a few strips 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.500
 tesafilm attach down here 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.690
 find the place 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.890
 well thus also reap 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:31.540
 then next here at this 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.420
 Ballpoint pen I'll record at the back 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.440
 is intering out 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.450
 that's it for now 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.950
 next he should actually 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 Just take this sponge here 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:51.070
 stuck in the back as you want 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.620
 I always prefer that's the top 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.930
 So know as the name implies 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:03.489
 should be pointed because I have it 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:10.620
 I do not like it when it's too fat 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.620
 Look, it should work 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:21.820
 learn again so now you see it is 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.900
 here in the front as it still manage 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.920
 is your thing 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.420
 I'll try something then that's one 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.269
 looks kind of professional is 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.510
 like a real finished lace this 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.690
 like these black plastic tips 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.110
 it looks quite good that way 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:46.390
 it looks like a real point 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:49.269
 So next I'll say it like that 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.370
 I have now swam a short piece 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.530
 that's why aluminum foil takes over 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.950
 electrical conductivity 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.810
 make 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.360
 the by the tension of mine 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.880
 finger through the aluminum foil here 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.160
 at the top of not something damp 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.410
 let black always pass on 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.560
 will then what then works 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.920
 there sensor and even if you are a little bit 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.600
 sponge oblong makes whole left 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.820
 peacefully filled the tube of the tube 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.599
 so to speak or something or where 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.900
 hold it 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:24.320
 then you need no alufolie what 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.000
 actually better is me 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.260
 Schlumberger did not think about it 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.180
 just so I take a piece 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.670
 Just cut off aluminum foil 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:44.440
 mostly no matter 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:50.860
 so also to make as straight then 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:53.750
 just wrap around like that 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.770
 if possible it should be the sponge 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.570
 touch 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.520
 but if not now is not 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:06.730
 develop weltuntergang so 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.830
 Zack whole develops now you see 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:14.600
 here forward he is already tesafilm 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:19.070
 we just do it 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:21.310
 somewhere so and now it would have to 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:25.070
 actually already work 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.010
 So I'll just show you the one 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.770
 sponge pure aluminum foil around so that 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.720
 something still touches the sponge and then 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.520
 that was it already and 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.970
 then I'll show you now there can be 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:45.500
 see 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:46.970
 so it says clean and that works 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:51.500
 It was then already in a minute 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:57.710
 has you a stylus with her everything 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:59.270
 possible use as natural 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.710
 as I said does not look very nice 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.150
 now not very high quality 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.010
 I say but I fulfilled it 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:14.240
 its purpose is improvisation technical 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:17.200
 I like it very much if it stops 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.120
 you just have to work 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:25.250
 then moisten the top something again then 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:29.330
 is it going again and that's it 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:32.330
 ipad or iphone stylus in a minute 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.740
 thank you and create it until next time 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.449
 Write comments what he still knows 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.059
 want 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.059
 and what you think you are not
