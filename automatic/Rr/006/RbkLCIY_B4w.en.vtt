00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.150
 this shrub appeared thanks 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 crossing black currant and 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.130
 gooseberry relation to the plant which 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.890
 previously did not exist in nature very 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.260
 different ones praise him others 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 oppose such experiments 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.119
 to have your own opinion about it 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.939
 shrubs we offer to grow it 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.780
 yourself on the site today in a rubric of 600 OK 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.520
 it's about hedgehogs 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.800
 Yoshta is the result of many years of work 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.690
 several generations of breeders 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.250
 working on crossing black 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.290
 currants and gooseberries 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.750
 the main task that stood before 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.600
 scientists increase yield and size 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.840
 currant berries and at the same time get rid of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.540
 gooseberry spines besides yoshta 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.239
 surpassed some parameters 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.510
 parents so she is less affected 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.190
 diseases and pests and and does not affect 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.370
 is a fungal disease like 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.430
 anthracnose bud mite terry and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.410
 even for yoshta bush looks much 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.810
 more impressive than her parents 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.810
 the crown of an adult plant can reach 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.300
 two and a half meters in diameter is not 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.470
 let's Russia high 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.530
 lateral branches should be cut annually 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.030
 in the spring of 30-40 centimeters 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 then side shoots will appear and that too 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.470
 was to promote 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.790
 yoshta does not yield 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.799
 as many shoots as currant and 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.960
 therefore, it takes less than an hour 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.969
 trim it too dignity shrub 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.890
 as for yields its first 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.219
 berries and what gives three years after 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.240
 planting from one bush can be collected 5-6 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.539
 kilograms of berries 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.909
 and in the good years, and even more but there 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.670
 one little secret if you want 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.659
 increase yields Jost plant 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.500
 near gooseberry and currants thorens her 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.619
 parents 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.990
 this family culture and stars and brew 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.750
 jam jam and jam compotes 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.300
 but most useful on fresh berries 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.170
 contain vitamins c and b as well as a number 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.570
 trace elements potassium iron j have to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.060
 Eat less than vitamin C 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.800
 black currant but much more than 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.870
 gooseberry 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.840
 so I take that well for 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.900
 improve immunity, it is well displays 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.190
 toxins and heavy metal salts with 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.560
 improves digestion and 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.450
 cardiovascular system 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.849
 propagated and so here as well as 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.569
 currant lignified cuttings and 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.910
 layering 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.310
 or by dividing the bush a little from 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.099
 relatives are different and care for it 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.120
 shrub however grow it even 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:58.680
 a little easier because he rarely gets sick 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.220
 yoshta is moisture-loving me and therefore when 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.459
 bush set to grow evolving 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.209
 water 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:14.110
 do not spare the water early in the spring a bunch of times 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.519
 treat for fungal diseases then 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.160
 there can be sprayed 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.880
 or blue vitriol copper field 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.390
 vitriol 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.849
 And one more item in the piggy bank of merits 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.340
 you eat it can be used in 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.290
 as a beautiful hedge 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.019
 Yes, and just for landscaping any 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.720
 plot and and bushes grow great yes and not 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.370
 require special care today is all 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.040
 what we wanted to tell you 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.269
 good luck to you in all matters and to new 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.269
 meetings in category 6 acres
