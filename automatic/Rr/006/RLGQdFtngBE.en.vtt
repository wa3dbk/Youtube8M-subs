 my business and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.450
 the people who sound like buying it now 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.170
 just as enough we already had 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.849

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.849

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.090
 and then good, sorry, we put the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.090
 refrigerator so it stays cool and does not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.409
 be damaged not so fast and if the client 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.349
 like does not give to try so that the 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.879
 basic guarapita express good 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.390
 client who decides if it was good 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:02.470
 it went wrong and I started I tell him that if 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.450
 It is bad that I do not pay no 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.090
 they are testing nothing bad if not everything is 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.420

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.829
