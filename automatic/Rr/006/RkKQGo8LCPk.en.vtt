00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Cool!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How can this guy be so cool? Let's meet autumn guy -- Lee Min Ho.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Hello. Nice to meet you!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I have been resting and filming CFs
[How have you been this while?]

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Also... I am preparing for my next project
[How have you been this while?]

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
LMH who's changed into an autumn guy is showing his mature charisma. Even the checkered fashion looks good on him.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
[The checkered pattern suits you well]

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
actually i don't wear this checkered style often

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
what style do you usually wear?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I usually sport a simple style with monotone colors e.g. black, white and grey

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You like wearing plain-color, right?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
yes, so I tend to wear more unique shoes

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
According to you,'the reason why I'm chosen as a clothing model' is... I will give you 3 options, pls choose 1.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
(1) becoz i'm handsome

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(2) i'm handsome and i'm tall

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(3) any clothes look good on me

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
ok, choose one among the 3

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I must choose one amongst them?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
yes you have to choose from among them

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I want to become choice 3

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
[handsome]

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
[tall]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
any kinda clothes suit him well

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[the bubble says "as expected, i'm perfect..."]

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Choice 3 is correct when it comes to LMH

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I heard something interesting...recently there's this thing where you can find out which entertainer you resemble..
[Shindong (from SUJU) looks similar to LMH]

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Ahh... i saw that report

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
oh you saw it?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
[Shindong, whose face looks like LMH: "i'm sorry".]

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I thought it was interesting and wondered why he felt apologetic about it.
[thoughts when seeing the report]

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
No, Shindong is 100% similar to LMH (she's pulling a prank on LMH)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
100%?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Honest talk. Yes or No]

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I've prepared a special Honest Talk (yes or no) session for you

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I've had a passionate love relationship after my debut

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
yes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[After BOF?] 
No

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
If i am born again, I want the same face I have now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Yes

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
if i love that person, it doesn't matter if she's 10 years older than me

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Yes

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
[I've had a passionate love relationship after my debut]

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Actually I debuted when i was 20 years old.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Right, you made your debut early.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
it's before BOF?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Yes, before BOF

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
she's an entertainer?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
not an entertainer

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.000
not an entertainer? right now she has activities in the entertainment circle?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.500
No

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500
No?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.000
You are probing more and more.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
SW: You're 24 now.
MH: yes

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[if i love that person, it doesn't matter if she's 10 years older than me]

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So if she's 34 it's also ok?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.500
yes it is

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.000
SW: really?
MH: yes

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in the case that the person is 34 years old, are you going to call her nuna or by her name?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
perhaps creating a nickname and calling her that way

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
actually you have worked with many actresses

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
LMH who has been paired with many representative beautiful actresses in different projects

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
amongst them, we cannot leave out Lee Min Jung

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Actually when Lee Min Jung was interviewed not long ago

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.500
LMJ was asked to choose between Lee Min Ho and Jung Kyung Ho

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.000
she chose Jung Kyung Ho

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
[Lee Min Jung who chose Jung Kyung Ho as her ideal type]

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
[Concerning Lee Min Jung's choice.]

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
She said i was her ideal type when she was filming BOF. But the moment she changed projects, Jung Kyung Ho became her ideal type.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Then, for you..

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.500
As for me, when i was filming BOF, Goo Hye Sun was my ideal type. I don't know, I didn't even think about Min Jung nuna as my ideal type.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.500
I'm sorry (to Lee Min Jung)

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.000
(Ha Jae Kyung's excerpt from BOF): You think everything can be solved by being sorry? 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.500
[It's a joke, Min Jung-sshi]

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Wish you not to catch a cold, not to be too sensitive to fall, for thsoe who are in love, keep lovely relationship. Thank you."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Min Ho-sshi, we'll meet you again when there's good news.
