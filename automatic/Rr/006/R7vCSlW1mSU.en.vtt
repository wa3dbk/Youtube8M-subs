00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.439
 hello everyone again from mockups today we 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.359
 talking about the chaos of the mountains and the front to 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.019
 regular bosses with warlords of test 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 draenor so 5 clan foundry boss 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.379
 black mountains rushed in front of us two 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:44.219
 brother-acrobat with one and CAT mechanic 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.770
 The battle takes place in a clearing where there are such 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.180
 here are the conveyor lines 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.219
 two bosses are found periodically 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.309
 at the same time on the conveyor sometimes one of 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.800
 them jump out of bounds 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:59.670
 throws all sorts of bekki or charges and then 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.019
 on someone and hangs a debuff 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 which increases physical damage 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.890
 Damage periodically rarely likely 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.270
 starts moving on these sin 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560
 pizza fly here 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.909
 actually the damage from these pizzas 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.610
 weighty enough 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:27.630
 but under saves you can survive to what 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.790
 reduced all the boss we run jump 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.770
 by the way these plates are not just chaotic 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.119
 way there are holes in them 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.860
 appears strictly in a certain order 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.700
 The first wave of these here are the enemy 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.100
 knitting needles with us in some such thing to us 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.360
 okay and then 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.310
 holes appear strictly in the neighboring 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.100
 conveyor lines 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.159
 Boss accumulates stew exactly on so much 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.979
 how much losing hp and also gradually 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.590
 saves a buff that increases 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.950
 his damage in three minutes we still INDICATES 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 about ten percent except everything 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.879
 other holes and periodically 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.190
 a debuff is applied which causes 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.680
 critical damage at us it was from 50 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.140
 thousand seconds 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.470
 the next phase we have is this 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.989
 here 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.260
 Hammers That is, there are such 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:30.260
 set fire and fall on top of them 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.700
 such presses own press memory 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.620
 I began to fall for what and 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.110
 regularities appear these press 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.440
 it is in these cells to us explicitly 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.010
 it was not possible to find out but also the time of the test 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.569
 it was only one and a half hours 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.790
 nevertheless, during this time we managed 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.069
 practically to beat the boss left to my 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.129
 at the last trophy 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.780
 about five million hp that is 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.510
 a little bit more careful 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.170
 more organized in general, he would kill 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.390
 even on the test as it will be in real 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.769
 mastering is difficult to say so far 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.769
 since it is still not terribly 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.280
 balanced both damage and mechanics 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.709
 and so after the press phase we again 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.500
 we return to the ordinary phase 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.540
 tanking and ok in dps but left 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.340
 difficulties for our raid was of course 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.120
 no dohe we have very few heals was on 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.040
 this test 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.200
 well and sad to be great again 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.480
 who have to run off from the boss 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.790
 to catch the extra stacks of the chopped 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 spine seemed to me this boss 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.200
 much easier than a gift the sovereign could 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.139
 beasts or just fiery which 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.549
 The list is earlier but now difficult 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.889
 say for sure which one 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.230
 okay will these boss follow in the raid 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.299
 it is quite possible that the next will be 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.730
 completely different 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.709
 Well , I have this all thanks to all 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.680

 warlords of draenor but for now you can

 watch out how our item ended 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.010
 where we left very, very little 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.049
 health boss and after which temporarily 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.010
