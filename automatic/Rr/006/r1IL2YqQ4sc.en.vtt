00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.070 

let's<00:00:01.170> take<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.410> look<00:00:01.620> at<00:00:02.600> one<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.780> spark

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
let's take a look at one of the spark

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:14.950 
let's take a look at one of the spark
plugs<00:00:07.370> I've<00:00:08.370> been<00:00:08.519> taking<00:00:08.849> these<00:00:08.940> out<00:00:09.120> yet<00:00:09.389> so

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.000 

the<00:00:15.960> interesting<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.529> see<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.859> looks

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
the interesting to see what it looks

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:28.720 
the interesting to see what it looks
like<00:00:18.770> all<00:00:19.770> right<00:00:19.980> let's<00:00:20.330> take<00:00:21.330> that

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.260 

a<00:00:28.760> little<00:00:29.449> white<00:00:29.660> on<00:00:29.689> top<00:00:33.370> it's<00:00:34.370> doesn't

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
a little white on top it's doesn't

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.140 
a little white on top it's doesn't
actually<00:00:35.570> look<00:00:35.900> bad<00:00:36.170> at<00:00:36.350> all<00:00:36.470> that's<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.160> I<00:00:37.460> got

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
actually look bad at all that's a I got

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.850 
actually look bad at all that's a I got
a<00:00:38.210> little<00:00:38.360> carb<00:00:38.660> in<00:00:38.840> there<00:00:39.020> a<00:00:39.170> lot<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.440> carbon

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
a little carb in there a lot of carbon

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.960 
a little carb in there a lot of carbon
but<00:00:42.910> all<00:00:43.910> in<00:00:44.120> all<00:00:44.440> that<00:00:45.440> doesn't<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:46.280> was<00:00:46.550> it

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
but all in all that doesn't it was it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.470 
but all in all that doesn't it was it
was<00:00:47.150> running<00:00:47.449> really<00:00:47.809> rich<00:00:48.580> so<00:00:49.580> I<00:00:49.970> kind<00:00:50.420> of

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
was running really rich so I kind of

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.650 
was running really rich so I kind of
expected<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.110> see<00:00:51.410> that<00:00:52.269> so<00:00:53.269> that's<00:00:53.420> that's

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
expected to see that so that's that's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.509 
expected to see that so that's that's
not<00:00:53.870> too<00:00:54.050> bad<00:00:54.199> I'll<00:00:54.739> pull<00:00:54.980> out<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.129> other<00:00:55.339> one

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
not too bad I'll pull out the other one

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.220 
not too bad I'll pull out the other one
let's<00:00:55.699> see<00:00:55.850> what<00:00:55.970> that<00:00:56.000> one<00:00:56.180> looks<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.480> it's

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
let's see what that one looks like it's

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.540 
let's see what that one looks like it's
actually<00:00:57.350> one<00:00:57.680> of<00:00:57.739> my<00:00:57.800> putting<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.190> back<00:00:58.309> in

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
actually one of my putting it back in

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.990 
actually one of my putting it back in
for<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:58.970> tip<00:00:59.150> ahead<00:00:59.420> oh<00:01:00.579> all<00:01:01.579> right<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:01.910> that's

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
for the tip ahead oh all right so that's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:43.139 
for the tip ahead oh all right so that's
one<00:01:36.940> that's<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.090> same<00:01:39.160> black<00:01:40.160> and<00:01:40.970> not<00:01:41.660> as

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
one that's the same black and not as

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.719 
one that's the same black and not as
carbon<00:01:44.149> but<00:01:44.739> that's<00:01:45.739> just<00:01:45.920> from<00:01:46.160> running<00:01:46.310> rich

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
carbon but that's just from running rich

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.559 
carbon but that's just from running rich
I<00:01:47.649> don't<00:01:48.649> yeah<00:01:49.190> it's<00:01:49.399> all<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:49.849> just<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.420> it's

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
I don't yeah it's all it's just and it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.609 
I don't yeah it's all it's just and it's
wet<00:01:50.780> carbon<00:01:51.259> -<00:01:51.470> it's<00:01:51.679> not<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:55.580> comes<00:01:55.819> right<00:01:55.970> off

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
wet carbon - it's not it comes right off

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.240 
wet carbon - it's not it comes right off
so<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.649> think<00:01:57.770> that's<00:01:58.099> just<00:01:58.190> from<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.890> engine

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
so I think that's just from the engine

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.089 
so I think that's just from the engine
is<00:02:01.429> was<00:02:01.849> pretty<00:02:02.000> much<00:02:02.209> I<00:02:02.360> think<00:02:02.420> abused<00:02:03.349> it<00:02:03.830> was

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
is was pretty much I think abused it was

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.430 
is was pretty much I think abused it was
everything<00:02:04.580> was<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.539> air<00:02:05.750> cleaner<00:02:06.140> was

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
everything was the air cleaner was

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.910 
everything was the air cleaner was
packed<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:09.380> wasn't<00:02:09.649> breathing

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
packed and it just wasn't breathing

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.500 
packed and it just wasn't breathing
right<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.849> it<00:02:11.000> was<00:02:11.090> probably<00:02:11.590> burning<00:02:13.510> burning

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
right so it was probably burning burning

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.400 
right so it was probably burning burning
oil<00:02:14.780> but<00:02:15.140> see<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:16.400> plug<00:02:17.410> this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
oil but see that this this plug this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.059 
oil but see that this this plug this
plug<00:02:18.739> isn't<00:02:18.950> really<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.520> bad<00:02:19.730> shape<00:02:19.790> at<00:02:20.300> all

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
plug isn't really in bad shape at all

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.660 
plug isn't really in bad shape at all
actually<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.879> mean<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.270> think<00:02:24.129> these<00:02:25.129> plugs

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
actually this I mean I think these plugs

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.559 
actually this I mean I think these plugs
are<00:02:25.819> part<00:02:26.060> we're<00:02:26.209> probably<00:02:26.420> relatively<00:02:27.050> new<00:02:27.410> I

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
are part we're probably relatively new I

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.300 
are part we're probably relatively new I
bet<00:02:29.569> they<00:02:29.720> were<00:02:29.830> because<00:02:30.830> they're<00:02:30.980> in<00:02:31.069> really

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
bet they were because they're in really

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.430 
bet they were because they're in really
good<00:02:31.459> shape<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:32.720> might<00:02:32.900> even<00:02:33.050> be<00:02:33.230> able<00:02:33.379> to

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
good shape so I might even be able to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.259 
good shape so I might even be able to
reuse<00:02:33.650> these<00:02:34.870> cuz<00:02:35.870> they're<00:02:36.080> they're<00:02:36.379> clearly

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
reuse these cuz they're they're clearly

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.580 
reuse these cuz they're they're clearly
they're<00:02:38.269> not<00:02:39.159> they<00:02:40.159> clean<00:02:40.400> right<00:02:40.670> up

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
they're not they clean right up

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.280 
they're not they clean right up
and<00:02:41.680> clean<00:02:42.250> right<00:02:42.459> down<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:43.050> down<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
and clean right down to the down to the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.620 
and clean right down to the down to the
silver<00:02:44.739> so<00:02:45.069> they're<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.970> good<00:02:46.120> shape<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:48.630> I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
silver so they're in good shape so I

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.720 
silver so they're in good shape so I
taught<00:02:49.930> into<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.599> 520<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:54.099> here's<00:02:54.489> what<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
taught into the 520 and here's what the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.940 
taught into the 520 and here's what the
valves<00:02:55.030> look<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.450> I've<00:02:56.440> already<00:02:56.590> done<00:02:56.920> a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
valves look like I've already done a

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.250 
valves look like I've already done a
valve<00:02:57.250> job<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.599> and<00:02:59.610> did<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:01.260> this

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
valve job on it and did that this

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.210 
valve job on it and did that this
morning<00:03:02.319> before<00:03:03.220> work<00:03:04.290> tore<00:03:05.290> off<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.590> covers

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
morning before work tore off the covers

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.559 
morning before work tore off the covers
the<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:07.290> intake<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.400> if<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.150> remember

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
the the intake that is if I remember

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.990 
the the intake that is if I remember
correctly<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.860> intake<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.519> five<00:03:13.330> thousandths

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
correctly the intake is five thousandths

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.670 
correctly the intake is five thousandths
clearance

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
clearance

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.500 
clearance
that<00:03:17.680> wasn't<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.130> this<00:03:18.519> was<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.850> one<00:03:19.000> okay

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
that wasn't the this was the one okay

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.530 
that wasn't the this was the one okay
must<00:03:19.870> have<00:03:20.019> just<00:03:20.230> done<00:03:20.440> yeah<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.830> was

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
must have just done yeah so that was

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.500 
must have just done yeah so that was
five<00:03:25.540> thousands<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.349> then<00:03:28.650> exhaust<00:03:30.510> that

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
five thousands and then exhaust that

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.770 
five thousands and then exhaust that
clearance<00:03:32.080> here<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:35.790> thirteen<00:03:36.790> thousand<00:03:37.420> but

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
clearance here is thirteen thousand but
