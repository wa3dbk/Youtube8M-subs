00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.172
Now it's too late...

00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:59.351
I can see that we should not be together.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.752
Now it's too late...

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.828
we've come too far 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.927
...and we should not be together.

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:22.443
Destructive, disruptive, not conductive.

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:30.361
Can't you see where we went wrong?

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:38.551
Now it's too late...

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:46.395
I can see that we should not be together.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:26.078

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.277
Take back my heart.

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:33.221

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:41.392
Give back my life.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.946
Give back my heart.

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:48.987
I know we can hold us together.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.465
Enlightening, enlightening...

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:56.717
when we're not fighting,

00:02:56.718 --> 00:02:58.656
we're not fighting.

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:04.672
Can't you see? we should get along.

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:12.739
It's not too late...

00:03:13.071 --> 00:03:20.252
I can see... I know we can hold it together.

00:03:38.523 --> 00:03:45.207
When we get along...

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:49.165
we're really strong.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:53.827
We're really strong.

00:03:54.286 --> 00:04:00.858
When we get along...

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:01.859
we're really strong.

00:04:04.674 --> 00:04:09.325
We're really strong.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:25.141
Conduct yourself.

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:32.318
(Conduct yourself)
When we get along...

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.252
