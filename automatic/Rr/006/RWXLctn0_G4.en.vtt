00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
kind of hard to go through all them but

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.870

usually get right back to you so what I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.690 
usually get right back to you so what I
have<00:01:37.920> right<00:01:38.070> here<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
have right here is kind of like a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.950 
have right here is kind of like a
graphical<00:01:39.210> glitch<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> thought<00:01:39.810> was

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
graphical glitch that I thought was

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.020 
graphical glitch that I thought was
pretty<00:01:40.049> cool<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> sniper<00:01:41.850> rifle

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
pretty cool so we have a sniper rifle

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
pretty cool so we have a sniper rifle
that's<00:01:42.450> got<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> crossbow<00:01:43.350> scope<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
that's got a crossbow scope on it and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.219 
that's got a crossbow scope on it and
what<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:44.939> does<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.420> when<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> go<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> try<00:01:46.079> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
what this does is when you go to try and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
what this does is when you go to try and
scope<00:01:46.560> into<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.159> looks<00:01:47.369> really<00:01:47.549> stupid

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
scope into it it looks really stupid

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
scope into it it looks really stupid
it's<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.360> way<00:01:48.659> low<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> screen<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it's like way low on the screen and you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
it's like way low on the screen and you
can<00:01:49.860> barely<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.399> through<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> scope<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can barely see through the scope so I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.700 
can barely see through the scope so I
guess<00:01:51.659> across<00:01:52.079> we're<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.470> has<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> different

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
guess across we're just has a different

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
guess across we're just has a different
kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.250> profile<00:01:53.820> instead<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> sniper

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
kind of profile instead of the sniper

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
kind of profile instead of the sniper
rifle<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.439> bit<00:01:55.560> lower<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.159> we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
rifle so it's a little bit lower so we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.069 
rifle so it's a little bit lower so we
try<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:56.939> scope<00:01:57.240> into<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.659> when<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.049> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
try and scope into this when it's on a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
try and scope into this when it's on a
sniper<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.710> looks<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.100> stupid<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.939> also

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
sniper this looks really stupid and also

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.880 
sniper this looks really stupid and also
when<00:02:00.570> you're<00:02:00.659> using<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.140> class<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> go

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
when you're using this class and you go

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
when you're using this class and you go
to<00:02:01.950> use<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> XL<00:02:02.759> launcher<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.479> actually

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
to use the XL launcher you can actually

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
to use the XL launcher you can actually
see<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.990> massive<00:02:04.320> knife<00:02:04.770> sticking<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> your
