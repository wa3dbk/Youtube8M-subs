00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.500
 serious, it's a serious job she has to 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.270
 to be taken seriously is a serious 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 fashion industry fashion she is not a 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.560

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.849
 You think it's beautiful, it's no use getting 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.489
 one thing that is super trendy in the 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:56.739
 body of the judge and 20 that in my 

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.500
 good the way the minister is that 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:01.660
 I am and you said that you do not know 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.670
 how to define your style because you think 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.069
 then you can be the person to 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.629
 set the income style which helps in 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.830
 all styles so I think the 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:10.899
 Minister also with the brand in function 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.489
 that even a girl can I 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.709
 frame in all styles I am 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.659
 versatile as the rest is versatile 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.640
 Do you think you can be a person? 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.470
 talk to this woman who buys the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.590
 riachuelo so I think I can 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 talk to people as they can 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.650
 dress better the same following a 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.620
 trend 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.340
 you consider yourself a victim of 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.170
 fashion 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.569
 lÃ©o I think this look is not a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.250
 little influence of this thing of being 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.659
 a little victim of fashion 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.790
 What do you think the big differential 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.560
 of the riachuelo that these other marks 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.840
 all have not I think the reaction is 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.200
 literate very fast desire 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.200
 consumer 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.620

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.020

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.070

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.810
 collor phelps would leave if you make a 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.220
 ask me what question do you ask me? 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.890

 nervous all the wounds by 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.380
 account of nervousness maybe one or the other 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.400
 could not be expressed as 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.710
 would 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.230
 I really liked this girl there in the promise. 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.540

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.570
 things that people in the fashion world do 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.030
