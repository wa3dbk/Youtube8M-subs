the<00:02:16.280> phone<00:02:16.430> number<00:02:16.730> that's<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.450> then

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
the phone number that's on it and then

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.170 
the phone number that's on it and then
reactivate<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.950> 24<00:02:19.430> hours<00:02:19.459> later<00:02:19.880> with<00:02:20.120> a

different<00:02:20.540> phone<00:02:20.720> number<00:02:21.280> fortunately<00:02:22.280> i

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
different phone number fortunately i

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.520 
different phone number fortunately i
think<00:02:22.940> i<00:02:23.030> even<00:02:23.060> had<00:02:23.510> got<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> chance<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.290> skip

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
think i even had got a chance to skip

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.100 
think i even had got a chance to skip
that<00:02:24.770> step<00:02:25.010> because<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.730> family<00:02:26.209> plans<00:02:26.480> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
that step because on family plans you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.290 
that step because on family plans you
can<00:02:27.290> switch<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.830> device<00:02:28.370> without<00:02:28.700> switching

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
can switch a device without switching

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.780 
can switch a device without switching
your<00:02:29.390> phone<00:02:29.720> number<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:31.040> another<00:02:31.459> person

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
your phone number to another person

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.630
