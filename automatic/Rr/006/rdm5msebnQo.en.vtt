00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120
 television and little by little it starts to flow 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.120
 is right July was very fast 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.480
 the leg and it feels and looks like it says 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:21.840
 not because he knows that I know why he is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 accommodating the leg in the air and then 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.380
 how do you want to look at how it went and the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.059
 then later it is seen let it run 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.149
 Let her run himself get up by 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.390
 there 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.390
 and also 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.500
 hooked that was a thing of mountains not 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.700
 you can go kick a ball like that because 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 I do not patio it in the height of the night 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.719
 but me to kick the leg is that it goes with 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.949
 too much force I do not know if it closes or very 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.320
 bad really bad mounts and looks said lennon yes 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.809
 it was a very bad decision but it is that the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.200
 diesel 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.149
 at that height kick the ball that does not 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.600
 you were tall for me it was very rare 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.220
 although the new the ball the defender 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.299
 Ecuadorian is at ground level 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 ball I know but look look look at the 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.600
 Steps 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:46.780
 He knows we're seeing what happens 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.640
 is that we have one more opinion 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.640
 evolved than television 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.130
 still still enough to think about 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:02.399
 russia there was no face of rafaela 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:05.110
 and all players say it because it's 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.399
 the way to enter not all are 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.410
 your partner is worried sick 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.690
 profession is not your teammate and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.690
 he already knew and looks is shouting 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.980
 at that time mounts was not thinking 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.980
 how much did he hurt 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.170
 today he thinks I send a greeting my dad who 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.810
 we just sent a data of says it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.489
 Remember Alberto Onofre says a 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.410
 creative midfielder who stayed 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:40.290
 out of the world 70's double by 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.290
 fracture in three days of mexico 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:54.160
 the day greetings to the original is that already 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:56.160
 look that gives the instep faithful age 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.690
 there is part and then by the trajectory 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.700
 it's going up strength 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.500
 on the knee of the admired one is 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.540
 totally broken 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.630
 the castle for first like that 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.070
 is nailed to the leg is that the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.990
 leg was stuck to the ground and it 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.330
 he pry gained the position that 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.020
 lever was well planted on the ground 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.570
 but the ball does not have the body 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.330
 completely flips the reality is the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.340
 mountain error that's why it comes out 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.920
 Runaway polar because the ball trailer 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.980
 controlled and the gaga rule the rule does not 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.560
 it's over the wrong one and that go for the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.110
 ball and that's where this is produced 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.500
 terrible shock that we will remember 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.970
 Maybe for bad many years ago because 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.370
 this player I am if I could have 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.470
 do this I say do not have to bring 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.790
 so to the maximum say nothing and two we are 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.790
 defeated but I
