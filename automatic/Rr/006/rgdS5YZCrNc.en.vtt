00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
I've tried that but who knows it might

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.449 
I've tried that but who knows it might
work<00:04:02.110> it'll<00:04:02.410> probably<00:04:02.620> work<00:04:02.770> just<00:04:03.130> make<00:04:03.220> it

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
work it'll probably work just make it

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.870 
work it'll probably work just make it

we all need a feel the song so as the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.870 
we all need a feel the song so as the
drummer<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.080> can<00:04:53.289> make<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.590> song<00:04:53.800> go<00:04:54.310> softer

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
range make people want to I guess that's

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.570

sometimes it's one you want to block

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.170 
sometimes it's one you want to block
because<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.470> drummer<00:05:05.710> helps<00:05:06.010> do<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.220> and<00:05:06.669> so
