today<00:00:15.830> we'll<00:00:16.830> start<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> low<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:18.140> low

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
today we'll start with a low one low

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.519 
today we'll start with a low one low
trucks<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.340> example<00:00:20.400> my

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
trucks I just have for example my

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.599 
trucks I just have for example my
thunder<00:00:22.640> light<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:25.710> low<00:00:25.859> trucks<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.460> really

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
thunder light the low trucks are really

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.310 
thunder light the low trucks are really
really<00:00:26.970> good<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.630> go<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.199> be

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
really good if you want to go and be

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.950 
really good if you want to go and be
very<00:00:28.529> stable<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.189> ride<00:00:29.539> just<00:00:30.539> because

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
very stable when you ride just because

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.920 
very stable when you ride just because
they<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.880> lower<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> ground<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:33.750> don't

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
they are lower to the ground they don't

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.130 
they are lower to the ground they don't
offer<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.410> great<00:00:34.620> turning<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:36.140> from

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
offer as great turning because from

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
offer as great turning because from
where<00:00:37.649> your<00:00:37.860> board<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.910> where<00:00:39.210> your<00:00:39.390> wheel

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
where your board is to where your wheel

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.240 
where your board is to where your wheel
would<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.860> small<00:00:41.190> little

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
would be it's a really small little

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.540 
would be it's a really small little
space<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.750> these<00:00:43.020> low<00:00:43.950> trucks<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> lot

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
space so these low trucks are a lot

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
space so these low trucks are a lot
better<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:45.059> stability<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.500> tighten

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
better for stability you can tighten

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260 
better for stability you can tighten
them<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:46.980> really<00:00:47.550> really<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.149> they'll

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
them down really really good and they'll

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.779 
them down really really good and they'll
actually<00:00:48.390> stay<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.930> way<00:00:49.340> they<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.520> have<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
actually stay that way they don't have a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
actually stay that way they don't have a
great<00:00:51.120> sharp<00:00:51.690> turning<00:00:52.350> radius<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:54.649> generally

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
great sharp turning radius and generally

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
great sharp turning radius and generally
because<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.460> lower<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:59.180> almost

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
because it is lower you know it's almost

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
because it is lower you know it's almost
not<00:01:00.600> even<00:01:00.840> noticeable<00:01:01.260> anymore<00:01:01.710> but<00:01:02.579> they<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
not even noticeable anymore but they are

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.310 
not even noticeable anymore but they are
a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:03.000> lighter<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> seem<00:01:06.570> mostly

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a little lighter and you seem mostly

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
a little lighter and you seem mostly
like<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.700> pros<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.360> could<00:01:09.540> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
like a lot of like pros that I could get

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.960 
like a lot of like pros that I could get
really<00:01:09.869> technical<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.280> lots<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
really technical they like to do lots of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.330 
really technical they like to do lots of
you<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.720> flipping<00:01:13.080> flip<00:01:13.500> outs<00:01:13.650> especially

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
you know flipping flip outs especially

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.280 
you know flipping flip outs especially
lines<00:01:14.640> most<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.900> grinding

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
lines most of them are grinding

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.580 
lines most of them are grinding
something<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> this<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.670> low<00:01:18.439> that<00:01:19.439> way

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
something like this so I'm low that way

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.039 
something like this so I'm low that way
they<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.150> full<00:01:21.390> feel<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.840> board

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
they get the full feel of the board

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.440 
they get the full feel of the board
they're<00:01:22.350> not<00:01:22.470> all<00:01:22.680> over<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.950> place<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.780> I

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
they're not all over the place and I

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.640 
they're not all over the place and I
don't<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.509> I've<00:01:27.780> tried<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.170> before<00:01:28.619> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
don't know I've tried out before I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
don't know I've tried out before I
really<00:01:28.979> like<00:01:29.130> them<00:01:29.369> I'm<00:01:29.759> not<00:01:30.090> too<00:01:30.329> partial<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
really like them I'm not too partial to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.780 
really like them I'm not too partial to
either<00:01:31.259> high<00:01:31.470> or<00:01:31.500> low<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> switch<00:01:32.610> out

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
either high or low I kind of switch out

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.569 
either high or low I kind of switch out
every<00:01:33.390> now<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:38.400> what

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
every now and then but it just from what

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.730 
every now and then but it just from what
everyone<00:01:39.390> else<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:39.840> told<00:01:40.020> me<00:01:40.140> before<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.650> I

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
everyone else has told me before and I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740 
everyone else has told me before and I
can<00:01:40.920> kind<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.250> watch<00:01:41.369> for<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> low

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
can kind of watch for this with a low

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.219 
can kind of watch for this with a low
truck<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.700> if<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:44.790> doing<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.229> 500

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
truck you get if you're doing like 500

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
truck you get if you're doing like 500
or<00:01:46.350> nose<00:01:46.649> grinds<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> feels<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.640> you're

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
or nose grinds it feels like you're

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
or nose grinds it feels like you're
walking<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.240> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.570> better<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.680> for

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
walking a little bit better but for

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
walking a little bit better but for
tricks<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.640> Smith's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
tricks like Smith's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.130 
tricks like Smith's
and<00:01:51.570> crooks<00:01:52.729> something<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> high<00:01:54.240> would

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
and crooks something like a high would

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
and crooks something like a high would
probably<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> better<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.880> can

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
probably do you better because you can

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
probably do you better because you can
actually<00:01:57.180> lock<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> actually<00:01:58.680> really

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
actually lock in and actually really

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.310 
actually lock in and actually really
have<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.790> thing<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> side<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.079> have

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
have this thing to the side you can have

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130 
have this thing to the side you can have
it<00:02:01.560> tweaked<00:02:01.770> out<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.670> will<00:02:02.880> grind<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:04.020> as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it tweaked out and it will grind just as

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
I'm not gonna vote you the way I've

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.380 
I'm not gonna vote you the way I've

better<00:02:31.510> pop<00:02:31.780> I've<00:02:32.260> never<00:02:32.830> noticed<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.910> pop

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
better pop I've never noticed that I pop

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.080 
better pop I've never noticed that I pop
higher<00:02:34.570> on<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.780> high<00:02:34.960> truck<00:02:35.230> or<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.440> low<00:02:35.590> truck

higher on a high truck or a low truck

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.690 
higher on a high truck or a low truck
but<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.980> some<00:02:38.980> people<00:02:39.190> will<00:02:39.280> say<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
but and some people will say that the

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.540 
but and some people will say that the
higher<00:02:39.850> trucks<00:02:40.150> do<00:02:40.300> that<00:02:40.480> because<00:02:41.400> by<00:02:42.400> that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
higher trucks do that because by that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.760 
higher trucks do that because by that
you<00:02:42.850> actually<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.210> more<00:02:43.420> ground<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.350> clear

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
you actually have more ground to clear

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.730 
you actually have more ground to clear
to<00:02:45.370> get<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.360> tail<00:02:46.570> hitting<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.530> ground

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
to get to the tail hitting the ground

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.640 
to get to the tail hitting the ground
and<00:02:48.420> by<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> time<00:02:49.750> your<00:02:49.990> board<00:02:50.230> hits<00:02:50.500> the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
and by the time your board hits the

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.140 
and by the time your board hits the
ground<00:02:50.830> your<00:02:51.220> board<00:02:51.550> instead<00:02:51.880> of<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.120> being

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
ground your board instead of it being

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.880 
ground your board instead of it being
fixed<00:02:52.630> like<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.410> pop<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.800> like

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
fixed like this you have to pop it like

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.160 
fixed like this you have to pop it like
this<00:02:54.130> instead<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.270> being<00:02:55.360> low<00:02:55.690> or<00:02:55.930> you'd<00:02:56.050> only

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
this instead of being low or you'd only

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.370 
this instead of being low or you'd only
get<00:02:56.410> about<00:02:56.530> maybe<00:02:57.360> 60<00:02:58.360> degrees<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.990> a<00:02:59.110> high<00:02:59.320> you

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
get about maybe 60 degrees on a high you

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.170 
get about maybe 60 degrees on a high you
could<00:02:59.710> get<00:02:59.830> maybe<00:02:59.980> around<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.430> 70<00:03:00.790> 75

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
could get maybe around like 70 75

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.090 
could get maybe around like 70 75
degrees<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:02.050> then<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.260> move<00:03:02.620> your<00:03:02.650> foot<00:03:02.950> up

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
degrees and then you move your foot up

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.950 
degrees and then you move your foot up
for<00:03:03.940> your<00:03:04.030> ollie<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.480> go<00:03:04.600> a<00:03:04.630> little<00:03:04.780> bit

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
for your ollie and you go a little bit

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.890 
for your ollie and you go a little bit
higher<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> lower<00:03:06.610> truck<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.180> get<00:03:07.390> just<00:03:07.840> a

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
higher for a lower truck you get just a

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.100 
higher for a lower truck you get just a
quicker<00:03:08.290> response<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:09.850> ollie<00:03:10.110> because

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
quicker response to the ollie because

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.460 
quicker response to the ollie because
you<00:03:11.290> have<00:03:11.380> less<00:03:11.560> ground<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:11.950> clear<00:03:12.630> but<00:03:13.630> higher

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
you have less ground to clear but higher

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.140 
you have less ground to clear but higher
trucks<00:03:14.800> usually<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.370> find<00:03:15.580> on<00:03:15.790> people<00:03:16.060> who

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150

out the street when they ride these
trucks<00:03:27.040> are<00:03:27.190> really<00:03:27.370> really<00:03:27.700> good<00:03:27.880> not<00:03:28.209> just

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
trucks are really really good not just

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.050 
trucks are really really good not just
independent<00:03:28.570> but<00:03:29.560> just<00:03:29.800> high<00:03:30.640> trucks<00:03:30.910> in

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
independent but just high trucks in

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.350 
independent but just high trucks in
general<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.810> mean<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.030> unless<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> try

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
general and I mean it's unless you try

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.740 
general and I mean it's unless you try
them<00:03:37.540> both<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:38.200> high<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.530> low

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
them both like a high and a low

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.660 
them both like a high and a low
you<00:03:40.750> know<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.140> can<00:03:41.470> do<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:42.100> most<00:03:42.250> technical

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
you know you can do the most technical

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.310 
you know you can do the most technical
flip<00:03:42.850> tricks<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.270> high<00:03:43.480> truck<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.050> then<00:03:44.200> you

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
flip tricks on a high truck and then you

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.530 
flip tricks on a high truck and then you
can<00:03:44.500> do<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:45.340> know<00:03:45.459> good<00:03:45.760> turning<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.300> a<00:03:46.330> low

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
can do you know good turning on a low

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.690 
can do you know good turning on a low
truck<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:46.959> need<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.410> be<00:03:47.709> very<00:03:47.950> careful

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
truck you just need to be very careful

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.140 
truck you just need to be very careful
and<00:03:48.850> not<00:03:48.970> will<00:03:49.900> bite<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.800> you<00:03:50.890> ride<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:52.590> but

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
and not will bite when you ride it but

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.630 
and not will bite when you ride it but
yeah<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.180> guess<00:03:55.900> that's<00:03:56.170> pretty<00:03:56.620> much<00:03:56.770> it<00:03:57.040> I

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
yeah I guess that's pretty much it I

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.840 
yeah I guess that's pretty much it I
mean<00:03:58.239> right<00:03:58.420> now<00:03:58.450> I'm<00:03:58.810> writing<00:03:59.170> my<00:03:59.850> titanium

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
mean right now I'm writing my titanium
