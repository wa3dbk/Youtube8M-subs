00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:10.870
 In addition, we more came out new words 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:13.300
 Because this translate common divisor and say there was any sense is the greatest common divisor of Which number of 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:18.490
 I Te wind which is also about the number 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.570
 And it is the largest of the greatest common divisor in the divisor 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.900
 For example, 12 and 16 of the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:31.010
 Maximum High x If you do, it will become the 4 largest common divisors 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:35.270
 If you have the greatest common divisor of 15 and 27, you have become this 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:42.800
 Well come out in search of the greatest common divisor 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:47.059
 11 the last one chosen Ya Wow Toka once's Ya I wrote all Do not there Oh three wrote all this 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 It's the biggest one, and it's Nendoroid 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:56.170
 I'm sure this word calculation at that least common multiple 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.429
 Should Ya and Kureteru people have thought that say Naa as was the guy out 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:07.860
 There is also a way to easily write out this kind of calculation even for the greatest common divisor 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:11.700
 And by 12 and let's do this kind of problem in 16 of the chocolate came out 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:19.320
 Greatest common divisor of 12 and 16 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 Suppose that the problem came out that please put out the largest tomorrow among the common figures 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 If you normally do about 12 some sea mud 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.850
 This and I 16 about the number revision Oh there's the Which also of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.890
 And It's me common divisor Ya Naa 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.729
 The biggest greatest common factor number I'm sorry I said something like this 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.900
 Street 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.580
 Well I Akan'nen such'll be the wind that say this maximum commitment Ne supported Nao like this day's 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:47.870
 How to do with numbers 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:52.190
 It is almost same as the least common multiple time First of all, write these 12 and 16 side by side 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:59.820
 I will write something like reverse writing and what did you do 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:02.360
 Well this together most of all what you do at first 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.360
 kazuo 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.140
 Number to divide 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.880
 think 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.680
 What is the wind that is 12 and both gravity because it is well'll laden ever said starring a now 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.000
 Learn but do 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.800
 Neat is divided by the even-Ya from brother both simple roof 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.530
 Feeling like this 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:34.010
 Please write it here in the second place . This is the first one . 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.970
 Along with the time of And then this is also the least common multiple 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.970
 Came out 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.840
 Cars 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.459
 so 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.459
 Both numbers 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.330
 Please finish 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.310
 Something together also let's split Well I cherry had collapsed until I ne and here write here 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:02.150
 So what happens if you divide by 2 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:05.360
 The 12 evil to a flat roof 16 evil was put out to 8 Eneco 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.250
 Then I will say what I did next time 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.180
 What did you do with number three ? 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:14.180
 The number of two numbers also a both came out 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.890
 The two numbers that came out 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.780
 In addition also answer gar 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:35.170
 Please think about the number to divide again 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:40.370
 Arcana 6 and 8 both have a number that divides 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:45.610
 Then, if you think that you should divide by 2 in the same way as before, as a little come 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.710
 If you think that you should divide by Kuching times or 2, the number 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.930
 number 3 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:53.790
 I 'll call you here and I will call you again And what happens if this is over 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.990
 Out to come I mean there are 6 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:04.080
 I read here is Ya ne and anymore you this is Rarena 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:06.700
 When this more swelling is the end when it is no longer and say minimum common multiple watch if you have the 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.730
 I want to call everything that is out here 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:14.150
 Let's write a little 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.150
 Least common multiple and say whether it has 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:26.790
 Because I hang on all this number that came out 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:34.979
 To him this is the least common multiple 2234 I'm mentioned a guy all in this outside became to much 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.440
 I think people have the least common multiple is to go straight to Fu say that now 48 read over in the lion 32 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.090
 However 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.460
 The greatest common divisor is different 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:50.039
 Please apply only the number of hands 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:56.430
 It is but the greatest common divisor or try it and I please take only a few hands were comfortable than the minimum small bus 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:05:01.390
 I can draw only the number of hands I said how I can put it out 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:07.030
 I mean just this mansion of the past here and here and say what happens when here 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.560
 If it only takes two for this and there are only three if there are three, but only these two 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.310
 Because it is good to call 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.150
 The greatest common divisor of 12 and 16 is 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.230
 It will be 4 in the evening and this is 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:25.350
 It will be the answer 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:32.670
 You can get the greatest common divisor with this as a factor and it looks like a band 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:33.360
 So I calculate almost like the day of the least common multiple, and only the last is the last 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.860
 Wrong 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.249
 At the time of the greatest common divisor, please take this number of hands 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.939
 When the least common multiple 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:48.029
 Remember always to avoid west ne This stiff is'll guy multiplied by the total of which is around the outside of vertical and horizontal 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.029
 The
