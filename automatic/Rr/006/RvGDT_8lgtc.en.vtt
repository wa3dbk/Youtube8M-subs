it in from closer to the braid i'm not
pulling<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.840> from<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.049> edge<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.860> pulling<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
pulling it from the edge I'm pulling it

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.660 
pulling it from the edge I'm pulling it
from<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> under<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> braid<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> just

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
from kind of under the braid so I just

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
from kind of under the braid so I just
kind<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.000> piqued<00:01:39.570> myself<00:01:40.049> I'm<00:01:40.380> gonna<00:01:40.500> scoop

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
kind of piqued myself I'm gonna scoop

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.480 
kind of piqued myself I'm gonna scoop
from<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> outside<00:01:42.380> then<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> outside<00:01:44.100> on

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
from the outside then on the outside on

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.910 
from the outside then on the outside on
the<00:01:44.549> other<00:01:44.700> side<00:01:45.409> then<00:01:46.409> I'm<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> skip

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the other side then I'm going to skip

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.910 
the other side then I'm going to skip
from<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> inside<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.649> scoop<00:01:49.649> from<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
from the inside and scoop from the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.810 
from the inside and scoop from the
inside<00:01:51.740> scoop<00:01:52.740> from<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.040> outside<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> I'm

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
inside scoop from the outside and I'm

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.149 
inside scoop from the outside and I'm
just<00:01:54.060> doing<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> basic<00:01:54.450> braid<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.500> scoop

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
just doing a basic braid as I go scoop

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.499 
just doing a basic braid as I go scoop
from<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> outside<00:01:58.790> scoop<00:01:59.790> from<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> inside

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
from the outside scoop from the inside

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.240 
from the outside scoop from the inside
and<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.110> will<00:02:01.200> give<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> nice<00:02:01.680> full<00:02:01.979> braid

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
and this will give you a nice full braid

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.440 
and this will give you a nice full braid
because<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.579> won't<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:03.000> pulling<00:02:03.360> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
because you won't just be pulling the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
because you won't just be pulling the
hair<00:02:03.659> from<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> outside<00:02:04.290> you'll<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> getting

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
hair from the outside you'll be getting

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.039 
hair from the outside you'll be getting
all<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.610> volume<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.810> easier

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
all the volume that you have it's easier

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.419 
all the volume that you have it's easier
if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> take<00:02:07.380> your<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.619> have<00:02:07.770> glasses<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
if you take your you have glasses and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.160 
if you take your you have glasses and
earrings<00:02:08.789> it's<00:02:09.270> probably<00:02:09.539> easier<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
earrings it's probably easier if you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.479 
earrings it's probably easier if you
take<00:02:10.379> them<00:02:10.560> off<00:02:10.709> first<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> don't<00:02:11.430> get

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
take them off first so you don't get

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.010 
take them off first so you don't get
tangled<00:02:11.610> up

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
tangled up

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.020 
tangled up
um<00:02:12.170> I've<00:02:12.980> been<00:02:13.010> braiding<00:02:13.400> my<00:02:13.490> own<00:02:13.610> hair<00:02:13.790> since

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
um I've been braiding my own hair since

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.360 
um I've been braiding my own hair since
I<00:02:14.120> was<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.450> seventh<00:02:15.320> grade<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:15.800> it's<00:02:15.950> not<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> big

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I was in seventh grade so it's not a big

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.360 
I was in seventh grade so it's not a big
deal<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.930> there<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.230> go<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:19.220> your

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
deal so there you go that is just your

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.790 
deal so there you go that is just your
basic<00:02:19.490> rate<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.930> say<00:02:21.140> it's<00:02:21.380> easier

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
basic rate and I have to say it's easier

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.850 
basic rate and I have to say it's easier
if<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:23.030> when<00:02:23.360> your<00:02:23.570> hair<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:23.900> dry<00:02:24.470> I

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
if you do it when your hair is dry I

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.010 
if you do it when your hair is dry I
think<00:02:25.220> if<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.120> braid<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.420> when<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:26.630> wet<00:02:26.840> it's

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
think if you braid it when it's wet it's

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.420 
think if you braid it when it's wet it's
going<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.500> going<00:02:27.590> to<00:02:27.740> pull<00:02:27.920> untangle

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
going to be it's going to pull untangle

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.250 
going to be it's going to pull untangle
if<00:02:28.520> it's<00:02:28.670> damp<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.060> even<00:02:29.270> worse<00:02:29.510> so<00:02:30.110> either

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
if it's damp it's even worse so either

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.260 
if it's damp it's even worse so either
sopping<00:02:30.800> wet<00:02:30.830> or<00:02:31.190> completely<00:02:31.550> dry<00:02:31.820> I<00:02:31.850> think

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
sopping wet or completely dry I think

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.700 
sopping wet or completely dry I think
now<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:32.810> going<00:02:32.930> to<00:02:32.990> show<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.140> another<00:02:33.410> braid

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
now I'm going to show you another braid

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.520 
now I'm going to show you another braid

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this um I kind of call it an inside / 8

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.960 
this um I kind of call it an inside / 8
I<00:02:36.560> don't<00:02:36.800> really<00:02:36.920> know<00:02:37.130> its<00:02:37.340> technical<00:02:37.820> name

I don't really know its technical name

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.890 
I don't really know its technical name
is<00:02:38.000> because<00:02:38.420> I'm<00:02:38.510> not<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.660> hairdresser

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
is because I'm not a hairdresser

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.470 
is because I'm not a hairdresser

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
to the to the edge here you'll be able

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.900 
to the to the edge here you'll be able
to<00:02:54.020> get<00:02:54.230> those<00:02:54.410> braids<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.830> bangs<00:02:55.340> woven<00:02:55.730> in

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
to get those braids the bangs woven in

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.970 
to get those braids the bangs woven in
so<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.180> won't<00:02:56.330> have<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.450> deal<00:02:56.660> with<00:02:56.720> bangs

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
so you won't have to deal with bangs

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.560 
so you won't have to deal with bangs
alright<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.310> I'm<00:02:58.550> going<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.760> pick<00:02:58.910> up<00:02:59.000> my<00:02:59.060> first

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
alright so I'm going to pick up my first

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.420 
alright so I'm going to pick up my first
chunk<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> hair<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.380> i'm<00:03:01.100> going<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.280> divide

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
chunk of hair and i'm going to divide

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.950 
chunk of hair and i'm going to divide
into<00:03:01.730> three<00:03:01.940> sections<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.660> i<00:03:02.780> did<00:03:02.930> before

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
into three sections like i did before

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.470 
into three sections like i did before
but<00:03:03.320> this<00:03:03.500> time<00:03:03.560> instead<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.070> going<00:03:04.430> over<00:03:04.970> from

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
but this time instead of going over from

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.120 
but this time instead of going over from
going<00:03:05.780> from<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.960> outside<00:03:06.320> in<00:03:06.500> i'm<00:03:06.890> going<00:03:07.070> to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
going from the outside in i'm going to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.740 
going from the outside in i'm going to
go<00:03:07.190> from<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.460> inside<00:03:07.970> out<00:03:08.150> some<00:03:08.390> kind<00:03:08.570> of

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
go from the inside out some kind of

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.470 
go from the inside out some kind of
breeding<00:03:09.290> inside<00:03:10.250> out<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.030> i'm<00:03:11.090> kind<00:03:11.420> of

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
breeding inside out so i'm kind of

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.990 
breeding inside out so i'm kind of
pulling<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.810> hair<00:03:11.960> to<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.170> center<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:13.000> but

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
pulling the hair to the center and but

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.550 
pulling the hair to the center and but
again<00:03:14.270> I'm<00:03:14.570> still<00:03:14.900> picking<00:03:15.140> up<00:03:15.290> from<00:03:15.470> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
again I'm still picking up from the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.710 
again I'm still picking up from the
outside<00:03:15.950> like<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.280> did<00:03:16.430> before<00:03:16.550> but<00:03:17.480> I'm

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
outside like I did before but I'm

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.900 
outside like I did before but I'm
pulling<00:03:18.260> those<00:03:18.560> sections<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.220> hair<00:03:19.250> into<00:03:19.730> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
pulling those sections of hair into the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.120 
pulling those sections of hair into the
center<00:03:20.300> it's<00:03:20.870> kind<00:03:20.990> of<00:03:21.170> weird<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.500> do<00:03:21.830> this<00:03:21.950> in

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
center it's kind of weird to do this in

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.560 
center it's kind of weird to do this in
slow<00:03:22.250> motion<00:03:22.520> because<00:03:22.880> I'm<00:03:22.970> used<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.209> braden

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
slow motion because I'm used to braden

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.960 
slow motion because I'm used to braden
quickly<00:03:23.930> I'm<00:03:24.680> not<00:03:25.010> thinking<00:03:25.340> about<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.730> so

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
quickly I'm not thinking about it so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.190 
quickly I'm not thinking about it so
it's<00:03:26.090> like<00:03:26.390> trying<00:03:26.600> to<00:03:26.690> teach<00:03:26.870> somebody<00:03:27.080> how

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
it's like trying to teach somebody how

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.690 
it's like trying to teach somebody how
to<00:03:27.320> spin<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> baseball<00:03:27.950> bat<00:03:28.100> you<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.430> kinda

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
to spin a baseball bat you have to kinda

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.400 
to spin a baseball bat you have to kinda
you<00:03:29.420> have<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.600> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.810> do<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.110> and<00:03:30.290> see<00:03:30.380> how

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
you have to kind of do it and see how

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.020 
you have to kind of do it and see how
you<00:03:30.560> did<00:03:30.770> it<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:30.950> then<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.340> slow<00:03:31.550> down<00:03:31.580> to<00:03:31.910> break

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
you did it and then I slow down to break

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.360 
you did it and then I slow down to break
it<00:03:32.180> down<00:03:32.300> for<00:03:32.600> them<00:03:32.690> but<00:03:33.590> again<00:03:33.860> i'm<00:03:34.130> just

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
it down for them but again i'm just

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.240 
it down for them but again i'm just
scooping<00:03:34.580> up<00:03:34.790> hair<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.950> working<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.070> into<00:03:37.160> a

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
scooping up hair and working it into a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.210 
scooping up hair and working it into a
braid<00:03:37.430> but<00:03:37.640> i'm<00:03:38.260> pulling<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.130> a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
braid but i'm pulling the it's like a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.980 
braid but i'm pulling the it's like a
pulling<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.580> hair<00:03:40.760> from<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.360> from<00:03:41.570> the

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
pulling the hair from it from the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.140 
pulling the hair from it from the
underside<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.620> braid<00:03:42.830> instead<00:03:43.820> of<00:03:43.910> going

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
underside of the braid instead of going

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.610 
underside of the braid instead of going
out<00:03:44.390> and<00:03:44.690> then<00:03:45.170> into<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.440> middle<00:03:45.880> starting

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
out and then into the middle starting

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.250 
out and then into the middle starting
underneath<00:03:48.620> and<00:03:49.280> pulling<00:03:49.580> it<00:03:49.700> oh<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.870> maybe

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
underneath and pulling it oh it's maybe

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.540 
underneath and pulling it oh it's maybe
if<00:03:51.410> you<00:03:51.470> just<00:03:51.500> watch<00:03:51.770> me<00:03:51.980> do<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.220> it'll<00:03:52.430> make

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
if you just watch me do it it'll make

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.610 
if you just watch me do it it'll make
more<00:03:52.700> sense<00:03:52.760> probably<00:03:53.600> i<00:03:53.630> should<00:03:53.750> probably

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
more sense probably i should probably

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.650 
more sense probably i should probably
just<00:03:54.830> be<00:03:54.980> quiet<00:03:55.160> now<00:03:55.550> because<00:03:56.120> i'm<00:03:56.240> probably

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
just be quiet now because i'm probably

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.480 
just be quiet now because i'm probably
confusing<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.260> and<00:03:57.500> i've<00:03:58.250> probably

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
confusing you and i've probably

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.860 
confusing you and i've probably
completely<00:03:58.970> forgotten<00:03:59.390> we're<00:03:59.540> pulling<00:03:59.780> my

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
completely forgotten we're pulling my

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.270 
completely forgotten we're pulling my
hair<00:04:00.020> from<00:04:00.140> but<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:02.060> get<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.330> idea<00:04:03.280> again

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
hair from but you get the idea again

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.530 
hair from but you get the idea again
it's<00:04:04.400> easier<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.730> do<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:04.940> not<00:04:05.090> talk<00:04:05.270> about<00:04:05.390> it

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
it's easier to do it not talk about it

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.640 
it's easier to do it not talk about it
and<00:04:06.459> my<00:04:07.459> favorite<00:04:07.850> braid<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.390> actually

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
and my favorite braid is to actually

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.600 
and my favorite braid is to actually
divide<00:04:09.650> my<00:04:09.830> hair<00:04:09.860> into<00:04:10.040> three<00:04:10.220> different

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
divide my hair into three different

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.300 
divide my hair into three different
sections<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:12.140> do<00:04:12.320> braids<00:04:12.709> like<00:04:12.890> this<00:04:13.100> do

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
sections and to do braids like this do

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.040 
sections and to do braids like this do
one<00:04:13.640> on<00:04:13.760> each<00:04:13.970> side<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.300> then<00:04:14.630> one<00:04:14.750> down<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
one on each side and then one down the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.890 
one on each side and then one down the
middle<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.410> then<00:04:16.060> secure<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.090> loose<00:04:17.419> ends

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
middle and then secure the loose ends

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.750 
middle and then secure the loose ends
with<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.470> clip<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:18.859> it's<00:04:18.980> all<00:04:19.100> kind<00:04:19.280> of<00:04:19.430> messy

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
with a clip so it's all kind of messy

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.950 
with a clip so it's all kind of messy
and<00:04:19.850> loose<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.120> hope<00:04:20.239> that's<00:04:20.359> straight<00:04:20.720> i<00:04:20.750> have

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
and loose I hope that's straight i have

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.620 
and loose I hope that's straight i have
no<00:04:21.169> way<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.410> knowing<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:23.030> my<00:04:23.210> clips<00:04:23.479> right

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
no way of knowing and my clips right

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.290 
no way of knowing and my clips right
here<00:04:23.840> something<00:04:23.990> what<00:04:24.229> i<00:04:24.320> would<00:04:24.470> do<00:04:24.620> is<00:04:24.919> you
