who laid ej yeah when you can see the
difference<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.439> actually<00:03:48.769> from<00:03:48.980> Cosette

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
difference this is actually from Cosette

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.539 
difference this is actually from Cosette
and<00:03:49.430> she<00:03:49.730> lays<00:03:49.909> she<00:03:50.720> lays<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.049> palest<00:03:51.530> egg<00:03:51.829> hmm
