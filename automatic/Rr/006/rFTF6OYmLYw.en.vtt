by<00:00:03.909> today<00:00:04.330> I'm<00:00:04.450> going<00:00:04.600> to<00:00:04.690> give<00:00:04.810> you<00:00:04.899> a<00:00:04.930> very

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
by today I'm going to give you a very

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.650 
by today I'm going to give you a very
short<00:00:05.200> demonstration<00:00:05.620> on<00:00:06.399> knurling<00:00:07.240> on<00:00:07.540> the

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
short demonstration on knurling on the

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.360 
short demonstration on knurling on the
lathe<00:00:07.840> it's<00:00:08.380> off<00:00:08.530> if<00:00:08.680> gnarly<00:00:08.980> tool<00:00:09.190> we're

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
lathe it's off if gnarly tool we're

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.839 
lathe it's off if gnarly tool we're
going<00:00:09.490> to<00:00:09.550> be<00:00:09.639> using<00:00:10.059> is<00:00:10.360> the<00:00:10.630> scissor<00:00:11.500> type

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
going to be using is the scissor type

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.249 
going to be using is the scissor type
though<00:00:12.849> various<00:00:13.209> types<00:00:13.509> of<00:00:13.660> learning<00:00:13.900> tool

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
though various types of learning tool

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.370 
though various types of learning tool
and<00:00:14.620> the<00:00:15.249> scissor<00:00:15.669> type<00:00:15.960> exerts<00:00:16.960> very<00:00:17.230> low

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
and the scissor type exerts very low

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.240 
and the scissor type exerts very low
pressure<00:00:17.740> on<00:00:18.039> the<00:00:18.359> headstock<00:00:19.359> and<00:00:19.980> it's<00:00:20.980> quite

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
pressure on the headstock and it's quite

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.689 
pressure on the headstock and it's quite
good<00:00:21.490> for<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.119> beginner<00:00:23.429> nothing<00:00:24.429> is<00:00:24.519> very

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699 
good for the beginner nothing is very

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.249 
good for the beginner nothing is very
simple<00:00:25.179> but<00:00:25.390> there<00:00:25.660> are<00:00:25.810> a<00:00:25.840> couple<00:00:26.109> of

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
simple but there are a couple of

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.679 
simple but there are a couple of
pitfalls<00:00:26.500> and<00:00:27.060> hopefully<00:00:28.060> this<00:00:28.210> video<00:00:28.390> will

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
pitfalls and hopefully this video will

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.890 
pitfalls and hopefully this video will
help<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:29.470> avoid<00:00:29.769> falling<00:00:30.189> into<00:00:30.400> those<00:00:30.900> first

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
help to avoid falling into those first

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.440 
help to avoid falling into those first
thing<00:00:32.110> to<00:00:32.320> note<00:00:32.500> is<00:00:32.800> that<00:00:32.830> the<00:00:33.370> diameter<00:00:33.940> of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
thing to note is that the diameter of

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.980 
thing to note is that the diameter of
the<00:00:34.870> material<00:00:35.440> that's<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.250> be<00:00:36.400> nulled<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:37.780> to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
the material that's to be nulled has to

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.190 
the material that's to be nulled has to
be<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.380> multiple<00:00:38.950> of<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.580> thread<00:00:40.030> pitch<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.660> the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
be a multiple of the thread pitch of the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.060 
be a multiple of the thread pitch of the
tool<00:00:41.500> the<00:00:42.370> cutting<00:00:42.730> tool<00:00:43.560> for<00:00:44.560> example<00:00:44.650> this

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
tool the cutting tool for example this

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.630 
tool the cutting tool for example this
one's<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.730> one<00:00:45.940> millimeter<00:00:46.560> pitch<00:00:47.560> on<00:00:48.400> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
one's a one millimeter pitch on the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.890 
one's a one millimeter pitch on the
thread<00:00:49.080> that<00:00:50.080> cuts<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.590> now<00:00:51.250> so<00:00:52.120> this<00:00:52.450> has<00:00:52.720> to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
thread that cuts the now so this has to

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.970 
thread that cuts the now so this has to
be<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.050> multiple<00:00:53.530> of<00:00:53.590> that<00:00:53.800> I'm<00:00:54.610> gonna<00:00:54.820> cut<00:00:55.210> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
be a multiple of that I'm gonna cut a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.440 
be a multiple of that I'm gonna cut a
piece<00:00:56.980> that's<00:00:57.280> nine<00:00:57.610> millimeters<00:00:58.270> in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
piece that's nine millimeters in

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.140 
piece that's nine millimeters in
diameter<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:59.280> should<00:01:00.280> give<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.490> nice<00:01:00.760> even

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
diameter and should give a nice even

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.390 
diameter and should give a nice even
mill<00:01:01.360> well<00:01:02.260> think<00:01:02.440> about<00:01:02.530> gnarliness<00:01:03.130> you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
mill well think about gnarliness you

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.979 
mill well think about gnarliness you
have<00:01:03.580> to<00:01:03.700> be<00:01:03.790> able<00:01:03.880> to<00:01:03.970> seal<00:01:04.180> around<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.720> piece

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
have to be able to seal around the piece

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.810 
have to be able to seal around the piece
that<00:01:05.229> you're<00:01:05.379> working<00:01:05.590> on<00:01:05.890> so<00:01:05.950> you<00:01:06.610> can

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
that you're working on so you can

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.330 
that you're working on so you can
position<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.390> nodal<00:01:07.689> correctly<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:09.009> if<00:01:09.159> like

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
position the nodal correctly and if like

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.209 
position the nodal correctly and if like
me<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.820> have<00:01:10.479> limited<00:01:10.659> space<00:01:10.929> and<00:01:11.560> you<00:01:12.009> put

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
me you have limited space and you put

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:13.999 
me you have limited space and you put
your<00:01:12.429> laying<00:01:12.939> is<00:01:13.119> mounted<00:01:13.479> on<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.630> bench

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
your laying is mounted on the bench

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.910 
your laying is mounted on the bench
where<00:01:15.009> it's<00:01:15.549> difficult<00:01:15.759> to<00:01:16.000> see<00:01:16.329> behind<00:01:16.920> it's

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
where it's difficult to see behind it's

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440 
where it's difficult to see behind it's
obviously<00:01:18.280> very<00:01:18.369> dangerous<00:01:18.969> to<00:01:19.119> be<00:01:19.179> leaning

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
obviously very dangerous to be leaning

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.010 
obviously very dangerous to be leaning
over<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:19.929> lathe<00:01:20.200> so<00:01:20.729> I've<00:01:21.729> mounted<00:01:22.299> tools

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
over the lathe so I've mounted tools

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.709 
over the lathe so I've mounted tools
I've<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.499> in<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.159> tailstock<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:25.450> in<00:01:25.630> a

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
I've you in the tailstock just in a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.539 
I've you in the tailstock just in a
Chuck<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:28.570> that<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:29.380> can<00:01:29.649> get<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.799> good<00:01:29.979> view<00:01:30.249> of

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
Chuck so that I can get a good view of

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.690 
Chuck so that I can get a good view of
the<00:01:31.200> positioning<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.560> knurling<00:01:32.890> tool<00:01:32.920> and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
the positioning of the knurling tool and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.989 
the positioning of the knurling tool and
on<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.939> screen<00:01:34.179> there<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.630> can<00:01:34.840> see<00:01:35.079> a<00:01:35.999> good

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
on the screen there you can see a good

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.450 
on the screen there you can see a good
view<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:38.079> material<00:01:38.619> can<00:01:38.859> be<00:01:38.890> worth<00:01:39.249> you

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
view of the material can be worth you

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.090 
view of the material can be worth you
know<00:01:39.990> then<00:01:40.990> we've<00:01:41.140> just<00:01:41.380> bought<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.679> material

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
know then we've just bought the material

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.889 
know then we've just bought the material
down<00:01:42.249> science<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.119> I've<00:01:43.299> put<00:01:43.539> a<00:01:43.569> small

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
down science and I've put a small

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.080 
down science and I've put a small
channel<00:01:44.319> in<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.560> using<00:01:45.159> parting<00:01:45.729> off<00:01:45.819> tool

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
channel in it using parting off tool

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.539 
channel in it using parting off tool
just<00:01:46.960> so<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.229> know<00:01:47.319> where<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.799> milling<00:01:48.310> ends

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
just so I know where the milling ends

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.700 
just so I know where the milling ends
this<00:01:49.299> is<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.509> good<00:01:49.840> view<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.079> your<00:01:50.259> work<00:01:50.499> is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
this is a good view of your work is

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.129 
this is a good view of your work is
important<00:01:51.399> so<00:01:51.819> it's<00:01:52.270> always<00:01:52.450> eye<00:01:52.630> view<00:01:52.840> comes

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:53.139 
important so it's always eye view comes

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:57.300 
important so it's always eye view comes

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.510 
course this is dead easy just bring up
one<00:02:06.609> of<00:02:06.639> the<00:02:06.759> vertical<00:02:07.179> lines<00:02:07.389> and<00:02:08.399> enlarge<00:02:09.399> it

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
one of the vertical lines and enlarge it

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.270 
one of the vertical lines and enlarge it
so<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.330> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.410> see<00:02:11.590> exactly<00:02:11.710> where<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
so that you can see exactly where the

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.370 
so that you can see exactly where the
center<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.790> material<00:02:13.300> is<00:02:13.450> positioned

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380

here<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.710> center<00:02:15.130> there's<00:02:15.670> no

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
here on the center there's no

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.210 
here on the center there's no
requirement<00:02:16.420> for<00:02:16.570> calibration<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.500> pop

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
requirement for calibration you just pop

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.580 
requirement for calibration you just pop
a<00:02:18.250> line<00:02:18.550> straight<00:02:18.910> in<00:02:19.090> there<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:20.350> can

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
a line straight in there and you can

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.400 
a line straight in there and you can
visually<00:02:21.370> see<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:24.190> centered<00:02:25.410> very

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
visually see that it's centered very

this'll<00:02:35.780> be<00:02:35.959> noted<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:36.530> he<00:02:36.590> was<00:02:36.859> saying<00:02:37.099> we

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
this'll be noted so he was saying we

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.750 
this'll be noted so he was saying we
multi-step<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.439> this<00:02:40.340> we<00:02:40.519> just<00:02:42.730> sat<00:02:43.730> down

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
multi-step to do this we just sat down

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.489 
multi-step to do this we just sat down
and<00:02:44.299> some<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:44.749> reason<00:02:45.680> early<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.249> turn

I've moved towards our viewers hopefully
you<00:02:50.659> can<00:02:50.810> see<00:02:51.019> what's<00:02:51.260> going<00:02:52.159> on<00:02:52.280> there<00:02:52.549> you

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
you can see what's going on there you

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.399 
you can see what's going on there you
can<00:02:52.909> see<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.409> wheels<00:02:54.409> of<00:02:54.859> the<00:02:56.139> Merlin<00:02:57.139> tool

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
can see the wheels of the Merlin tool

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.459

are both rotating and filming a patent

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.199 
are both rotating and filming a patent
the<00:03:03.680> same<00:03:03.950> as<00:03:04.159> say<00:03:04.489> thread<00:03:05.120> cutter<00:03:05.499> does<00:03:06.499> and

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
the same as say thread cutter does and

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.140 
the same as say thread cutter does and
what<00:03:08.209> Peter's<00:03:08.599> relieved<00:03:09.049> that<00:03:09.819> along<00:03:10.819> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
what Peter's relieved that along the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.330 
what Peter's relieved that along the
length<00:03:11.629> of<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.930> material<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.769> cut<00:03:12.949> a<00:03:12.980> shallow

length of the material to cut a shallow

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.750 
length of the material to cut a shallow
thread<00:03:14.090> very<00:03:14.659> very<00:03:14.989> slowly<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:16.400> it

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
thread very very slowly so that it

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.159 
thread very very slowly so that it
follows<00:03:17.299> the<00:03:18.010> pattern<00:03:19.010> as<00:03:19.310> it<00:03:19.430> goes<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:20.169> then

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
follows the pattern as it goes and then

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.610 
follows the pattern as it goes and then
bring<00:03:21.409> back<00:03:22.060> increases<00:03:23.060> depth<00:03:23.239> slightly<00:03:23.780> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
bring back increases depth slightly and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.879 
bring back increases depth slightly and
repeat<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.129> process<00:03:25.629> again<00:03:26.629> very<00:03:27.199> slowly<00:03:27.469> so

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
repeat the process again very slowly so

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.300 
repeat the process again very slowly so
that<00:03:27.919> to<00:03:28.840> maintain<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.169> good<00:03:30.709> clear<00:03:30.949> pattern

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
that to maintain a good clear pattern

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:44.460 
that to maintain a good clear pattern
