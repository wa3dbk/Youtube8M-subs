00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.700
 very good to all and welcome to ico 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.459
 to take three beyond gotham for 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.219
 complete the full room 

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:12.309
 trophies is in part 2 of the pad 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:17.470
 cave so let's get there once 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.859
 here let's go back a little bit so they appear 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.570
 caught superman with his dark suit 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.160
 let's go up one side a little bit for the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.289
 left side entered back 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.269
 we entered the trophy room and 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.939
 we started to complete the little things to 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.920
 little first of all I'm going to get the 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.920
 golden brick breaking for five 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.379
 signs the first second third and 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.250
 the last two behind the vehicle 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 hala we already have it to appear and what 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.649
 let's catch 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.050
 now we go to the beginning once what 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.000
 fuck this we go to the beginning where 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.140
 was those three mini chess though 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.210
 for me that's like a three in a row 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.519
 because you have to kill the king of the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.769
 black chips we're going to ride the queen and 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.710
 is doing checkmate no longer check 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.149
 we were breaking all these visits here 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.020
 he had not fixed we are going to assemble what 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:16.259
 that consequently is the bishop that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.869
 Like we have done is checkmated we 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.850
 got catwoman let's buy it 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.190
 and talk a little about her too 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.369
 known as gatÃºbela in Spanish America 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.259
 a character associated with batman and came out 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.270
 for the first time in batman number 1 in 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.729
 spring of 1940 has known 350,000 of 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 pieces of lego or money or coins their 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.700
 real names 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.600
 celine due to the lunar deity cl n 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.909
 it was mainly known as a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.729
 expert jewelry thief in disguise 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.159
 and they get just like a cat 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.740
 over the years he went with 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.859
 a much more sexual and complex character 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.350
 besides wearing a different suit 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.240
 totally usually becomes 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 a strong attraction between her and batman 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.679
 but over time it has 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.289
 become a complicated deep and 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.519
 impossible love when we get up 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.140
 here is all where is the vehicle and 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.690
 we break it this vehicle is that 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.010
 similar to the one he has recently but 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.410
 we are going to assemble the 1989 vehicle if 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.900
 I do not remember what it is with me 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.930
 I grew up and in fact is the one that most 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.769
 like we do not have a vehicle that more 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.550
 forward then we will complete 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.280
 we will show the vehicles that we have 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.349
 unlocked in the cave besides the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.440
 watchtower you can also see the mini 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.299
 cooper and if we activate the rest there 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.860
 next will begin to move and fill us 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.860
 well many coins 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.829
 wishing that his parents come to these 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.239
 heights will surely already have it 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.700
 everything for me everything for me that I have 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.110
 pasta until I have a little more 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.549
 to the right of the room under the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.730
 stairs we break all these boxes 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.420
 because there is a pressure switch of 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.180
 weight or not is if it disappears 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.849
 we press it with just putting ourselves with a 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.520
 character on top there are some pipes that 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.030
 they are illuminated and we have the first 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.760
 3- ball lit to your right and one 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.400
 kind of box that we're going to break and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.069
 followed we mounted a kind of 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.140
 lever we will give it and we will light 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.860
 then the second balls 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.710
 and we check how it turns on 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.540
 we would be one is not far away 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.940
 let's fly we climb up and we'll see 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.730
 a steel metal stone we are going to 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.460
 try one of the heroines of the 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.370
 s contract that exploits if badly not 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.780
 age memory 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.530
 it will not bring you red hair here is 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.720
 plastic r let's break it with a 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.610
 bombshell does not need to throw anything 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.360
 throw nothing if we do not have it then 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.400
 we can use any pump one of the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.350
 batman costume or any other 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.860
 character that can exploit these 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.980
 metals 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.650
 we have third on and now yes 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.730
 yeah let's get that character is the 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.000
 luxurious costume good is that other one that we 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:22.470
 it remains to block and unlock forgiveness 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.060
 after buying we are going to take the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.980
 candies 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.210
 I want it, let's talk about that 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.680
 south batman in art or as pronounced 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:36.240
 this character appeared for the first time 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.120
 in batman 113 in February 1958 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.750
 this story was titled Batman the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.050
 superman of the planet xy in this story 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.290
 the character is an alien named 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:54.090
 plane and that is from the southern planet in arc 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.450
 as shown in the suit in 2008 , a 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.700
 writer resurrected this concept but already 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.790
 here as a bruce half mental mess 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.590
 something psychological a trauma a 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:09.030
 bruce security personality 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.010
 subconscious in case your mind 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.140
 I was overwhelmed by trauma 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.960
 psychological good a subject that is 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.750
 complicated to explain did not come out very expensive 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.780
 25 thousand cheaper than the cat woman we 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.760
 is something that does is save adam 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.470
 Break all these chairs with only 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.840
 break the table and the chair on the side 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:33.300
 left or the chair we just throw away the 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.130
 the candles and the picture it appears 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.130
 our beloved fairies 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.590
 and we have completed the whole room full 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.300
 of trophies although if we want we can 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.120
 get one of the secrets this has not 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.039

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.249
 an achievement also for having found a 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.249
 hidden secret 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.870
