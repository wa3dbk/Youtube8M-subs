00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
 mr z and today we will continue to play u 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.299
 friend called minecraft poket 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.950
 edishn 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.990
 and specifically we will today 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.840
 consider the server and today we 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.349
 such a black server tp it is behind him 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.500
 hunger games 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.960
 so let's say hello to everyone so 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 got into a fight with currency there are Russians on the server 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.760
 And so go more precisely ip this server and 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.890
 the port will be in the description under the video and rather 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.320
 just in this video will be another server 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.399
 also hunger games but this map is like 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 she is not so well known for example players 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.920
 who play multiplayer well this 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.809
 I do not know the card because it is not there 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.340
 like for example i am so i play this 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.199
 map the second time you can say I already 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 but just tried to play here 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.079
 and such a corteco would not know the second card 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 will be more famous so everything and here we are 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.350
 let's start so let's collect things so 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.680
 fine already a little chest so generally super 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.840
 so let a man of stone 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.939
 jelly 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.520
 gold ball so let's see it 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.649
 should this start me 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.770
 I think so, let's not run away ka 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.140
 distracted 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.899
 so some house now we have it 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.899
 let's see but after we get dressed 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.969
 let's see if there is anyone such a lego 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:48.610
 there is nobody so let's go see the house 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:51.229
 open chests stupid secrets passes 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.069
 chests chests chests chests chests chests 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:59.500
 like there is no yes a chest is not here and 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:02.179
 we run then to the second floor but the main thing 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.619
 so someone here already beat and it seems to me 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:10.519
 something you do n't know where it is 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.230
 a little bit afraid a little bit of court so 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:15.920
 okay i will argue 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.230
 like no one creeps me is not 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.530
 may not please 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 of course, but such a rise is a little bit 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:30.200
 falls of course well, here we are at the very 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:33.459
 earth chessie moves but thank goodness i 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.170
 already magic to the frame 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.959
 so let's see what country 0 have a chest 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:45.200
 also no and so got home john on 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.569
 the roof so here it is chest pants 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.900
 the boots are great 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.120
 about sympathetic and what more than name 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.520
 so great pants he just not 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.100
 enough 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.830
 all down now for sure yeah for sure 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.470
 one cunning is already here by we leave him 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.450
 here and wait 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.150
 so now he is here 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.430
 where are you 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.810
 food hiv camera on even a little bit upstairs 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.020
 and then the chest 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.090
 there are a lot of floors, but I didnâ€™t know 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:25.880
 but of course for the first time because 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:31.360
 I play because she is so che for 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.360
 wily so live me 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:42.329
 They were killed me well, in general, I have shown you 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.670
 card partly even preserves principle 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.620
 not bad but the rep here is certainly not 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.390
 finalized by the fact that at the beginning all stand in 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.650
 one point as you can see and 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.200
 only when the game starts then well 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.319
 as if then all the positions 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.819
 distributed over the initial and again 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.930
 you can fight it from the very beginning 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.760
 certainly closer to the movie the hunger games 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.349
 but still it somehow think 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.920
 wrong could have had more time 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.950
 give players to collect loot so well in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.049
 general map examined and now let's 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.870
 meet you on the next server 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.789
 for me it will probably still not soon 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.010
 but for you it will be just one 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.690
 a moment so there is no a plug and 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.330
 video so we have a second server 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.820
 Here it is, there is such a card in the hunger 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.410
 games actually have it not 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.380
 my fictional statistics 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.750
 Well, because I have not played here 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.300
 I played multiplayer now you 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.510
 can understand not multiplayer by looking 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.000
 my previous video so here one 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.570
 man but i think we should here damn i 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.510
 the class did not choose the way so but nothing 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:05:00.620
 terrible by the way other things lie and 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.620
 creeps the sword terribly 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:13.639
 I can only go to find so great at all 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.639
 need to get dressed quickly 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:22.150
 so sword 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:27.430
 and will run immediately for this account to pull 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.430
 the main thing is not to know that I'm running after him 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:37.639
 so quite guess myself so come on 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.400
 dude dy 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.740
 I won 1 kilo me one victory in 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.450
 In general, well, look for them on this map 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.730
 in fact, that's from sulfur to me more 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.460
 love than that one because this card 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.740
 more famous i played here also on 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.790
 wilderness the previous time I have no one 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.040
 killed her did not win naturally like this 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.960
 that the desert is generally known at the map 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.930
 and this ball principle is also famous 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.840
 its card for multiplayer is removed but 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.190
 minus this server is that it is very 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.620
 rarely works that is 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:13.970
 and for you it was for a moment but for me 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.580
 it was well for about half an hour she was waiting i was 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:21.530
 I don't know why maybe this of course 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:23.600
 need to come here often I wanted 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.240
 quite rare well rather rare 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.280
 every minute 3 can be so if 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.010
 you got to this server then you big 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.140
 lucky and indeed for that too there 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.979
 not shown how many people on 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.010
 server and 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:41.210
 do they play in general okay what have you already 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:44.750
 started talking as you may have noticed on 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.150
 my channel contest is held so 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.560
 don't forget to link to it 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.710
 here now somewhere on the screen you see well 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.340
 But in general, that's all, let's go 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.300
