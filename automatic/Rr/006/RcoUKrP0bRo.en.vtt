00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.909
 well well 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.629
 these kids that I'm here after 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.430
 two weeks is worth the seven many 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.379
 good upload videos but I have already started 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.730
 the institute recently and well I have to 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.519
 study does it take to start 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 exams like crazy and good I have them 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:25.039
 to approve or if not I upload videos worth 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.310
 so first that before this is worth 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.140
 and tell you that although there are six active 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.789
 Youtube was not out of YouTube 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.410
 I've been trying some things 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.660
 minecraft testing the action commands 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 experiments give in when I pulled out a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.650
 little time and another time 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.990
 apart from for his day because he got it out of 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.150
 to play with my friend something yes is worth 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.390
 and well I come to bring a command that 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.150
 flame replace item is worth a command 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.950
 very interesting that is to replace 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.720
 you can replace replace one and I have 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.190
 a block is valid but the blockade is 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.790
 silly because that with a blog being 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.199
 you can but hey this is the 1.8 vale 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.970
 in case someone 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.660
 good 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.450
 this is the first command worth would be re 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.730
 pleasure and it's worth in you for 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.460
 select in the entity 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.560
 than to select an entity and so 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.600
 we put brackets type equal to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.760
 zombie is worth with his uppercase zeta and 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 we close the brackets specify 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.930
 we would make an entity in particular that in 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.030
 this case would be the zombie vale and now 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.700
 here we would put the armor point slot 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.190
 point head that that would be the helmet worth 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.110
 for example now we put minecraft two 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.240
 points diamond blog okay I'm not going to 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.710
 teach rather from here bars 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.290
 replay system entity or blog is valid in marmoset 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.850
 I for example that if a slot entity and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.830
 here we have all those in which 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.500
 We can put several containers in the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.330
 Inventory 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.800
 blas 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.400
 the armor when grinding knows love armor 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.500
 things 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.560
 Armor what I know and we can also 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.200
 change them from leander sets of someone from 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.420
 a person and good is to assign command 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.420
 we're going to do a bar dimes test 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.470
 I'm going to take it out here 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:21.260
 and the good of the fourth 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:25.720
 the kids hear clear 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.579

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.380

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.090
 puts those inches head forward and 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.320
 we can also do it with swords 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.970
 I do not remember we can put a 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.030
 sword 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.500

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.500
 times the club 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.659
 plausible 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.549
 in you I do not remember which was the 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.620
 the sword is exactly worth the hand 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.400
 but it has to be around here it's worth 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.250
 They must be the Moors 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.409
 I do not know how to look for it and if I find it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.459
 I'll leave in the description look at the 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.430

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.890
 example to these for the skeletons 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.410
 ok if we put that skeleton 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.390
 for example to put a little 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.849

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.409
 and it is put to the writings is this worth it 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.440
 can do with any motor that 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.590
 you can carry an object in your head worth 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.100
 and now this one here in free marmoset 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.570
