00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.969 

hello<00:00:00.510> everybody<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:01.439> have<00:00:01.589> been<00:00:01.709> getting<00:00:01.800> a

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hello everybody we have been getting a

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.470 
hello everybody we have been getting a
lot<00:00:02.070> of<00:00:02.190> questions<00:00:02.490> about<00:00:02.639> how<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> develop<00:00:03.389> a

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
lot of questions about how to develop a

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.930 
lot of questions about how to develop a
faster<00:00:03.840> articulation<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.609> would<00:00:05.790> say

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
faster articulation and what I would say

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.250 
faster articulation and what I would say
is<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.690> best<00:00:07.109> shortcut<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:08.900> no<00:00:09.900> shortcut

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
is that the best shortcut is no shortcut

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
is that the best shortcut is no shortcut
so<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.250> that<00:00:11.370> means<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
so what that means is that we have to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.240 
so what that means is that we have to
actually<00:00:12.809> practice<00:00:13.259> our<00:00:13.650> articulation

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
actually practice our articulation

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.460 
actually practice our articulation
constantly<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.540> make<00:00:15.660> sure<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
constantly just to make sure that the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.840 
constantly just to make sure that the
timing<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.550> more<00:00:18.480> natural<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.050> more<00:00:19.410> adroit

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
timing is more natural is more adroit

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
timing is more natural is more adroit
the<00:00:20.850> tongue<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.199> muscle<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.830> like

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the tongue is just a muscle just like

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
the tongue is just a muscle just like
anything<00:00:23.519> any<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.090> our<00:00:24.390> other<00:00:24.570> muscles<00:00:24.960> which

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
anything any of our other muscles which

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.439 
anything any of our other muscles which
means<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.580> don't<00:00:26.880> use<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.240> lose

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
means that if you don't use it you lose

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.490 
means that if you don't use it you lose
it<00:00:27.720> right<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.470> have<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> keep<00:00:28.830> working

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
it right so we have to keep working

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.680 
it right so we have to keep working
consistently<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.270> there<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.600> many

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
consistently on it there are so many

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.650 
consistently on it there are so many
different<00:00:34.140> exercises<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.130> do

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
different exercises that you can do

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
different exercises that you can do
there<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.690> many<00:00:36.899> books<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.430> would

there are many books and what I would
recommend<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.329> have<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.750> all<00:00:40.079> those<00:00:40.290> books

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
recommend is have out of all those books

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.389 
recommend is have out of all those books
the<00:00:41.070> ones<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> would<00:00:41.520> recommend<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.180> yes

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
make make sure that there's some

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
exercises that like the Stork staccato

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.580 
exercises that like the Stork staccato
studies<00:00:51.750> they're<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.140> good<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.530> they

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
studies they're very good because they

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.139 
studies they're very good because they
have<00:00:52.710> different<00:00:52.890> rhythms<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:54.000> can

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
have different rhythms and you can

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.639 
have different rhythms and you can
practice<00:00:54.629> those<00:00:54.930> things<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.320> actually

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
practice those things I actually

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.260 
practice those things I actually
practiced<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.399> Birman<00:00:56.760> scales<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.949> Oberman

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
practiced the Birman scales and Oberman

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.540 
practiced the Birman scales and Oberman
velocity<00:01:00.270> studies<00:01:00.690> just<00:01:01.320> completely<00:01:01.890> doing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
velocity studies just completely doing

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.299 
velocity studies just completely doing
it<00:01:02.670> nice<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:02.969> slowly<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:03.809> they<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.379> some

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it nice and slowly because they are some

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
it nice and slowly because they are some
of<00:01:05.400> them<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.729> easy<00:01:06.270> enough<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:07.140> be

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
of them are easy enough that you can be

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.289 
of them are easy enough that you can be
playing<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> low<00:01:07.979> register<00:01:08.299> and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
playing in the low register and

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
playing in the low register and
therefore<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.500> concentrate<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
therefore you can concentrate on the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
therefore you can concentrate on the
tongue<00:01:11.970> instead<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.510> having<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.049> try<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.290> play

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
tongue instead of having to try to play

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.270 
tongue instead of having to try to play
a<00:01:14.520> lot<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.060> notes<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:16.040> considering<00:01:17.040> just

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a lot of notes and considering just

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
a lot of notes and considering just
getting<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> accuracy<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> note<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
getting the accuracy of the note so you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.530 
getting the accuracy of the note so you
go<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.110> something<00:01:19.320> simple<00:01:19.470> and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
go with something simple and

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.070 
go with something simple and
consistently<00:01:21.540> okay

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
consistently okay

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.440 
consistently okay
then<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.950> thing<00:01:23.159> about<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.520> nowadays<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.270> have

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
then the thing about if nowadays we have

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
then the thing about if nowadays we have
these<00:01:24.600> little<00:01:24.869> DS<00:01:25.350> or<00:01:25.560> metronomes<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.250> tuners

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
these little DS or metronomes and tuners

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.929 
these little DS or metronomes and tuners
that<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:27.930> use<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.759> would

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that we can use and what I would

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.690 
that we can use and what I would
recommend<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.450> think<00:01:30.810> about<00:01:30.900> getting<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.700> an

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
recommend is think about getting a an

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.830 
recommend is think about getting a an
exercise<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.360> do<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
exercise that you can do at a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.020 
exercise that you can do at a
comfortable<00:01:34.439> campus<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.189> hundred<00:01:35.490> if

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
comfortable campus a at a hundred if

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.149 
comfortable campus a at a hundred if
we're<00:01:36.210> doing<00:01:36.479> something<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:51.060 

and<00:01:42.640> then<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.210> have<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.420> articulation<00:01:50.070> okay

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
and then we have the articulation okay

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.429 
and then we have the articulation okay
so<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.000> around<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.450> hundred<00:01:53.020> maybe<00:01:53.350> a

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
so that is around a hundred maybe a

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.830 
so that is around a hundred maybe a
little<00:01:53.590> bit<00:01:53.740> faster<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.520> if<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.909> give

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
little bit faster but if we give

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.450 
little bit faster but if we give
ourselves<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.409> commitment<00:01:56.920> okay<00:01:57.130> we're

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
ourselves the commitment okay we're

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.940 
ourselves the commitment okay we're
going<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.759> just<00:01:58.000> do<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.179> one<00:01:58.840> notch<00:01:59.140> only<00:01:59.770> one

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
going to just do it one notch only one

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.550 
going to just do it one notch only one
notch<00:02:00.130> per<00:02:00.789> week<00:02:01.179> okay<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.929> same<00:02:02.170> little

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
notch per week okay the same little

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.139 
notch per week okay the same little
boring<00:02:02.740> exercise<00:02:03.189> but<00:02:03.549> we<00:02:03.670> practice<00:02:03.970> every

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
boring exercise but we practice every

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.870 
boring exercise but we practice every
day<00:02:04.569> and<00:02:04.720> we<00:02:05.170> just<00:02:05.200> go<00:02:05.560> with<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:05.950> notch<00:02:06.220> okay

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
day and we just go with one notch okay

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.910 
day and we just go with one notch okay
and<00:02:07.299> we<00:02:07.720> do<00:02:07.869> it<00:02:08.019> like<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.229> consistently<00:02:08.769> for

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
and we do it like that consistently for

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.919 
and we do it like that consistently for
a<00:02:08.950> whole<00:02:09.160> year<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:09.580> means<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.819> we<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.149> 52

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
a whole year that means that we get 52

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.040 
a whole year that means that we get 52
notches<00:02:11.590> okay<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.910> at<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.630> beginning<00:02:13.720> when

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
notches okay now at the beginning when

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.410 
notches okay now at the beginning when
you<00:02:14.110> go<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.290> from<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.769> comfortable<00:02:15.220> 100<00:02:15.970> or<00:02:16.120> 80

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
you go in from the comfortable 100 or 80

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.770 
you go in from the comfortable 100 or 80
and<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.019> 81<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.769> then<00:02:17.980> 22<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.760> 23<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.420> little

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
and to 81 and then 22 and 23 and little

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.009 
and to 81 and then 22 and 23 and little
thing<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:19.989> that<00:02:20.170> at<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.560> beginning<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:21.099> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
thing so that at the beginning the the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.420 
thing so that at the beginning the the
moving<00:02:23.019> of<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.440> notch<00:02:23.560> will<00:02:23.830> seem<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.220> it's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
moving of the notch will seem that it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.250 
moving of the notch will seem that it's
insignificant<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.690> actually<00:02:25.989> great

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
insignificant and that is actually great

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.140 
insignificant and that is actually great
because<00:02:26.830> when<00:02:27.370> you're<00:02:27.519> going<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.880> faster

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
because when you're going to the faster

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.059 
because when you're going to the faster
tempos<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.410> same<00:02:29.590> thing<00:02:29.769> when<00:02:29.950> you're

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
tempos that's the same thing when you're

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.820 
tempos that's the same thing when you're
getting<00:02:30.160> from<00:02:30.430> 140<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.090> 141<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.780> 142<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.319> 143

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
getting from 140 to 141 to 142 to 143

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.650 
getting from 140 to 141 to 142 to 143
it<00:02:33.190> will<00:02:33.430> feel<00:02:33.610> like<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.510> need

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
it will feel like that so all you need

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
it will feel like that so all you need
to<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.049> to<00:02:35.260> commit<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.459> will

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
to do is to commit to it and you will

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:45.290 
to do is to commit to it and you will
get<00:02:36.819> it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.360
