00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.450
 you like to sing but sometime your 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.760
 comrades have told you that you do not serve 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.549
 for that do not listen to them and tomato 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.890
 example of Pablo Mengual as because in 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.570
 class saw no very sea charm and so here 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.570
 I'll try a bit to improve 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.320
 like Pablo 85 students from 7 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.300
 and 17 years of school ramÃ³n and cajal have 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.390
 decided to dedicate three days of the week 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.610
 to rehearse and give voice to this choir 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.160
 I come to the choir because I love to sing and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.399
 send me sign up to sing with the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.399
 the rest 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.680
 we sing in a lot of places and I do not know 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.750
 and the environment is also very we are all 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 friends even if there are small children and 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 greater 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.590
 in this way and without realizing they have 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.590
 given the first step to make music in 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.470
 group its only instrument the voice that at 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.500
 sing songs different styles with 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.360
 other children and to have to act all 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.240
 that's why the first thing develops the first 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.220
 heard and then also good their culture in 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.740
 general because they know music the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.420
 different styles of different places 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.940
 a way to connect with music and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.450
 with group experiences because the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.070
 know new people and because I 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.140
 I had a great time with my friends 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.000
 develops in the ear and make theirs 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.750
 such special issues as the trial 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 without you from u2 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530
 the child 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680
 raise your voice for solidarity purposes we have 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.300
 recorded a CD and we have dedicated all the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.300
 all the benefits to caritas 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.840
 and above all they realize that wanting is 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.400
 can I sing badly then I'm not 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.600
 here in the chorus then it means that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.600
 I sing at least something good
