from<00:02:20.510> last<00:02:20.750> year<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.370> think<00:02:22.370> I've<00:02:22.640> gotten

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
from last year I think I've gotten

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.920 
from last year I think I've gotten
better<00:02:22.940> because<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:23.660> many<00:02:23.780> great

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
better because we have so many great

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.809 
better because we have so many great
players<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.319> practice<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.950> push<00:02:25.160> me<00:02:25.340> easy

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
players in practice to push me easy

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.890 
players in practice to push me easy
I<00:02:25.940> think<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.270> difference<00:02:26.420> wing<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.780> uh

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
I think the difference wing that uh

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.440 
I think the difference wing that uh
slasher<00:02:27.500> enough<00:02:28.190> six<00:02:28.400> years<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.819> now<00:02:28.880> we<00:02:29.060> have

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
slasher enough six years and now we have

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.720 
slasher enough six years and now we have
ten<00:02:30.110> eleven<00:02:30.500> players<00:02:30.680> are<00:02:30.860> gonna<00:02:30.950> play<00:02:31.040> yeah

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
ten eleven players are gonna play yeah

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.040 
ten eleven players are gonna play yeah

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050
