that in the future maybe possibly with a
software<00:03:04.620> update<00:03:05.040> which<00:03:05.280> brings<00:03:06.120> me<00:03:06.240> to<00:03:06.270> my

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
software update which brings me to my

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.360 
software update which brings me to my
next<00:03:07.230> point<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.710> that<00:03:07.740> there's<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.070> lack<00:03:08.340> of

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
next point is that there's a lack of

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.190 
next point is that there's a lack of
third-party<00:03:09.120> apps<00:03:09.330> on<00:03:09.570> here<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.020> that's

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
third-party apps on here so that's

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.970 
third-party apps on here so that's
something<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.440> would<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.650> liked<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:10.800> have

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
