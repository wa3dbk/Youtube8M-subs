make money playing poker online it's not

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.400 
make money playing poker online it's not
as<00:00:17.130> easy<00:00:17.250> as<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.550> just<00:00:17.730> made<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.880> sound<00:00:18.260> but<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
as easy as I just made it sound but in a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990 
as easy as I just made it sound but in a
way<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> guess<00:00:19.710> it's<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.400> hard<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.850> may

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
way I guess it's not as hard as you may

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.380 
way I guess it's not as hard as you may
think<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.570> sort<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.840> swings<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.350> roundabouts

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
think it sort of swings and roundabouts

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.200 
think it sort of swings and roundabouts
but<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> wasted<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.590> lot<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.189> time<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
but I wasted a lot of my time in the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.050 
but I wasted a lot of my time in the
early<00:00:27.570> years<00:00:27.859> so<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.890> try<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> learn<00:00:29.429> techniques

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
early years so I try to learn techniques

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.389 
early years so I try to learn techniques
and<00:00:30.480> other<00:00:30.630> Assisting<00:00:31.230> programs<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.070> try<00:00:32.279> and

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and other Assisting programs to try and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.850 
and other Assisting programs to try and
get<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.700> edge<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:32.910> were<00:00:33.510> either<00:00:33.780> too<00:00:34.230> hard

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
get an edge that were either too hard

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.970 
get an edge that were either too hard
for<00:00:35.010> me<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.969> sort<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> concept<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.860> at

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
for me to sort of get a concept of at

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.450 
for me to sort of get a concept of at
the<00:00:38.070> time<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:38.940> total<00:00:39.540> bullshit<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:41.370> I'm

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the time or just total bullshit so I'm

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
the time or just total bullshit so I'm
making<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.850> short<00:00:42.059> tutorial<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.989> refine<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.530> ten

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
making a short tutorial to refine my ten

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
making a short tutorial to refine my ten
years<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> experience<00:00:44.550> into<00:00:44.789> something<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
years of experience into something that

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
years of experience into something that
can<00:00:45.570> help<00:00:45.600> my<00:00:45.899> friends<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> anyone<00:00:47.070> else<00:00:47.309> who

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
two years as a losing player before I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
two years as a losing player before I
even<00:00:56.670> looked<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.270> my<00:00:57.420> game<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.379> point

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
even looked at my game and at that point

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
even looked at my game and at that point
was<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.219> i<00:00:59.250> bought<00:00:59.609> Doyle<00:01:00.359> Brunson's<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
really worth a read but at the same time

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.179 
really worth a read but at the same time
I<00:01:14.790> also<00:01:15.090> found<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.960> problem<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.770> had<00:01:16.950> with

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
I also found my problem that I had with

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490 
I also found my problem that I had with
it<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.939> very<00:01:18.270> open<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.080> had<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> lot

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
it was it was very open and it had a lot

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
it was it was very open and it had a lot
of<00:01:19.530> content<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:21.000> also<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.390> few

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of content but it was also very few

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.570 
of content but it was also very few
practical<00:01:22.259> examples<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.430> sometimes

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
practical examples which can sometimes

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.510 
practical examples which can sometimes
leave<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> hard<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> grasp<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
leave it hard to grasp because you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.920 
leave it hard to grasp because you
couldn't<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:26.909> relate<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.720> certain

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
couldn't really relate to certain

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.899 
couldn't really relate to certain
aspects<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> game<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> you'd<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.490> into

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
aspects of the game that you'd get into

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.240 
aspects of the game that you'd get into
where<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:31.200> wouldn't<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.710> what<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> do

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
where you wouldn't know what to do

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
where you wouldn't know what to do
because<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.820> books<00:01:33.060> I've<00:01:33.420> explained<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
because the books I've explained it so

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.609 
because the books I've explained it so
broadly<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.869> was<00:01:36.869> wanting<00:01:37.200> more<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
broadly and I was wanting more of a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
broadly and I was wanting more of a
system<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.220> sort<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:39.119> just<00:01:39.150> straight<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
system that sort of was just straight to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
system that sort of was just straight to
implement<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.380> knew<00:01:40.619> what<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:40.950> doing<00:01:41.329> so

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
implement I knew what I was doing so

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.870 
implement I knew what I was doing so
that<00:01:42.720> didn't<00:01:42.990> really<00:01:43.079> suit<00:01:43.380> me<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:44.340> also<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that didn't really suit me and also the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.880 
that didn't really suit me and also the
book<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.240> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.600> got<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> super<00:01:46.530> system

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
book now if you got it the super system

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.999 
book now if you got it the super system
too<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.540> dated<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.740> guess

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
too but it's also very dated but I guess

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.499 
too but it's also very dated but I guess
at<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> same<00:01:50.369> time<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> game<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> poker<00:01:51.270> has

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
at the same time the game of poker has

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
at the same time the game of poker has
been<00:01:51.659> around<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.110> long<00:01:52.259> enough<00:01:52.470> time<00:01:52.710> too<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
been around a long enough time too so I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.620 
been around a long enough time too so I
guess<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.729> could<00:01:53.850> say<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> same<00:01:54.149> rules<00:01:54.540> apply

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
guess you could say the same rules apply

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.760 
guess you could say the same rules apply
to<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:57.060> what<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> moved<00:01:58.110> onto<00:01:58.320> after

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to that but then what I moved onto after

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.459 
to that but then what I moved onto after
reading<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.340> book<00:01:59.610> was<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.509> online<00:02:00.869> forums

through<00:02:37.959> freds<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.410> found<00:02:38.680> nothing<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.160> use

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
through freds and found nothing of use

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.330 
through freds and found nothing of use
because<00:02:39.790> that's<00:02:40.030> sort<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.450> just<00:02:40.660> how<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.340> it

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
can take some time to get used to all

can take some time to get used to all
the<00:02:43.930> lingo<00:02:44.140> as<00:02:44.349> well<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.769> you're<00:02:44.890> new<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.160> the

the lingo as well if you're new to the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.280 
the lingo as well if you're new to the
game<00:02:45.489> in<00:02:45.670> terms<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.030> simplistic<00:02:46.450> stuff<00:02:46.989> like

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
game in terms of simplistic stuff like

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.520 
game in terms of simplistic stuff like
CEO<00:02:48.220> meaning<00:02:48.760> cut<00:02:49.000> off<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.540> SB<00:02:50.019> meaning<00:02:50.380> small

CEO meaning cut off and SB meaning small

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.979 
CEO meaning cut off and SB meaning small
blind<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.430> list<00:02:51.610> goes<00:02:51.700> on<00:02:52.030> obviously

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
blind and the list goes on obviously

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.050 
blind and the list goes on obviously
these<00:02:53.140> are<00:02:53.200> really<00:02:53.440> simplistic<00:02:53.860> examples<00:02:54.819> but

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
these are really simplistic examples but

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.880 
these are really simplistic examples but
you<00:02:55.209> do<00:02:55.360> need<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.720> learn<00:02:56.110> them<00:02:56.350> because<00:02:56.680> it's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
you do need to learn them because it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.250 
you do need to learn them because it's
also<00:02:57.370> relevant<00:02:57.790> within<00:02:58.209> books<00:02:58.480> as<00:02:58.810> well<00:02:58.959> they

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
also relevant within books as well they

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.850 
also relevant within books as well they
use<00:02:59.440> these<00:02:59.680> abbreviations<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.590> having<00:03:02.830> done

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
use these abbreviations so having done

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.070 
use these abbreviations so having done
that<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.340> played<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.610> game<00:03:03.730> for<00:03:03.849> about<00:03:04.090> four

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
fast them by trying to reinvent the game

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.140 
fast them by trying to reinvent the game
its<00:05:09.250> myself<00:05:09.580> so<00:05:10.120> I<00:05:10.180> think<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:12.580> downside

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
its myself so I think and the downside

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.790 
its myself so I think and the downside
to<00:05:13.390> it<00:05:13.420> is<00:05:13.810> that<00:05:13.840> I've<00:05:14.110> probably<00:05:14.320> got<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.560> bigger

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
to it is that I've probably got a bigger

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.710 
to it is that I've probably got a bigger
ego<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.370> I<00:05:15.400> did<00:05:15.760> before<00:05:15.910> but<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.420> guess<00:05:16.480> that

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
ego now I did before but I guess that

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.890 
ego now I did before but I guess that
comes<00:05:16.960> with<00:05:17.170> success<00:05:18.150> so<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.210> hope<00:05:19.390> this<00:05:19.510> video

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
comes with success so I hope this video

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.600 
comes with success so I hope this video

which I'm glad to say it feels great and

which I'm glad to say it feels great and
for<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.640> past<00:05:39.790> couple<00:05:39.970> of<00:05:40.120> years<00:05:40.210> my<00:05:40.600> stats

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
for the past couple of years my stats

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.500 
for the past couple of years my stats
have<00:05:41.200> took<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.410> real<00:05:41.620> upturn<00:05:42.070> about<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.180> week

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
have took a real upturn about a week

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.470 
have took a real upturn about a week
after<00:05:43.900> reading<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.740> book<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:46.210> I've<00:05:46.330> never

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
after reading the book and I've never

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.000 
after reading the book and I've never
looked<00:05:46.600> back<00:05:46.930> to<00:05:47.140> be<00:05:47.230> honest<00:05:47.530> I<00:05:47.650> guess<00:05:47.830> it's

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
looked back to be honest I guess it's

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.160 
looked back to be honest I guess it's
lucky<00:05:48.130> that<00:05:48.310> the<00:05:48.580> variance<00:05:49.060> went<00:05:49.570> my<00:05:49.720> way<00:05:49.930> in

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.170 
lucky that the variance went my way in

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.870 
lucky that the variance went my way in
terms<00:05:50.350> of<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.650> had<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.890> up<00:05:50.980> string<00:05:51.250> straight

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
terms of I had the up string straight

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.980 
terms of I had the up string straight
away<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:52.180> didn't<00:05:52.480> really<00:05:52.570> have<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.780> big

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
away and didn't really have a big

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.950 
away and didn't really have a big
downfall<00:05:53.250> but<00:05:54.250> over<00:05:54.790> the<00:05:54.820> time<00:05:55.090> about<00:05:55.330> of<00:05:55.720> the

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
downfall but over the time about of the

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.050 
downfall but over the time about of the
two<00:05:56.110> years<00:05:56.320> I've<00:05:56.440> had<00:05:56.530> variance<00:05:57.040> but<00:05:57.310> who

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
two years I've had variance but who

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.610 
two years I've had variance but who
doesn't<00:05:58.330> to<00:05:58.630> be<00:05:58.690> honest<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:59.050> book<00:05:59.200> stop<00:05:59.470> me<00:05:59.590> a

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.170 
was to now be in positive figures of
around<00:06:07.420> 25k<00:06:08.050> over<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:08.710> past<00:06:08.920> two<00:06:09.100> years<00:06:09.340> I<00:06:09.520> can
