I've<00:00:18.270> enjoyed<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.900> car<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> lot<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.650> one<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
I've enjoyed the car a lot but one of

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.250 
I've enjoyed the car a lot but one of
the<00:00:20.010> headlights<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:20.670> burned<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.240> after<00:00:21.750> four

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
the headlights has burned out after four

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
the headlights has burned out after four
years<00:00:22.500> now<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
years now so I'm going to do a

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630 
years now so I'm going to do a
replacement<00:00:24.600> today<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.490> one<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
replacement today and one of the

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.250 
replacement today and one of the
headlights<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> still<00:00:27.330> good<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:27.930> thought<00:00:28.170> it

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
headlights is still good so I thought it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
headlights is still good so I thought it
would<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> good<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.220> replace<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.300> bulb

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
would be a good time to replace the bulb

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.560 
would be a good time to replace the bulb
and<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> comparison<00:00:31.349> test<00:00:32.120> for<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> stock

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and do a comparison test for the stock

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.310 
and do a comparison test for the stock
light<00:00:34.500> bulbs<00:00:34.860> versus<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.640> new<00:00:36.320> Sylvania

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
Silver Star ultras now the ultras are

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
Silver Star ultras now the ultras are
popular<00:00:41.160> they're<00:00:41.280> supposed<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> bit

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
popular they're supposed to be a bit

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
popular they're supposed to be a bit
brighter<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.649> some<00:00:43.649> people<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:43.950> said<00:00:44.129> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
brighter and some people have said that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.000 
brighter and some people have said that
they<00:00:44.460> don't<00:00:44.489> last<00:00:45.030> quite<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.510> long

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
they don't last quite as long

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.110 
they don't last quite as long
obviously<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.070> can't<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.370> test<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.760> part

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
obviously I can't really test that part

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.299 
obviously I can't really test that part
out<00:00:48.270> yet<00:00:48.300> but<00:00:48.989> hopefully<00:00:49.379> I'll<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.980> least<00:00:50.010> get

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
out yet but hopefully I'll at least get

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.310 
out yet but hopefully I'll at least get
a<00:00:50.760> year<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.660> them

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a year or two out of them

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
a year or two out of them
these<00:00:52.649> were<00:00:53.239> $49<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.510> our<00:00:55.289> local<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.430> riley<00:00:56.969> auto

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
these were $49 at our local a riley auto

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.920 
these were $49 at our local a riley auto
parts<00:00:57.510> store<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:59.280> we're<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
parts store so what we're going to do is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.389 
parts store so what we're going to do is
take<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> stock<00:01:01.800> light<00:01:02.039> bulb<00:01:02.250> that's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
take out the stock light bulb that's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
take out the stock light bulb that's
burned<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.000> replace<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
burned out and replace it with one of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.039 
burned out and replace it with one of
these<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:05.189> will<00:01:05.400> do<00:01:05.580> some<00:01:05.939> video<00:01:06.600> footage

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
these and I will do some video footage

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
difference looks like between these and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
difference looks like between these and
the<00:01:10.890> original<00:01:11.659> hopefully<00:01:12.659> give<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> good

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

review<00:01:13.350> these<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.780> shown<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:16.049> say<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.650> can

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
review these are shown they say they can

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
review these are shown they say they can
be<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> 50<00:01:17.400> percent<00:01:17.520> brighter<00:01:18.060> obviously

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
be up to 50 percent brighter obviously

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.270 
be up to 50 percent brighter obviously
they<00:01:19.140> probably<00:01:19.380> aren't<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> full

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
they probably aren't going to be a full

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.359 
they probably aren't going to be a full
50<00:01:20.670> percent<00:01:21.030> brighter<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.220> with

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
50 percent brighter but you know with

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.859 
50 percent brighter but you know with
that<00:01:23.520> kind<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> advertising<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.420> means<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that kind of advertising that means that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.539 
that kind of advertising that means that
it<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.200> up<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.100> might<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.250> 10

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
it can be up to so it might be 10

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.120 
it can be up to so it might be 10
percent<00:01:26.670> brighter<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.390> 20<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.080> never<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
percent brighter or 20 you never know so

for<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.200> package<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.890> shows<00:01:59.130> lifespan<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
for this package it shows lifespan and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.109 
for this package it shows lifespan and
this<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> standard<00:02:01.710> bulb<00:02:01.950> extra<00:02:02.939> vision

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
this is a standard bulb extra vision

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.469 
this is a standard bulb extra vision
cool<00:02:03.630> blue<00:02:04.729> standard<00:02:05.729> silver<00:02:05.939> star<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.360> the

cool blue standard silver star in the
Silver<00:02:06.750> Star<00:02:06.930> ultra<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.489> lot<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
Silver Star ultra and you see a lot of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.380 
Silver Star ultra and you see a lot of
the<00:02:09.300> light<00:02:10.819> comparison<00:02:11.819> showing<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.180> one's

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
the light comparison showing this one's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.760 
the light comparison showing this one's
gonna<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> lot<00:02:12.780> brighter

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
gonna be a lot brighter

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.010 
gonna be a lot brighter
but<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> lifespan<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.970> one<00:02:15.390> compared<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> a

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but the lifespan is a one compared to a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.160 
but the lifespan is a one compared to a
1<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.320> 2<00:02:16.530> 2<00:02:16.950> or<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> 4<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.390> these<00:02:18.780> aren't<00:02:18.990> going<00:02:19.110> to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
1 a 2 2 or a 4 so these aren't going to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.410 
1 a 2 2 or a 4 so these aren't going to
last<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.680> long<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.640> something<00:02:21.300> that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
last as long and that's something that

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.750 
last as long and that's something that
they're<00:02:21.660> telling<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.140> upfront<00:02:22.440> from<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
they're telling you upfront from the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.140 
they're telling you upfront from the
manufacturer<00:02:23.760> they're<00:02:23.910> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.090> be

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
manufacturer they're going to be

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.310 
manufacturer they're going to be
brighter<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:24.690> they're<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:24.930> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.110> last

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
brighter but they're not going to last

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.430 
brighter but they're not going to last
as<00:02:25.530> long<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.100> for<00:02:27.060> those<00:02:27.720> looking<00:02:28.050> for<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.230> long

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
as long so for those looking for a long

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.990 
as long so for those looking for a long
life<00:02:28.650> bulb<00:02:28.980> these<00:02:29.250> probably<00:02:29.580> aren't<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.910> to

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
life bulb these probably aren't going to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880 
life bulb these probably aren't going to
be<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.330> but<00:02:30.630> let's<00:02:30.840> continue<00:02:31.320> on<00:02:31.650> we'll<00:02:31.800> see

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
be it but let's continue on we'll see

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.800 
be it but let's continue on we'll see
what<00:02:31.980> our<00:02:32.010> comparison<00:02:32.520> looks<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.630> it's

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
what our comparison looks like so it's

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.150 
what our comparison looks like so it's
hard<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.110> show<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.410> brightness<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.950> think

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
hard to show the brightness I think

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.830 
hard to show the brightness I think
showing<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> beams<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.270> garage<00:02:36.510> is

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
showing the beams on the garage is

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.960 
showing the beams on the garage is
probably<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.260> best<00:02:37.500> way<00:02:37.770> for<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.700> show<00:02:38.850> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
probably the best way for to show the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.360 
probably the best way for to show the
difference<00:02:39.360> in<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.570> beams<00:02:40.040> brightness<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.340> I

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
difference in the beams brightness but I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.550 
difference in the beams brightness but I
will<00:02:41.670> show<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.240> width<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.750> quite<00:02:43.290> different

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
will show the width is quite different

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.510 
will show the width is quite different
on<00:02:43.800> these<00:02:43.980> two<00:02:44.630> looking<00:02:45.630> over<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.020> left<00:02:46.520> front

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
on these two looking over the left front

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.250 
on these two looking over the left front
this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.970> driver<00:02:48.210> side<00:02:48.480> front<00:02:48.900> corner<00:02:49.230> of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
this is the driver side front corner of

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.710 
this is the driver side front corner of
the<00:02:49.440> car<00:02:49.680> you'll<00:02:50.340> see<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.670> lit<00:02:50.940> up<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.600> is

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the car you'll see it's lit up this is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.540 
the car you'll see it's lit up this is
looking<00:02:51.930> down<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.290> an<00:02:52.380> angle<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:53.280> lit<00:02:53.430> up

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
looking down at an angle it's lit up

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.360 
looking down at an angle it's lit up
pretty<00:02:53.760> good<00:02:53.850> over<00:02:54.750> there<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.560> if<00:02:56.100> we<00:02:56.190> look

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
pretty good over there and if we look

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.820 
pretty good over there and if we look
over<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.910> right<00:02:57.120> side<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.780> that's<00:02:58.530> aimed

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
over to the right side and that's aimed

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.250 
over to the right side and that's aimed
right<00:02:59.070> off<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.490> right<00:02:59.930> angle<00:03:00.930> you'll<00:03:01.080> see

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
right off the right angle you'll see

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.430 
right off the right angle you'll see
that<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.770> lot<00:03:01.950> darker<00:03:02.280> over<00:03:02.870> past<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
that it's a lot darker over past on the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.580 
that it's a lot darker over past on the
right<00:03:04.890> quarter<00:03:05.220> panel<00:03:05.550> there<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.850> front<00:03:06.120> tire

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
right quarter panel there the front tire

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.930 
right quarter panel there the front tire
front<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:07.860> tire<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.520> you'll<00:03:08.670> see<00:03:08.820> it's

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
front right tire so you'll see it's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.690 
front right tire so you'll see it's
quite<00:03:09.210> dark<00:03:09.420> over<00:03:09.780> there<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.920> lot<00:03:11.130> more<00:03:11.190> lit

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
quite dark over there and a lot more lit

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.760 
quite dark over there and a lot more lit
up<00:03:11.880> over<00:03:12.480> on<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.840> side

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
up over on this side

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.530 
up over on this side
definitely<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.430> wider<00:03:14.700> beam<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.210> noticed

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
definitely a wider beam I noticed

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.150 
definitely a wider beam I noticed
driving<00:03:15.960> not<00:03:16.140> during<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.530> test<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.130> was

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
driving not during the test that it was

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.570 
driving not during the test that it was
a<00:03:17.280> lot<00:03:17.520> brighter<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.570> lot<00:03:18.750> whiter<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.770> wider

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
a lot brighter and a lot whiter so wider

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.120 
a lot brighter and a lot whiter so wider
and<00:03:20.880> width<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.450> terms<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.200> beam<00:03:22.410> let's<00:03:23.010> go

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
and width in terms of the beam let's go

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.680 
and width in terms of the beam let's go
up<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.400> show<00:03:23.760> him<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.150> garage<00:03:24.330> door<00:03:24.600> and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
up and show him on the garage door and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.410 
up and show him on the garage door and
just<00:03:24.840> see<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:24.959> difference<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:25.500> brightness

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.290 

okay<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.290> not<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.830> most<00:03:29.950> scientific<00:03:30.160> as<00:03:31.090> we

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
okay so not the most scientific as we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.580 
okay so not the most scientific as we
are<00:03:31.420> in<00:03:31.600> real<00:03:31.750> life<00:03:31.990> here<00:03:32.230> but<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.560> really

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
are in real life here but this is really

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.740 
are in real life here but this is really
real<00:03:33.280> life<00:03:33.520> results<00:03:34.060> so<00:03:34.270> on<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.569> right<00:03:34.720> side

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
real life results so on the right side

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.130 
real life results so on the right side
you'll<00:03:35.200> see<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:36.030> passenger<00:03:37.030> light<00:03:37.810> on<00:03:38.050> the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
you'll see the passenger light on the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.020 
you'll see the passenger light on the
right<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.980> left<00:03:39.160> is<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.550> driver's

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
right and on the left is the driver's

right and on the left is the driver's
side<00:03:40.150> which<00:03:40.390> replaced<00:03:40.870> with<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.230> Sylvania

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
side which replaced with the Sylvania

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.750 
side which replaced with the Sylvania
light<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.850> new<00:03:43.000> ultra<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.140> you'll<00:03:45.070> see<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.430> so

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
light the new ultra and you'll see it so

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.730 
light the new ultra and you'll see it so
whiter<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.480> terms<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.200> light<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.410> don't

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
whiter in terms of the light I don't

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.720 
whiter in terms of the light I don't
know<00:03:47.800> how<00:03:47.890> well<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.130> cameras<00:03:48.400> going<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.610> pick

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
know how well the cameras going to pick

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.370 
know how well the cameras going to pick
it<00:03:48.850> up<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.209> is<00:03:49.240> quite<00:03:49.570> a<00:03:49.630> bit<00:03:49.840> brighter<00:03:50.140> and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
it up but it is quite a bit brighter and

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.370 
it up but it is quite a bit brighter and
it<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.800> whiter<00:03:51.190> in<00:03:52.000> terms<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.080> actual

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
it is whiter in terms of the actual

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.280 
it is whiter in terms of the actual
colors<00:03:53.830> so<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.520> not<00:03:55.239> fifty<00:03:55.630> percent<00:03:55.959> brighter

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
colors so and not fifty percent brighter

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.930 
colors so and not fifty percent brighter
is<00:03:56.500> advertised<00:03:56.980> on<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.220> packaging<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:57.819> they

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
is advertised on the packaging but they

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.570 
is advertised on the packaging but they
did<00:03:58.060> say<00:03:58.239> up<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.510> 50<00:03:59.020> percent<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.680> I'd<00:03:59.890> say<00:04:00.160> it's

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
did say up to 50 percent so I'd say it's

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.699 
did say up to 50 percent so I'd say it's
probably<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:01.030> good<00:04:01.239> 25<00:04:01.780> percent<00:04:02.170> brighter<00:04:02.470> than

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
probably a good 25 percent brighter than

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.670 
probably a good 25 percent brighter than
the<00:04:02.830> original<00:04:03.250> stock<00:04:03.550> bulb<00:04:04.290> you<00:04:05.290> know<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.410> have

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
the original stock bulb you know I have

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.259 
the original stock bulb you know I have

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
read the Honda Element owners say than

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.570 
read the Honda Element owners say than
these<00:04:07.420> things<00:04:07.660> only<00:04:07.900> last<00:04:08.140> about<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.470> year<00:04:08.580> in

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
these things only last about a year in

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.220 
these things only last about a year in
some<00:04:09.850> cars<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.239> particularly<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.989> Honda

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
some cars and particularly the Honda

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.050 
some cars and particularly the Honda
elements<00:04:11.650> which<00:04:11.800> we<00:04:11.980> replaced<00:04:12.519> it<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:12.760> today

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
elements which we replaced it in today

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.400 
elements which we replaced it in today
so<00:04:14.070> overall<00:04:15.480> definitely<00:04:16.480> they<00:04:16.810> do<00:04:17.140> what<00:04:17.290> they

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
so overall definitely they do what they

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.890 
so overall definitely they do what they
say<00:04:17.590> they<00:04:17.769> do<00:04:17.829> they're<00:04:18.280> brighter<00:04:18.609> they<00:04:19.180> are<00:04:19.540> a

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
say they do they're brighter they are a

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.830 
say they do they're brighter they are a
whiter<00:04:20.200> kind<00:04:20.950> of<00:04:21.130> color<00:04:21.579> they<00:04:22.150> are<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.360> wider

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
whiter kind of color they are a wider

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.380 
whiter kind of color they are a wider
and<00:04:23.200> with<00:04:23.590> beams<00:04:24.100> so<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.460> get<00:04:24.640> more<00:04:24.910> out<00:04:25.270> to

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
and with beams so you get more out to

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.080 
and with beams so you get more out to
the<00:04:25.630> side<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.550> definitely<00:04:27.550> brighter<00:04:27.880> than

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
the side and definitely brighter than

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.820 
the side and definitely brighter than
the<00:04:28.240> stock<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:28.900> as<00:04:29.200> long<00:04:29.380> as<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.560> don't<00:04:29.650> mind

replacing them on a shorter period of

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.900

time<00:04:32.400> definitely<00:04:33.400> give<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.610> a<00:04:33.640> little<00:04:33.760> bit

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
brighter night vision so hopefully this

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.170 
brighter night vision so hopefully this
