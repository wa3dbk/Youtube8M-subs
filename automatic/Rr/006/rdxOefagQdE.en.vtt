00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.549
 I spend time on it and in the meantime 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.710
 will do makeup and would like you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.080

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.119
 this season if you're interested then 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.519
 look further as the last tone 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.430
 time i favor such can korean 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.019
 love cream from for tony moth he has 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 light shade so basically 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 I use it only in winter is pregnant on 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.899
 finger seam be careful if anyone 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.309
 then wants to try this bibi cream 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.860
 keep in mind that he has this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.410
 grayish because to me exactly this goes i 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.260
 we just ran off what pink ones 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.570
 tone tones 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.399
 why could not it be so here all 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.000
 dawn just one I really 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.839
 OK 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.059
 I'll cover concealer in some areas 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.059
 because seller from floreal 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.149
 here 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.769
 And neatly all this in twist the polishko 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.040
 fix all loose powder from the sea 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.040
 day 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.159
 and by the way lack of tan is one of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.979
 the fashion trends of this season are tons we 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.020
 secured go to brow my winter 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.670
 border is no longer in the city in the sun they 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.009
 become darker and more 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.020
 contrast so in the winter I use 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 these are the cream shadows and the color 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.430
 tattoo shade 40 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.930
 besides, I really like 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.880
 use in this capacity exactly 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.220
 cream shadows because they are very 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.530
 resistant when they freeze no 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.210
 touches can no longer erase your 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.110
 broker and for me it is very important because 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.220
 that my border is so very short 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.289
 very little hair so big 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.780
 part of the eyebrow I drew on it therefore for 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.690
 it is very important to me that the color was persistent 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.970
 another trend of this winter is thick 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.350
 even slightly shaggy brow me to 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 Sorry nature eyebrows 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.360
 I did not give it away 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.220
 to be in the trend of this season but not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.200
 less all but my brows I try 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.959
 make as wide as possible 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.569
 it is possible cream shades from mac put on 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.910
 as a base for eye makeup fluffy 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.250
 natural brush is very light 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.010
 movements distribute shadows over the eyelid 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.079
 I will do absolutely nude makeup and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.329
 It seems to me that this trend is not only 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.950
 last two or three years, but in general this 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.040
 trend of the whole decade 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.409
 all moving and motionless 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.230
 I will cover this in such natural shades 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.930
 big fluffy tassel I put on 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.030
 moving and fixed eyelid inflict 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.310
 white matte shadows under the curb and in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:45.109
 corner of the eye a little bit brighten 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.859
 the area under the brow and the entire inner 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.859
 corner 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.720
 I do not like daytime makeup 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.970
 200 times change brushes so the same 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.370
 the brush itself I will type in such 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.739
 here is the middle and brown shade for 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.650
 drawing the folds of the century I put on this 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.030
 big brush contribute it so crease and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.129
 in general, then on our 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.189
 and at the same time the same brush all 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.379
 shade now i take soft 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.569
 pencil brush and I will use 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.519
 Here is this model Phil and take only 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.170
 two of these first shades will be them 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.329
 mix in order that in brown not 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.769
 was too saturated with a pencil pencil 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.470
 very convenient to do this operation 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.750
 because buy it then fold 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.959
 centuries and just doing her loose 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.730
 Contrast I brush everything with a brush and and 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.370
 I make the same brush with the same brush 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.340
 feathering now i want to draw 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.139
 shooter in general in daily makeup I do not 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.879
 I love to use my eyeliner 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.939
 it seems she looks too straight 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:44.739
 bright and contrast therefore most often when 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.090
 wife on the makeup with the girl I paint 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.010
 normal black shadows 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.819
 I think it looks more 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.160
 naturally more gently to the same 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.099
 A lot of pin marks 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.060
 quick and easy way to wash paint 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.790
 mascara cilia 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.459
 with daily make-up I do not like much 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.650
 cucumbers dye eyelashes ordinary 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:09.010
 cilia just stain it with them 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.409
 I do not score I do not use any 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.389
 special techniques for staining 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.120
 eyelashes to make them thicker 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.750
 just a few moves 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.820
 cilia 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.169
 and it seems to me for the daily 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.120
 Naturally this makeup is quite 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.190
 enough and of course we will do 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.680
 a small contoured very little bit 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.260
 i will emphasize muscles well all this 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.020
 spread a little bit 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.620
 blackout whiskey necessarily stressed not 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.870
 hair card will apply a light blush on 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.970
 cups most often I have the most 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.620
 ordinary fighters can be neatly 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.199
 apply some finger 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.330
 smooth lipstick to goblet 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.729
 taken such a fresh natural 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.620
 shade well and here we are ready to make our own 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.460
 trend this season in trend 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.250
 winter 2015 is absolutely nude makeup without 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.159
 emphasis on anything and as long as he is with you 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.900
 what no accent let's do with you 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.120
 let's deal with another fashion trend 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.460
 by the way this trend i'm not generally 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.979
 who probably did not see them prince-sama 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.380
 I do not really use it but in the photos 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.000
 We rest fashion shows me very much 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.620
 like this kind of makeup to this 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.300
 make-up seems to me even possible 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.090
 Spread little eyes and lips 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.729
 because the main emphasis you won't believe 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.639
 we will have with you on the cheeks so here's another 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:28.449
 one fashion trend of this season is 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:31.330
 Nude makeup with frosty bright such 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:35.889
 cheeks i will type a cool shade of a circle 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:41.860
 and the effort will noticeably blush make this 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:44.979
 the effect of a frozen counter here poke 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.080
 fashion trend these pink cheeks but 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.270
 I want to warn you about one thing 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.419
 this trend when you have 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.699
 Emphasis precisely on cheek makeup lips peephole 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.590
 and god must be quite minimal and by 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.960
 it may not be at all, but now 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.779
 I probably bought my rosy cheeks 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.120
 because the next fashion trends 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:06.099
 there should be only one accent and 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.199
 this emphasis will be on the cube and generally already 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.270
 second year super fashionable makeup 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.120
 we have makeup exactly with accent 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.250
 on lips only shades change 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.789
 over summertime these shades 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.159
 remind us of such bright ripe berries 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:24.819
 these are such various saturated bright 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:27.190
 pink fresh colors in winter now everything 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.630
 it changes a little bit in shades and you 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.719
 probably almost everything is fine 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.520
 you know that now these shades go away 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.039
 even in some kind of gothic because 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.440
 fashionable dark maroon shades with 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:42.219
 practically black maroon 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.000
 chocolate even purple is generally the most 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:48.279
 ripe darkest shades screw in 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.080
 trend this season I will use 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.479
 shade that suits my 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.360
 appearance let not even be straight 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:58.149
 saturated with dark straight strongly visible 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.310
 this is such a burgundy shade of 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:02.469
 mosaic sleek appearance we not much 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.940
 constancy therefore such a shade 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:07.259
 I will look pretty pretty 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:10.870
 bright and contrast first we sum up the cup 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:12.729
 we apply help but that's what we have with 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.099
 you turned out to be honest for me 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.560
 bright lipstick is a very good option 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.250
 transform daily daily makeup 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.409
 evening 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.570
 Here is such my daily makeup in 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.360
 it seems to me he takes a total 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.070
 I have 15 minutes at most 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.050

 but for today all this is all you wanted
