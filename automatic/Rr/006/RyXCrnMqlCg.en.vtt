00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.430
 I'm glad you're back 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.680
 today we do not just want anime 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.700
 and mangas speak but today cook 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.080
 I like for you and we want too 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.059
 do not cook anything but today 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.109
 we do japanese carey so take 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.699
 I'll take you to my kitchen 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.490
 and then we can do it directly 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.300
 the kitchen for a good Japanese 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.630
 of course we only need curry curry 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 a make potatoes the cat now 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:37.070
 do not necessarily like creating in it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 on cayenne make lovely plus 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.180
 like wild olive oils and then cut 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.289
 we enjoy the whole thing now 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.170
 small 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.840
 I personally am actually total their 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.860
 against waste and so on though 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.360
 I would then always before me 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.039
 these little white things in the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.780
 Factories here should hit the page 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.149
 and actually seems more of that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.710
 whole part as fruit is by 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.270
 is always very little with me 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 to be informed by the paprika 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.340
 and because of course we all were smart 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.229
 we sort all the stuff in 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 the order in the bowl like that 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.939
 later also almost comes into the pot 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:20.460
 that is called paprika and together with the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.320
 mushrooms in a pot and tips too 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 cutting is a bit too 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.140
 if one cuts into a kitchen towel 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.880
 or 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.320
 but now belong the belong 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 simply not to recipe as he with 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.880
 his shit evaporate as tube 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.740
 left-handed anyway, always apply the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.409
 kitten I cut now completely 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.659
 small because I personally find negra 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.850
 and would then not feel when 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.280
 I could have them because they are still healthy 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.970
 Now, they still seem pure and 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.470
 besides, then there is such an orange flick 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.409
 in the choir i 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.210
 that's what Jugendhaus looks like 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.860
 atom I cut that small on us 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 Best no longer sees tastes hears 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.860
 or will you read my cup now? 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.690
 personal fits vegetable number one 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 are the onions because I just 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.650
 never made it in my life 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.080
 to turn the switch without me 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.230
 had looked as if things 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.060
 now we would cut that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.800
 Dice in dice if you go up 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.420
 here cut off my finger 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.670
 have then ever been the best 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.530
 requirements to cook now 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.700
 also to start because we do that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.080
 now next to it now, so to speak 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.440
 times with the fact that you live in the pot 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:47.799
 pot of planned olive oil left such a mark 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.799
 that he is pretty fat on the ground is me 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.740
 hope you do not understand each other yet 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.450
 deals 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.460
 that once not only pink geneva fc 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.760
 needs it belongs to be equal yet 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.760
 Cook 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220
 No 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.640
 So what I forgot, of course 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.680
 actually not existential at all 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.150
 is their need of course also 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.379
 better if the onions are glassy what they are 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.239
 Nobody really will because they are 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.860
 someday when we only become weak 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:22.230
 a teaspoon gets bigger and bigger when you have more 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.709
 wants or something sharper 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.840
 his 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.510
 then please also make more pure 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.909
 But remember that always burns twice 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.530
 So beautiful on the beautiful curry 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.659
 side effect the surfaces here with it 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.769
 I'll never get it out again if that 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.959
 whole without something on your tailor 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.200
 this color and consistency 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.400
 then comes potatoes, of course, too 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.750
 It is very important that you take one too 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.250
 little filmed in the nothing in it 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.260
 fits and where just everything out again 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.819
 the flour does not catch any of it 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:57.420
 heaped tablespoons that distributed here 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.400
 so a little bit out of 15 would be summer and 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.220
 you mix that whole thing 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.000
 the only allergens are the curry later 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.030
 to bind 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.590
 we stir good instant sooner and ever 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.209
 so gradually the broth so one 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.799
 some companies will all 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.620
 now about a quarter of an hour up 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:30.120
 the stove at medium temperature and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:31.710
 then it goes on also wants to over 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.020
 yellow mass disappeared is one 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.870
 complex the peppers and mushrooms 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.580
 their course before total 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.580
 have compiled knowingly 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.919
 then come lemon juice 2 teaspoons a 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.830
 teaspoon black method and one 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.289
 Tiny amount of cayenne pepper thinks about it 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.690
 Such sharp turn then also 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.150
 mixed down a bit again and 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.710
 then the whole remains still open 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.860
 stand ten minutes on the stove 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.060
 between 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.039
 Since I have a pot for me 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.520
 wash it off now we make the rice 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.590
 bring 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.500
 you can take it to every journey 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.750
 the gnh reports that sushi rice is that 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.219
 so -called round grain rice I get the hole 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.289
 always because of the simple that known 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.509
 Sticky rice is of course again 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.590
 Moreover, not to open the package then 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.080
 I take about half of it now 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.300
 the retractable and then you do it 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.939
 put water on it so that the rice is straight 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.060
 Cover is then covered on top and off 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.439
 the hearth plate and that is exactly there about 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.590
 ten minutes to the whole water 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:35.860
 is overcooked now so carry his 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:39.069
 brown mud pampe what is that 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.900
 actually finished and the trip to 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.310
 should actually be like that in the meantime 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:47.650
 be far that the water largely 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.960
 is overcooked rolf witte otto now comes 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.830
 the clou and then take the best 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.229
 all kitchen towel comes the whole floris 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.629
 once it's about entrepreneurs that is 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.870
 once so investors this whole thing so pure 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:04.719
 the head on it my goal the whole 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.900
 here in the corners strained so that the 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:10.599
 Rice between pot and lid 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.919
 hovering in turn for them to flip this way and that 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.020
 the whole thing stays ten again 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.080
 minutes and should then finish 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.080
 his 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.319
 Immediately that 's it I hope you have mine 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.000
 small pop course I like it on 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.650
 taste every case if you want 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.240
 that I often cook things somehow 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.099
 you may have seen my mum 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.629
 or you are especially good 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.460
 Taste and from the Japanese kitchen 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.990
 come writes why in the 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.339
 comments I look at that and 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.349
 Maybe that will cook after you 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.639
 format has fallen otherwise you will find 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.539
 here on the page in my video of 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.180
