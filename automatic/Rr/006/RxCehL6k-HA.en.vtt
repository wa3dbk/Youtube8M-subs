00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.070
 we longed for them and we hoped that it was bull

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.470

 Well, boys, I explain, there's a lot 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.359
 people who have not yet understood 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.780
 that this series of chapters is called 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:37.210
 download and install is not revision of the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.449
 mod the only thing I do in here 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.370
 is to show them that if it works and that it is 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.840
 completely Persian perfectly 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.339
 installed I did not teach them to play 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.409
 let's say in this case I'm not going to 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.120
 explain how things work 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.070

 how the refinery works or how 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.100
 the two water containers work 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.290

 to the boys mode installation is 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.200
 supremely simple I think it 's the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.480
 Mount package is the easiest of 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.670
 install and it looks good if there are boys 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.610

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.150
 I created this boy background 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.670
 truth is a very big detail already very 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.770
 bacano leaves was already great to remove 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.210
 the other old dot that we had 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.250
 We will continue to personalize and 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.440
 improving this type of funds was the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.030
 mate jaime a greeting does 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.280

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.160

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 works guys I've seen that in others 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.160
 videos have a lot of problems with the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.780
 installation if you follow the steps 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.470
 I repeat if they follow the steps they do not have 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.270
 why ask questions 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.430
 it's serious guys we go to the effort 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.549

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.190
 if we all do it at face value and 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.530
