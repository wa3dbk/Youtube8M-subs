handle<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.940> little<00:01:34.149> bit<00:01:34.240> better

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.920

thought we had a solid game over there
they<00:01:44.290> got<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> little<00:01:44.620> luck<00:01:44.800> with<00:01:44.980> the<00:01:45.070> PK<00:01:45.460> so

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
they got a little luck with the PK so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.220
