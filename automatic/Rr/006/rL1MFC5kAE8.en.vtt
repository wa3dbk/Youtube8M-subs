a beep now what the beep does is it gets
translated<00:03:13.880> by<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.420> box<00:03:14.690> into<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.709> software

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
translated by this box into the software

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.150 
translated by this box into the software
and<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:17.150> translates<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.930> movement<00:03:18.440> of<00:03:18.590> your

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
and it translates the movement of your

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.270 
and it translates the movement of your
record<00:03:20.200> so<00:03:21.200> when<00:03:21.380> i<00:03:21.500> move<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.880> record

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
record so when i move the record

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.130 
record so when i move the record
the<00:03:25.280> software<00:03:25.849> recognizes<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.540> movement<00:03:26.989> and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
the software recognizes the movement and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.580 
the software recognizes the movement and
it<00:03:27.950> will<00:03:28.099> move<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.340> audio<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.660> your<00:03:29.870> laptop<00:03:30.379> in

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
it will move the audio in your laptop in

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.290 
it will move the audio in your laptop in
the<00:03:30.769> exact<00:03:31.099> same<00:03:31.310> way<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.400> that's<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.760> basics

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
the exact same way so that's the basics

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.780 
the exact same way so that's the basics
we<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.379> get<00:03:39.470> into<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.129> little<00:03:40.280> bit<00:03:40.370> deeper

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
we can get into it a little bit deeper

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.449 
we can get into it a little bit deeper
but<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.330> on<00:03:41.540> this<00:03:41.660> video<00:03:41.989> right<00:03:42.200> here<00:03:42.459> so

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
but not on this video right here so

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.050 
but not on this video right here so
that's<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.540> setup<00:03:44.780> right<00:03:45.019> there<00:03:45.290> oh<00:03:45.530> yeah<00:03:46.280> i'm

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
that's the setup right there oh yeah i'm

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.330 
that's the setup right there oh yeah i'm
using<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.450> simple<00:03:47.720> as<00:03:47.959> mike<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.890> might<00:03:49.160> look

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
using a simple as mike it might look

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.770 
using a simple as mike it might look
expensive<00:03:49.730> but<00:03:50.060> it's<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.299> cheap<00:03:50.540> bad

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
expensive but it's a cheap bad

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.440 
expensive but it's a cheap bad
motherfucker<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:52.400> don't<00:03:53.090> even<00:03:53.180> know<00:03:53.360> what

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
motherfucker I don't even know what
