00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:08.050
 4 Let's learn a song called Thunder for the amount this time. 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.530
 This song 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:16.559
 I do not put out the code is now released only three now 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.559
 If you look at three, b - group 4 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.830
 Seven of these minor sevens being # Seven 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 There are three. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.290
 Then, 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.520
 The beginning is now repeating. 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.520
 If you like the song 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:01:07.820

00:00:43.930 --> 00:01:13.630
 we ... 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.960
 A special lunch for me 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:21.520
 This is iterating over and over 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:35.530
 So if you show it slowly, 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:50.679
 5 de la la to be be 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:52.709
 5 be the one 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.709
 U 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:02:02.489
 For example, in the lead 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.989
 I'll give it to you slowly. 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.720
 5 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.340
 U 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:30.720
 Oh oh oh oh oh yeah oh 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:43.550
 Haejusimyeon to her complexion highs 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.360
 And now the slightly different part is making a little rack there , 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.160
 There is a part that comes out there and I want to express it now. 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:56.500
 I saw him in the room with him. 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.670
 Some novice users may have a hard time, but I'll try it. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:40.189
 Coming out 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:44.719
 Now, 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:48.109
 It's important to know that this is a slave. 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:52.370
 This is one way geseo code 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:59.269
 What is this? This is the same nose. 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.299
 So if you look at the web coo so you can just do this 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.299
 5 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:19.810
 I can do it now, but now I want to emphasize the bass a little bit even in the fourth semester. 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.810
 I want to be a slab coming 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:43.639
 I repeated this night is another way 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:43.639
 5 4 4 4 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.590
 I would appreciate it if you could play like this. 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.110
 Yes. I'll finish here today.
