00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
bit cloudy by the way there was just a

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.180 
bit cloudy by the way there was just a
snake<00:00:10.110> like<00:00:10.349> right<00:00:10.530> inside<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:10.830> our<00:00:10.980> thing

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
snake like right inside of our thing

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.440 
snake like right inside of our thing
here<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.550> came<00:00:11.610> out<00:00:11.849> here<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.090> go<00:00:12.179> hunting

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
here and I came out here to go hunting

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.070 
here and I came out here to go hunting
for<00:00:12.599> snakes

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
for snakes

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.980 
for snakes
so<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.769> can<00:00:13.920> find<00:00:14.130> where<00:00:14.280> he<00:00:14.400> went<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.900> mean<00:00:15.900> he

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
so you can find where he went I mean he

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.439 
so you can find where he went I mean he
ran<00:00:16.139> off<00:00:16.320> pretty<00:00:16.560> quick<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.039> maybe<00:00:18.029> he's<00:00:18.270> all

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
looks like a watermelon that's not a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.130 
looks like a watermelon that's not a
watermelon<00:00:44.460> no<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> other<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.660> thought<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
watermelon no the other one I thought it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.970 
watermelon no the other one I thought it
was<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> pineapple

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
was a pineapple

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.479 
was a pineapple
what<00:00:47.760> color<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.149> pineapple<00:00:48.800> why<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
what color is a pineapple why that

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
what color is a pineapple why that
definitely<00:00:50.850> looks<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.239> watermelon<00:00:52.010> let's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
definitely looks like a watermelon let's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.790 
definitely looks like a watermelon let's
hear<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.520> Tim<00:00:53.699> okay<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> spent<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> lot<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
hear it for Tim okay so I spent a lot of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.319 
hear it for Tim okay so I spent a lot of
the<00:00:55.980> morning<00:00:56.309> trying<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> research<00:00:57.030> different

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the morning trying to research different

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.599 
the morning trying to research different
light<00:00:57.899> options<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> pool<00:00:58.829> we've<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
light options for the pool we've got a

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.040 
light options for the pool we've got a
few<00:00:59.820> things<00:01:00.059> where<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.510> put<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.809> lights

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
few things where I can put like lights

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.500 
few things where I can put like lights
around<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> jet<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.280> powered<00:01:02.670> from<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
around the jet that are powered from the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.119 
around the jet that are powered from the
pump<00:01:03.780> being<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> pumps<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.949> then

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
pump being on but the pumps not on then

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.530 
pump being on but the pumps not on then
they<00:01:05.220> won't<00:01:05.339> work<00:01:05.549> eventually<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.450> gonna

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
they won't work eventually I'm gonna

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.950 
they won't work eventually I'm gonna
replace<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.740> entire<00:01:08.450> apparatus<00:01:09.450> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
replace this the entire apparatus is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.929 
replace this the entire apparatus is
like<00:01:10.110> 600<00:01:10.560> bucks<00:01:10.590> hopefully<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
like 600 bucks hopefully it's just the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.210 
like 600 bucks hopefully it's just the
bulb<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.360> bed<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.619> transformer

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bulb that's bed or the transformer

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
bulb that's bed or the transformer
because<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.610> would<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.270> do<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.450> they

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
because it would what they do is they

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
because it would what they do is they
take<00:01:15.689> 120<00:01:16.080> volts<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.369> pump<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.759> 12

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
take 120 volts in and then pump out 12

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.490 
take 120 volts in and then pump out 12
volts<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> don't<00:01:19.380> get

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
volts to that so that you don't get

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320 
volts to that so that you don't get
shocked<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.340> pool<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.820> anything<00:01:21.180> goes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
shocked in the pool if anything goes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
shocked in the pool if anything goes
wrong<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:22.229> 12<00:01:22.500> volts<00:01:22.740> won't<00:01:22.920> shock<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
wrong so 12 volts won't shock you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
wrong so 12 volts won't shock you
because<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.700> such<00:01:23.850> low<00:01:24.150> amperage<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.710> should

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
because it's such low amperage I should

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.609 
because it's such low amperage I should
mention<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.030> high<00:01:27.210> amperage<00:01:27.600> will<00:01:28.320> shock

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
mention that a high amperage will shock

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 
mention that a high amperage will shock
you<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.790> voltage<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> shot<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you it's not the voltage that shot you

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
you it's not the voltage that shot you
it's<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> amperage<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:32.159> keep<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.520> in

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
it's the amperage so just keep that in

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's the amperage so just keep that in
mind<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.119> should<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:33.960> DC<00:01:34.439> 12<00:01:35.009> volts<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.400> there

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
mind but should be DC 12 volts in there

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
mind but should be DC 12 volts in there
and<00:01:35.759> that's<00:01:35.970> super<00:01:36.840> safe<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.979> being<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.250> the
