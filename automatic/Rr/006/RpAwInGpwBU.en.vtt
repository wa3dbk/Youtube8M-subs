DeSoto airflow head and I think last

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.950 
DeSoto airflow head and I think last
episode<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.699> saw<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.210> way<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.449> walk<00:00:18.690> would<00:00:18.810> up

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
episode we saw the way you walk would up

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.990 
episode we saw the way you walk would up
the<00:00:18.990> side<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.189> piece<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.670> here

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the side here with all the piece in here

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.019 
the side here with all the piece in here
will<00:00:21.840> actually<00:00:22.199> cut<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> piece<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.070> put<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
will actually cut a piece and put a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.279 
will actually cut a piece and put a
solid<00:00:24.269> piece<00:00:24.510> down<00:00:24.720> through<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.080> where<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
solid piece down through here where the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.410 
solid piece down through here where the
head<00:00:25.410> bolt<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.939> had<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.210> weld

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
head bolt is and then we had to weld

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.109 
head bolt is and then we had to weld
around<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:28.500> over<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> head<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> repair<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
around all over the head to repair the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.979 
around all over the head to repair the
damage<00:00:30.510> from<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> corrosion<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.600> also<00:00:33.600> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
damage from the corrosion and also the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.380 
damage from the corrosion and also the
top<00:00:34.230> of<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.710> cylinder<00:00:34.980> head<00:00:35.070> right<00:00:36.059> now<00:00:36.210> we're

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
top of the cylinder head right now we're

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720 
top of the cylinder head right now we're
going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> take<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.930> resurface<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> head<00:00:38.430> on

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
going to take and resurface the head on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:02:41.500 
going to take and resurface the head on
the<00:00:39.390> middle

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.880 

well<00:02:42.510> I've<00:02:42.720> gotten<00:02:42.990> all<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.200> big<00:02:43.350> lumps<00:02:43.770> off

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
well I've gotten all the big lumps off

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.280 
well I've gotten all the big lumps off
of<00:02:44.070> this<00:02:44.190> thing<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:44.580> least<00:02:44.640> most<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.150> them<00:02:45.300> as

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
of this thing at least most of them as

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.490 
of this thing at least most of them as
you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.650> see<00:02:46.800> cleaned<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.190> here<00:02:47.310> on<00:02:47.460> this<00:02:47.610> end

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
you can see cleaned up here on this end

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.860 
you can see cleaned up here on this end
head<00:02:49.500> over<00:02:49.800> here<00:02:50.240> because<00:02:51.240> his<00:02:51.360> head's<00:02:51.600> work

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
head over here because his head's work

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
head over here because his head's work
so<00:02:52.290> much<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.710> think<00:02:52.770> what<00:02:52.980> we're<00:02:53.160> gonna<00:02:53.280> do<00:02:53.490> is

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
so much I think what we're gonna do is

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.220 
so much I think what we're gonna do is
actually<00:02:53.970> put<00:02:54.330> it<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> furnace<00:02:54.870> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
actually put it in the furnace and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.070 
actually put it in the furnace and
straighten<00:02:55.770> it<00:02:55.860> out<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:57.510> that'll<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.930> our<00:02:58.020> next

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
straighten it out so that'll be our next

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.940 
straighten it out so that'll be our next
project<00:03:00.080> I've<00:03:01.080> got<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> cylinder<00:03:01.590> head<00:03:01.740> set

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
project I've got the cylinder head set

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.620 
project I've got the cylinder head set
up<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.340> furnace<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.150> straightening

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
up in the furnace on the straightening

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.760 
up in the furnace on the straightening
fixture<00:03:04.020> and<00:03:04.800> we're<00:03:05.520> gonna<00:03:06.170> let<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.350> heat<00:03:07.590> up

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
fixture and we're gonna let this heat up

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.410 
fixture and we're gonna let this heat up
for<00:03:07.980> about<00:03:08.160> an<00:03:08.730> hour<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> half<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:11.420> we'll

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
for about an hour and a half and we'll

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.020 
for about an hour and a half and we'll
let<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.690> cool<00:03:12.930> down<00:03:13.340> and<00:03:14.340> then<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.730> should<00:03:14.970> be

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
let it cool down and then it should be

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.330 
let it cool down and then it should be
fairly<00:03:15.480> straight<00:03:15.990> like<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> real<00:03:16.890> machine<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
fairly straight like a real machine the

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.610 
fairly straight like a real machine the
head

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.600 

before<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:21.739> bolt<00:03:21.950> this<00:03:22.129> down<00:03:22.629> we<00:03:23.629> can<00:03:23.780> see<00:03:24.610> how

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
before we bolt this down we can see how

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.280 
before we bolt this down we can see how
this<00:03:25.819> rocks<00:03:26.090> back<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.450> forth<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:29.140> once<00:03:30.140> we

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
this rocks back and forth and once we

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.660 
this rocks back and forth and once we
get<00:03:30.410> it<00:03:30.530> out<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.800> oven<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.250> should<00:03:31.430> be<00:03:31.519> nice

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
get it out of the oven it should be nice

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.970 
get it out of the oven it should be nice
and<00:03:31.700> straight<00:03:34.989> we've<00:03:35.989> got<00:03:36.140> this<00:03:36.290> unbolted

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
and straight we've got this unbolted

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.289 
and straight we've got this unbolted
from<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.400> fixture<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.090> as<00:03:38.569> you<00:03:38.720> can<00:03:38.840> see<00:03:40.299> you

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
from the fixture and as you can see you

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.140 
from the fixture and as you can see you
don't<00:03:41.510> rock<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.019> roll<00:03:42.140> anymore<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.730> now<00:03:44.060> we're

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
don't rock and roll anymore so now we're

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.369 
don't rock and roll anymore so now we're
gonna<00:03:44.269> go<00:03:44.450> ahead<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:44.629> resurface<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.170> head

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
gonna go ahead and resurface the head

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.119 
gonna go ahead and resurface the head
once<00:03:45.709> more<00:03:45.799> I<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.410> head<00:03:48.560> back<00:03:48.799> on<00:03:49.040> the

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
once more I have the head back on the

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.910 
once more I have the head back on the
mill<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.819> we're<00:03:50.090> gonna<00:03:50.239> go<00:03:50.390> ahead<00:03:50.480> and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
mill and we're gonna go ahead and

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.309 
mill and we're gonna go ahead and
resurface<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.599> get<00:03:53.599> a<00:03:53.630> relatively<00:03:54.140> flat

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
resurface is to get a relatively flat

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.460 
resurface is to get a relatively flat
surface<00:03:54.799> there<00:03:55.599> we've<00:03:56.599> changed<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.019> vit<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.440> a

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
surface there we've changed the vit to a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.190 
surface there we've changed the vit to a
PCD<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> polycrystalline<00:03:59.090> diamond<00:03:59.299> so<00:04:00.079> we

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
PCD a polycrystalline diamond so we

00:04:00.200 --> 00:05:15.670 
PCD a polycrystalline diamond so we
should<00:04:00.380> get<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.530> fairly<00:04:00.829> smooth<00:04:01.549> surface

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.020 

well<00:05:16.680> if<00:05:16.770> taking<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.070> couple<00:05:17.280> of<00:05:17.370> passes<00:05:17.850> off

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
well if taking a couple of passes off

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.670 
well if taking a couple of passes off
this<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:18.450> I've<00:05:18.510> got<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.810> fairly<00:05:19.050> straight<00:05:19.500> I

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
this and I've got it fairly straight I

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680 
this and I've got it fairly straight I
got<00:05:19.890> one<00:05:20.070> little<00:05:20.310> spot<00:05:20.730> right<00:05:20.760> here<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.240> a

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
got one little spot right here and a

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.560 
got one little spot right here and a
little<00:05:22.350> bit<00:05:22.440> around<00:05:22.650> here<00:05:23.150> I'm<00:05:24.150> gonna<00:05:24.330> take

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
little bit around here I'm gonna take
