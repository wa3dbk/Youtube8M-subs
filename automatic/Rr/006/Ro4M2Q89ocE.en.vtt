00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.620
 summer has come and many artists are very 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.809
 I wanted to get to the open air to write 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 all this beauty around 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.350
 that bloom that bright green that is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.090
 there are a lot of emerging artists 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.619
 green may appear integer 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.580
 mystery after all actually is green 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.279
 that shade 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 that color which is very rich 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.309
 the palette and our eye is very good 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.000
 distinguishes between different shades of green he 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.850
 distinguishes 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 let's say them like that on paper but when we 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.480
 look at the green grass on the green 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.100
 trees many beginners get confused and 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.329
 write all 1 very bottom and green 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.129
 paint a small set of colorful 16 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.129
 colors 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:59.039
 St. Petersburg production 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 just two green colors 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.470
 Verida new green and green 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.110
 emerald green emerald 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.970
 virtually absent in nature he 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.659
 visible only in stones for example in 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.790
 malachite 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.960
 and here it is viridan and green 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.030
 the only thing left for a beginner 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 the artist to portray 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.750
 green tree and actually spreading this 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.450
 paint water and he writes it somewhere 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.299
 brighter somewhere darker somewhere thick 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.409
 blooper i am green especially if paint 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.490
 very so fresh and lasting 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.250
 the result is enough 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 gloomy picture as a result we get 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.229
 rather gloomy picture in which 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.909
 there are not transparent areas and greens 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.159
 looks not as beautiful and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.750
 sunny how do i get this 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.350
 variety of shades 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.100
 which we see in the green here follows 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.890
 remember that when the greens are good 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.149
 illuminated then 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 the lighted part will have more 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.220
 warm component that is for this we 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.640
 to the very same very bottom 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.090
 green should mix yellow if we 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.620
 let's mix up the middle yellow 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.879
 then we will have this 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.069
 beautiful warm shade 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.090
 the more yellow he was adding those 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.680
 this shade will be more yellow 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.510
 the more green the corresponding 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.099
 it will be so dark and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.950
 calm very don you see already 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.660
 it turned out quite interesting foliage 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.940
 in comparison let's say with this spot 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.180
 this green is more alive 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.099
 if we add more to this 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:02.819
 green blue in this case blue 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:09.200
 satio that is, this one is a shade then we 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:12.900
 get the shadow part of the tree that is 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.330
 the cool part of the crown is sunny 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.940
 light misses 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:21.500
 of course color education actually 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.970
 green is more complex and even 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.790
 greenery in the shadow part you can watch 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.209
 presence let's say red if 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.230
 try to add red here 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:37.440
 quite a bit so that the shade does not come out 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.560
 beyond the green he remained so 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.110
 a little like brown like this crown 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.760
 becomes even more interesting in color 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.830
 this is just one option we are now with 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.599
 you are considered well if you start 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.189
 mix for example Verida new and 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.260
 emerald the same emerald which 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.629
 In general, here it is with a pure form 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.549
 really not present but in very rare 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.909
 leaves you might see him 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:12.150
 but more often it will be a color like this 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:17.070
 mixed yellow and you get this 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.770
 grass greens bright and fresh 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.400
 in the trees this green we see extremely 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.520
 seldom 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.930
 most often it occurs precisely in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:32.760
 grass so use this shade 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.410
 need very carefully in general you can 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.580
 mix more 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:42.510
 yellow and blue colors for more 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.970
 complex shade and it's probably even 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.240
 more preferably because then 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.320
 you really get more complicated 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.210
 shade of green and for example educators 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.610
 art schools prefer just 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.950
 take away from their students in the open air 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.910
 green so that there is no such 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.410
 unambiguous zelenki look how much 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.670
 varied and shades are obtained if 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:12.570
 mix them yellow blue green with 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.350
 yellow or mixing yellow and black 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:22.110
 even we get a very interesting color 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:24.030
 now i will mix black and yellow for 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.940
 many are discovering that too 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:29.180
 it turns out such a green olive 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.480
 the green color is very beautiful very 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.780
 natural again if we approach him 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:43.770
 start adding blue 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:48.150
 then we get and the shadow of the tree's 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:52.140
 such a bush and so mix 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.720
 shades required for volume transfer 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.210
 wood use not only lightening 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.420
 the color of the usual verida new green 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.610
 but also mixing these colors with yellow and blue and 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.760
 it will give you the opportunity to transfer all 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:08.840
 the richness of the color of green nature 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.840
 I wish you success
