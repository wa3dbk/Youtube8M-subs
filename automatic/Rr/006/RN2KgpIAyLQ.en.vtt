 balm skin cleanser for its high 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.780
 clean your skin of all cosmetic oil 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.489
 or environmental pollution like being 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 Paul, you have to keep in mind that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 you should never apply a face mask 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 on the skin as previously mentioned 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.640
 since it would be a waste of time and not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.600
 you will have no result as we 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.299
 we will apply 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.700
 honey mask we only need 4 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.560
 to 5 tablespoons of honey and we're going to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.479
 apply on the face we leave it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 act for 20 minutes and then 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 We remove the warm water with warm water 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.190
 will help us to open the pore and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.830
 finally we will remove with abundant 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.780
 cold water cold water to assess what 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.180
 the pore closes again this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 you can do it three times 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.030
 per week and in a month you will notice a skin 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.640
 more hydrated more radiant and you will notice that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.580

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.229
 last recommendation is very important 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.600
 that if you like makeup you have to 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.880
 keep in mind that the natural is what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.009
 better just apply shine to the skin and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.440
 that excess makeup can 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.690
 cause serious damage to your skin too 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.000
 we recommend that you apply a layer 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.340
 very thin natural oil on you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.369
