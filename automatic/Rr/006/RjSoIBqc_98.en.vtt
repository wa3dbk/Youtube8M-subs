00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.470
 hello my little lovers 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.160
 historicity Murazor with you and so 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.070
 we continue to review the latest just 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.770
 branch of the British tower potential 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.789
 they have almost all cars except archer 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.340
 archer porosto crown of development under sa in 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.260
 world, he goes backwards at the same time it 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.110
 it just need to adore 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.720
 machines apart from any competition at all 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.989
 i told you about archer like you already 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:44.850
 know about heelys told here and 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.739
 turn came we to Challenger 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.049
 more correct to call it a miracle of technology in 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.790
 us challenger to roger forcibly 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:55.059
 the module has a name 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.580
 avenger or venture how to 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.119
 to talk straight how to lead the movie tilida 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.650
 about american superheroes 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:07.530
 that's actually what this is for 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.880
 the unit is again a remake and a girl 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.909
 medium tank cromwell 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.829
 comets except the original differ from 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.320
 Who is more than one big kromwell 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.829
 rollers yes actually 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.560
 avenger is a car of one project with 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.590
 challenger and here is a manger 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.990
 as for me it would be preferable but 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 we have his tower in my stock she 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.200
 we have this building from us 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.539
 Challenger mind adventure game corps was lower 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.240
 As you can see improved gera such there is 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.880
 setting over my body on the pics 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.880
 she really seemed bigger plus y 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.130
 towers and totally vents 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.380
 but can tanker farts a lot more 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.499
 something someone may know and peas there 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.560
 fed well I can't find out but for some reason 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.270
 it did well or obviously incredible 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.399
 a lot of powder gases were after 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.119
 shots too hard to guess 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.880
 probably the challenger itself was 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.270
 higher so because of the tower and over here 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.870
 this one is this superstructure on the body 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.569
 and you jack was not 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.760
 same up to the manager module with us 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.790
 used as stock but 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690
 maybe in the future I wouldn't mind 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.420
 see exactly 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.760
 and jingling in our game can be 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.269
 straight at 7 logon below he's cool 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.430
 so here's an amusing and generally Tanchiki 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.840
 now let 's another way all of a sudden about 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.269
 what kind of tank is he 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.280
 represents he drives like a village to 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.530
 that you already think your own 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.780
 I have already got a gun here 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.660
 incredibly given a 17-pound is the same as 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.030
 And on the fifth they caught on the sixth she a bit 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.079
 different tth may be minimal 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.280
 by rate of fire 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:58.450
 by stabilization is pretty obvious but 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.549
 if on the fifth they fought and on the sixth 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.950
 conditionally this gun is enough for us 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.340
 given 6 we can still 170 they 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:11.090
 breaking through our there this rate here but on 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.129
 seventh 171 176 you can have flown from me 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.919
 head doesn't matter well come on ruler here 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:21.109
 good but the seventh caught 

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:23.349
 alpha we have 155 well, as wbr throws 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.840
 about 150 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.569
 say it is not enough then someone can with 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.109
 I do not agree that it is not enough but I 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.680
 I say that it is not enough to break through 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.560
 few 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.720
 alpha little tower turns 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.570
 slowly and by the tank is small 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.540
 actually in the rush british on this 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.460
 brought out the same weapon before you 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.160
 at least a little different about the confusion matrix 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.340
 money can be rate of fire but there 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.440
 the tower turns quickly 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:00.220
 noticeably faster and it saves 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.870
 here there is no such a big shed 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.870
 there is not much like on pt 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.800
 because in similar it is even in t25 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.320
 2 I also hated about 175 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.820
 punch I practiced gave battle was such a boule 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.650
 we have 240 alpha 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.769
 considering that every t25 hotel from panther 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.670
 all go quietly with a breakthrough 200 alpha 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.660
 300 320 if to be exact in general everyones and 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:32.830
 drying all sorts of drying and doing that 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.980
 scary things with their 150 2 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:39.630
 these most millimeter well 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:43.180
 carries the enemy tanks to pieces and 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.560
 because they could probably a little bit 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.419
 guess it . painfully liked 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.860
 Of course on previous fishing this gun 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.260
 then she is quite good at herself 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.130
 flea but firefly certainly didn't like it and 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.130
 In principle, it is clear why this 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.030
 separate topic she is not bad on feliciano 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.030
 norms on 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.540
 archery but she already 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.570
 Feels bad on Challenger 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.360
 yes precisely because little alpha and 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.390
 the break through is still quite good 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.000
 especially on the goldie yet 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.590
 don't drag that is new hold and that's enough 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.710
 debts of 320 or 302 it does not matter and you 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:34.479
 you shoot you fart if to be exactly 130 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:37.900
 135 155 not really much well 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:41.479
 here there is such an opinion and it would be better here 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.130
 there was some other gun at 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.910
 but what the British option of course 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.210
 a little here 20 pounds to eat which 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.800
 on the next tanks we have something that 84 meter 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.800
 ninety-three millimeters understandable 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.780
 that with them in licking in this tower would be 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.320
 giant problems will not just not 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:06.300
 got in but something had to be thought up and with 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:09.120
 you grieve . 7 left la with such a gun 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.430
 it is not very good to eat of course 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.050
 dramatically 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.060
 perhaps no obvious solution was possible 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.720
 this name st 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.229
 thats just more barn suit than his 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.510
 analogue 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.000
 on the seventh laval and kids medium tanks 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.940
 with a few other parameters gun but 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.039
 here is the turret rotation speed for this tank 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.620
 really not enough because such a gun 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.350
 same as the average tank of his veins 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.380
 with virtually no 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:40.020
 I do not say pluses that you will be right 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:44.630
 terrible to suffer and there all night 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:47.940
 sob over this tank maybe not but 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.889
 the pain will believe me especially the show 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.590
 Komi there will generally be all pretty 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.750
 and sad well why not cry guys 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.030
 like and subscribe to the channel 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.320
 Thank you for your attention and 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.320
 new meetings yet bye
