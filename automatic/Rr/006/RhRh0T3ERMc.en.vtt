00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
first step okay so just practice getting

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.680 
first step okay so just practice getting
our<00:02:35.069> feet<00:02:35.190> noisy<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:36.150> should<00:02:36.329> be<00:02:36.420> really

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
our feet noisy that should be really

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.960 
our feet noisy that should be really
really<00:02:36.720> straightforward<00:02:37.379> so<00:02:38.250> for<00:02:38.549> Flair<00:02:38.819> you

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
really straightforward so for Flair you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.390 
really straightforward so for Flair you
know<00:02:39.150> want<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> break<00:02:40.319> off<00:02:40.500> into<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.829> normal<00:02:41.220> Z

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
know want to break off into a normal Z

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.949 
know want to break off into a normal Z
you<00:02:41.640> want<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.910> break<00:02:42.090> off<00:02:42.269> into<00:02:42.450> what<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> kind

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
you want to break off into what I kind

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.589 
you want to break off into what I kind
of<00:02:43.049> call<00:02:43.109> a<00:02:43.440> swivel<00:02:44.280> z<00:02:44.489> so<00:02:44.940> what's<00:02:45.150> rule<00:02:45.359> Z<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
of call a swivel z so what's rule Z is

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.119 
of call a swivel z so what's rule Z is
the<00:02:45.810> way<00:02:45.870> you're<00:02:46.019> actually<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.709> swivel

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
the way you're actually going to swivel

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.180 
the way you're actually going to swivel
at<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.910> middle<00:02:48.150> pacquiao<00:02:48.799> so<00:02:49.799> this<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.099> how

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
at the middle pacquiao so this is how

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.979 
at the middle pacquiao so this is how
you<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.489> you're<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.329> break<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.780> into

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
you do it you're going to break off into

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.720 
you do it you're going to break off into
normal<00:02:52.440> Z<00:02:52.650> but<00:02:52.859> as<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.099> break<00:02:53.370> off<00:02:53.579> you're

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
normal Z but as you break off you're

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.430 
normal Z but as you break off you're
going<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:53.879> go<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.390> away<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.019> you're<00:02:55.319> going

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
going to go up so away so you're going

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.380 
going to go up so away so you're going

over to it over tiller that's what's

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.589 
over to it over tiller that's what's
going<00:02:59.849> to<00:02:59.879> be<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.120> that's<00:03:00.299> what's<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.569> to
