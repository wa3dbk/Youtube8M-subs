00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.630
 hello together the amplify the viruses 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.490
 the fourth campaign missions in 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.360
 So singapore despite all weapons 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.010
 changed and the first floor 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.140
 if he is from the Valkyrie 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.000
 over puts right here at this 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.580
 stranded rule book that is the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.650
 horizontal rain dog tag the 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.450
 first weapon you will find shortly before 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.920
 sequence where he step into the armor 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.570
 she would have to go to the biggest event or 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.520
 a floor is higher the jump here 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.960
 a bit difficult because the falls 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.890
 is there to find the star 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.300
 and indeed it is the sga hsv so then 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.430
 Send his tank then it goes on 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.290
 and if you are with the tank then 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.700
 parkhaus had arrived there I have to 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.559
 thank me at mark who has me 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.140
 betrayed where one was active finds that 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.000
 Unfortunately, I did not make it myself 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.940
 you must in all cases in those second 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.220
 floor or the first of the basement garage 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.040
 here on the container and then on 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.210
 this lead around the corner and around 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.560
 go through it a bit and here 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.880
 a bit wary at the edges 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.460
 you can easily fall under it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.530
 and there you have the diary 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.729
 maybe smg and indeed the m 240 b 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.060
 makes a lot of noise and has too 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.920
 A crowd shot 100 or even 100 100 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.720
 and the next dog day is 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.509
 then in the bar there you have to go before three 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.549
 Turn off four opponents and do the doping 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:38.000
 then suspended under the tresen this is the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.810
 panzerkolonnen but away and yes that 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.060
 you can find here 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 and the next weapon is then 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.020
 a bit further that is relatively on 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.729
 At the end you have to be there first 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.670
 clarify and then you have two back there 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.439
 so container cardboard box container things 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.399
 and there in the corner 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.929
 behind it is the m 16 84 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:00.080
 It is a very cool cart I think 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.729
 a three burst and the last doccheck 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.799
 is then in the hangar 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.479
 For that you have to do the song 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.220
 decide so down the wing 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.679
 falls then he goes high jumps on it 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.580
 and above it is the grounded 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.760
 and best butterflies not under 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 yes, this same unfortunately we have 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.890
 again the case that a battlelog still 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.220
 a weapon is needed more than in 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.040
 game is displayed as objective and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.480
 Although it is also in here 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.870
 hangar and knows that one of the wise 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.410
 the closest being researched the need 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.329
 you turn off then he gets the sy js 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.329
 And yes, then he has 100 percent again
