going to show you how to make an object

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.220 
going to show you how to make an object
that<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.339> draw<00:00:05.640> more<00:00:06.299> interesting<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.109> more

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230

eye-catching and a little bit more

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.259 
eye-catching and a little bit more
engaging<00:00:10.170> okay<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.340> can<00:00:11.429> see<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:12.000> this

engaging okay so you can see that this

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.539 
engaging okay so you can see that this
is<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.900> house<00:00:13.200> hopefully<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.070> tell<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is a house hopefully you can tell and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.210 
is a house hopefully you can tell and
this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.630> it's<00:00:16.020> kind<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.320> boring<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.800> mean<00:00:17.010> it

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
this is it's kind of boring I mean it

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.870 
this is it's kind of boring I mean it
follows<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.859> standard<00:00:19.859> rules<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.520> you

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
follows the the standard rules of you

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.300 
follows the the standard rules of you
know<00:00:21.000> 3d<00:00:21.570> dimensions<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.830> know<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.160> all

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
know 3d dimensions and you know it's all

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.089 
know 3d dimensions and you know it's all
nice<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.910> legit<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.449> straight<00:00:24.779> right<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
nice and legit and straight right so the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.880 
nice and legit and straight right so the
first<00:00:26.340> thing<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.689> is

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
first thing that you can do to it is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.580 
first thing that you can do to it is
make<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.300> perspective<00:00:30.300> more<00:00:30.720> extreme<00:00:31.320> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
make the perspective more extreme so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.940 
make the perspective more extreme so
what<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> mean<00:00:31.920> by<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.329> this<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
what I mean by this this is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.200 
what I mean by this this is
corresponding<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.969> nice<00:00:36.180> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
corresponding to this so it's nice and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.910 
corresponding to this so it's nice and
straight<00:00:36.690> everything<00:00:37.200> follows<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> rules

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
straight everything follows the rules

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.970 
straight everything follows the rules
but<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.969> can<00:00:39.120> add<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.600> extreme<00:00:40.290> perspective<00:00:40.829> to

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
but you can add a extreme perspective to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
but you can add a extreme perspective to
it<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> turns<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:41.820> something<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it so it turns into something like this

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.709 
it so it turns into something like this
which<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.590> corresponding<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.879> okay<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
which is corresponding to this okay so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
which is corresponding to this okay so
you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.930> tell<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.489> bit<00:00:47.640> more

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you can tell it's a little bit more

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.690 
you can tell it's a little bit more
engaging<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.340> more

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
engaging you can see it and it's more

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400 
engaging you can see it and it's more
dynamic<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> see<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
dynamic and you can see that the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.369 
dynamic and you can see that the
perspective<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:54.329> little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.809> sharpened

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
perspective is a little bit sharpened

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.400 
perspective is a little bit sharpened
and<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.820> definitely<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.719> has<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and it is definitely it has that

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.670 
and it is definitely it has that
stronger<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.510> contrast<00:01:00.510> between<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.930> big

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
stronger of a contrast between the big

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740 
stronger of a contrast between the big
and<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.039> small<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.390> see<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and the small so you can see it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.679 
and the small so you can see it's
zooming<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.650> way<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.159> okay<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
zooming in this way right okay so the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.330 
zooming in this way right okay so the
second<00:01:07.020> thing<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.409> can<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> actually

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
second thing that you can do is actually

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.719 
second thing that you can do is actually
add<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.360> little<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.080> ask<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.430> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
add in a little bit of ask you so it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.390 
add in a little bit of ask you so it
turns<00:01:11.909> into<00:01:12.150> something<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:14.040> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
turns into something like this now this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.310 
turns into something like this now this
compared<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> tell<00:01:16.020> there's<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
compared to that you can tell there's a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.440 
compared to that you can tell there's a
huge<00:01:16.710> difference<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.729> what<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:17.909> did<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
huge difference so what I did with that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.980 
huge difference so what I did with that
is<00:01:18.869> um<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.470> took<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.460> shape<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.390> did<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
is um I took this shape and I did the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.100 
is um I took this shape and I did the
skew<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.490> pushing<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> lines<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.810> words

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
skew which is pushing the lines in words

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
skew which is pushing the lines in words
like<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.560> boom<00:01:25.860> boom<00:01:26.250> boom<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.000> tell

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
like this boom boom boom as you can tell

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.149 
like this boom boom boom as you can tell
from<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.570> illustration<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
from the illustration and then it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.899 
from the illustration and then it
creates<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.490> nice<00:01:30.259> effect<00:01:31.259> which<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:31.920> which

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
creates this nice effect which is which

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
creates this nice effect which is which
you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.240> tell<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.720> really<00:01:34.290> really

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you can tell it's really really

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620 
you can tell it's really really
different<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.549> this<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.090> when<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.420> see

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
different from this and when you see

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.749 
different from this and when you see
that<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.110> wow<00:01:37.320> boom<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.340> lot<00:01:38.549> more

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
that it's like wow boom it's a lot more

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
that it's like wow boom it's a lot more
engaging<00:01:39.180> than<00:01:39.390> something<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.920> just

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
engaging than something that is just

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.539 
engaging than something that is just
normal<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.110> follows<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> rules<00:01:44.009> very

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
normal and it follows the rules very

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.600 
normal and it follows the rules very
different<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.149> okay<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.220> recap

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
different from that okay so to recap

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.690 
different from that okay so to recap
first<00:01:48.360> thing<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> given<00:01:50.189> or

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
first thing you can do to it is given or

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.050 
first thing you can do to it is given or
give<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.350> extreme<00:01:52.350> perspective<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
give it an extreme perspective like so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.569 
give it an extreme perspective like so
all<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.530> second<00:01:55.860> thing<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.340> can

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
all right and the second thing you can

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.499 
all right and the second thing you can
do<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.719> skew<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.229> lines<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.009> words<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> I'm

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
do is to skew the lines in words and I'm

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
do is to skew the lines in words and I'm
probably<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.469> more<00:02:01.680> tutorials<00:02:02.219> on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
probably going to make more tutorials on

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.580 
probably going to make more tutorials on
how<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.700> can<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.240> properly<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:04.409> by

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
how you can do this properly but by

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.429 
how you can do this properly but by
skewing<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.600> giving<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.960> extreme

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
skewing it and giving it the extreme

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.869 
skewing it and giving it the extreme
perspective<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.340> something<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.849> this

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
perspective you get something like this

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.840 
perspective you get something like this
as

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
as

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.120 
as
