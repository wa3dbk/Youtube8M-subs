so<00:00:52.410> here's<00:00:52.710> how<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.010> construct<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.699> thing

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so here's how we construct this thing

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.439 
so here's how we construct this thing
for<00:00:54.329> three<00:00:54.480> dollars<00:00:55.100> first<00:00:56.100> two<00:00:56.879> pieces<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
for three dollars first two pieces of

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.639 
for three dollars first two pieces of
PVC<00:00:58.170> pipe<00:00:58.440> about<00:00:59.340> one<00:00:59.640> foot<00:00:59.940> each<00:01:00.350> next<00:01:01.350> we've

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
PVC pipe about one foot each next we've

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
PVC pipe about one foot each next we've
got<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.890> bent<00:01:02.250> connector<00:01:02.879> we're<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.449> take

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
got a bent connector we're going to take

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.230 
got a bent connector we're going to take
the<00:01:03.660> first<00:01:03.840> piece<00:01:04.760> plug<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.939> into<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the first piece plug it into the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
the first piece plug it into the
connector<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.869> then<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.189> second

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
connector and then take this second

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.490 
connector and then take this second
piece<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> plug<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.350> what's

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
piece and plug it in you see what's

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.929 
piece and plug it in you see what's
happening<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.040> yeah<00:01:11.520> we're<00:01:11.670> getting<00:01:11.909> close
