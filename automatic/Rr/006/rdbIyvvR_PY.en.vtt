00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
here in Alabama so there's that and you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.270 
here in Alabama so there's that and you
wait<00:01:01.829> continuing<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.550> around<00:01:04.070> first<00:01:05.070> thing<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
wait continuing on around first thing I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.380 
wait continuing on around first thing I
noticed<00:01:05.549> when<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.820> driving<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.240> vehicle

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
noticed when I was driving the vehicle

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
noticed when I was driving the vehicle
is<00:01:06.689> how<00:01:06.840> sharp<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.439> turning<00:01:07.740> radius<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.340> has

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
is how sharp of a turning radius it has

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.370 
is how sharp of a turning radius it has
I<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.729> know<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:09.180> slightly<00:01:10.110> modified

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
I don't know if it was slightly modified

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.480 
I don't know if it was slightly modified
but<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.070> mean<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.970> turns<00:01:12.600> around<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.740> dime<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
but I mean it turns around on a dime it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.370 
but I mean it turns around on a dime it
seems<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.939> there's<00:01:15.330> your<00:01:15.479> rear<00:01:15.840> wiper<00:01:16.049> ready

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
out if you wanted to but pretty much

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
out if you wanted to but pretty much
there<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.759> seat<00:01:32.970> folds

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
down you can do it like that if you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.090 
down you can do it like that if you
wanted<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.990> extra<00:01:37.110> storage<00:01:37.409> space

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100

usually going to be leather and of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.540 
usually going to be leather and of
course<00:02:31.959> the<00:02:32.140> reason<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.650> because<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.400> the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
course the reason is because of the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.240 
course the reason is because of the
durability<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.540> stuff<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.739> your

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
front seat is cloth because it's a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.140 
front seat is cloth because it's a
little<00:02:38.440> bit<00:02:38.590> cheaper<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.970> be<00:02:40.120> a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
little bit cheaper it's going to be a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.860 
little bit cheaper it's going to be a
make<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:40.959> more<00:02:41.140> affordable<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.750> force

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
make it more affordable for the force

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.140 
make it more affordable for the force
so<00:02:44.620> there's<00:02:45.010> your<00:02:45.160> leather<00:02:45.430> interior<00:02:45.880> looking
