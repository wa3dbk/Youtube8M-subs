 but for you tomorrow morning 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.239
 this is the galaxy s 4 was announced then 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.470
 we will go right back to 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.839
 technical specificities because I 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.570
 know you're waiting for this so it does 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.210
 130 grams this galaxy s 4 it is with 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.920
 a full hd screen super amoled a screen 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.229
 of 5 inches so bigger than the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.420
 galaxy s iii 2 gigas of ram 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.540
 here we are really in the middle of the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.280
 crowd 1 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.040
 so 13 megapixels for the camera 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.150
 we see that here too samsung joins a 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.230
 little standards today 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.880
 high-end smartphones in terms of 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.360
 photo it will exist in two colors 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.150
 galaxy s 4 in white and black capacity 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.110
 memory 16 32 64 giga there it will do 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.210
 pleasure to all who want to jump 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.550
 many given it will exist in 64 giga the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.200
 galaxy s 4 and in addition it has a micro port 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.600
 sd which you can add the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.790
 memory what else will it turn with the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.620
 latest version of android at 4.2.2 that 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.720
 it's good news it's finer 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.240
 I said it lighter and by their side 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.500
 specificity samsung put the package on 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.820
 new software 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.990
 that was already the case with the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.880
 galaxy s iii you remember it without 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.280
 doubt is there a lot of novelties 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.630
 photo side for example you go 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.050
 to be able to mix that look is enough 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.150
 nice mixer a photo of the sensor 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.220
 in front with the photo of the sensor 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.229
 the arriate the result it can do it 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.490
 little funny postcards on 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.080
 tested it just now it's enough 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.640
 fun we can also create albums 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.500
 photos directly from the smartphone 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.690
 also works pretty cool that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.950
 is called the s translator who was 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.870
 shown by samsung 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.090
 so that's great located for example 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.580
 abroad you will be able to actually 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 dictate a message in French and you will 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.540
 to have written in English and even dictated 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.160
 in English that's what's so strong 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.750
 it's a real-time translator 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.269
 works in both writing and speaking 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.730
 frankly we tested it and it works 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.440
 we really bluffed what else ah 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.870
 yes a fairly fun function that we did not 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.010
 could not test in the room but who on 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.120
 the paper is rather attractive 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.830
 Let's admit you're at home - too 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.390
 four friends and you have a galaxy s 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.610
 4 you will be able to synchronize without 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.530
 thread the song of a galaxy s cut on 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.519
 all the others and listened to him so with a 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.350
 its most powerful since there will be 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.760
 four speakers to escape galaxies 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.120
 which will be located to them is rather 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.790
 not bad 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.840
 nice function is the reviews the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.610
 review 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.129
 it's quite bluffing when approaching the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.150
 screen finger of this galaxy s 4 you 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.390
 have information that appears 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.590
 a bit like galaxy note 2 besides 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.760
 but it was with the stylus that it 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.930
 walk with the must so we can have 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.720
 additional information 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.670
 when we have a name an email header 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.250
 for example or of course contacts or 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.549
 well on the calendar and samsung promises 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.160
 other applications with this system 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.890
 other sensors that has in this galaxy s 4 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.840
 which will actually allow to follow 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.220
 actually reading a text that you 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.110
 read on your smartphone 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.670
 again we did a little test that's 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.440
 pretty bluffing just look 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.819
 the screen makes it the smartphone and the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.680
 lean a little bit on the drau 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.450
 on the actually up or towards the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.069
 down and there the screen will scroll by itself 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.170
 because it will detect that you are in 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.819
 read the screen not bad at all 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.170
 infrared remote control that too 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.480
 a novelty on this galaxy s four 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.099
 multifunction infrared remote controls 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.230
 pac on samsung tvs that 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.110
 will walk on all TVs with also 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.610
 we are going to say a kind of big store 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.829
 virtual that has been completely redesigned 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.840
 we will find photos music videos etc 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.829
 that you can buy directly and 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.329
 that's pretty funny 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.220
 they added a pedometer function 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.109
 and you have a live app that 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.269
 works and that will close you so 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.920
 worked for example if you walk 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.690
 you will know how many steps 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.359
 you do and how many calories you 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.030
 you can also spend on 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.980
 of wellness all that is health the 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.019
 galaxy s iii will analyze the quality of 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.310
 air humidity temperature etc. 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.680
 we see that we are really in this 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.120
 health wellness trend even on 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.710
 phones and so it happens on this 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.300
 new device will also have 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.889
 accessories that will be available from 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.840
 small bracelets pedometer and so on 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.190
 that's what can be said then my 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.720
 felt is that it looks like 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.700
 really still galaxy s3 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.139
 frankly when we see like that we get 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.849
 said this is the galaxy s iii he really 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.610
 the same touch the same finish 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.700
 except on the side where he overflowed board a 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.450
 little bit of steel or aluminum but 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.010
 it is true that it really looks like 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.690
 a lot galaxy s iii in any case that's 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.380
 a very nice phone that in my opinion is going 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.940
 cartoning 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.770
 there are studies that are pretty 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.870
 impressive that provides that samsung 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.060
 will sell more than 10 million during 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.169
 the month of his release here he should 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.770
 go out in the coming weeks we 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.080
 does not have the rates yet 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.250
 that was the first 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.370
 information we could give you 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.379
 on this galaxy s 4 we find ourselves very 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.490
 quickly of course on the 01net techno channel 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.440
 see you soon 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.240
 Jerome yes but now it takes 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.440
 to return my little french guy then go 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.810
 to sleep a little bit then jump into a 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.300
 plane i'm waiting for you here that's for this case 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.520
 access s4 obviously we will talk about it again 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.870
 since as soon as it comes out it will be 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.710
 discover in test on the techno channel 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.710
 01net hi to all
