little<00:00:09.590> engine<00:00:10.590> disassembly<00:00:11.840> that<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
little engine disassembly that the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.090 
little engine disassembly that the
justification<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.179> needed<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.139> cylinder

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
justification is I needed a cylinder

justification is I needed a cylinder
I<00:00:17.900> needed<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.020> sleeve<00:00:19.820> this<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> half

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
I needed a sleeve this one and a half

I needed a sleeve this one and a half
horsepower<00:00:21.689> spark<00:00:22.500> plug<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.119> needed<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
horsepower spark plug in needed that and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.730 
horsepower spark plug in needed that and
that's<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.109> good<00:00:25.289> one

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that's a good one

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.310 
that's a good one
very<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.970> bowl<00:00:27.300> ridden<00:00:27.660> area<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.050> really

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
very that bowl ridden area is really

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.439 
very that bowl ridden area is really
really<00:00:28.859> good<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.429> that's<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.269> have

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
really good and that's the one as I have

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.150 
really good and that's the one as I have
seen<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.590> was<00:00:31.830> stuck<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:34.079> flywheel<00:00:34.590> was

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
seen it was stuck and the flywheel was

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.389 
seen it was stuck and the flywheel was
less<00:00:36.149> busted<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.040> other<00:00:38.070> one

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
less busted on this one the other one

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.930 
less busted on this one the other one
seemed<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> be<00:00:38.820> good<00:00:39.590> history<00:00:40.590> unknown<00:00:41.780> the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
seemed to be good history unknown the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.910 
seemed to be good history unknown the
justification<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:44.969> this<00:00:45.390> whole<00:00:46.610> little

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
justification for this whole little

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.330 
justification for this whole little

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
video for a did come out with a fairly

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.180 
video for a did come out with a fairly
decent<00:00:53.760> gas<00:00:54.329> tank<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:56.780> really<00:00:57.980> really<00:00:58.980> good

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
decent gas tank a really really good

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.880 
decent gas tank a really really good
piston<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.539> Rings<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:00.989> stuck<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.559> dirty

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
piston or the Rings are stuck it's dirty

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.820 
piston or the Rings are stuck it's dirty
but<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.579> really<00:01:02.940> really<00:01:03.359> good<00:01:04.350> looking<00:01:04.589> rod

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
but it's really really good looking rod

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.250 
but it's really really good looking rod
good<00:01:05.129> looking<00:01:05.400> piston<00:01:05.850> clean<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.310> the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
good looking piston clean that up the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.670 
good looking piston clean that up the
side<00:01:10.260> covers<00:01:10.770> both<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:12.320> appeared<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.530> be

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
side covers both of them appeared to be

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
side covers both of them appeared to be
the<00:01:13.890> engine<00:01:14.250> paired<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.820> be<00:01:14.970> run<00:01:15.540> not<00:01:15.930> too<00:01:16.200> long

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the engine paired to be run not too long

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
the engine paired to be run not too long
ago<00:01:16.490> or<00:01:17.490> I'll<00:01:17.729> clean<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.600> right<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
ago or I'll clean this up right here I

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
ago or I'll clean this up right here I
believe<00:01:19.770> that'll<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> good<00:01:20.460> replacement

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
believe that'll be a good replacement

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.280 
believe that'll be a good replacement
for<00:01:21.270> something<00:01:21.869> else

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
for something else

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.370 
for something else
the<00:01:22.890> gear<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.630> looked<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.170> there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the gear as I have looked at it there

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
the gear as I have looked at it there
kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> scraped<00:01:26.280> around<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.790> little<00:01:27.000> bit<00:01:27.299> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
kind of scraped around a little bit it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.649 
kind of scraped around a little bit it
looks<00:01:27.659> really<00:01:28.140> really<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.799> good<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
looks really really really good so you

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.679 
looks really really really good so you
know<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.290> engine<00:01:32.210> being<00:01:33.210> damaged

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
know with this one engine being damaged

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.520 
know with this one engine being damaged
at<00:01:33.869> some<00:01:34.110> time<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.530> its<00:01:34.680> past<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.340> being<00:01:36.530> took

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
at some time in its past and being took

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.460 
at some time in its past and being took
apart<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.490> with<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.479> engine<00:01:39.930> several

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
apart that with this one engine several

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.280 
apart that with this one engine several
engines<00:01:40.970> somewhere<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.990> land

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
engines somewhere in the in the land

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.219 
engines somewhere in the in the land
will<00:01:43.680> end<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.759> running<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.780> these<00:01:45.930> donor

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
will end up running with these donor

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.270 
will end up running with these donor
parts<00:01:47.270> this<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.619> main<00:01:49.799> part<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
parts this is a this the main part that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.219 
parts this is a this the main part that
I<00:01:50.369> wanted<00:01:50.670> off<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.119> engine<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.689> get<00:01:51.869> another

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I wanted off this engine to get another

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.389 
I wanted off this engine to get another
engine<00:01:52.649> running<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.200> the

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
engine running so you know that's the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.770 
engine running so you know that's the
justification<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.670> whole<00:01:56.820> thing<00:01:57.149> now
