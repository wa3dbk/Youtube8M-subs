shots as he's dead or it's some
the<00:02:13.409> one<00:02:13.739> if<00:02:14.189> you<00:02:14.280> have<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> packed<00:02:14.640> lunch<00:02:14.790> one

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
shot to the head and he's dead I found

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.069 
shot to the head and he's dead I found
out<00:02:17.700> an<00:02:17.819> easier<00:02:18.090> way<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.209> kill<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.599> warden<00:02:18.900> aim

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
out an easier way to kill the warden aim

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.440 
out an easier way to kill the warden aim
for<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.349> head<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.859> also<00:02:20.280> found<00:02:20.609> out<00:02:20.819> claim<00:02:21.239> were

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
for the head I also found out claim were

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.880 
for the head I also found out claim were
stealing<00:02:21.840> really<00:02:22.049> easily<00:02:22.319> but<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.560> guess<00:02:22.739> at

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
stealing really easily but I guess at

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.559 
stealing really easily but I guess at
the<00:02:22.980> same<00:02:23.159> time<00:02:23.370> they're<00:02:23.939> not<00:02:23.969> really<00:02:24.209> talking

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the same time they're not really talking

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.259 
the same time they're not really talking
about<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.870> warden<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.530> video<00:02:25.829> so<00:02:26.189> yeah<00:02:26.969> I

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
about the warden in this video so yeah I

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.759 
about the warden in this video so yeah I
don't<00:02:27.629> really<00:02:27.719> want<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.959> go<00:02:28.019> on<00:02:28.260> about<00:02:28.439> that

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
don't really want to go on about that

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.330 
don't really want to go on about that
right<00:02:29.189> now<00:02:29.219> uh<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:30.599> guess<00:02:31.109> since<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.129> talked

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
right now uh so I guess since we talked

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.119 
right now uh so I guess since we talked
about<00:02:32.430> mob<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.819> dead<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:33.120> bit<00:02:34.040> what<00:02:35.040> do<00:02:35.099> you

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
about mob of the dead a bit what do you

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.729 
about mob of the dead a bit what do you
think<00:02:35.459> about<00:02:35.780> uprising<00:02:36.780> compared<00:02:37.560> to

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
think about uprising compared to

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.559 
think about uprising compared to
revolution<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.819> think<00:02:39.030> revolutions

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
revolution do you think revolutions

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.020 
revolution do you think revolutions
better<00:02:39.810> or<00:02:40.049> do<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.230> think<00:02:40.439> up<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:41.030> uprisings

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
better or do you think up or uprisings

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.399 
better or do you think up or uprisings
better<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:43.760> personally<00:02:44.760> think<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.409> uprising

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
better I personally think that uprising

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.410 
better I personally think that uprising
better<00:02:46.889> is<00:02:47.099> for<00:02:47.340> zombies<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.389> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
better is for zombies and for a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.879 
better is for zombies and for a
multiplayer<00:02:48.900> maps<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:49.530> revolution
