you<00:02:29.380> do<00:02:29.560> your<00:02:29.709> box<00:02:29.890> step<00:02:30.250> like<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.610> would<00:02:30.819> so

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
you do your box step like you would so

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.890 
you do your box step like you would so
it<00:02:31.209> has<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> place<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.810> exit<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:34.060> it's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
it has a place to exit and as it's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.490 
it has a place to exit and as it's
exiting<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:36.310> bring<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> other<00:02:36.700> one<00:02:36.849> in<00:02:37.500> and

feels right for you and you're going to
have<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.780> be<00:03:36.870> stepping<00:03:37.230> really<00:03:37.620> fast<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.129> do

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
have to be stepping really fast to do

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.059 
have to be stepping really fast to do
this<00:03:38.519> even<00:03:38.879> if<00:03:38.970> you're<00:03:39.090> spinning<00:03:39.299> slow<00:03:40.069> it's

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
this even if you're spinning slow it's

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.190 
this even if you're spinning slow it's
going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.579> this<00:03:41.790> four<00:03:42.150> step<00:03:42.569> thing<00:03:42.930> for

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
going to have this four step thing for

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.800 
going to have this four step thing for
every<00:03:43.379> cycle<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:45.180> go<00:03:47.810> basically

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
every cycle of it you go basically

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.030 
every cycle of it you go basically
you're<00:03:49.079> running<00:03:49.410> stepping<00:03:50.040> quickly<00:03:51.140> on<00:03:52.140> the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
you're running stepping quickly on the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.520 
you're running stepping quickly on the
front<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:53.940> front<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.329> box<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.810> then

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
front to the front of the box and then

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710 
front to the front of the box and then
to<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.769> back<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.099> box<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.609> when<00:03:57.540> your

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
to the back of the box and when your

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.289 
to the back of the box and when your
feet<00:03:57.930> are<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.170> between<00:03:58.700> is<00:03:59.700> where<00:03:59.970> your<00:04:00.120> poi

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
feet are in between is where your poi

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.990 
feet are in between is where your poi
are<00:04:00.450> going<00:04:00.569> to<00:04:00.629> be<00:04:00.690> entering<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.200> exiting<00:04:02.000> so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
are going to be entering and exiting so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.430 
are going to be entering and exiting so

you're keeping one hand on the front and
one<00:04:04.620> hand<00:04:04.799> on<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.010> back<00:04:06.799> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.430 

I'm<00:04:12.890> not<00:04:13.010> doing<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.370> for<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.700> already

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.460 

I'm<00:04:18.440> gonna<00:04:18.620> put<00:04:18.800> your<00:04:18.950> hands<00:04:19.190> far<00:04:19.550> enough<00:04:19.760> back

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
I'm gonna put your hands far enough back

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.190 
I'm gonna put your hands far enough back
but<00:04:21.470> you're<00:04:21.620> missing<00:04:22.040> your<00:04:22.190> asses<00:04:22.670> back<00:04:22.700> -<00:04:23.300> and

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
but you're missing your asses back - and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.840 
but you're missing your asses back - and
fired<00:04:24.530> up<00:04:24.650> forward<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.250> you're<00:04:25.370> not<00:04:25.490> giving

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
fired up forward that you're not giving

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.370 
fired up forward that you're not giving
yourself<00:04:26.920> so<00:04:28.120> good<00:04:29.120> luck<00:04:29.270> with<00:04:29.330> that<00:04:29.510> I<00:04:29.960> think

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
yourself so good luck with that I think

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.260 
yourself so good luck with that I think
now<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.800> know<00:04:31.100> at<00:04:31.370> least<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.700> idea<00:04:31.730> of<00:04:32.120> what

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
now you know at least the idea of what

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.300 
now you know at least the idea of what
you're<00:04:32.420> doing<00:04:32.620> should<00:04:33.620> be<00:04:33.770> able<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:34.070> get<00:04:34.220> it

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
you're doing should be able to get it

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.800 
you're doing should be able to get it
down<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.700> little<00:04:34.940> time<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.360> does<00:04:35.510> take<00:04:35.780> some

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
down to little time it does take some

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.980 
down to little time it does take some
practice<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:37.430> you're<00:04:38.390> not<00:04:38.570> going<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.780> be<00:04:38.870> able

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
practice and you're not going to be able

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.200 
practice and you're not going to be able
to<00:04:39.170> immediately<00:04:39.410> do<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:40.040> maybe<00:04:40.700> start<00:04:41.090> off

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
to immediately do it maybe start off

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.780 
to immediately do it maybe start off
with<00:04:41.390> something<00:04:41.600> like<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.670> where<00:04:43.670> you<00:04:43.760> just

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
with something like this where you just

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.020 
with something like this where you just
do<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.450> hand<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:46.520> then<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.790> do<00:04:46.910> the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
do the one hand and then you do the

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.430 
do the one hand and then you do the
other<00:04:51.490> so<00:04:52.490> when<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.640> do<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.880> Box<00:04:53.090> step<00:04:53.440> from

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
other so when you do the Box step from

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.190 
other so when you do the Box step from
one<00:04:55.280> direction

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
one direction

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.980 
one direction
it<00:04:57.200> sets<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.650> up<00:04:57.740> for<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.700> other<00:04:58.850> hand<00:04:59.150> to

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
it sets you up for the other hand to

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.710 
it sets you up for the other hand to
come<00:05:00.200> in<00:05:00.350> from<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.680> throne<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:02.330> that's<00:05:02.540> how
