with you know the impression that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.600 
with you know the impression that

Australian wines are industrial and that

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.630 
Australian wines are industrial and that

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
they are not you know made from the land

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.010 
they are not you know made from the land

I mean we're biodynamic wines they don't
any<00:01:13.170> additions<00:01:13.859> to<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:15.439> they're<00:01:16.439> made

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
any additions to them and they're made

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.459 
any additions to them and they're made
very<00:01:16.890> naturally<00:01:17.429> and<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.149> know<00:01:18.299> reflect<00:01:19.109> the

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:19.469 
very naturally and you know reflect the

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.760 
very naturally and you know reflect the
sense<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.859> place<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:20.640> River<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.259> mean<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189

of off the land so i think wines are

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.850 
of off the land so i think wines are
different<00:02:03.840> from<00:02:03.989> around<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.469> world<00:02:04.590> in

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.539 
vintage the 2007 vintage was you know
just<00:02:22.870> fantastic<00:02:23.829> or<00:02:23.950> was<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.220> earliest

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
just fantastic or was the earliest

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.289 
just fantastic or was the earliest
vintage<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.209> record<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:26.579> it<00:02:27.579> was<00:02:27.730> harvested

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
vintage on record and it was harvested

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.780 
vintage on record and it was harvested
on<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.659> think<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.049> first<00:02:29.349> time<00:02:29.790> one's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
on I think it's the first time one's

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.929 
on I think it's the first time one's
been<00:02:31.000> harvested<00:02:31.390> on<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.480> full<00:02:31.750> moon<00:02:31.780> fruit<00:02:32.260> day

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
been harvested on a full moon fruit day

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.699 
been harvested on a full moon fruit day
in<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.120> biodynamic<00:02:34.450> calendar<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.379> I<00:02:35.470> think

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
in the biodynamic calendar and I think

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.349 
in the biodynamic calendar and I think
with<00:02:36.129> the<00:02:36.280> fruit<00:02:36.489> was<00:02:36.700> some<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.239> best

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
with the fruit was some of the best

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:39.240 
with the fruit was some of the best
fruit<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.079> I've<00:02:38.200> ever<00:02:38.379> seen<00:02:38.620> coming<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.129> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
fruit that I've ever seen coming to the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.330
