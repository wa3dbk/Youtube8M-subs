00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
while back so I have made some quite

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.580

category<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.600> then<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.109> can<00:03:26.260> compete<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.769> lot

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
category and then it can compete a lot

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.550 
category and then it can compete a lot
more<00:03:27.250> with<00:03:27.430> them<00:03:27.640> with<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.420> SUV<00:03:28.870> car<00:03:29.140> types<00:03:29.410> of
