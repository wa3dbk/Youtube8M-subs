and I'll show you guys kind of the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.590 
and I'll show you guys kind of the
mechanics<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> game<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.400> right<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:05.640> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
mechanics of the game as of right now so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
mechanics of the game as of right now so
we'll<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.810> choose<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.130> we'll

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
we'll just choose this one and we'll

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120 
we'll just choose this one and we'll
choose<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> normal<00:01:08.939> race<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:10.260> we'll<00:01:10.650> use<00:01:10.830> my

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
choose a normal race and we'll use my

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.780 
choose a normal race and we'll use my
Tesla<00:01:11.640> car<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> I'd<00:01:13.320> say<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> graphics

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
Tesla car and I'd say that the graphics

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
Tesla car and I'd say that the graphics
have<00:01:14.970> made<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> huge<00:01:15.630> improvement<00:01:16.049> now<00:01:16.439> but

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
have made a huge improvement now but

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.190 
have made a huge improvement now but
another<00:01:17.369> stump<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> file<00:01:18.810> for

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
another stump is that the file for

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
another stump is that the file for
downloading<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.340> large<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
downloading this is really large so it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.359 
downloading this is really large so it
takes<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.659> lot<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> space<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.340> your

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
takes a lot of space up on your on your

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.100 
takes a lot of space up on your on your
device<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> guys<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.869> immediately

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
device and as you guys can immediately

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 
device and as you guys can immediately
see<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.310> great<00:01:26.520> graphics<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.240> mean<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
see it's really great graphics I mean a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.999 
see it's really great graphics I mean a
huge<00:01:27.780> improvement<00:01:28.380> from<00:01:28.409> last<00:01:28.560> year's

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
huge improvement from last year's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.399 
huge improvement from last year's
asphalt<00:01:29.490> five<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.079> what<00:01:31.290> they

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
asphalt five I really do like what they

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649 
asphalt five I really do like what they
did<00:01:31.470> with<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:33.030> sure<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.420> we're

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
did with it but I'm not sure if we're
