I<00:01:37.259> didn't<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.770> how<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> be

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I didn't know how it was going to be

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
between mommy SIV and I because like

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
between mommy SIV and I because like
you're<00:01:41.220> literally<00:01:41.880> moving<00:01:42.360> halfway<00:01:42.720> around

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
you're literally moving halfway around

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.960 
you're literally moving halfway around
the<00:01:42.960> world<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.380> live<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.159> two<00:01:44.369> people<00:01:44.610> you've

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the world to live with two people you've

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.230 
the world to live with two people you've
never<00:01:45.270> met<00:01:45.540> before<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.640> little<00:01:47.939> bit

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
never met before so I was a little bit

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.789 
never met before so I was a little bit
skeptical<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.869> how<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> turn

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
skeptical of how that was going to turn

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.010 
skeptical of how that was going to turn
out<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.670> turned<00:01:51.329> out<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> lot<00:01:51.750> better<00:01:51.899> than

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
out but it turned out a lot better than

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440 
out but it turned out a lot better than
I<00:01:52.290> thought<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.619> could<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.829> it's<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:54.240> cool

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I thought it could be it's a really cool

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.969 
I thought it could be it's a really cool
how<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> like<00:01:55.350> events<00:01:55.799> and

adapting to new culture ever over here

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.350 
adapting to new culture ever over here
wasn't<00:02:28.680> very<00:02:28.920> hard<00:02:29.250> especially<00:02:29.430> considering

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
wasn't very hard especially considering

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
wasn't very hard especially considering
it's<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.080> Netherlands<00:02:31.710> like<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.310> mom<00:02:32.460> said

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
it's the Netherlands like my mom said

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.400 
it's the Netherlands like my mom said
when<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:32.970> first<00:02:33.060> was<00:02:33.720> moving<00:02:34.020> here<00:02:34.140> she's<00:02:34.350> like

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
when I first was moving here she's like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.710 
when I first was moving here she's like
out<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.950> all<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.580> European<00:02:36.120> countries<00:02:36.150> he

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
out of all the European countries he

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.510 
out of all the European countries he
could<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:36.990> moved<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.920> Netherlands<00:02:38.370> is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
could have moved to the Netherlands is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.190 
could have moved to the Netherlands is
probably<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.000> easiest<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.570> transition

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
probably the easiest to transition

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.750 
probably the easiest to transition
because<00:02:40.380> everyone<00:02:40.950> speaks<00:02:41.100> English<00:02:41.370> there

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
because everyone speaks English there

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.790 
because everyone speaks English there
it's<00:02:42.030> not<00:02:42.210> too<00:02:42.480> much<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.840> culture<00:02:43.050> shock<00:02:43.380> so

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it's not too much of a culture shock so

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.690 
it's not too much of a culture shock so
I'm<00:02:43.890> really<00:02:44.040> happy

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I'm really happy

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.450
