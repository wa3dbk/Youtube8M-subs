00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
guess what all the three people that you

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.449 
guess what all the three people that you
have<00:04:11.540> at<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> back<00:04:12.020> will<00:04:12.620> be<00:04:12.650> sweating<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.280> out

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
have at the back will be sweating it out

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.970 
have at the back will be sweating it out
