 along the middle back line you perform 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.430
 lengthening necessary for a figure 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.159
 if there is a slouch then there is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.380
 remove the lengthening if the figure is not slouched 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.159
 whereas here the elongation is not performed and 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.240
 here in the protruding area of ​​the shoulder blade through 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.970
 tuck top 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.310

 the middle of the backline unfolds 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 breaks we restore it in a straight line 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.790
 restore the width of the mountain
