 you are watching new gameplay dmg 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.599
 first of all remind you all how 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.099
 I always make this gameplay is 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.220
 old as I'm looking up at the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.800
 left March 24, 2012 worth 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.390
 I want to remember for those who do not 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.910
 you know that a chosen metal gear online 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:36.050
 this multiplayer and it came included in 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.020
 metal gear solid 4 but it has already closed its 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.260
 servers last year on the 12th of 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.269
 June of last year of 2012 are worth 3 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.460
 you can not play anymore I want you to know 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.850
 that these games are old games 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.579
 old games 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.769
 that are not current that many people 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.860
 I commented I asked how do I do 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.839
 play better are not old games worth 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.519
 you can not play games are already games that the 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.390
 people record those that are still stored 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.950
 in his pc and he gives them to me or I take them 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.220
 to be able to use them in my comments 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.500
 well worth a lot to say 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.789
 surely I will talk very fast 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.440
 I'm going to make a very quick pass of 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.270
 all because I have many things to say 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.009
 and unfortunately the example that 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.610
 it better came to me that it was this is pretty 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.979
 short are only 6 minutes and little 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.149
 it reaches 7 minutes so it comes before 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.560
 usually means that good 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.530
 I'm already seeing it up 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.940
 name soso fallas vale and is a gameplay 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.850
 of the American server is worth 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.750
 also playing a dm a duel for 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.830
 equipment on a equipment bigmac 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.480
 against one of the clans seem to be more 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.120
 most prestigious celebrities in North America 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.830
 that was the clan of the causes which 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.740
 they will end up winning but good according to 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.600
 I commenting losing the gameplay and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.030
 well I hope as always that you like it 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.430
 the truth is that I use pretty good 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.780
 good and why he chose this gameplay 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.240
 Well, it suits me because 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.030
 as I said is the game on the server 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.450
 american voucher and american 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.650
 BNG come or talk or rather better 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.700
 the first news that I wanted to give you 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.459
 kojima yesterday August 29 made some 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.209
 statements on twitter or did 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.900
 statements or let's say 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.709
 comments or tweeted some words 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.930
 on twitter that possibly are depends 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.580
 how you look or how you interpret a 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.010
 very good news 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.290
 well here below example you will be 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.420
 watching the twitters are a series of 5 or 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.980
 tweets the most important of them is 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.220
 this you are seeing is the first 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.900
 tweet vale 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.900
 in oil to this one 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.870
 as you see these include is a tweet 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.319
 officer of colima vale tells us that 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.830
 The presentation of a 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:05.310
 gameplay in colima pro tele a estudios 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.590
 this I want to remind you that we took 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.210
 the student of the angels is a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.470
 study 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.920
 inaugurated or performed exclusively 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.260
 to make the online game of 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.160
 future metal days let's say it's a 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.860
 kojima's online division of kojima but 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.870
 good and what is said or if they are dedicated to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.850
 online is good news that is 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.580
 saying that it is inaugurated presented 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.060
 the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.310
 As you can see, some event has opened the 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.310
 next week an opening benders week 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:50.070
 then he tells us something about the alcor efe that 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.910
 now he is learning to make games 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.130
 beautiful for the audience 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.110
 this fairly quickly 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.180
 quickly when he said he wanted to do 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.630
 an attractive multiplayer to the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.630
 players and westernize it and that's why 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.910
 I associate this with that which says that 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.070
 is learning to make a beautiful game 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.800
 beautiful for the audience to say because 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.530
 they are trying to make a little showy 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:18.080
 this assumption m0 that I already tell you that 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.980
 it seems that it is the news of this 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.860
 tweet that they are working 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.490
 as we already knew in m &amp; g today in the online 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.080
 for metal gear solid 5 and good there 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.490
 it is like saying the week that comes to 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.680
 put an open event open 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.210

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.790

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.650
 next week 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.470
 Well, maybe we have more news 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.210
 of medium or we may not have them is 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.610
 simply be an open event but 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.030
 for the company but surely they are 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.030
 preparing something for the ts the tokyo game 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.280

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.370

 that I do not remember if when celebrating 19 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 As of September 22 we have two more 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.940
 weeks and something three weeks 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.009
 kojima along with his goal and the 5 are going to 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.750
 be in this event for sure this is not 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.130
 the disc the disc was a to the best 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.780
 we found that kojima wanted 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.650
 show something in europe 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.030
 the ts not the ts here play at home with a 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.090
 I surely have your own 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:35.020
 conference 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.660
 here in japan in Tokyo then metal 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.690
 gear solid 5 if you are going to be in the knit 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.860
 that and if you are going to see secure information 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.020
 metal gear online, well, that's the 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.699
 news may be that it finally appears 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.760
 we do not know 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.250
 I bet if they run out 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.440
 the time like this is a year so that 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.389
 is made online multiplayer game has 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.300
 to leave already then the tc this one can 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.310
 to be a good date is better there 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.760
 down today you are seeing some more tweet 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.580
 they are not relatively more important 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.039
 but good speaks 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.960
 speaks in the second tweet talks about not 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.810
 would you mind doing a demonstration 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.350
 but he says you can not talk and play 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.420
 at the same time this I did colima 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.520
 it also tells you that metal gear solid is 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.430
 like a game of existed infiltration 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.090
 it requires very delicate control or 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.340
 exclusive 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.030
 and that you although we see it 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.650
 so also 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.810
 the third tweet here is living it 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.810
 put 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:37.090
 and talk about what a beautiful gameplay or 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.580
 a beautiful game 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.280
 and talk about the development you have to have 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.250
 Maf set and strategy 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.900
 then he tells us about a situation that 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.600
 could give in the game I guess if 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.730
 you see a ladder you would like to climb but 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.410
 you would not do it like that in the first stay 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.100
 first classes you can not be that is 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.690
 this 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:07:00.780
 referring to strafe online or to a 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.789
 supposed scenario in a multiplayer of 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.229
 metal gear online let's say as the 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.300
 player is there more integral than the one 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:08.370
 express a ladder and you will not give 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.900
 strong account time that you can 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.729
 upload it until some time 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.919
 although I can go up to the roof talking 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.449
 some little things that we do not know about 

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.280
 what does he really talk about when he speaks 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.630
 simply from the metal gear game 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.210
 solid 5 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.970
 as we are saying it speaks from all 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.340
 since his first tweet that yesterday he tweeted 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.470
 all this of m &amp; g good I'm just the 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.510
 gameplay I'm done in fact the 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.940
 gameplay just wanted to be this 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.370
 information tell the date the tokyo 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.500
 game show and tell you that possibly more 

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.540
 m &amp; g information or be on the way 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.310
 I hope that we all hope also for 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.190
 supposed more metal information already 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.140
 solid 5 and nothing else is over 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:50.020
 employ so nothing later we will do 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.760
 more replace more comments with more in 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.470
 the field law of may so nothing that 

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.420
 tell you how to always give 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:58.230
 favorites comment and nothing a greeting and 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.230
 until the next video
