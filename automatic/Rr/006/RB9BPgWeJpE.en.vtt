00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:09.670
 1 Terror This game is really popular. 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:11.320
 Windrunner cookies ditch ran run La swing watching what's driven during this awful correct, but 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.040
 There is no world outside. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.840
 Anyway, this time I would like to introduce a unique indie game. 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.030
 Me and Light Rock 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.030
 top 5 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.540
 4 Hello table 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.739
 It's a game with 2 players, a game called Jump. 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.640
 It 's really a game for the future. 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.809
 That's it. 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.510
 I can get it free from the Play Store app store now. 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:48.400
 I hope you'll try one of the great graphics behind it. 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 I think it's really good. The stage is currently divided into eleven. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.430
 There are different ways to avoid the stage. 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.400
 In the case of district d 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.450
 Thus come and thus the hammer jjikeoyo 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.960
 Our Zeta 2 is also needed as a jump in sending it like this. 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:08.270
 Bush is dead. I can practice this way. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.670
 What if the same stage 6 is extinguished sun is gonna disappear two months 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.680
 This is now timing. 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.710
 Just jump in and jump . 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.729
 So, 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.050
 I think it has become easier as the stage won not easy 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.600
 I'm avoiding it now with the Resources tab. 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.960
 You do not just jump eopguyo yireongeo something slide 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.759
 I see that mere presence of that jump 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.830
 It looks very simple, but it never happens because it falls into the water. 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:48.420
 You have to pay attention to the explanation and the weight. 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:54.360
 It's progressing now. 21% now. It 's 100% tight. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:58.800
 So if you die in the middle of the stage, you have to do it again. 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.729
 This button is used to look at this example 15 looks first to see ad 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.670
 It's possible 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.700
 It's so annoying. 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700
 Ah 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.110
 so 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.930
 You should try not to die before clearing the stage 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.930
 Write neurons in that part going gatguyo 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.620
 Other than that, the game is okay . 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.480
 Between 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:30.070
 I think the 4 graphics in indie games are really great. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.820
 Especially when it comes to my knees, should I say that I feel like a Mein Craft Shader? 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.060
 4 Is that a little like that? 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:43.069
 It's okay. Very simple game. 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:48.200
 Sounds like gaming that makes it sound, so calm. 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:53.719
 Part number Let's clear this stage. Stage one. 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.230
 Well teeth will straighten them from the water, you do be careful when clipped corner chair 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.230
 50% 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.069
 And a difficult place is the cause of the stage 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:09.090
 Oh, that's it. It's hard to be. 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.200
 We have to be careful this way . 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.489
 same 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.900
 Now there's a basic menu. You do not need to see anything else. 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.380
 I'll take a look. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.959
 Right menu 2 Nick icon 4 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.760
 Where to buy characters 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.400
 It is also looking to buy a coil which to draw 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 Most have to make a thousand-dollar decision. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:37.069
 There are things I picked up with $ 0.99 , using drawing. 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.069
 Why do you draw 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:45.319
 Docking source to replace 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.870
 Yet the car to meet the Smile Smile icon collection 2 thermal limits 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.870
 Why 2 I do not know where to find this 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:04:01.680
 I do not have this. That's what it's like to be a dashboard adidaboard ranking. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.880
 2 How many points to Las but this will be linked with Google Play Play Google 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.360
 It's easy to know because it's a gamma salt. 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.160
 It 's a game that jumps along the way . 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.550
 When you try and look for players'm just playing out time nasilttae 2 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.380
 I hope. 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:22.620
 Slip game that I personally like doing these other parliamentarians and non-game between 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.680
 I think it's a game with some color appeal. 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.830
 So please try it. 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.160
 I'll meet you in another game.
