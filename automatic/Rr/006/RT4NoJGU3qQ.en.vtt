switches<00:02:43.950> were<00:02:44.220> probably<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.670> best<00:02:44.880> for

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
switches were probably the best for

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.520 
switches were probably the best for
recording<00:02:45.630> because<00:02:45.750> they're<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:45.990> most<00:02:46.170> quiet

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
recording because they're the most quiet

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980 
recording because they're the most quiet
so<00:02:47.520> that's<00:02:47.700> why<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.000> decided<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.540> go<00:02:48.660> with<00:02:48.780> them

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
so that's why I decided to go with them

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.680 
so that's why I decided to go with them
and<00:02:49.860> it's<00:02:49.980> LED<00:02:50.430> backlit<00:02:51.000> but<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.480> probably

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
and it's LED backlit but that's probably

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.650 
and it's LED backlit but that's probably
a<00:02:51.840> bit<00:02:51.959> fuzzy<00:02:52.200> probably<00:02:52.680> can't<00:02:52.890> even<00:02:52.950> see<00:02:53.280> that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
a bit fuzzy probably can't even see that

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.770 
a bit fuzzy probably can't even see that

which gives it the better recording
features<00:04:12.120> i<00:04:12.239> guess<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.630> gets<00:04:12.690> rid<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:12.959> some

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140
