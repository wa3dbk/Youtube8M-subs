one of the ways that you can deceive a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
one of the ways that you can deceive a
defender<00:00:26.189> who's<00:00:26.550> using<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> jump<00:00:27.240> technique

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
of the fake technique is a fairly easy

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160 
of the fake technique is a fairly easy
skill<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.099> master<00:00:32.300> what's<00:00:33.300> more<00:00:33.540> difficult<00:00:33.719> is

skill to master what's more difficult is

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.990 
skill to master what's more difficult is
timing<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> defender<00:00:35.700> believes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
timing so that the defender believes

your<00:00:36.180> first<00:00:36.480> movement<00:00:36.989> enough<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.500> commit<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
a jump or extended lead if you get it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
a jump or extended lead if you get it
right<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> defender<00:00:41.670> will<00:00:41.790> jump<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.329> or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
right then the defender will jump up or

right then the defender will jump up or
over<00:00:42.690> lean<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.230> response<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.829> your<00:00:43.920> first

you miss time your fake shot or use it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.850 
you miss time your fake shot or use it
so<00:00:51.449> often<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> defender<00:00:52.500> simply

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so often that the defender simply

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
so often that the defender simply
ignores<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> may<00:00:54.120> leave<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.690> no

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
shot you shouldn't set up or begin the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.120 
shot you shouldn't set up or begin the
movement<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:43.140> differently<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.829> your<00:01:43.920> normal

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
movement any differently to your normal

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
movement any differently to your normal
basic<00:01:44.640> shot<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> defender

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
basic shot if you do then a defender

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.859 
basic shot if you do then a defender
might<00:01:46.860> realize<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.579> won't<00:01:47.820> react<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.720> that's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
might realize and won't react so that's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
might realize and won't react so that's
the<00:01:49.049> fake<00:01:49.259> shot<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.799> let's<00:01:49.950> recap<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
the fake shot but let's recap on all the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
the fake shot but let's recap on all the
key<00:01:51.060> points<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> fake<00:01:52.890> shot<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
key points the fake shot is one of the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
key points the fake shot is one of the
ways<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.210> deceive<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.600> defender<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
ways you can deceive a defender and the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.170 
ways you can deceive a defender and the
double<00:01:55.979> action<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.430> feint<00:01:56.670> technique

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
double action of the feint technique

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.109 
double action of the feint technique
should<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> fairly<00:01:57.869> easy<00:01:57.990> skill<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> master

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
should be a fairly easy skill to master

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.179 
should be a fairly easy skill to master
but<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> timing<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.750> more<00:02:00.990> difficult<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:02.009> can

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
but the timing is more difficult it can

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.140 
but the timing is more difficult it can
really<00:02:02.399> mislead<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> defender

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
really mislead the defender

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.180 
really mislead the defender
set<00:02:04.720> up<00:02:04.870> as<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.110> would<00:02:05.260> put<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> regular<00:02:05.950> shot

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
set up as you would put a regular shot

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.820 
set up as you would put a regular shot
and<00:02:06.400> begin<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.730> normal<00:02:07.120> shooting<00:02:07.510> action

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
and begin the normal shooting action

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.910 
and begin the normal shooting action
exactly<00:02:08.830> as<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.100> would<00:02:09.280> for<00:02:09.490> your<00:02:09.520> basic<00:02:10.000> shot

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
exactly as you would for your basic shot

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.450 
exactly as you would for your basic shot
stop<00:02:11.920> suddenly

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
stop suddenly

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.160 
stop suddenly
somewhere<00:02:13.150> between<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.600> release<00:02:13.840> point

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
somewhere between the release point

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.600 
somewhere between the release point
rotating<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> fingers<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.580> your

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.270 
rotating the fingers of your
non-shooting<00:02:16.420> hand<00:02:16.480> around<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.860> front<00:02:18.100> of

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
non-shooting hand around and in front of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.730 
non-shooting hand around and in front of
the<00:02:18.400> ball<00:02:18.660> return<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.930> ball<00:02:20.110> quickly<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.650> the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
starting position and then proceed with

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.150 
starting position and then proceed with
a<00:02:22.780> normal<00:02:23.170> shot<00:02:23.410> at<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> goal<00:02:23.860> post<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.830> that's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
a normal shot at the goal post so that's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.640 
a normal shot at the goal post so that's
