00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
soon as your board pops your back foot

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.560 
soon as your board pops your back foot
scoops<00:00:42.899> back<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.160> bit<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.390> might

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
scoops back just a little bit it might

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.840 
scoops back just a little bit it might
even<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.620> bit<00:00:46.739> too<00:00:46.980> hard<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
even be a little bit too hard for you to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.270 
even be a little bit too hard for you to
notice<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.420> obviously<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.440> watching<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
notice but obviously here watching the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.979 
notice but obviously here watching the
video<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.760> super<00:00:51.120> slow-mo<00:00:51.570> frame-by-frame

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
video and super slow-mo frame-by-frame

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.040 
video and super slow-mo frame-by-frame
it's<00:00:52.530> pretty<00:00:53.100> obvious<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.449> here<00:00:54.600> again<00:00:54.690> watch

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it's pretty obvious so here again watch

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.470 
it's pretty obvious so here again watch
your<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.410> foot<00:00:55.649> right<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.910> just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
your back foot right there it just

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110 
your back foot right there it just
scoops<00:00:58.079> back<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> little<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
scoops back a little bit so it's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.200 
scoops back a little bit so it's
honestly<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.899> much<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:02.190> foot<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
honestly not so much that your foot is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
honestly not so much that your foot is
coming<00:01:03.840> off<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.290> much<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.580> your

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
coming off as much as it is like your

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.200 
coming off as much as it is like your
foot<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.270> shoving<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> board<00:01:07.140> away<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
foot is shoving the board away from you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.240 
foot is shoving the board away from you
so<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> ollie<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.320> back<00:01:10.530> foot<00:01:10.799> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
so on the ollie with your back foot it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
so on the ollie with your back foot it's
very<00:01:11.580> important<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> pop<00:01:12.570> straight

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
very important that you pop straight

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.940 
very important that you pop straight
down<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:14.000> your<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.420> foot<00:01:15.659> moves<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.680> side

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
down if your your foot moves from side

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.730 
down if your your foot moves from side
to<00:01:17.009> side<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.729> any<00:01:17.939> direction<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:19.200> gonna<00:01:19.380> push

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
to side in any direction it's gonna push

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.830 
to side in any direction it's gonna push
the<00:01:20.159> board<00:01:20.430> away<00:01:20.820> from<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:21.720> gonna

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
the board away from you and it's gonna

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.460 
the board away from you and it's gonna
be<00:01:22.020> extremely<00:01:22.770> hard<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.369> land<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
be extremely hard to land so this is the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.140 
be extremely hard to land so this is the
part<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.740> want<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.130> practice<00:01:26.520> right<00:01:26.759> here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
and you can probably do that pretty easy

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
and you can probably do that pretty easy
but<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.780> back

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the that motion right there as well

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.899 
the that motion right there as well
because<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.009> what's<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.729> your
