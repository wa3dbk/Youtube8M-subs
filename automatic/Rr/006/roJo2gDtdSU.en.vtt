00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.640
- Out it comes...

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.380
let's give it a spin.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.450
Oh man. That is bent...

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.520
E: Bent axle.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.600
Postscript: turns out the answer is
actually F: none of the above.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.920
We took it apart, something surprised me, 
so let's have a closer look at it.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.260
This axle that came out - turns out it's not bent.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.120
Even before the cone comes off the ball
path is even on the cone surface.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.740
We take the cone off and we'll do the roll test.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.199
Let's see what a good straight axle looks like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.040
Nice and straight.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.400
A bent axle would look something like that.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.409
So this axle is not bent.
It's clearly got some damage here,

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.020
It's clearly got some damage here, there was a problem,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.159
The problem was in the last assembly of the hub.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.780
Jumbled ball bearings out of place

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.440
caused the hub to be eccentric around the axle.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.660
A hub ball bearing down inside the shell
is causing these gouge marks.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.320
That's what caused the eccentricity.
That's what has ruined this axle.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.600
It's straight as can be - it would adjust fine

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.980
but that's a huge stress riser and likely to fail inside.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.780
So - that is the rest of the story. 
To get yours, take stuff apart.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.480
See you next time.
