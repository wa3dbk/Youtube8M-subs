00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:14.329
 certainly in these gte clanis marsi and they are 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.850
 back a slider my new video 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:19.340
 today brings comes to more beautiful bombs 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.680
 cintoia perhaps among many perhaps because not 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.150
 there are still so many and therefore 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.100
 I can't know for sure with 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.650
 those not admitted faster than in 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.030
 title will be there if then it will not be true ce 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.530
 write it in the comments not it 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.899
 in fact, we will immediately cancel it, I say it 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.399
 maybe in case this happens so that 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.679
 there are no cops of any kind 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.999
 however the enemies were very scarce I have it 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.989
 already mentioned also on my channel were 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:43.909
 indeed they were really scarce 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.469
 was present 11 minutes with the leap 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.390
 lampa that opens excuse me not me 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.030
 I always forget the name of the bar col 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.649
 e football adjustable silencer 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.280
 hold the lightning then of thomas 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:58.069
 peripheral profile what you view the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.539
 blows up silently and resistance 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.280
 he has no hot voice because he was mine 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.980
 new account with a name also 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.840
 quite weird ea 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.060
 in fact you will see it called camel 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.670
 red and in fact I won't have to look for some 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 mine I will use a hbr that will collect 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.530
 on earth that will help me a lot and up 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 this has had several problems in 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.150
 past and why obviously when 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.040
 opens you die in many erap points indeed 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.990
 in protection because then the map becomes 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.270
 completely different is almost exactly 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 opening I immediately approach the fort 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.229
 where to escape the caput having had 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.330
 I didn't want problems in the past 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.729
 in fact they had been dead at about 20 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.110
 in a row because I stayed at this one 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.360
 part think that after the earthquake 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.860
 it was all over a beautiful one came out 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.649
 gas discharge I died right away 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.869
 however to the enemies to point one already 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.369
 said they were scarce i wanted some and some 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.530
 what do you think of this thing 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.410
 according to me gameplay against enemies 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 it is not that we can do ad 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.009
 exception of black ops courage said 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.690
 even on the canal maybe I explained one 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.640
 bit in and it's still in this short time 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.039
 I try to explain it to the sale of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.289
 black ops yours where he was with a visage yes 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.060
 still managed to keep up with 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.530
 players maybe even stronger than you 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.390
 since a visa was not so 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.759
 difficult to do the first one he could 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.160
 doing so predominated the lobby over games 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.230
 where the active radar is not contemplated 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.000
 if you find it against a strong enemy it is not 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.680
 that great things can be done 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 especially 30 pitches in a row then 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.900
 according to me, finding myself in scarce is 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.780
 the only reason why we can 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.700
 make a gameplay here is the only note 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.230
 possibility for which it can be done 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.510
 then there are exceptions 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.000
 obviously there are those who are stronger and there 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.340
 succeeds I have nothing to say precisely 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 these people envy you a lot because 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.430
 manage to make better gameplay than 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.200
 mine this is obvious 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.590
 the gameplay was also the only one I hope 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.330
 may like quaero in the midst of sport 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.010
 it was open to me not open there 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.440
 I understood nothing more I got away with it 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.750
 very well and then at the end of the game 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.030
 or I will die the strange number I thought that 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.860
 had my own DNA killed me 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.140
 because I saw that at the same time 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.790
 in which it exploded that I died and it was 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.349
 seen the mini gem a bargain that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.060
 it seemed precisely the DNA that fell from the 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.069
 heaven then I was told that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.020
 it was a missile attack then gigi 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.520
 to me that I didn't understand anything 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.500
 and they died that way 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.240
 anyway some business to finish them and 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.980
 I hope you need it so I am 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.410
 I always like commented sign up 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.820
 if you are not yet passera gracious 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:36.770
 my skull is also enough to issue cards 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:39.430
 guys finished hello to all gtt 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.430
 killed
