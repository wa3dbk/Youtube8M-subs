00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
you I suggest have to copy this code and

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.390 
you I suggest have to copy this code and
then<00:02:55.859> inserted<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.489> this<00:02:56.790> part<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.299> a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
then inserted it in this part of you a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.520 
then inserted it in this part of you a
few<00:02:59.400> job<00:02:59.639> code<00:02:59.939> if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.299> do<00:03:00.480> still<00:03:00.719> format<00:03:01.230> this

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
few job code if you do still format this

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.979 
few job code if you do still format this
will<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.889> work<00:03:01.919> slightly<00:03:02.629> so<00:03:03.629> you<00:03:03.689> should

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
will not work slightly so you should

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.929 
will not work slightly so you should
definitely<00:03:04.019> update<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:05.040> code<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.639> the<00:03:05.669> new

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
definitely update your code to the new

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.890 
definitely update your code to the new
format<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:08.280> last<00:03:08.519> thing<00:03:09.299> here<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.689> quite

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
format and the last thing here is quite

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.349

important<00:03:10.409> and<00:03:10.530> remember<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.819> comma<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.299> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
important and remember the comma at the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.259 
important and remember the comma at the
end<00:03:12.419> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.079> line<00:03:13.349> above<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.609> need<00:03:15.060> this

small generators like this just send me
a<00:03:24.599> message<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.470> I'll<00:03:25.799> try<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.280> make<00:03:26.609> it<00:03:27.229> so

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
a message and I'll try to make it so
