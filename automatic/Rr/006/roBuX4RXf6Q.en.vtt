00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.600
 yes we already know the whole world the new 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.670
 galaxy s 6 has been the great winner of 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.260
 recently finished mobile world 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.420
 congress your metallic design the screen 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.070
 of the age model that revolutionizes 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 totally the way that so far 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.210
 we had to see a terminal 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 everything in general seems to be a 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 smartphone destined to succeed but 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.620
 many samsung users wonder 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.589
 if it's really worth it or not change 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.089
 Your recent Samsung Galaxy S 5 by the S6 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.360
 we ask different 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.739
 spokespersons of samsung and these we 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.739
 they answered as follows 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.890
 I would give the jump depends a little bit 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.379
 many conditioning things francisco 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 a goal that we go to level 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.530
 technological of course the jump I 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.509
 I think it's very big is 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.280
 practically abysmal and above all 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.020
 taking into account the main ones 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.110
 news the screen is that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.420
 It's practically double the resolution 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 the camera low very much the experience 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.950
 multimedia about all the performance of the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.899
 own terminal logically a galaxy is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.320
 type very well with the 1.0 update 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:32.190
 resources and others 3 clearly not 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.740
 they set up a new experience 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.780
 completely different but the same 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 other galaxy terminals of evolution 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 had been so significant here on 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.990
 everything also the main good the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.710
 The main advantage is that when you have 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.840
 a 15 in your hand and you take in that six and 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 average of first notes a solution 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.210
 completely different from a terminal 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.750
 a much more sensation 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.520
 the materials and in addition to evans is 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.799
 different that a consumer appreciates when 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.450
 final may seem silly or not 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.479
 depending because in the end it's one thing 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.979
 that you are going to catch 50 times a day and that 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.860
 you will be working 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.530
 using then that is something with what good 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.200
 Well, you know him 50 times a day 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.590
 and you're looking at it all day looking at 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.000
 classes in hand and a user at the end 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.730
 if you are really looking for 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.709
 benefits in this range of typical 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.209
 what is it that I use most of age especially 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.730
 the screen of what you see the most because 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.140
 a good screen that in the end people 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.860
 you just leave the camera in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.330
 house or the video camera example to 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.250
 end we go with the mobile everywhere 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.410
 from part of our life well a good 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.489
 camera and above all so go fast 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.410
 that had flowed well 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.660
 processor that the battery last you 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.190
 we also have a spectacular battery 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.560
 really everything that is read is circulated 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.760
 improvement 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.850
 but above all when you have in the 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.850
 hand 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.540
 that's why I would renovate almost that 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.760
 would renew the terminal but has already seen 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.380
 what he has on what he has seen 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.380
 what what gives us 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.160
 because they must change a is that's a 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.700
 other unique design are exceptional 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.830
 the uses of materials and other 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.660
 the fast loading options and in the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.030
 wireless card that until now 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.650
 we had bot cars on the other hand the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.520
 camera a very powerful camera that is going 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.700
 to allow taking some pictures 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.340
 impressive and an accessories sentra 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.860
 renovated 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.900
 that will give us much more much more 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.489
 game and then finally personal 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.190
 seen that it is a machine all the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.269
 hardware will allow us with these 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.269
 fast accesses
