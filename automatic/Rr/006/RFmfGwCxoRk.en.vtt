00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
it in ok that's it now you want to

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
it in ok that's it now you want to
identify<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.909> spot<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.720> pumpkin<00:01:18.930> where

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
identify the spot on your pumpkin where

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.440 
identify the spot on your pumpkin where
you're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.799> place<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.220> spigot<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.790> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you're going to place the spigot and so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.690 
you're going to place the spigot and so
we<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.600> marked<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.560> here<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.130> our

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
we just marked off right here as our

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.210 
we just marked off right here as our
point<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:25.350> our<00:01:25.500> pumpkins<00:01:25.860> super

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
point and because our pumpkins super

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.370 
point and because our pumpkins super
thick<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.670> top<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.270> tell<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:28.110> need<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
thick on top you can tell we need to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
thick on top you can tell we need to
thin<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> wall<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.250> using<00:01:29.759> your<00:01:29.880> scooper

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
thin out the wall so using your scooper

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.219 
thin out the wall so using your scooper
just<00:01:31.079> hollow<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.540> point<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> wall

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
just hollow out the point on the wall

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.920 
just hollow out the point on the wall
and<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.579> good<00:01:35.850> trick<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.210> discovered<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and a really good trick we discovered is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.410 
and a really good trick we discovered is
to<00:01:37.170> put<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.619> knife<00:01:38.340> through<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.270> can

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
to put a knife through so you can

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.920 
to put a knife through so you can
identify<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.110> hole<00:01:40.430> ok<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.700> ours<00:01:42.360> looks<00:01:42.720> good

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
identify that hole ok so ours looks good

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
identify that hole ok so ours looks good
now<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.909> we're<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.500> carve<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> hold

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
now and we're going to carve the hold

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.800 
now and we're going to carve the hold
with<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> spigot<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.390> did<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.780> was

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
with the spigot and all we did here was

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.750 
with the spigot and all we did here was
just<00:01:48.960> place<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
just place the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.120 
just place the
part<00:01:52.420> right<00:01:52.570> here<00:01:52.600> on<00:01:53.080> our<00:01:53.590> pumpkin<00:01:53.950> and

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
part right here on our pumpkin and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.340 
part right here on our pumpkin and
traced<00:01:54.370> it<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.610> pencil<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:55.540> had<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.690> plan<00:01:56.290> to

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
traced it in pencil so we had a plan to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.710 
traced it in pencil so we had a plan to
start<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.010> using<00:01:57.730> that<00:01:57.820> same<00:01:58.090> carving<00:01:58.570> knife

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
start and using that same carving knife
