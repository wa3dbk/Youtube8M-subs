00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
sure what that was all about yet but it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.200 
sure what that was all about yet but it
does<00:01:07.049> seem<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.920> getting<00:01:08.310> better<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> more

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
does seem to be getting better the more

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
does seem to be getting better the more
that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.049> for<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.470> reason<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:10.950> almost

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
that I do it for some reason it's almost

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.460 
that I do it for some reason it's almost
like<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.430> learning<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> really

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
like it's learning but I kind of really

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.490 
like it's learning but I kind of really
doubt<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> basically<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
doubt that so basically what you have to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.140 
doubt that so basically what you have to
do<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> open<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.630> camera

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150
