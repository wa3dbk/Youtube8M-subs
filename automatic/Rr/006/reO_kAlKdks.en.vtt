 hello and welcome to this new video 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.510
 today we are going to make a pack of 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.820
 western sky s 10 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.510
 if you approach by the blog you will give 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.900
 account of how good we have done in 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.050
 a pack of the same and that already booster has 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.260
 decided to present the the sky that 11 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.559
 is worth the later version on that day that 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.790
 will replace serially and that will now come 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.920
 with the new version 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.400
 but if they have a future but that of 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.890
 good moment he would be that day 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.880
 being 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.980
 being for sale 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.780
 let's perform in a pub let's see 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.610
 a little the design of the smartphone and then 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.700
 we will see a bit the characteristics 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.290
 let's start by taking out the smartphone 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.990
 from the box 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.330
 tell you that heaven that day is a 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.190
 smartphone that we are testing though 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.420
 already take time in the market because 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.420
 We wanted to try something 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.259
 of water to have a reference in 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 As the first woman refers to 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.030
 we try and let's see how we 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.770
 result 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.140
 first of all as usual 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 we found the smartphone if we remove 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.880
 protection we find the manual 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.880
 of user 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.960
 the helmets that the truth has being 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.890
 also very attractive 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.230
 the usb data cable and the adapter 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.960
 current 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.970
 we find the guarantee of 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.520
 smartphone 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.560
 It also brings me 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.590
 Card is crossing the sky 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.719
 an an affiliation card to the 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.719
 owners of the smartphone 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.359
 what would be a screen saver 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.219
 for the same in case we want 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.399
 protect the screen against the 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:13.799
 real already hard 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.799
 let's go now with what is 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.930
 it's amazing in its five inches and 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.630
 inch screens or we'll see the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.360
 characteristics but it is surprising what 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.920
 tremendously light that so light 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.550
 that are 118 grams of weight this is a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.350
 point 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:42.200
 to stand out in him 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.200
 I have all three since 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.870
 head so I do not remember but 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.150
 example one of the last videos that 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 we have seen him 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.870
 of heaven and forgiveness of heaven the sky 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.640
 be for example the week or darfur a 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.370
 smartphone that could be competing 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.340
 perfectly with the sky of that 10 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.920
 ok we found skin 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.420
 smartphone weighs 160 grams if not 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.439
 I remember badly this we are talking about 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:15.250
 118 grams is very very light good this 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:17.860
 smartphone is not mono body ills 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.830
 the casing is removed and we have access 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.370
 to what is inside of it to 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:29.380
 put the microsim card and the card 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.020
 of good microsim cards because 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.440
 like all Spanish manufacturers 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.870
 this smartphone is also double sim 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.170
 here we find the one in the entrance 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.620
 for the micro sim and tested for 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.220
 card 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.440
 microsd yeah well I'm going to zoom in a bit 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.569
 so you can see this, mark here that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.069
 this is the nfc port for you to know 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.409
 that is well nfc and good as you see the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.930
 material chosen by the water is 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.420
 plastic here we have the battery that already 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.959
 that we are here we mention it in a 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.959
 battery 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.520
 of 2000 daily 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.230
 and well let's continue with the part 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.390
 back since we are here here we 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.410
 we found with a multimedia speaker and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.880
 led flash and the rear camera that in 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.950
 this case is forgiveness of 8 megapixels 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.600
 of resolution in the lateral part 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.030
 left we found the buttons of 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.780
 raise and lower volume in the part 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.730
 front the 5 megapixel camera is worth 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.340
 a camera also very powerful for 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.160
 make video calls the end now that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.220
 the speaker is so fashionable 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.170
 called three capacitive buttons worth 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.760
 that the right part is not included 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.580
 we find the button 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.170
 On off lock and unlock 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.600
 in the lower part we find 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.760
 the microusb entry and to end 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.380
 at the top we find 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.970
 the headphone input 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.530
 let's continue a little with the 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.540
 characteristics although we have already 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.150
 mentioned some and as we said 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.690
 we have found with a smartphone 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:15.960
 with 5 inches of screen one 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:18.210
 hd resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.380
 the sharpness of the screen is something to 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.750
 value we have 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.090
 a good first impression 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.450
 with the screens and with the 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.640
 operation of the smartphone on 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.710
 processor is a 4 cores to 1.2 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.950
 gigahertz and we find a 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.390
 madrid 400 inside the stripes of 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.010
 one gigabyte gb of internal storage 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.170
 camera as we said 8 megapixels 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:48.340
 and 5 on the front 8 on the back 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:51.640
 2,000 million battery orders and over 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.410
 all very valuable the weight 118 grams 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.940
 that turns this smartphone into one 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.530
 of the lightest we've had 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.139
 our hands with 5 inches of 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:02.419
 screen but the one that picture for now 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.370
 good for the moment what we wanted 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.439
 count we are performing the tests 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.169
 of the smartphone let's go let's continue 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.150
 testing it to see how the 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.889
 true that first impressions 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.080
 point to how well the smartphone 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.330
 moves with total fluency and responds 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.790
 pretty good but we'll have to 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.920
 perform the 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.420
 some other test more for 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.370
 to see what the degree of 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.010
 Satisfaction does not deserve the smartphone 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.310
 without anything thank you very much and until next 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.310
 videos
