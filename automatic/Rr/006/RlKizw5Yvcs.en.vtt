00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
tissue for clone to be made but I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.590 
tissue for clone to be made but I'm
pretty<00:01:11.540> sure<00:01:11.659> she<00:01:11.930> dies<00:01:12.110> um<00:01:13.090> another<00:01:14.090> thing<00:01:14.210> is

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
pretty sure she dies um another thing is

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.490 
pretty sure she dies um another thing is
that<00:01:14.630> at<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.260> end<00:01:15.380> of<00:01:15.500> this<00:01:16.330> video<00:01:17.330> she<00:01:17.600> seems

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
that at the end of this video she seems

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.410 
that at the end of this video she seems
to<00:01:18.620> be<00:01:18.710> talking<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:19.159> somebody<00:01:19.460> some<00:01:20.180> people

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
to be talking to somebody some people

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.999 
to be talking to somebody some people
think<00:01:20.540> that's<00:01:20.690> actually<00:01:20.960> Master<00:01:21.470> Chief<00:01:21.770> I

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
think that's actually Master Chief I

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.980 
think that's actually Master Chief I
really<00:01:22.789> doubt<00:01:22.969> that<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.299> think<00:01:23.630> it's<00:01:23.750> just<00:01:23.930> a

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
really doubt that I think it's just a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.630 
really doubt that I think it's just a
new<00:01:24.110> character<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:25.009> we<00:01:25.159> haven't<00:01:25.520> really

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
new character that we haven't really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.760 
new character that we haven't really
heard<00:01:25.880> of<00:01:26.060> so<00:01:26.659> we'll<00:01:26.990> have<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.289> find<00:01:27.469> that<00:01:27.619> on

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
heard of so we'll have to find that on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.529 
heard of so we'll have to find that on
the<00:01:27.950> retail<00:01:28.340> version<00:01:28.520> another<00:01:29.210> thing<00:01:29.450> I

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
the retail version another thing I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.209 
the retail version another thing I
wanted<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.840> talk<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.469> you<00:01:30.649> guys<00:01:30.680> about<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:31.189> a

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
wanted to talk to you guys about is a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:32.800 
wanted to talk to you guys about is a
little<00:01:31.460> theory<00:01:31.820> of<00:01:31.909> mine<00:01:32.119> for<00:01:32.450> what<00:01:32.600> this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
little theory of mine for what this

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.539 
little theory of mine for what this
video<00:01:33.109> could<00:01:33.259> hint<00:01:33.590> for<00:01:33.859> the<00:01:33.950> retail<00:01:34.130> version

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
video could hint for the retail version

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.380 
video could hint for the retail version
of<00:01:34.939> reach<00:01:35.180> um<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.979> trail<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.729> video<00:01:38.060> itself

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
of reach um the trail the video itself

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.630 
of reach um the trail the video itself
is<00:01:38.600> called<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:38.960> Spartan<00:01:39.350> will<00:01:39.500> rise<00:01:39.710> now<00:01:40.310> that

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
is called a Spartan will rise now that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.709 
is called a Spartan will rise now that
really<00:01:41.060> doesn't<00:01:41.299> make<00:01:41.450> much<00:01:41.509> sense

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
really doesn't make much sense

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.870 
really doesn't make much sense
considering<00:01:42.439> noble<00:01:42.979> team<00:01:43.159> is<00:01:43.340> already<00:01:43.490> there

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
considering noble team is already there

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.459 
considering noble team is already there
um<00:01:44.649> so<00:01:45.649> I<00:01:46.009> I<00:01:46.369> went<00:01:47.090> on<00:01:47.149> Halo<00:01:47.450> Waypoint<00:01:47.719> and<00:01:48.259> the

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
um so I I went on Halo Waypoint and the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.139 
um so I I went on Halo Waypoint and the

waypoint<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.990> actually<00:01:51.890> reachable<00:01:52.310> fall<00:01:52.609> but

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
waypoint is actually reachable fall but

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.300

from<00:01:53.179> her<00:01:53.299> ashes<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.840> Spartan<00:01:54.409> must<00:01:54.619> rise<00:01:54.920> I

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
from her ashes a Spartan must rise I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.190 
from her ashes a Spartan must rise I
don't<00:01:56.030> know<00:01:56.149> what<00:01:56.299> what<00:01:56.420> you<00:01:56.539> guys<00:01:56.689> think<00:01:56.929> but

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
I think that must mean that um that's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.560 
I think that must mean that um that's
probably<00:02:01.369> talking<00:02:01.670> about<00:02:01.820> master<00:02:02.299> Ching

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570

that<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.360> why<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.900> says<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.530> Spartan<00:02:13.190> must<00:02:13.430> rise

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
that is why it says a Spartan must rise

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.780 
that is why it says a Spartan must rise
um<00:02:14.200> from<00:02:15.200> her<00:02:15.350> ashes<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.710> Spartan<00:02:16.100> must<00:02:16.280> rise<00:02:16.460> so

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
um from her ashes a Spartan must rise so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.090 
um from her ashes a Spartan must rise so
that<00:02:17.090> makes<00:02:17.330> sense<00:02:17.600> um<00:02:18.200> also<00:02:18.860> at<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
that makes sense um also at the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.340 
that makes sense um also at the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
it out of reach alive so that could

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.790 
it out of reach alive so that could
possibly<00:02:26.450> mean<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.750> noble<00:02:27.200> team<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.590> trying
