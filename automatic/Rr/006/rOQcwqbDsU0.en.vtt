natural<00:01:03.990> right<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.979> really<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.060> using

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
natural right now I really like using

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.389 
natural right now I really like using
the<00:01:06.420> colors<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.109> is<00:01:07.259> more<00:01:07.499> expensive<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
the colors but it is more expensive and

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:11.200 
the colors but it is more expensive and
it<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:08.999> adds<00:01:09.240> up<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.749> he<00:01:09.899> is<00:01:09.990> unnatural

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
it really adds up so he is unnatural

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.160 
it really adds up so he is unnatural
