 Calories are more mature have more 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.129
 quantity then also goes down the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.500
 prices a drop in prices 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
 further propitiated by the port strike 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.819
 in san antonio a million and a half of 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.399
 fruit boxes could not be 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.830
 exported their next destination then 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.690
 will be the central vega install willful 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.000
 until the strawberries 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.310
 the cherry until the cherries until the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.659
 export peaches to the pear the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.100
 apple that starts came out like this there's a 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.780
 amount of fruit we from a country is 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.549
 please and if we do not comply 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
 commitments of those serious therefore 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.690
 this fruit to the disposition of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.040
 public at a really reasonable cost 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:38.550
 that is , the seriousness 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.550
 down 2008 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.680
 It becomes much difference between the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.540
 national fruit and export is at 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.270
 the view and not only it shows in the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.210
 prices a cherry a flotilla or the grape 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.780
 that leaves the biggest tasty country and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.780
 of better quality 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.640
 you can not and we take advantage of 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.110
 quality 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.270
 we take advantage of quality because we eat 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.070
 better how is the store that exports in 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.590
 different different a bit even from 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.450
 the structure that you are the national least 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.700
 sweet that the national that normally the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.180
 European the American requires less 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.690
 sweetness 1500 pesos costs today the kilo of 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.480
 grape without peel a thousand strawberries 1500 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.350
 the furry peaches and 2000 the kilogram 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.780
 cranberries 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.780
 everything indicates that yes the next days 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.780
 we will pay less for better quality 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.350
 obviously if prices have gone up but 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.180
 it's worth someday that we eat something 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.430
 good because we are always eating it 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.530
 the works left by our countries 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.510
 bad that good does not come 'they say and here 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.040
 in the vega the fruit lagged in the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.040
 port of all wrong
