00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello to all and a jack and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.430
 verdict today we find ourselves for 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.680
 a video on the 2012 Tour de France 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.040
 so this is the 17th stage of this tour of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.300
 la France 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 and as you see guys do not have it 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.179
 of respite directly attacked with richie 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.710
 door 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.540
 the Yeti because they have white jersey 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 with red polka dots from this tour de france so 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.119
 there are two passes of out of category in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.600
 this step and more passes first 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.359
 category 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.949
 so the goal was that I attack that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.289
 I'm in the breakaway but who is not 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 too many people in the breakaway like 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.689
 I did not have to play everything 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.930
 school because it takes a long time 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.420
 crazy it takes a crazy time on the xbox and 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.750
 I could take almost all the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 points 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.010
 so I was careful that second 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.309
 of the white classification with red dots that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 is kessiakoff not be in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.930
 the breakaway what was the case and so we 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 can see and have as there is 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.579
 had some magic hey I simulated 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.710
 almost all the time up until then 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 and then I took the end of simulation 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.829
 so at that moment and then I had 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.719
 made me fall behind 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.820
 by two runners who are blake blel 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.909
 kadri I do not know his name anymore 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.610
 it starts with a b but it's kadri and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 luis leon sanchez 1 so I was I 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.560
 third then there is I believe there 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:20.909
 had at 3-4 minutes I had kadri and a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.409
 minute of me was there serves him and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.479
 sanchez and we can see that the jersey 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.840
 yellow that is by the wings and at 23 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.110
 minutes 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.960
 so then I'm good I take 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.210
 richie door and I will try to do 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.350
 the rest at max to take the jersey 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.400
 yellow with richie door 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.020
 good knowing that these buildings this 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.250
 that he has but hey one more player who 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 is well placed in the general classification 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.210
 Guys it does not refuse so you had to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 that richie door ends 11 minutes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.820
 before before bradley wiggins 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.600
 so we can see that quadrillait is coming 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.409
 win the stage 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.939
 so we want to see that they had when 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.950
 even a small gap we need to know 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.340
 it's the first one that has 22 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.350
 minutes 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.790
 but I 'm not the first then 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.170
 blow I must at least feel comfortable 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 have to be at 16 minutes 15 minutes from 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.409
 yellow jersey so that's the goal it was 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.899
 that I take the yellow jersey with 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.700
 richie door and so we will see together 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.989
 if it will do it or not and it's true 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.220
 that there is not too much of this step has been 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.990
 a little mundane 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.040
 I attacked I took all the points 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.120
 for the white jersey with red polka dots 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.460
 besides blue and white with red polka dots 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.040
 that I have really well consolidate but 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.840
 I will be white jersey with red polka dots 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.680
 Normally at the end of the tour de France 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.450
 because I think he's staying 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.220
 only one mountain stage 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.830
 and whatever happens there will not be enough 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.480
 of points to catch me so 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.650
 it's pretty official guys on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.270
 can already tell you that I am 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.500
 white jersey with red polka dots with richie 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.030
 door of this tour de france so I 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.230
 was also careful of mistakes 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.100
 because andy schleck attacked 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.150
 michalek who was seconds away at 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.800
 few seconds of bradley wiggins who 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.240
 was presently but the young had 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.150
 attacked and what you need to know is 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.440
 that even if the richie wears and jersey 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.240
 yellow there is still a stage of 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.770
 mountain and a step against the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.300
 so watch in my head it was 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.760
 almost sure that richie door 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.700
 even having the yellow jersey with a 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.440
 or two seconds finally advances one or 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.060
 two minutes of wandering he would finish 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.620
 definitely not yellow jersey of this 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.130
 tour de france so to as I could the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.640
 show 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.580
 a disc is an enemy u17 of two 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.170
 buildings this ranking 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.640
 in the provisional ranking 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.970
 general I mean before before this 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.430
 step 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.500
 so here and we can see that in the 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.720
 general finally in the stage ranking 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.000
 provisional andy schleck was at over 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.510
 of a minute from Bradley Wiggins after 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.740
 his attack 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.000
 so frankly I was in the process of 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.640
 train I said to myself good is what I 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.990
 continue or where would I do I 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.940
 did not have the choice fall and I continue 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.290
 but I have the game stressed because I 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.340
 knew very well that as I tell you 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.610
 say I will not win the tour de france 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.610
 with richie door and suddenly I say 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.020
 all on arms the wings here we are it's 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.490
 true I speak a little a lot and a little 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.810
 quickly but I hope it's 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.610
 understandable and then well ben here 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.050
 I like to talk a little about this trick 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.710
 I find they love exciting 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.420
 could you think that 50 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.600
 when we take the sky is not too many games 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.090
 all this but finally not at all 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.830
 it's really interesting so for the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.730
 green jersey normally it must be 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.920
 good good everything remains to be done but 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.750
 Normally that I was almost the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.960
 main so I think it's going to be 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.239
 good 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.489
 so here we can see that this is a life 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.200
 schleck we can see that froome and wings 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.360
 are far enough I ask them to 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.410
 relay to the max and there I will go under 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.090
 the red flame as you can see 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.140
 and then what's going to be interesting 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.490
 is really going to be seeing the ranking 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.530
 general the general classification in the end 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.510
 of stage the guy will be a lot but 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.550
 so a lot of changes and huge 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.440
 step one step 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.540
 we might think banal but in fact 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.000
 not at all we'll see all this together 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.440
 would be clash given deep down I had 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.600
 more bars virtue richie door it is 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.100
 more beard is green bar so even 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.340
 with that I got myself I was really telling myself 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.490
 that for the next stage it was going to be 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.870
 a little hot so here we go see if I 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.240
 I get the yellow jersey with richie 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.900
 door 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.010
 then we will wait for everyone 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.500
 happen that maybe take a little 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.090
 piece of time because oh well there 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.530
 not many people who have arrived so 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.730
 there finally they are a little far 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.220
 so we can see that kadri won 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.930
 sanchez 2nd at 5 minutes month end richie 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.880
 door to 6 minutes and there were 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.120
 other escaped with daniel sound what 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.090
 had let go a little bit before that are 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:26.170
 behind then she is if it was 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.030
 possible that you go go go 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.620
 fuck and they're coming that's right 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.570
 that we are caught like twenty 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.740
 minutes on them so it's not nothing but 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.970
 the goal is there I was really waiting 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.430
 I was really waiting to see if I had 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.470
 got yellow jersey and especially if 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.040
 higgins was a little late on 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.630
 andy schleck 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.070
 a good thing to know is that it 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.960
 there is still a time trial and 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.240
 bradley wiggins is the favorite of this 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.470
 step has nothing to say then there the picture does 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.930
 do not block it's really here it is 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.890
 comes a breakaway that was at 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.740
 departures that happen 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.630
 and that's everybody's coming our 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.010
 nibali evans pierre rolland who arrive 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.900
 at the same time as andy schleck so I'm 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.930
 say it's good I was really telling myself 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.260
 it's showing you that it's finally 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.310
 we will see that brad lewis did not succeed 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.900
 to hang andy schleck 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.710
 so we'll show you all that 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.310
 it's true that it's a bit boring to 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.720
 everyone arrives it's a little bad 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.310
 do but hey it's okay listen 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.290
 the guys there is soon the tour de france 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.110
 2013 who will come out to us as I wanted 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.310
 said i'll try to see to see her 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.390
 before so I hope it will pass 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.510
 I hope that it will work 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.280
 then good to play games the legates the 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.840
 next day or the same evening you have a 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.740
 video and it will be really cool go there 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.240
 stay longer than that when a 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.470
 fifty or so bodies that will arrive 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.590
 so the camera I saw that the 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.000
 tenth game wipeout ring ding dong 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.280
 really but what is sure is that 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.590
 I will be yellow jersey with richie porte 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.560
 because there is a 13 minute gap with 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.320
 andy schleck including bradley wiggins who 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.860
 happens a minute as we can see 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:54.240
 a little over a minute 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.120
 after andy schleck and there we can see at 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.620
 overall ranking appear to be enormous at 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.570
 general classification richie door and 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.300
 yellow jersey with 2 minutes 30 advanced 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:06.120
 on bradl all inks kadri third the 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.560
 frame guy he's 3rd and andy schleck is 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.990
 fourth so we can see that it was 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.100
 really a good a nice step a 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.570
 suspense stage 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.950
 and yeah frankly it was really 

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.830
 cool so you take even more advanced 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.270
 for the team ranking and we 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.620

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.090

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.160
 step 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.810

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.760
