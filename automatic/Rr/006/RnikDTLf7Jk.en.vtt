very kind of watery and I automatically

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.119 
very kind of watery and I automatically
thought<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:58.020> really<00:00:58.140> my<00:00:58.350> skin<00:00:58.590> oily

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
have to end up returning it I also felt

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980 
have to end up returning it I also felt
that<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.710> might<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.220> cover<00:01:05.519> at<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.990> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
that it might just not cover at all so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.039 
that it might just not cover at all so
I'm<00:01:07.320> after<00:01:07.950> testing<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.270> applying<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.869> my
