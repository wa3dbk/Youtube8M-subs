00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:22.840
 Paris and decided to play Sam in Syria 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.180
 first blood and this is a great toy i 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.180
 I think you will have fun to me, then certainly 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.149
 it will be fun well I have already passed it 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.870
 several times and now I will try to go 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.840
 no i don't worship i don't even master well i don't 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.090
 what averages so here on loaded in 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.210
 principle ha quite old so what if 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:50.590
 Well, I do not know, let's see the screensaver probably 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:53.050
 so the very beginning of the 19th century all the newspapers of the world 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.200
 wrote about a terrific discovery made 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.940
 archaeologists egypt under the ruins of the ancient 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.399
 from famous civilizations have been found 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.200
 the next medium is another even more ancient 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.940
 however surprisingly advanced technology 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.680
 shorter lobby 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.930
 hammer if you want to put on 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.480
 pause and read 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.630
 Basically, I like this plot. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.760
 interesting very curious 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.410
 especially on the rear picture this one 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.050
 beautiful cosmos what a handsome man he is brave 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:32.170
 earthlings fought well and shorter now 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.070
 will have to go go and fight with 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.590
 those terrible forces dungeon 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.390
 in fact they are not dungeons but they 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.909
 so scary 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.560
 candida with candidate choice of problems not 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:53.670
 arose so but this candidate is me 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 harry shift 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.310
 so well of course we will see grafon 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.380
 the game is old but very interesting now 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.540
 it's generally difficult to find somewhere just the same 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.300
 a game with the same graphics your very 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.470
 funny game very funny yes 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.470
 this perspective is interesting 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.689
 so well 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.100
 Egypt 1378 AD 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.750
 so the sun shines too boring so well 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.550
 and here is the very first year 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:41.670
 I entered into my we are ready for battle and I 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.780
 I remember that over there lies 2 colt well see 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.990
 Grafon is basically not bad for those years and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.990
 by macroscop 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.920
 so here's the number I already killed two 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.560
 lightning sparkle sadness no i 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.239
 I know this place is not too late 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.239
 no no no no 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.350
 see what a master and just a monster and 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.620
 It was 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.510
 it all developed 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.800
 here is level five 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.850
 much last there 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.850
 just a stock by words 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.140
 yumorok too present so 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.519

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.430
 they wo n't kill 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.620
 the third course and not the third cake so 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.620
 f6 then yes and preserved 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.390

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.030
 which he perceives the world and 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.180
 also a large stock of bond 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.800

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.130
 lived up to 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:04.490
 but I was not holding onto me 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.490
 confused by this nicely beautiful room 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.590

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.030
 but she 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.380
 there is no such thing as taking into account the change of pain 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.760

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.760

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.190
 Thank you all for your attention next time I 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.330

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.000

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.830
 liked put likes didn't like 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.140

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.900
 the next video and I will not walk 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.310
