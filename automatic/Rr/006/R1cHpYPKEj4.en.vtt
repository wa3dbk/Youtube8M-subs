fired<00:02:37.750> but<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.740> realized<00:02:40.250> why<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.459> can't

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
fired but I so I realized why I can't

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.310

get<00:02:40.850> nobody<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.270> fire<00:02:41.480> me<00:02:41.780> from<00:02:41.870> stand-up
