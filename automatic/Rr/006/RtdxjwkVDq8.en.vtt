00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:20.829
 Here the arrow has passed the test so far 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:28.909
 all connections are whole 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:29.739
 it means the arrow profile has not changed and but 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:36.140
 he is even 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:40.340
 nowhere bent nothing so I am here 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:48.850
 boom boom profile metal not 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 shut further metal everywhere closed 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.660
 nowhere bend nothing 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.890
 hinge all integers 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.479
 a little bit of this place is written on you 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:24.850
 then cooked bushings as was done here 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:30.350
 here 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:36.110
 a little spot broke but it now 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:39.070
 fix them later when installing the boom 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.600
 when install racks 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.600
 I advise a little away 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.119
 dislodge the arrow from the exhaust here at 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.180
 see me very close 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:02:01.600
 centimeter 3 pipe arrow passes 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.600
 Arrow does not touch the cylinder is put in the end 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:12.800
 here it is not visible 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:25.970
 shift the cylinder this way so 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:31.519
 principle the cylinder passes began to do 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:37.900
 villas in general are 10 by 10 square 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:43.940
 main frame channel 140 rack 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:49.640
 valve made valve hinge made 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.600
 built into these racks ie pieces 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.200
 cooked pipes 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.769
 they have a valve pipe that is it 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.769
 will already be 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:07.849
 the valve here means shaybochki brewed 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:15.560
 so that the pipe does not fly out of two 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:20.359
 the parties here are the same villas themselves with 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.629
 pipe nct two inch creed tiles 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.629
 mounted they put here in these bushings 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:31.659
 made of two and a half inches of pipe 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.659
 nkt also they are tightly welded 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.720
 here bye 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.720
 in this condition
