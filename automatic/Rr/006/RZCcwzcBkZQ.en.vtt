00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.889
Smart ForFour (the 4-doors one) and new Renault Twingo. One German, the other

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.700
French, but what they have in common? Many things: to begin, they are produced on

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.949
the same platform and in the same plant, and then, at a glance,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.730
we see, in the inside, that the seats are completely identical.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.730
Well, today we will try to compare them!

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
They have a nice and dynamic design, are the result of a joint-venture between two

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.399
giants of the automotive world and both are candidates to become

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.870
champions of sales in the coming months:

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.290
the new versions of Renault Twingo and Smart ForFour are just arrived in the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.730
italian dealerships; these two models have different objectives and past:

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.370
if the franch car, in fact, comes from a twenty-year history,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.800
full of successes and millions of autos sold worldwide, the

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.550
the "stretched" variant of the German citycar certainly had not the same

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.270
luck, going out of production (in 2006) just two years after the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.360
commercial launch.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.460
Comparing them, we note that, at the level of external body, the differences are

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.130
more obvious, with the French car that adopts a more streamlined design, and the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.030
German one that prefers softer and rounded surfaces; in conclusion, 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
it was allowed some freedom on the respective departments of design

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.600
In the front, the respective calenders and lower air intakes 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.620
to distinguish the two models

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.410
The ForFour is 10 cm shorter than the Twingo (3,49 meters in total),

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.840
while the French car is 3,59 meters long;

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.550
however, they share the "skeleton" and the mechanical scheme 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.550
with the rear engine

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.270
Inside the car, things go differently,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.630
with seats and practical solutions (as the compass-opening glasses) very similar

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.919
between the two models;

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.899
even on a technical level the similarities are not lacking, with a

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:18.049
rear engine structure and the same units on both cars: the new

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.889
Twingo and ForFour, in fact, will be equipped with the 3-cylinder 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:27.969
71 HP aspirated engine and the 900 Turbo with 90 HP of power.

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.409
So we have some differences and many points in common for the Renault and Smarts cars, but

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.409
which one will become the favorite of motorists?

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.449
To decide, as always, will be the market.
