to be aware of everything behind you
yeah

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.640 

a<00:03:11.370> little<00:03:12.370> less<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.790> this<00:03:13.209> kind<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.870> help<00:03:14.500> yeah

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
a little less of this kind of help yeah

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.530 
a little less of this kind of help yeah
a<00:03:14.739> little<00:03:15.099> less<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.370> that<00:03:15.400> puppet<00:03:15.790> movement<00:03:16.120> as

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
a little less of that puppet movement as

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.199 
a little less of that puppet movement as
you<00:03:16.720> years<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.140> years<00:03:17.319> you're<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:18.400> into<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.730> go

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
you years and years you're so into it go

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.130 
you years and years you're so into it go
into<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.450> 40<00:03:20.549> check<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.760> pots<00:03:22.000> behind<00:03:22.690> check

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
into a 40 check on the pots behind check

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.729 
into a 40 check on the pots behind check
it's<00:03:23.319> hard<00:03:23.620> also<00:03:23.920> my<00:03:24.129> check<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:26.440> your<00:03:26.590> eyes

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
it's hard also my check just your eyes

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:27.990 
it's hard also my check just your eyes
are<00:03:27.010> moving<00:03:27.250> all<00:03:27.370> over<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.700> place<00:03:27.879> you're

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
looking at the clock you check it you

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.110 
looking at the clock you check it you
know

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.690 

you're<00:03:33.019> looking<00:03:33.590> back<00:03:33.800> at<00:03:33.950> your<00:03:34.040> ingredients

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
you're looking back at your ingredients

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.240 
you're looking back at your ingredients
thinking<00:03:35.360> ten<00:03:35.690> steps<00:03:35.959> ahead<00:03:36.050> you<00:03:36.980> know<00:03:37.069> all

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
thinking ten steps ahead you know all

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.790 
thinking ten steps ahead you know all
that<00:03:37.370> stuff<00:03:38.019> we're<00:03:39.019> just<00:03:39.170> checking<00:03:39.319> once<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:39.769> a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
that stuff we're just checking once in a

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.650 
that stuff we're just checking once in a
while<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.489> it's<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.879> lot<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.060> staying<00:03:41.390> in<00:03:41.540> one

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
while but it's a lot of staying in one

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.390

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
in your mind okay but not so much you

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.740 
in your mind okay but not so much you
think<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.099> then<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.819> a<00:03:46.879> you<00:03:47.300> have<00:03:47.599> a

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
think of it then you have a you have a

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.420 
think of it then you have a you have a
legal<00:03:48.470> cat<00:03:48.799> here<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.160> you're<00:03:49.280> always

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
legal cat here that you're always

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.180 
legal cat here that you're always

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
Millennium Falcon jumping all the pigs

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.990 
Millennium Falcon jumping all the pigs
yeah<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:10.040> know<00:04:10.130> what<00:04:10.310> we<00:04:10.400> got<00:04:10.519> going<00:04:10.730> on<00:04:10.790> well

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
so you start to kind of play around with

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.900 
so you start to kind of play around with
all<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.110> food<00:05:09.290> here<00:05:09.590> and<00:05:10.220> start<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.520> get<00:05:10.700> like

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
all the food here and start to get like

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.930 
all the food here and start to get like
this<00:05:11.200> food<00:05:12.200> obviously<00:05:12.950> even<00:05:13.430> at<00:05:13.610> this<00:05:13.790> stage

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
this food obviously even at this stage

this food obviously even at this stage
looks<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:14.570> much<00:05:14.750> different<00:05:14.810> than<00:05:15.200> Galois

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
looks so much different than Galois

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.700 
looks so much different than Galois
