things<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.149> might<00:02:06.270> become<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.959> new<00:02:07.380> family

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860

rules or whatever but what you're being
tested<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.630> are<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> printed<00:02:10.140> rules<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
tested on are the printed rules so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.770 
tested on are the printed rules so
always<00:02:11.039> go<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> books<00:02:11.819> go<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> manual

it's the guidelines that you're being
tested<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.610> okay

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
tested on okay

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.330 
tested on okay
an<00:02:16.410> example<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.819> um<00:02:18.000> colonoscopies<00:02:18.900> in

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
an example is with um colonoscopies in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.640 
an example is with um colonoscopies in
the<00:02:20.340> CPT<00:02:20.760> book<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.120> says<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.420> use<00:02:21.540> modifier<00:02:21.959> 53

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the CPT book it says to use modifier 53

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.910 
the CPT book it says to use modifier 53
if<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:24.420> can't<00:02:24.720> complete<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.590> colonoscopy

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
if you can't complete the colonoscopy

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.410 
if you can't complete the colonoscopy
because<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.400> prep<00:02:26.640> wasn't<00:02:26.970> done<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:27.270> or

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
because the prep wasn't done right or

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.440 
because the prep wasn't done right or
whatever<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.010> real<00:02:29.250> world<00:02:29.580> most<00:02:30.000> payers

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
whatever in the real world most payers

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.360 
whatever in the real world most payers
will<00:02:30.720> tell<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.140> what<00:02:31.590> code<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:31.950> far<00:02:32.190> as<00:02:32.280> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
will tell you what code as far as you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.309 
will tell you what code as far as you
got<00:02:32.520> because<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.510> know<00:02:33.599> colonoscopy<00:02:34.170> goes

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
got because you know colonoscopy goes

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.510 
got because you know colonoscopy goes
you<00:02:34.500> know<00:02:34.620> all<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> way<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.040> over<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.459> down

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
you know all the way up over and down

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.270 
you know all the way up over and down
the<00:02:36.360> whole<00:02:36.569> shebang<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.709> they've<00:02:37.860> also<00:02:38.069> got

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the whole shebang but they've also got

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.339 
the whole shebang but they've also got
you<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:38.909> practicing<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.689> it's<00:02:39.780> only<00:02:39.900> go<00:02:40.049> part

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
you know practicing so it's only go part

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.400 
you know practicing so it's only go part
way<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> colon

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
way up the colon

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.750 
way up the colon
so<00:02:41.740> they'll<00:02:41.890> say<00:02:41.980> well<00:02:42.130> if<00:02:42.190> that's<00:02:42.340> as<00:02:42.490> far<00:02:42.670> as

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
so they'll say well if that's as far as

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.560 
so they'll say well if that's as far as
you<00:02:42.850> got<00:02:42.970> Koda<00:02:43.510> practicing<00:02:44.610> but<00:02:45.610> in<00:02:45.880> CPT<00:02:46.360> it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
you got Koda practicing but in CPT it

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.330 
you got Koda practicing but in CPT it
doesn't<00:02:46.810> say<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.140> so<00:02:47.530> we<00:02:47.740> need<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.070> go<00:02:48.190> by

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
doesn't say that so we need to go by

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.360 
doesn't say that so we need to go by
what<00:02:48.490> CPT<00:02:49.120> says<00:02:49.420> not<00:02:50.320> by<00:02:50.350> what<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.920> might<00:02:51.100> be

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
what CPT says not by what you might be

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.790 
what CPT says not by what you might be
experiencing<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.240> real<00:02:52.420> world<00:02:53.110> okay

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
experiencing in the real world okay

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.110 
experiencing in the real world okay
that's<00:02:54.160> not<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.430> teaching<00:02:54.640> because<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:54.970> can

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
that's not like teaching because I can

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.440 
that's not like teaching because I can
stay<00:02:55.240> in<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.390> perfect<00:02:55.750> coding<00:02:56.020> world<00:02:57.450> the
