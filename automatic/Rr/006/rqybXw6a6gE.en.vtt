ten<00:00:36.059> eight<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.300> understand<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> second

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
ten eight I understand but the second

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
ten eight I understand but the second
two<00:00:38.129> rounds<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.579> think<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.969> pulled<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.570> my

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
two rounds I think I pulled it with my

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.350 
two rounds I think I pulled it with my
pressure<00:00:40.469> forward<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
pressure forward and I was like and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.479 
pressure forward and I was like and
that's<00:00:42.870> why<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.680> give<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.100> 28

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that's why the first just give like 28

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.660 
that's why the first just give like 28
28<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.360> thought<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:46.739> could<00:00:47.129> get<00:00:47.430> an<00:00:47.579> extra

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
28 so I thought I could get an extra

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.760 
28 so I thought I could get an extra
round<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.300> thought<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> was
