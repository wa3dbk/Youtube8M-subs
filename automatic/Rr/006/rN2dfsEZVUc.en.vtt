tech that makes an MST 88 heatsink that

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.209 
tech that makes an MST 88 heatsink that
would<00:00:38.520> work<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> motherboard<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.570> this

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
would work with a motherboard like this

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
would work with a motherboard like this
the<00:00:41.219> 88<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:42.090> between<00:00:42.660> these<00:00:43.140> two<00:00:43.440> screw

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the 88 because between these two screw

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
the 88 because between these two screw
holes<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> heatsink<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.180> 88

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
holes for the heatsink it's 88

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.920 
holes for the heatsink it's 88
millimeters<00:00:46.230> now<00:00:47.510> we<00:00:48.510> could<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.899> just

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
millimeters now we could have just

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.900 
millimeters now we could have just
bought<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.860> heatsink<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.550> mentioned

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
bought that heatsink that I mentioned

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340 
bought that heatsink that I mentioned
but<00:00:51.090> apart<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> fact<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.170> hard

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
but apart from the fact that it's hard

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.569 
but apart from the fact that it's hard
to<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.620> outside<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.309> US<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.539> also<00:00:54.719> costs

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
to get outside of the US it also costs

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.979 
to get outside of the US it also costs
roughly<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.969> same<00:00:57.120> amount<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.510> money<00:00:57.719> there

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
roughly the same amount of money there

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.569 
roughly the same amount of money there
was<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.289> difference<00:00:58.620> between<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.160> low<00:00:59.399> end

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
was the difference between this low end

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.299 
was the difference between this low end
motherboard<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.870> UD<00:01:01.170> 3<00:01:01.469> version<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
motherboard and the UD 3 version that

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.390 
motherboard and the UD 3 version that
did<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.730> heat<00:01:02.940> sinking<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> MOSFETs<00:01:04.400> so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
did have heat sinking on the MOSFETs so

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.240 
did have heat sinking on the MOSFETs so
we're<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.939> look<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.270> creating<00:01:06.299> our<00:01:06.810> own

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
we're going to look at creating our own

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.060 
we're going to look at creating our own
with<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> heatsink<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.990> we've<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.470> just

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
with the heatsink that we've got just

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270 
with the heatsink that we've got just
grilled<00:01:11.369> away<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.790> box<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:13.770> heatsink

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
grilled away in a box here this heatsink

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.840 
grilled away in a box here this heatsink
here<00:01:14.990> came<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.409> socket<00:01:16.650> 7<00:01:17.070> system<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
here came from a socket 7 system that

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.240 
here came from a socket 7 system that
was<00:01:18.000> passively<00:01:18.450> cooled<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.110> we're<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
was passively cooled and we're going to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.910 
was passively cooled and we're going to
attempt<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> retrofit<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.830> onto<00:01:22.830> these

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
attempt to retrofit this onto these

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.080 
attempt to retrofit this onto these
MOSFETs<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:25.369> now<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> first<00:01:26.759> thing<00:01:26.939> you've

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
MOSFETs here now the first thing you've

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.280 
MOSFETs here now the first thing you've
got<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.380> create<00:01:28.500> yourself<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.130> mold

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
got to do is to create yourself a mold

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
got to do is to create yourself a mold
we<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> screws<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.340> 88

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
we know that the screws at 88

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.569 
we know that the screws at 88
millimeters<00:01:33.299> apart<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.369> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
millimeters apart and we could just have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.260 
millimeters apart and we could just have
a<00:01:35.939> completely<00:01:36.869> vertical<00:01:37.350> block<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.710> heatsink

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
a completely vertical block of heatsink

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.780 
a completely vertical block of heatsink
but<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.420> aren't<00:01:39.570> very<00:01:39.659> many<00:01:40.790> components

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
but there aren't very many components

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.880 
but there aren't very many components
around<00:01:41.970> these<00:01:42.540> MOSFETs<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.350> let's<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.860> we

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
around these MOSFETs so let's see if we

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.039 
around these MOSFETs so let's see if we
can<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.579> better<00:01:44.780> create<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> bit

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
can do a little bit better create a bit

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
can do a little bit better create a bit
more<00:01:46.229> surface<00:01:46.590> area<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.159> call<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.670> MOSFETs

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
more surface area to call these MOSFETs

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.460 
more surface area to call these MOSFETs
down<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.820> thing<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.240> could<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:52.170> take

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
down now one thing we could do is take

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.830 
down now one thing we could do is take
some<00:01:52.680> heatsink<00:01:53.159> off<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> left<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.180> so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
some heatsink off to the left and so

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.730 
some heatsink off to the left and so
I've<00:01:54.930> got<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> cardboard<00:01:55.470> cutout<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:57.740> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I've got a cardboard cutout here that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.980 
I've got a cardboard cutout here that
could<00:01:58.950> do<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.299> would<00:02:00.600> create<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
could do just that if we would create a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.230 
could do just that if we would create a
heatsink<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.710> an<00:02:01.829> l-shape<00:02:02.040> fashion<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.969> this

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
heatsink in an l-shape fashion like this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120 
heatsink in an l-shape fashion like this
that<00:02:03.990> would<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> little<00:02:04.770> bit<00:02:04.950> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that would get us a little bit more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.670 
that would get us a little bit more
surface<00:02:05.579> area<00:02:05.840> then<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.140> could<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.469> with

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
surface area then what we could do with

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.990 
surface area then what we could do with
a<00:02:07.710> straight<00:02:08.190> part<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.660> end

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
a straight part that would end

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.760 
a straight part that would end
about<00:02:11.990> their<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:14.450> that's<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:14.930> option<00:02:14.960> a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.060 

second<00:02:18.770> option<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:20.110> we<00:02:21.110> could<00:02:21.290> try<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.620> put

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
second option is we could try and put

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.220 
second option is we could try and put
heat<00:02:22.220> thinking<00:02:22.670> everywhere<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:24.020> can

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
heat thinking everywhere that we can

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.290 
heat thinking everywhere that we can
here<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.020> could<00:02:27.200> get<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.970> much<00:02:28.970> larger

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
here so we could get it much larger

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.530 
here so we could get it much larger
surface<00:02:29.720> area<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:31.730> would<00:02:31.850> have<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.300> do

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
surface area and we would have to do

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.090 
surface area and we would have to do
more<00:02:32.720> work<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.200> actually<00:02:33.350> create<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.830> heat

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
more work to actually create a heat

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.340 
more work to actually create a heat
think<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.580> would<00:02:34.670> fit<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:36.080> could

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
think that would fit here so that could

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.380 
think that would fit here so that could
be<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> second<00:02:36.860> possibility<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.830> out<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.850> these

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
be a second possibility so out of these

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.320 
be a second possibility so out of these
two<00:02:41.830> either<00:02:45.190> this<00:02:46.190> one<00:02:46.459> or<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.970> cardboard

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
two either this one or this cardboard

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.280 
two either this one or this cardboard
cutout<00:02:52.390> we're<00:02:53.390> going<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.690> create<00:02:53.930> something

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
cutout we're going to create something

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.010 
cutout we're going to create something
that'll<00:02:55.100> work<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.550> call<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.880> MOSFETs<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.660> this

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
that'll work to call the MOSFETs of this

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.340 
that'll work to call the MOSFETs of this
motherboard<00:02:57.320> down<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.660> is<00:02:59.840> part<00:03:00.110> one

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
motherboard down so this is part one

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.770 
motherboard down so this is part one
where<00:03:00.770> I'm<00:03:00.890> sure<00:03:01.160> I'm<00:03:01.550> sharing<00:03:02.270> with<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.630> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
where I'm sure I'm sharing with you the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.340 
where I'm sure I'm sharing with you the
preparation<00:03:04.270> in<00:03:05.270> part<00:03:05.600> two<00:03:05.810> I'll<00:03:06.050> show<00:03:06.290> you

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
preparation in part two I'll show you

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.010 
preparation in part two I'll show you
the<00:03:06.620> heatsink<00:03:07.070> as<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:07.370> been<00:03:07.550> cut<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.090> then

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
the heatsink as it's been cut and then

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.760 
the heatsink as it's been cut and then
we'll<00:03:09.170> attach<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:10.570> so<00:03:11.570> tune<00:03:11.959> in<00:03:12.110> next<00:03:12.260> time<00:03:12.530> to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
we'll attach it so tune in next time to

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.500 
we'll attach it so tune in next time to
see<00:03:12.860> what<00:03:13.130> I've<00:03:13.250> come<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.459> with<00:03:13.610> with<00:03:14.450> just
