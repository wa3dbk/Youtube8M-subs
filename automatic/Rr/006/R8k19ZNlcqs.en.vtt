00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.190 

the<00:00:57.520> abbey<00:00:57.880> is<00:00:57.970> your<00:00:58.180> classic<00:00:58.480> top<00:00:58.900> boost

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
the abbey is your classic top boost

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.230 
the abbey is your classic top boost
amplifier<00:00:59.710> the<00:01:00.280> bass<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.670> treble<00:01:00.790> controls

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
amplifier the bass and treble controls

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.240 
amplifier the bass and treble controls
are<00:01:01.360> really<00:01:01.480> interactive<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.410> as<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:03.040> move

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
are really interactive so as you move

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.760 
are really interactive so as you move
those<00:01:03.520> across<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:03.940> frequency<00:01:04.510> spectrum<00:01:04.809> you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
those across the frequency spectrum you

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.070 
those across the frequency spectrum you
know<00:01:05.800> that<00:01:06.580> when<00:01:06.790> you've<00:01:06.910> moved<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.630> treble

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
know that when you've moved the treble

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.310 
know that when you've moved the treble
it'll<00:01:08.500> affect<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> bass<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.360> vice-versa<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it'll affect the bass and vice-versa the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.530 
it'll affect the bass and vice-versa the
Abbey<00:01:11.590> also<00:01:11.800> has<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> cut<00:01:12.250> control<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:13.330> cut

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
Abbey also has a cut control the cut

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.230 
Abbey also has a cut control the cut
control<00:01:13.900> takes<00:01:14.229> out<00:01:14.640> high<00:01:15.640> frequencies<00:01:16.120> out

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
control takes out high frequencies out

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.630 
control takes out high frequencies out
of<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.390> power<00:01:16.540> section<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.070> he's<00:01:18.280> gonna<00:01:18.400> play

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
of the power section so he's gonna play

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.480 
of the power section so he's gonna play
a<00:01:18.670> little<00:01:18.790> bit<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:19.479> is<00:01:19.540> Doug<00:01:20.220> what<00:01:21.220> I'm<00:01:21.340> gonna

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
a little bit this is Doug what I'm gonna

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.700 
a little bit this is Doug what I'm gonna
do<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:21.970> I'm<00:01:22.090> gonna<00:01:22.180> change<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.870> cut<00:01:23.290> control

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
do is I'm gonna change the cut control

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.650 
do is I'm gonna change the cut control
as<00:01:23.950> he<00:01:24.010> plays<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.760> can<00:01:24.910> see<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.450> tone

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
as he plays so you can see this the tone

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:54.030 
as he plays so you can see this the tone
sweep<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.800> the<00:01:27.250> cut<00:01:27.430> control<00:01:27.700> gives<00:01:27.880> you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.469 

so<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.159> cut<00:01:55.310> control<00:01:55.640> really<00:01:55.909> is<00:01:56.149> a<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.450> a

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
so the cut control really is a is a

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.569 
so the cut control really is a is a
universal<00:01:56.840> tone<00:01:57.409> control<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.189> by<00:01:58.310> removing

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
universal tone control and by removing

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.249 
universal tone control and by removing
high-end<00:01:59.119> from<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.479> back<00:01:59.840> end<00:02:00.110> of<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
high-end from the back end of the

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.440 
high-end from the back end of the
amplifier<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:01.219> won't<00:02:01.520> affect<00:02:01.820> your<00:02:01.939> overdrive

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
amplifier it won't affect your overdrive

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.149 
amplifier it won't affect your overdrive
pedals<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.649> know<00:02:03.799> some<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.100> things

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
pedals and you know some of the things

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.649 
pedals and you know some of the things
that<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.490> may<00:02:04.729> want<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.000> put<00:02:05.149> on<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.360> front<00:02:05.450> of

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
that you may want to put on the front of

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.990 
that you may want to put on the front of
your<00:02:05.750> now<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.229> power<00:02:06.439> level<00:02:06.799> control<00:02:07.159> reduces

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
your now the power level control reduces

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.490 
your now the power level control reduces
the<00:02:08.149> amount<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.509> power<00:02:08.690> that's<00:02:08.899> available<00:02:09.019> in

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
the amount of power that's available in

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.779 
the amount of power that's available in
the<00:02:09.590> power<00:02:09.769> section<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.280> amplifier

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
the power section of the amplifier

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.940 
the power section of the amplifier
without<00:02:11.510> changing<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.019> tonality<00:02:12.290> or<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
without changing the tonality or the

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.500 
without changing the tonality or the
feel<00:02:13.220> or<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.550> way<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.790> behaves<00:02:14.239> with<00:02:14.390> your

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
feel or the way it behaves with your

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.120 
feel or the way it behaves with your
pedal<00:02:14.840> board<00:02:15.050> it<00:02:15.349> just<00:02:15.620> makes<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.980> amp

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
pedal board it just makes the amp

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.250 
pedal board it just makes the amp
quieter<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.209> as<00:02:17.330> Doug<00:02:17.510> plays<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> little<00:02:18.019> bit

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
quieter so as Doug plays a little bit

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.660 
quieter so as Doug plays a little bit
more<00:02:18.440> I'm<00:02:18.709> gonna<00:02:18.830> bring<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.130> power<00:02:19.340> level

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
more I'm gonna bring the power level

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.000 
more I'm gonna bring the power level
