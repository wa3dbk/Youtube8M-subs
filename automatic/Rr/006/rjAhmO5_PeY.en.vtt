00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
what can we do to help our students I

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.600 
what can we do to help our students I
think<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.209> most<00:02:16.450> important<00:02:17.140> thing<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.860> lot

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
think the most important thing is a lot

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.850 
think the most important thing is a lot
of<00:02:18.670> people<00:02:18.819> are<00:02:19.540> very<00:02:19.930> of<00:02:20.349> contributing<00:02:21.250> to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
of people are very of contributing to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.730 
of people are very of contributing to
various<00:02:23.860> companies<00:02:24.610> or<00:02:24.970> organizations

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
various companies or organizations

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.320 
various companies or organizations
because<00:02:26.740> they're<00:02:26.860> not<00:02:26.980> sure<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.670> where<00:02:28.240> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
because they're not sure of where the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.090 
because they're not sure of where the
money<00:02:28.510> will<00:02:28.690> go<00:02:29.130> how<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.340> will<00:02:30.490> be<00:02:30.610> utilize

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
money will go how it will be utilize

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.220 
money will go how it will be utilize
so<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:31.940> think<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.240> most<00:02:32.420> important<00:02:32.930> thing<00:02:32.960> is

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
so I think the most important thing is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.090 
so I think the most important thing is
to<00:02:33.260> show<00:02:33.800> people<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.460> this<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.240> one<00:02:35.780> area<00:02:36.140> one

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
to show people that this is one area one

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.460 
to show people that this is one area one
company<00:02:37.930> one<00:02:39.310> organization<00:02:40.310> which<00:02:41.090> will<00:02:41.470> use

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
company one organization which will use

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.850 
company one organization which will use
your<00:02:43.040> funds<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:45.020> the<00:02:45.170> best<00:02:45.410> of<00:02:45.680> their

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
your funds to the best of their

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
your funds to the best of their
abilities<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:48.020> think<00:02:48.470> I'm<00:02:49.270> completely

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
abilities and I think I'm completely

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.300 
abilities and I think I'm completely
certain<00:02:50.930> about<00:02:51.260> World<00:02:51.590> Vision<00:02:51.980> that's<00:02:52.160> why<00:02:52.280> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
certain about World Vision that's why I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.100 
certain about World Vision that's why I
never<00:02:52.370> hesitate<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.180> contributing<00:02:53.570> whatever

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
never hesitate in contributing whatever

never hesitate in contributing whatever
I<00:02:54.170> can<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:55.040> world<00:02:55.280> vision<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.420> think<00:02:56.660> if

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
I can the world vision and I think if

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.930 
I can the world vision and I think if
everybody<00:02:57.350> started<00:02:57.890> feeling<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.520> about

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
everybody started feeling that about

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.990 
everybody started feeling that about

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
support my school they would have a very

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.680 
support my school they would have a very
good<00:03:02.180> outlet<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.380> donate<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.970> lot<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.540> people

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
good outlet to donate to a lot of people

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.650 
good outlet to donate to a lot of people
want<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.380> give<00:03:06.620> money<00:03:07.210> but<00:03:08.210> they're<00:03:08.390> always

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
want to give money but they're always

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.350 
want to give money but they're always
worried<00:03:09.350> about<00:03:10.280> how<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.640> money<00:03:10.970> will<00:03:11.180> be

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
worried about how the money will be

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.430 
worried about how the money will be
utilized<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.190> think<00:03:13.490> in<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:14.480> strong<00:03:14.960> way<00:03:14.990> one

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
utilized so I think in a strong way one

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.880 
utilized so I think in a strong way one
should<00:03:15.650> say<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:16.490> this<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.910> one<00:03:17.890> organization

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
should say that this is one organization

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.870 
should say that this is one organization
which<00:03:19.430> will<00:03:19.670> use<00:03:20.000> your<00:03:20.300> money<00:03:20.480> in<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:21.230> very<00:03:21.500> very

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
positive way i may say that that is that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.720
