00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.940
Giorgio Armaniâ€™s one of the most prestigious
brands in fashion. The brand produces lines

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.660
all the way from Armani Prive as the couture
level all the way down to Armani jeans. Giogio

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.690
Armani is high end ready to wear and Collezioni
is ready to wear slightly less expensive and

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.730
Armani.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.940
Giorgio Armani himself was born outside of
Milan in 1934. The company remains based in

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.140
Milan. He studied medicine, but never really
worked in medicine and instead found a job

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.260
at (?) the most important fashion store in
Italy in 1957 where he did visual merchandising

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.300
and was a buyer for the store.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.350
And he caught the eye of a menâ€™s wear
manufacturer, Nino Cerutti, who hired him

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.840
to design a wholesale menâ€™s wear line
called the Hitman where he stayed for eight

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.559
years. An important milestone in Armaniâ€™s
career was the 1980 film, American Gigolo

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.930
in which Richard Gere had an Armani wardrobe
that received almost as much attention as

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.090
the film itself. It really put Armani on the
map and made him into a household name.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.790
Concurrent with the film, Armaniâ€™s
designs were featured in boutiques like Barneyâ€™s

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.759
and also high end department stores like Sakâ€™s.
So, people that had loved Richard Gears clothes

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.779
in the film could go and buy Armani clothes
themselves. In fact, Armani opened an office

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:35.040
in Los Angeles to be closer to Hollywood clients.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.139
His suits in particular were really favored
by men and women in the creative industries.

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:44.859
The distinguishing feature of Armani clothes
and Armani suits in particular is that itâ€™s

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:51.279
a relaxed tailoring. He actually figured out
different ways of doing things. He took away

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:56.329
a lot of the under structure of menâ€™s
tailoring to make the suits softer, make them

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.149
more body conscious.

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:06.399
Characters on the 1980s TV series, Miami Vice
also wore a lot of Armani. Armani jeans flourished

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.380
as part of the whole designer jean culture
and fragrances and eye wear were introduced.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.980
Both of which have been very important to
the brand. Giorgio Armani has also done many

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.790
other things including design soccer uniforms
and flight attendants uniforms for Alitalia.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.710
What distinguishes Giorgio Armaniâ€™s
designs in addition to their relaxed tailoring

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.400
is a unique color palette. He uses a lot of
really interesting neutrals kind of mushroomy

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.280
grays and navy blues that are so dark theyâ€™re
almost black. Never anything harsh, but always

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.090
very subtle and kind of mysterious colors.
People say that once you wear Armani everything

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.480
else seems uncomfortable.
