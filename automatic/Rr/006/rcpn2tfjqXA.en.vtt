00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello youtube friends greetings always 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.370
 from Colombia I am Luis Javier Hernández 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.690
 Remember that you can always look at 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.560
 videos from my page on youtube 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.810
 You can also search for me on Facebook 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.740
 as ' un and javier hernández today I'm going to 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.080
 talk a little about the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.789
 interpretation and interpretation of a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.590
 rhythm called vallenato ride today 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.520
 I'm going to talk about precisely the walk 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.530
 competition I will take as fragment 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.910
 a version of the sergio teacher 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:36.929
 Rodriguez of Vallenato chicken but it's 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.760
 interpreted by lidia martínez de 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.010
 talk a little about the phrasing 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.719
 and about how to fill out how to fill out when 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 you touch the ride it sounds like running a little 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.320
 more advanced 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 natural 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.660
 the base really the base of the melody 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.660
 is 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.360
 but when it comes to playing vallenato inside 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.690
 of esthetics go high aesthetics a 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.700
 way of feeling is 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.630
 you can see see it from the style 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.380
 vallenato detests aesthetics we have to 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.790
 fill a little more 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.790
 you can use third 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.580
 I propose to always do the quadruple 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.830
 speed the quadruple speed is 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.340
 four times four strokes per times 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.920
 and that is the strong weather and time 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.680
 boards would already be so so so so so 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.980
 so the code would not grow taca taca taca 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.290
 taca taca taca basil so much for the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.990
 who know musical notation is if they are 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.320
 black that black the quadruple speed 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.200
 would be made in eighth notes taca taca taca taca 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.300
 daisy daisies now 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.610
 if you are touching the idea of carrying 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.340
 always the quadruple speed in the 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.680
 wrist on the wrist to assign a little 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.599
 plus 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.760
 They call popularly the 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.189
 accordionists the pulse if one listens 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.250
 recordings if you listen to recordings 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:04.709
 old the accordion players of the 60 70 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:09.620
 they record a lot with that implicit speed 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.620
 it can be like that already qatar 50 city 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.500
 with speed it would be like that 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.870
 efe 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.350
 basically for everything you are looking for is 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.060
 always fill the melody 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.560
 you can use voice in leadership and 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.660
 ways of this post indie bing technique 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.770
 of thick melody or you can employ 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.770
 also the third ones 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:57.289
 here for example and looming 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.699
 third 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.699
 of the fundamental 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:24.439
 but it can be simple and with which of the 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.909
 airplane that is only an opinion 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:28.520
 staff does not have to be like I say 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.999
 it's a personal opinion and it's from 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.039
 the experience that I have is 

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:38.240
 simply a version what is important is 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:39.860
 let him serve what you seek and if 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.180
 they do not serve what I for example if I 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.520
 I feel they can look elsewhere 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.469
 also if you have any concerns or 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.449
 something like that can you write me with many 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:49.449
 thanks and greetings from colombia chau
