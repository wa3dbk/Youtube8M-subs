and<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:38.739> know<00:00:38.860> at<00:00:38.980> first<00:00:39.040> I<00:00:39.370> thought<00:00:39.550> about

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
and you know at first I thought about

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.350 
and you know at first I thought about
doing<00:00:40.690> pieces<00:00:40.989> but<00:00:41.410> we<00:00:41.980> decided<00:00:42.250> early<00:00:42.760> to

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
doing pieces but we decided early to

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.369 
doing pieces but we decided early to
just<00:00:43.629> kind<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.839> go<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:43.960> different<00:00:44.140> direction

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
just kind of go a different direction

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.880 
just kind of go a different direction
and<00:00:44.920> this<00:00:45.489> is<00:00:45.580> what<00:00:45.699> we<00:00:45.790> came<00:00:45.909> up<00:00:45.970> with<00:00:46.089> a<00:00:49.890> more

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
and this is what we came up with a more

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.710 
and this is what we came up with a more
it's<00:00:51.370> more<00:00:51.580> about<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.909> color<00:00:52.150> than<00:00:52.360> it<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.510> the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
it's more about the color than it is the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.840 
it's more about the color than it is the
squares<00:00:53.019> actually<00:00:53.559> maybe<00:00:54.159> about<00:00:54.370> six<00:00:54.610> months

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850

definitely needed well me and axis this
is<00:01:56.680> the<00:01:56.740> first<00:01:56.980> time<00:01:57.100> we've<00:01:57.400> worked<00:01:57.550> together

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
is the first time we've worked together

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.120 
is the first time we've worked together
like<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.300> know<00:01:58.540> we've<00:01:58.720> we've<00:01:58.960> done

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
like this you know we've we've done

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
like this you know we've we've done
productions<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.310> past<00:02:00.520> just<00:02:00.820> kind<00:02:01.060> of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
productions in the past just kind of

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.510 
productions in the past just kind of
real<00:02:01.300> quick<00:02:01.590> piece<00:02:02.590> character<00:02:03.040> type<00:02:03.250> thing

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
real quick piece character type thing

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.800 
real quick piece character type thing
but<00:02:03.790> this<00:02:03.909> is<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.120> first<00:02:04.330> time<00:02:04.510> we've<00:02:04.690> done

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
but this is the first time we've done

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.780 
but this is the first time we've done
something<00:02:05.020> like<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.320> together<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.340> think

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
something like this together and I think

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.809 
something like this together and I think
it<00:02:07.090> complements<00:02:07.659> his<00:02:07.840> characters<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:08.530> well

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it complements his characters so well

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.190 
it complements his characters so well
that<00:02:09.819> we're<00:02:10.390> going<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.569> try<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> take<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.019> on

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
that we're going to try to take this on

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.190 
that we're going to try to take this on
the<00:02:11.290> road<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.620> see<00:02:11.739> what<00:02:11.860> happens
