00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.060 
video because I got a lot of numbers to
go<00:00:40.020> over<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.559> don't<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:40.980> all

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
go over and I don't have them all

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.530 
go over and I don't have them all
memorized<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.910> first<00:00:42.120> thing<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> agenda

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
memorized the first thing on the agenda

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
memorized the first thing on the agenda
is<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> cheat<00:00:43.860> wise<00:00:44.100> data<00:00:44.460> rate<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.180> data

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is the cheat wise data rate the data

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.310 
is the cheat wise data rate the data
rate<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> t2i

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
rate for the t2i

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.190 
rate for the t2i
is<00:00:46.530> about<00:00:47.039> 45<00:00:47.610> megabits<00:00:48.149> per<00:00:48.300> second<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:49.020> is

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is about 45 megabits per second which is

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
is about 45 megabits per second which is
five<00:00:49.500> point<00:00:49.829> eight<00:00:50.070> nine<00:00:50.340> megabytes<00:00:50.670> per

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
five point eight nine megabytes per

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
five point eight nine megabytes per
second<00:00:51.660> class<00:00:52.230> four<00:00:52.530> card<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> four<00:00:53.250> megabytes

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
second class four card is four megabytes

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
second class four card is four megabytes
per<00:00:53.910> second<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.510> class<00:00:54.899> six<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.410> six<00:00:55.710> megabytes

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
per second a class six is six megabytes

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.160 
per second a class six is six megabytes
per<00:00:56.309> second<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.120> class<00:00:57.390> ten<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.930> ten

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
per second and a class ten is ten

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.349 
per second and a class ten is ten
megabytes<00:00:58.680> per<00:00:58.859> second<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> other<00:01:00.149> thing

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
megabytes per second now the other thing

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.720 
megabytes per second now the other thing
to<00:01:00.449> remember<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> t2i<00:01:01.890> has<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
to remember is that the t2i has a

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
to remember is that the t2i has a
variable<00:01:03.239> bitrate<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> more<00:01:04.680> motion

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
variable bitrate so the more motion

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
variable bitrate so the more motion
that's<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.000> higher<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.479> data<00:01:06.720> rate

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that's going on the higher the data rate

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.250 
that's going on the higher the data rate
so<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> class<00:01:07.920> 4<00:01:08.280> class<00:01:08.460> 6<00:01:09.060> card<00:01:09.450> might<00:01:09.780> keep<00:01:10.049> up

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so a class 4 class 6 card might keep up

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020 
so a class 4 class 6 card might keep up
well<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> camera<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.979> stationary<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:11.939> as

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
well the camera is stationary but as

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
well the camera is stationary but as
soon<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> start<00:01:12.570> swinging<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.229> around<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
soon as you start swinging it around the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
soon as you start swinging it around the
data<00:01:14.369> rate<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.640> gonna<00:01:14.729> go<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.450> might

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
data rate it's gonna go up and you might

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.170 
data rate it's gonna go up and you might
over<00:01:16.170> exert<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.979> card<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:18.000> what

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
over exert the card so I know what

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.830 
over exert the card so I know what
you're<00:01:18.330> thinking

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you're thinking

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.719 
you're thinking
I<00:01:18.869> used<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.350> use<00:01:19.500> class<00:01:19.860> 4<00:01:20.159> cards<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.700> my

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I used to use class 4 cards in my

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
I used to use class 4 cards in my
camcorder<00:01:21.060> how<00:01:21.780> come<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.080> can't<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.470> them<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
camcorder how come I can't use them in

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
camcorder how come I can't use them in
my<00:01:22.860> t2i<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.970> reason<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> because

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
my t2i the reason for that is is because

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
my t2i the reason for that is is because
