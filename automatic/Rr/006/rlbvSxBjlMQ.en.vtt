00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
like if an alligator bit your arm off in

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.619 
like if an alligator bit your arm off in
the<00:00:52.230> lake<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.100> go<00:00:53.309> back<00:00:53.610> swimming<00:00:54.480> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that lake to face your fears except it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
that lake to face your fears except it's
a<00:00:57.570> lot<00:00:57.719> worse<00:00:58.070> because<00:00:59.070> demons<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> lot

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
a lot worse because demons are a lot

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
a lot worse because demons are a lot
worse<00:01:00.420> than<00:01:00.449> an<00:01:00.780> alligator<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
worse than an alligator it's not the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.270 
worse than an alligator it's not the
smartest<00:01:02.940> move<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.510> Ash's<00:01:03.930> part<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.920> guess

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
smartest move on Ash's part but I guess

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
smartest move on Ash's part but I guess
there<00:01:05.460> wouldn't<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> game<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.299> they<00:01:06.420> didn't

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

of tongue-in-cheek and has dark humor

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.850 
of tongue-in-cheek and has dark humor
it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.509> lot<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> movies<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it's a lot like the movies in that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
it's a lot like the movies in that
regard<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.150> plot<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> general

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
regard so the plot and the general

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.319 
regard so the plot and the general
atmosphere<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> game<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.430> both<00:01:32.820> pretty

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
atmosphere of the game are both pretty

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.210 
atmosphere of the game are both pretty
good<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.810> mean<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> game<00:01:35.040> has

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
good I mean really if the game has

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.340 
good I mean really if the game has
better<00:01:35.400> gameplay<00:01:36.030> better<00:01:36.450> camera<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.079> better

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
better gameplay better camera and better

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.770 
better gameplay better camera and better
controls<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.430> could<00:01:38.700> easily<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.299> pretty

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
controls this could easily be a pretty

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
controls this could easily be a pretty
good<00:01:40.020> game<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.710> unfortunately<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.640> three<00:01:41.909> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
good game but unfortunately all three of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
good game but unfortunately all three of
those<00:01:42.150> things<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.630> lacking<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.560> camera<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
those things are lacking the camera just

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.850 
those things are lacking the camera just
plain<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.909> sucks<00:01:45.450> every<00:01:46.200> other<00:01:46.380> step<00:01:46.829> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
plain out sucks every other step you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.130 
plain out sucks every other step you
take<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.490> camera<00:01:48.000> jumps<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> different

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
take the camera jumps to a different

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.289 
take the camera jumps to a different
angle<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.740> it's<00:01:50.070> hard<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.549> tell<00:01:50.729> where<00:01:51.119> you

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
angle and it's hard to tell where you

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.539 
angle and it's hard to tell where you

you can press back to kind of jump
backwards<00:04:00.600> but<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:00.930> doesn't<00:04:01.290> really<00:04:01.410> work

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
backwards but this doesn't really work

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.860

in<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.790> game<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.690> combat<00:04:13.320> in

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
in this game but just like the combat in

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.080 
in this game but just like the combat in
the<00:04:13.530> general<00:04:13.950> movement<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.610> running<00:04:14.970> is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
the general movement the running is

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.240 
the general movement the running is
really<00:04:15.269> cumbersome<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.320> just<00:04:16.470> doesn't<00:04:16.919> feel

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
really cumbersome and just doesn't feel

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.880 
really cumbersome and just doesn't feel
fluid<00:04:18.030> at<00:04:18.209> all<00:04:18.419> it's<00:04:18.690> very<00:04:19.109> robotic

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
fluid at all it's very robotic

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.370 
fluid at all it's very robotic
the<00:04:20.520> game<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:21.030> tongue-in-cheek<00:04:21.600> and<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.140> has

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
the game is tongue-in-cheek and it has

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.670 
the game is tongue-in-cheek and it has
the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.090 
the
evil<00:04:23.370> dead<00:04:23.639> feel<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.199> regard<00:04:25.500> it's<00:04:25.949> a

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
evil dead feel so in that regard it's a

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.240 
evil dead feel so in that regard it's a
good<00:04:26.550> game<00:04:26.850> I<00:04:26.880> mean<00:04:27.180> ash<00:04:27.449> can<00:04:27.840> even<00:04:28.169> taunt<00:04:28.800> the

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
good game I mean ash can even taunt the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.610 
good game I mean ash can even taunt the
enemies<00:04:29.789> with<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.150> triangle<00:04:30.870> button<00:04:31.110> those
