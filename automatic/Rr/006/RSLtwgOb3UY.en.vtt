00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
what the actual microphone capsule

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.549 
what the actual microphone capsule
portion<00:01:02.550> looks<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.030> we've<00:01:03.809> also<00:01:03.989> got<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> li

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
portion looks like we've also got a li

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
portion looks like we've also got a li
also<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.189> clip<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.210> clip<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
also of clip so we can clip this on to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.460 
also of clip so we can clip this on to
our<00:01:08.060> color<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.840> we've<00:01:09.990> got<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> cable

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
our color and then we've got the cable

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.690 
our color and then we've got the cable
it's<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.930> untie<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.340> would<00:01:14.490> say

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it's just untie this and I would say

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's just untie this and I would say
this<00:01:14.970> cable<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.689> round<00:01:16.170> about<00:01:16.350> I'd<00:01:16.680> say<00:01:16.710> 1.2<00:01:17.700> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this cable is round about I'd say 1.2 to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.749 
this cable is round about I'd say 1.2 to
1.5<00:01:18.720> meters<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.380> length<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.979> then<00:01:20.580> it's

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
1.5 meters in length and then it's

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
1.5 meters in length and then it's
terminated<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> three-and-a-half

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259

we've<00:02:03.000> got<00:02:03.030> two<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.780> foam<00:02:04.159> covers<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
we've got two little foam covers for the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.260 
we've got two little foam covers for the
microphone

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
microphone

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.990 
microphone
and<00:02:07.479> then<00:02:08.200> we've<00:02:08.410> got<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.830> microphone<00:02:09.520> itself

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and then we've got the microphone itself

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.510 
and then we've got the microphone itself
same<00:02:10.989> length<00:02:11.319> cable<00:02:11.770> by<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> looks<00:02:12.220> of<00:02:12.370> things

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
same length cable by the looks of things

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.740 
same length cable by the looks of things
it's<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.239> unravel<00:02:13.870> this<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:15.270> let's<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.690> a

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it's just unravel this and let's have a

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.170 
it's just unravel this and let's have a
look<00:02:17.020> at<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> length<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.770> cable<00:02:18.000> yes<00:02:19.000> it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
look at the length of the cable yes it

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.020 
look at the length of the cable yes it
is<00:02:19.239> approximately<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> same<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:20.380> about<00:02:20.530> 1.2<00:02:21.400> -

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
is approximately the same so about 1.2 -

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.229 
is approximately the same so about 1.2 -
one<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.630> a<00:02:22.690> half<00:02:22.870> meters<00:02:23.349> length<00:02:23.650> cable<00:02:24.400> this

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
one and a half meters length cable this

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.870 
one and a half meters length cable this
is<00:02:25.569> what<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.080> actual<00:02:26.680> microphone<00:02:27.489> module

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
is what the actual microphone module

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.449 
is what the actual microphone module
looks<00:02:28.030> like<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.569> looks<00:02:28.750> identical<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
looks like it looks identical to the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.250 
looks like it looks identical to the
other<00:02:30.670> one<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.450> then<00:02:31.630> we've<00:02:31.810> got<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.050> same

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
other one and then we've got the same

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.979 
other one and then we've got the same
sort<00:02:32.650> of<00:02:32.680> krokodil<00:02:33.280> type<00:02:33.880> clip<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.599> clipping

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
sort of krokodil type clip for clipping

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.589 
sort of krokodil type clip for clipping
the<00:02:35.170> cable<00:02:35.680> onto<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.980> shirt<00:02:36.280> collar<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.819> then

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
the cable onto a shirt collar and then

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.059 
the cable onto a shirt collar and then
we<00:02:37.840> have<00:02:38.080> got<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.319> slightly<00:02:38.739> different

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
we have got a slightly different

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.770 
we have got a slightly different
connector<00:02:39.910> because<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.209> is<00:02:40.299> a<00:02:40.360> stereo

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
connector because this is a stereo

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.390 
connector because this is a stereo
connector<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.350> can<00:02:41.380> see<00:02:41.650> with<00:02:41.769> the<00:02:41.890> two<00:02:42.100> black

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
connector you can see with the two black

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.610 
connector you can see with the two black
lines<00:02:42.700> there<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.750> three<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:44.410> half

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
lines there so three and a half

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.789 
lines there so three and a half
millimeter<00:02:45.220> stereo<00:02:46.150> connector<00:02:46.959> with<00:02:47.769> the

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
millimeter stereo connector with the

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.930 
millimeter stereo connector with the

HQs so now I'm going to switch over to
the<00:02:52.180> stereo<00:02:52.569> microphone<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.980> audio<00:02:54.430> that

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
the stereo microphone the audio that

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.190 
the stereo microphone the audio that
you're<00:02:54.700> currently<00:02:55.120> actually<00:02:55.480> hearing<00:02:55.959> though

you're currently actually hearing though

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.890 
you're currently actually hearing though
even<00:02:56.470> though<00:02:56.799> it's<00:02:56.890> recorded<00:02:57.489> with<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.970> mono

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
even though it's recorded with the mono

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.820 
even though it's recorded with the mono
microphone<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.890> will<00:03:00.549> be<00:03:01.440> recomposing<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.620> in

microphone I will be recomposing that in
my<00:03:03.250> editing<00:03:03.730> program<00:03:04.299> so<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.049> comes<00:03:05.260> out

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
my editing program so that it comes out

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.860 
my editing program so that it comes out
of<00:03:05.530> both<00:03:05.769> speakers<00:03:06.610> so<00:03:07.180> let's<00:03:07.360> switch<00:03:07.450> over<00:03:07.720> to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
of both speakers so let's switch over to

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.289 
of both speakers so let's switch over to
this<00:03:08.080> second<00:03:08.560> microphone<00:03:08.769> now<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.000> audio
