 ibagué dot com interviewed the embers asus presents fc pipe 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.670
 not that their conclusions about the local draw we had them 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.210
 Complications by teams 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.000
 dt d similar as the alcorcón alliance that did not get two points 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.560
 then they were shared care 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.680
 and especially keep in mind that starting games minute 20 we 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.810
 we were with ten men and that did then 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.870
 percent the situation much more difficult 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.560
 now it is classified today that they are going to play now against patriots cvm the ufos 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.000
 If a very strong team always 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.510
 playing against ducks is going to be very complicated 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.790
 a team well standing on the court 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.500
 per cent complicated the party in bogotá we won 0 then we wait 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.080
 for having learned from the mistakes that were made 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.400
 let's wait percent 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 improve in the part that we need more than the exhibition 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.629
 and be able to advance to the semifinals 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.230
 noa in your analysis it is easier to finish local or start local min 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.199
 in that phase 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.719
 that is a topic related to 0 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:24.919
 because he was a waiter he achieved a good visitor result, let's say that 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.919
 local will be easier again 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:31.389
 but if the party by the way in part visitor the result is adverse therefore 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.489
 you have the pressure you must have to go out and look for a result and your father can 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.559
 complicate the local party then 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.249
 pc really I do not see 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.679
 that there is a significant advantage 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:42.979
 in addition to 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.679
 percent if it's at the arc the tournament the visitor results a lot from the 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.329
 teams throughout the tournament felt more comfortable playing 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.239
 visitors that local 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.690
 At the end of the event we had a talk with the sports manager and Mayor Ivan 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:56.309
 novel 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:03:00.409
 - the analyzes on this first phase and especially in the quarterfinals 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.409
 of the postobón tournament we are going to have many important flaws 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.359
 where I had the politicians b 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.149
 it was heavy 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:10.499
 Our city 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.429
 it was nothing to face the tuna and the series in this fight for 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:15.479
 Grand finale 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.589
 before him at least one of the two teams that entered the tournament 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:19.399
 postobón 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.399
 is in the final phase as in its environment 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.389
 let's say the subject 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.279
 nothing of the campaign of noemí soto is not a descendant example of what they must 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.479
 make the clubs 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.689
 who pretend to be in professional soccer 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.659
 good administration 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.309
 good staff with good management 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.469
 with a technical body bridge that we are 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.749
 that our results that are given at that time and are 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:48.029
 disputing the finals the visitor goal are valid soon for some 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.659
 effect in a round game or to suddenly define some team 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:52.809
 classified 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.679
 no keys are defined first by points 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:01.709
 then by difference of goals without counting as a visitor 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.919
 and in case they scored points and the deference was lower it will be decided 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.989
 from shots from the penalty point 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.809
