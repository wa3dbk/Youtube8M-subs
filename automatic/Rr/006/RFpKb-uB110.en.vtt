00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:25.880
As I'm with a cold today, I'm going to make a delicious tea that Mari Mori taught me.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.668
You there, click down here and subscribe on Mari's Instagram.

00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:32.127
A delicious tea to heal colds and flus.

00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:44.330
To make this tea, the first thing you'll need is 750ml of water.

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:51.907
I'm going to boil the water with 1 cinnamon stick. Don't be stingy, use a big stick, hey?

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.478
And 5 cloves.

00:00:56.027 --> 00:01:03.803
The water boiled and smells delicious. I'm going to put a lid here, turn the heat off and caramelize

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:05.805
10 tablespoons of crystal sugar.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.217
This caramel mustn't get too dark because the darker it is, the less sweet it will be.

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:24.211
So, despite we've put 10 tbsps of sugar, if it's too dark, the

00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.240
caramel will be more bitter than sweet.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.934
The caramel is ready and now I'm going to pour that water we boiled with cinnamon and cloves. It has to be very hot.

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:36.065
Be careful when you're going to do this because the caramel will come up at once.

00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:43.971
If you didn't burn yourself with your caramel, now you just have to add the juice of a lemon and 1 tsp of yerba mate.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:51.480
Now we put a lid and wait 5 minutes. After this, you just have to sift and enjoy in a warm little bed,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.318
with a nice blanket while you watch a movie.

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:10.711
