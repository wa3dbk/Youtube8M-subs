sizes this one is by Barrett s it's kind

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.750 
sizes this one is by Barrett s it's kind
of<00:00:21.640> in<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:21.990> idea<00:00:22.990> of<00:00:23.050> a<00:00:23.110> saddle<00:00:23.530> I<00:00:23.650> guess<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
of in the idea of a saddle I guess this

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.029 
of in the idea of a saddle I guess this
one<00:00:28.000> is<00:00:28.180> by<00:00:28.420> Lee<00:00:28.960> Nielsen<00:00:31.860> probably<00:00:32.860> one<00:00:33.010> of

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
one is by Lee Nielsen probably one of

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.059 
one is by Lee Nielsen probably one of
the<00:00:33.190> prettiest<00:00:33.969> looking<00:00:34.300> I<00:00:34.420> think<00:00:37.859> you<00:00:38.859> can

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:39.069 
the prettiest looking I think you can

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:43.559 
the prettiest looking I think you can
make<00:00:39.249> your<00:00:39.489> own<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.800> you<00:00:41.980> can<00:00:42.129> also<00:00:42.280> use<00:00:42.609> bevel

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:43.569 
make your own and you can also use bevel

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:48.419 
make your own and you can also use bevel
gauges<00:00:46.679> I'll<00:00:47.679> just<00:00:47.859> show<00:00:48.069> you<00:00:48.100> very<00:00:48.399> briefly

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
gauges I'll just show you very briefly

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.200 
gauges I'll just show you very briefly
how<00:00:48.940> each<00:00:49.120> other<00:00:49.300> is<00:00:49.389> used<00:00:50.429> so<00:00:51.429> let's<00:00:51.670> say<00:00:51.940> we

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
how each other is used so let's say we

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.899 
how each other is used so let's say we
wish<00:00:52.569> to<00:00:52.749> mark<00:00:52.929> some<00:00:53.199> dovetails<00:00:53.710> on<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.760> end

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
wish to mark some dovetails on the end

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.279 
wish to mark some dovetails on the end
of<00:00:55.030> this<00:00:55.149> board<00:00:56.429> we've<00:00:57.429> marked<00:00:57.960> our<00:00:58.960> gauge

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
of this board we've marked our gauge

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:06.000 
of this board we've marked our gauge
line<00:00:59.999> if<00:01:00.999> we<00:01:01.210> were<00:01:01.329> using<00:01:01.569> the<00:01:01.960> Lee<00:01:02.589> Neilson<00:01:05.010> we

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
line if we were using the Lee Neilson we

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.179 
line if we were using the Lee Neilson we
need<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.310> choose<00:01:06.520> our<00:01:06.700> angle<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.979> is

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
need to choose our angle and this is

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:12.270 
need to choose our angle and this is
done<00:01:09.880> as<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.479> ratio<00:01:11.079> here<00:01:11.590> we<00:01:11.770> have<00:01:11.979> on<00:01:12.159> this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
done as a a ratio here we have on this

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.529 
done as a a ratio here we have on this
side<00:01:12.520> one<00:01:13.420> in<00:01:13.570> six<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:15.159> this<00:01:15.640> side<00:01:15.909> one<00:01:16.390> in

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
side one in six on this side one in

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.630 
side one in six on this side one in
seven<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:19.000> if<00:01:19.180> we're<00:01:19.329> working<00:01:19.509> with<00:01:19.719> softwood

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
seven so if we're working with softwood

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
seven so if we're working with softwood
we'll<00:01:21.640> probably<00:01:21.789> go<00:01:22.000> for<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.240> one<00:01:22.420> in<00:01:22.600> six<00:01:22.899> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.630 

that's<00:01:27.100> simply<00:01:27.430> place<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.710> brass<00:01:29.950> stock<00:01:30.399> is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
that's simply place the brass stock is

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.190 
that's simply place the brass stock is
placed<00:01:30.969> on<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.320> end<00:01:32.530> of<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.829> work<00:01:37.020> slip<00:01:38.020> down

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
placed on the end of the work slip down

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.330 
placed on the end of the work slip down
tight<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.009> can<00:01:42.189> mark<00:01:44.159> either<00:01:45.159> with<00:01:45.310> a

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
tight and then we can mark either with a

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.819 
tight and then we can mark either with a
sharp<00:01:45.670> pencil<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:49.570> if<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.929> wish<00:01:50.109> to<00:01:50.140> we<00:01:50.560> could

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
sharp pencil or if we wish to we could

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
sharp pencil or if we wish to we could
do<00:01:50.979> that<00:01:51.130> with<00:01:51.579> a<00:01:51.609> marking<00:01:52.060> knife

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.590 

now<00:01:55.470> mark<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:55.890> dovetails<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.760> tend<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
now mark my dovetails I tend to use a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.500 
now mark my dovetails I tend to use a
sharp<00:01:57.930> pencil<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:59.490> mark<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> other<00:01:59.940> side<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
sharp pencil to mark the other side of

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.250 
sharp pencil to mark the other side of
that<00:02:00.630> dovetail<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:02.490> must<00:02:02.730> remember<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.260> flip

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
that dovetail we must remember to flip

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
that dovetail we must remember to flip
this<00:02:04.500> over<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.910> we<00:02:06.030> keep<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> same<00:02:07.190> angle<00:02:14.510> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
this over so we keep the same angle and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.600 
this over so we keep the same angle and
just<00:02:15.750> mark<00:02:16.020> our<00:02:16.230> waste<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.070> don't<00:02:20.370> remove

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
just mark our waste so we don't remove

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.150 
just mark our waste so we don't remove
the<00:02:20.820> wrong<00:02:20.970> bit<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.840> virtus<00:02:26.390> saddle<00:02:27.390> marker

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
the wrong bit the virtus saddle marker

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.030 
the wrong bit the virtus saddle marker
the<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:30.150> longer<00:02:30.540> length<00:02:30.780> goes<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.800> end<00:02:31.950> of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
the the longer length goes on the end of

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.170 
the the longer length goes on the end of
your<00:02:32.100> stock<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
your stock and this one here it's a

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.820 
your stock and this one here it's a
one-in-eight<00:02:39.660> marker<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.530> would<00:02:40.680> be

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
one-in-eight marker so this would be

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.100 
one-in-eight marker so this would be
more<00:02:41.210> appropriate<00:02:42.210> for<00:02:43.370> hardwood<00:02:45.110> again

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
more appropriate for hardwood again

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.540 
more appropriate for hardwood again
sharp<00:02:47.070> pencil<00:02:48.230> can<00:02:49.230> use<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> marker<00:02:50.130> pen<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.430> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
sharp pencil can use a marker pen if you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.340 
sharp pencil can use a marker pen if you
like

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:09.030 

as<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.130> say<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.340> can<00:02:58.640> use<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:58.820> knife

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.850 

and<00:03:09.430> then<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:09.819> can<00:03:09.970> use<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.150> bevel<00:03:10.540> gauge<00:03:10.860> if

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
and then we can use a bevel gauge if

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.250 
and then we can use a bevel gauge if
we're<00:03:12.220> using<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.610> bevel<00:03:12.939> gauge<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.810> can<00:03:13.989> set

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
we're using a bevel gauge you can set

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.220 
we're using a bevel gauge you can set
whatever<00:03:14.650> angle<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:16.390> may<00:03:16.629> have<00:03:16.659> a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
whatever angle you like you may have a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.089 
whatever angle you like you may have a
gauge<00:03:18.159> set<00:03:18.549> up<00:03:18.790> which<00:03:18.970> will<00:03:19.150> give<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.950> one<00:03:20.950> in

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
gauge set up which will give you one in

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.140 
gauge set up which will give you one in
six<00:03:21.459> 187<00:03:22.269> you<00:03:22.390> can<00:03:22.540> set<00:03:22.840> your<00:03:23.549> bevel<00:03:24.549> gauge<00:03:24.819> to

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
six 187 you can set your bevel gauge to

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.759 
six 187 you can set your bevel gauge to
exactly<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:27.640> Mark<00:03:27.909> out<00:03:28.120> your<00:03:28.299> dovetails

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
exactly that and Mark out your dovetails

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.460 
exactly that and Mark out your dovetails
or<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.220> simply<00:03:30.640> eyeball<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.540> pick

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
or you can simply eyeball it pick

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.089 
or you can simply eyeball it pick
whatever<00:03:32.680> angle<00:03:33.159> you<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:34.769> once<00:03:35.769> you've<00:03:35.950> done

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
whatever angle you like once you've done

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.059

a<00:03:36.159> few<00:03:36.430> dark<00:03:36.670> tales<00:03:37.109> you'll<00:03:38.109> know<00:03:38.379> roughly

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
a few dark tales you'll know roughly

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.880 
a few dark tales you'll know roughly
what<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.250> correct<00:03:39.549> angle<00:03:39.849> is<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> wood

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
what the correct angle is for the wood

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.670 
what the correct angle is for the wood
you're<00:03:42.069> working<00:03:42.489> in<00:03:43.170> once<00:03:44.170> you've<00:03:44.349> set<00:03:44.650> your

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
you're working in once you've set your

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.430 
you're working in once you've set your
bevel<00:03:45.010> gauge<00:03:45.250> though<00:03:46.049> remember<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.139> keep<00:03:47.260> it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
bevel gauge though remember to keep it

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.759 
bevel gauge though remember to keep it
the<00:03:47.530> same

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
the same

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.680 
the same
otherwise<00:03:48.370> your<00:03:48.609> dovetails<00:03:49.060> may<00:03:49.359> look<00:03:49.569> a<00:03:49.659> bit

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
otherwise your dovetails may look a bit

00:03:49.690 --> 00:04:09.770 
otherwise your dovetails may look a bit
odd

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.910 

one<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.590> advantages<00:04:10.710> with<00:04:12.620> some<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.740> these

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
one of the advantages with some of these

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.229 
one of the advantages with some of these
gauges<00:04:14.250> is<00:04:15.920> that<00:04:16.920> they<00:04:17.130> are<00:04:17.190> supposed<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.000> give

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
gauges is that they are supposed to give

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.590 
gauges is that they are supposed to give
you<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:22.290> right<00:04:22.950> angle<00:04:23.400> mark<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:24.210> go<00:04:24.360> across

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
you the right angle mark to go across

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.460 
you the right angle mark to go across
the<00:04:25.380> end<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.680> your<00:04:25.770> board<00:04:26.010> as<00:04:26.160> well<00:04:27.410> so<00:04:28.410> you

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
the end of your board as well so you

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.140 
the end of your board as well so you
would<00:04:28.800> mark<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.770> angle<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.880> across<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.030> end

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
would mark the angle and across the end

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:46.040 
would mark the angle and across the end
of<00:04:36.300> your<00:04:36.390> board<00:04:41.510> flip<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.660> around<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:45.540> angle

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
of your board flip it around the angle

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.840 
of your board flip it around the angle
and<00:04:46.260> across<00:04:47.100> the<00:04:47.280> end<00:04:47.400> of<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.580> board<00:04:49.850> and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
and across the end of the board and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:13.120 
and across the end of the board and
that's<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.150> same<00:04:51.390> with<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.720> Vettes<00:04:52.200> as<00:04:52.440> well

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.570 

if<00:05:14.130> you've<00:05:14.430> used<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.850> bevel<00:05:15.240> gate<00:05:16.430> then<00:05:17.430> you

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
if you've used the bevel gate then you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.640 
if you've used the bevel gate then you
should<00:05:17.759> use<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:19.020> Tri<00:05:19.289> square<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:22.380> square

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
should use the Tri square and square

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.999 
should use the Tri square and square
those<00:05:23.009> marks<00:05:23.400> round<00:05:24.319> and<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:25.440> will<00:05:25.560> find<00:05:25.830> that

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
those marks round and you will find that

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.089 
those marks round and you will find that
a<00:05:26.310> lot<00:05:26.940> easier<00:05:27.139> if<00:05:28.139> you<00:05:28.440> would<00:05:28.560> clamp<00:05:28.860> your

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
a lot easier if you would clamp your

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:43.350 
a lot easier if you would clamp your
work<00:05:29.539> in<00:05:30.539> a<00:05:31.380> vise

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.650 

so<00:05:44.360> now<00:05:44.509> that<00:05:44.660> boards<00:05:45.020> all<00:05:45.169> set<00:05:45.410> up<00:05:46.330> ready<00:05:47.330> to

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
so now that boards all set up ready to

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:55.390 
so now that boards all set up ready to
have<00:05:47.960> it<00:05:48.080> stuff<00:05:48.289> tails<00:05:48.560> cut<00:05:53.650> so<00:05:54.650> whichever<00:05:55.160> you

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
have it stuff tails cut so whichever you

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.129 
have it stuff tails cut so whichever you
choose<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:57.440> mark<00:05:57.680> your<00:05:57.889> dovetails<00:05:59.139> the

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.139 
choose and mark your dovetails the

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.900 
choose and mark your dovetails the
result<00:06:00.500> should<00:06:00.680> be<00:06:00.740> the<00:06:00.830> same<00:06:03.520> hope<00:06:04.520> you<00:06:04.699> found

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
result should be the same hope you found

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.170 
result should be the same hope you found
