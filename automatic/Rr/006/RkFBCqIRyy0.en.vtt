00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
today on protein powder I normally do

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.340 
today on protein powder I normally do
reviews<00:00:05.190> on<00:00:05.490> pre<00:00:06.000> workouts<00:00:06.420> but<00:00:06.750> today<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.020> want

reviews on pre workouts but today I want
to<00:00:07.379> show<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.620> guys<00:00:07.799> an<00:00:08.420> awesome<00:00:09.440> protein<00:00:10.440> that

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
to show you guys an awesome protein that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.549 
to show you guys an awesome protein that
i<00:00:10.740> just<00:00:10.800> bought<00:00:11.190> recently<00:00:12.349> it's<00:00:13.349> called

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
i just bought recently it's called

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
i just bought recently it's called
formula<00:00:14.190> 1<00:00:14.450> see<00:00:15.450> if<00:00:15.509> we<00:00:15.660> can<00:00:15.780> get<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
formula 1 see if we can get that in the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.769 
formula 1 see if we can get that in the
camera<00:00:16.650> there<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> can<00:00:17.220> see<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.570> formula<00:00:18.570> 1

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
camera there so you can see it formula 1

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.150 
camera there so you can see it formula 1
it's<00:00:19.050> made<00:00:19.289> by<00:00:20.210> first<00:00:21.210> form<00:00:21.710> now<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it's made by first form now this is a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.390 
it's made by first form now this is a
really<00:00:23.519> interesting<00:00:23.550> protein<00:00:25.220> one<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.310> my

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
really interesting protein one of my

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
really interesting protein one of my
favorite<00:00:26.760> things<00:00:26.939> about<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.660> flavor

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
favorite things about it is the flavor

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.640 
favorite things about it is the flavor
let's<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.710> if<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:28.949> see<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.369> also

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
let's see if you can see that also

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.350 
let's see if you can see that also
there's<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> little<00:00:31.859> bit<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.219> glare<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:33.210> it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
there's a little bit of a glare but it's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.990 
there's a little bit of a glare but it's
called<00:00:33.570> CTC<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> think<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.579> implied

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
called CTC now I think that's implied

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.610 
called CTC now I think that's implied
that<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> flavor<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.780> cinnamon<00:00:37.290> toast<00:00:37.500> crunch

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that the flavor is cinnamon toast crunch

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.500 
that the flavor is cinnamon toast crunch
and<00:00:38.100> that's<00:00:38.550> exactly<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.120> tastes<00:00:39.390> like

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and that's exactly what it tastes like

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.060 
and that's exactly what it tastes like
it's<00:00:40.440> delicious<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.219> love<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.579> protein

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
it's delicious I love this protein

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.990 
it's delicious I love this protein
another<00:00:44.070> really<00:00:44.280> good<00:00:44.460> thing<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.789> this

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
another really good thing about this

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.119 
another really good thing about this
protein<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.020> mention<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
protein that I want to mention is the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.060 
protein that I want to mention is the
mix<00:00:47.520> ability<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.690> whether<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> use<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.350> fork<00:00:49.890> or

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
mix ability so whether you use a fork or

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709 
mix ability so whether you use a fork or
spoon<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.399> makes<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:50.940> protein<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
spoon that makes up your protein or you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.139 
spoon that makes up your protein or you
have<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.899> blender<00:00:52.170> bottle<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.850> shake

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
have a blender bottle and you you shake

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.549 
have a blender bottle and you you shake
it<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> mix<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:55.980> no<00:00:56.129> clumps<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
it up to mix it there are no clumps so

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.959 
it up to mix it there are no clumps so
that's<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.859> pet<00:00:59.070> peeves<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.789> other

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that's one of my pet peeves with other

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.959 
that's one of my pet peeves with other
protein<00:01:00.390> powders<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.890> mix<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.489> mix<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
protein powders is you mix and mix and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.420 
protein powders is you mix and mix and
stir<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.449> stir<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.080> no<00:01:04.619> matter<00:01:04.769> what<00:01:04.890> there's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
stir and stir and no matter what there's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
stir and stir and no matter what there's
you<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:05.970> clumps<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.890> don't

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you have these clumps that don't

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
you have these clumps that don't
dissolve<00:01:08.189> with<00:01:08.400> water<00:01:08.640> milk<00:01:08.970> whatever<00:01:09.150> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
dissolve with water milk whatever you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.859 
dissolve with water milk whatever you
use<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.810> didn't<00:01:10.770> find<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.430> issue

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
use I didn't find that to be an issue

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.219 
use I didn't find that to be an issue
with<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.200> formula<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.860> protein<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.840> far<00:01:16.080> as

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
with this formula one protein as far as

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.429 
with this formula one protein as far as
macros<00:01:16.710> go<00:01:16.979> it's<00:01:17.909> got<00:01:18.060> 20<00:01:18.420> grams<00:01:18.659> per<00:01:19.049> scoop

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
macros go it's got 20 grams per scoop

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
macros go it's got 20 grams per scoop
and<00:01:20.869> you<00:01:21.869> know<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.170> pretty<00:01:22.439> negligible<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
and you know that's pretty negligible I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.100 
and you know that's pretty negligible I
mean<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.939> protein<00:01:24.420> powders<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
mean all protein powders are going to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.240 
mean all protein powders are going to
have<00:01:25.229> between<00:01:25.470> 20<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> 30<00:01:26.670> grams<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.180> protein

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
have between 20 and 30 grams of protein

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.789 
have between 20 and 30 grams of protein
this<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> high-quality<00:01:29.610> protein<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.320> also<00:01:31.500> has

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
this is high-quality protein it also has

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.649 
this is high-quality protein it also has
your<00:01:31.829> five<00:01:32.250> grams<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:33.290> bcaas<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.659> it's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
your five grams of bcaas in it so it's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
your five grams of bcaas in it so it's
got<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> good<00:01:37.490> ingredient<00:01:38.490> profile<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.890> mixes

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
got a good ingredient profile it mixes

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.700 
got a good ingredient profile it mixes
very<00:01:41.549> easily<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.689> flavor<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.110> awesome

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
very easily and the flavor is awesome

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.830 
very easily and the flavor is awesome
