hundreds of new features and new shiny
things<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.449> it's<00:01:03.629> not<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.960> come<00:01:04.019> with

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
things but it's not going to come with

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.359 
things but it's not going to come with
that<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.100> middle

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that much it's kind of like a middle

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.969 
that much it's kind of like a middle
ground<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.850> they<00:01:06.659> say<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.110> gonna<00:01:07.260> cost<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
ground and they say it's gonna cost the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.920 
ground and they say it's gonna cost the
same<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> stuff<00:01:08.939> pack<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
same as a stuff pack and I think this is

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.440 
same as a stuff pack and I think this is
just<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> US<00:01:10.770> only<00:01:11.100> because<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.150> will<00:01:12.270> be

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
just in the US only because that will be

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.929 
just in the US only because that will be
twenty<00:01:12.780> dollars<00:01:13.140> whereas<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> UK<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
twenty dollars whereas in the UK will be

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.539 
twenty dollars whereas in the UK will be
20<00:01:15.540> pounds<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.259> least<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.340> is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
20 pounds at least that's what it is

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.480 
20 pounds at least that's what it is
priced<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.270> moment<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.950> five<00:01:20.159> pounds

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
priced at at the moment so five pounds

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
priced at at the moment so five pounds
more<00:01:20.700> than<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.880> staff<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> UK<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
more than a staff back in the UK but it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.010 
more than a staff back in the UK but it
comes<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:22.920> more<00:01:23.340> stuff<00:01:23.640> than<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.390> stuff<00:01:24.750> pack

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
comes with more stuff than a stuff pack

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.380 
comes with more stuff than a stuff pack
so<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.770> think<00:01:25.860> must<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.159> quite<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> cool<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
so I think must be quite a cool thing so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
so I think must be quite a cool thing so
some<00:01:27.930> things<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.259> go<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.040> go
