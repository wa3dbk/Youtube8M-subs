bit on that side you can bring it close

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
bit on that side you can bring it close
alright<00:00:27.330> if<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:27.990> threaded<00:00:28.460> fixing<00:00:29.900> now<00:00:31.820> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
alright if your threaded fixing now the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.740 
alright if your threaded fixing now the
actual<00:00:32.969> fixing<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:34.380> nothing<00:00:34.649> bolt<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.520> nut

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
actual fixing but nothing bolt the nut

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.959 
actual fixing but nothing bolt the nut
the<00:00:36.750> screw<00:00:37.440> goes<00:00:37.950> through<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> hole<00:00:40.079> like

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
the screw goes through the hole like

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.619 
the screw goes through the hole like
that<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.430> goes<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.149> plug<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
that that then goes into the plug in the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.150 
that that then goes into the plug in the
wall<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.559> suggest<00:00:47.039> using<00:00:48.800> probably<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> red

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
wall we suggest using probably the red

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.930 
wall we suggest using probably the red
plugs<00:00:50.489> would<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:51.350> drill<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.100> masonry

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
plugs would do drill with a masonry

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.400 
plugs would do drill with a masonry
drill<00:00:54.120> bit<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.629> going<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.140> brick

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
drill bit if it's going into a brick

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
drill bit if it's going into a brick
wall<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.379> plug<00:00:58.969> which<00:00:59.969> goes

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
wall so you get your plug which goes

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.450 
wall so you get your plug which goes
into<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> wall<00:01:01.190> after<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> drilled

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
into the wall after you drilled

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.920 
into the wall after you drilled
obviously<00:01:03.080> you<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.260> screw<00:01:05.030> that<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
obviously you then screw that into the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
obviously you then screw that into the
plug<00:01:08.900> resulting<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.799> fixing<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> wall

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
plug resulting in the fixing on the wall

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.149 
plug resulting in the fixing on the wall
obviously<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.869> does<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.470> bit<00:01:13.710> does<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.040> go

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
obviously that does this bit does not go

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
obviously that does this bit does not go
in<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> wall<00:01:14.490> alright<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> also<00:01:16.229> don't

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
in the wall alright and also don't

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
in the wall alright and also don't
tighten<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.920> too<00:01:17.159> much<00:01:17.310> leave<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:17.970> can

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
tighten up too much leave it so it can

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.410 
tighten up too much leave it so it can
turn<00:01:18.710> alright<00:01:19.710> you'll<00:01:20.580> need<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.330> you
