00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
guys I've done the tutorial and this

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.130 
guys I've done the tutorial and this
already<00:02:51.519> should<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.060> on<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.360> screen<00:02:52.690> now<00:02:53.110> I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
already should be on the screen now I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.830 
already should be on the screen now I
guess<00:02:53.500> I'll<00:02:53.709> put<00:02:53.800> it<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:53.980> an<00:02:54.070> annotation<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.840> I

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
guess I'll put it on an annotation and I

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.870 
guess I'll put it on an annotation and I
thought<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.680> fits<00:02:56.950> within<00:02:57.160> well<00:02:57.550> with<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
thought it fits within well with the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.199 
thought it fits within well with the
barn<00:02:58.440> harvest<00:02:59.440> sugarcane<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.780> melons<00:03:02.140> oh

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
barn harvest sugarcane the melons oh

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.790 
barn harvest sugarcane the melons oh
that<00:03:04.209> one<00:03:04.330> didn't<00:03:04.480> work<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:05.230> will<00:03:05.410> work<00:03:05.440> though

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
that one didn't work it will work though

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:23.580 

kids<00:07:18.139> escaped<00:07:18.470> just<00:07:19.460> put<00:07:19.639> that<00:07:19.820> fence<00:07:20.030> back

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:27.159 

yeah<00:07:24.590> but<00:07:24.800> that<00:07:24.980> is<00:07:25.570> everything<00:07:26.570> you<00:07:26.990> can
