00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.400
 very good that I am kicker nai 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.960
 directors prism tutorials let's see 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.639
 how to retrieve information from 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.219
 Photographs that need a lot of range 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.929
 dynamic like this that you see here is worth 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.480
 very important that you have photographed 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.760
 in raw for better results we are going to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.890
 come file open and we open our 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.530
 raw photography in this case in format 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.810
 of in axis and good if it is raul 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.220
 you will open it directly with the plugin 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.250
 raw camera adobe if you can not 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.559
 Select here it ok for camera raw 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.329
 we are going to open and we are already open with this 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.620
 plugin that if you do not know it is very 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.199
 simple and we'll see later 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.359
 more thoroughly as you will see this image 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.409
 need information in the shadows 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.300
 because in this area here has been 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.710
 completely black but if 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.539
 we would have tried to make that come out 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.280
 well this part of here would have left 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.170
 what a terrible thing to have achieved 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.089
 we had to have done an access is 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.949
 say put together several photos with different 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.300
 position but since we do not have it we're going 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.039
 to take advantage of a photograph of 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.049
 entered to recover this area from here 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.780
 of the histogram and also the area of ​​the 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.429
 lights that is around here is worth for 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.390
 we are going to take advantage of two tabs that 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.940
 has raw camera that are illuminations and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.850
 if you notice, I'm going to lift the tab 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.830
 of shadows so that we recover 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 information in the dark areas here in 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.340
 the stairs I'll take it fully to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.159
 that you see we have recovered a lot of 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.790
 information a lot of detail and 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.880
 I will also do with the 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.550
 illuminations is worth in this other example 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.440
 that we have here I made the photo to 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.050
 that the central area of ​​this church 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.060
 stay well exposed is very good 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.460
 center the dome above but without 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 however, the sides are very dark 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.050
 for if I had for example done the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.330
 photo with more exposure is to say with more 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.270
 light, I would have burned the area 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.979
 of central these columns the dome and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.410
 well this is something that equally 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.350
 we would have gotten with an hdr but 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.110
 let's do it with a single rail 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.759
 photography we climb the shadows we go down 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.800
 the illuminations and we are winning 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.270
 a lot of dynamic range in this way 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 even now I can climb a tad 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.649
 exposure so that the image has more 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.440
 light and good in certain cases you can 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.380
 also use the tabs here 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.110
 down the black and white 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.020
 you need even more information 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.730
 It's worth these here but well 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.410
 I repeat that you have to be careful with 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.530
 this because it generates noise if we take it 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.540
 to the extremes to finish we're going to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.860
 clarity to give up some 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.020
 sharpness to those areas that we have 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.270
 recovered and why not a tad of 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.640
 intensity to give more color to our 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.350
 image is valid in this last case that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.870
 we have here I will not edit the photo with 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.310
 raw camera but I'm going to open it 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.410
 directly with photoshop with this 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.550
 button that is here that is open image and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.620
 which serves to open the image in 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.920
 photoshop once we have edited it in 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.750
 raw camera voucher come to image settings 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.010
 and you can see that here we have shadows and 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.360
 illuminations and we can do 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.790
 exactly the same as we did in 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.290
 camera raw but in this case we're 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.210
 editing in photoshop good here I had 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.760
 more options and the bad of editing in 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.500
 photoshop is that they are no longer ray and 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.380
 We are recovering information but 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.580
 generating much more noise up here the 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.740
 tutorial today I hope that I have you 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
 liked and for anything I'm by 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.790
 here in the comments or on the networks 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.540
 social a very strong hug and we 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.540
 we see in the next
