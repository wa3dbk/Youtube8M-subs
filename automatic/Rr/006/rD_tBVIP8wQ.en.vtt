00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
right now I'm just getting experience

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.360 
right now I'm just getting experience
points<00:04:54.120> but<00:04:54.510> there<00:04:54.690> isn't<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:54.990> an<00:04:55.770> endurance

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
points but there isn't a an endurance

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.680 
points but there isn't a an endurance
capsule<00:04:56.970> or<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.690> strength<00:04:58.050> capsule<00:04:58.530> maybe<00:04:58.710> no

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
wonder if it's a strength capsule if

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.010
