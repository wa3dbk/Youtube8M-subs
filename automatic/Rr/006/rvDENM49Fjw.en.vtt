00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
see the surface has been dressed with

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.450 
see the surface has been dressed with
some<00:01:33.790> fresh<00:01:34.479> akadama

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
some fresh akadama

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.719 
some fresh akadama
and<00:01:36.460> I've<00:01:37.210> applied<00:01:37.450> some<00:01:37.570> moss<00:01:38.369> around<00:01:39.369> the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
and I've applied some moss around the

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.540 
and I've applied some moss around the
trunk<00:01:39.940> just<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.300> accentuate<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:42.340> the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
trunk just to accentuate the way the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.900 
trunk just to accentuate the way the
roots<00:01:42.790> and<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> nebari<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.690> running<00:01:44.050> on<00:01:44.200> there

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
roots and the nebari is running on there

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.130 
roots and the nebari is running on there
some<00:01:45.910> people<00:01:46.210> prefer<00:01:46.390> to<00:01:46.540> cover<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.960> whole

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
some people prefer to cover the whole

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.740 
some people prefer to cover the whole
pot<00:01:47.440> in<00:01:47.650> moss<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:48.250> think<00:01:48.759> it's<00:01:48.910> not<00:01:49.450> really

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
pot in moss I think it's not really

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.170 
pot in moss I think it's not really
necessary<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:51.399> be<00:01:51.550> honest<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:51.850> Moss

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
necessary and to be honest that Moss

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.030 
necessary and to be honest that Moss
will<00:01:52.450> come<00:01:52.690> off<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:53.110> soon<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> tree<00:01:53.800> comes

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
will come off as soon as the tree comes

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.670 
will come off as soon as the tree comes
back<00:01:54.310> from<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.700> exhibition<00:01:55.470> when<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.560> goes

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
back from the exhibition when it goes

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.700 
back from the exhibition when it goes
back<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:56.979> today<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:01.690> second<00:02:02.050> tree<00:02:02.200> I'm<00:02:02.320> taking

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
back on today the second tree I'm taking

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:14.640 
back on today the second tree I'm taking
along<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.250> this<00:02:12.360> growth<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:14.020> year<00:02:14.080> has<00:02:14.380> been

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
along is this growth this year has been

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.680 
along is this growth this year has been
quite<00:02:14.890> sparse<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.940> leaves<00:02:16.270> are<00:02:16.510> much

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
quite sparse and the leaves are much

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.449 
quite sparse and the leaves are much
larger<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.319> year<00:02:17.620> than<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.950> work<00:02:18.160> in

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
larger this year than the work in

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.059 
larger this year than the work in
previous<00:02:18.880> years<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:20.170> I<00:02:20.380> believe<00:02:20.440> that's<00:02:20.830> to

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
previous years and I believe that's to

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:31.260 
previous years and I believe that's to
do<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:29.100> by<00:02:30.100> increasing<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> surface<00:02:30.970> of

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
do with the by increasing the surface of

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.949 
do with the by increasing the surface of
the<00:02:31.360> leaves<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.110> more<00:02:32.640> sunshine<00:02:33.640> for

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the leaves to get more sunshine for

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.830 
the leaves to get more sunshine for
photosynthesis<00:02:35.130> again<00:02:39.360> there's<00:02:40.360> been<00:02:40.510> some

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
photosynthesis again there's been some

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.839 
photosynthesis again there's been some
moss<00:02:41.170> applied<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> surface<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.580> again

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
moss applied to the surface and again

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:51.180 
moss applied to the surface and again
that<00:02:43.060> Moss<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.510> coming<00:02:43.780> off<00:02:50.040> again<00:02:51.040> I've

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
that Moss is coming off again I've

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.650 
that Moss is coming off again I've
brought<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.610> camera<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.240> bit<00:02:52.360> closer

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
brought the camera a little bit closer

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.500 
brought the camera a little bit closer
just<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.050> give<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.410> look<00:02:53.620> at<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:54.330> at<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
just to give you a look at the at the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.410 
just to give you a look at the at the
surface<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.200> park<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.910> way<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.240> has

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
surface of the park and the way this has

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.860 
surface of the park and the way this has
been<00:02:58.630> dressed

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.500 

so<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.990> might<00:03:05.200> see<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> slight<00:03:05.830> bloom<00:03:06.400> on<00:03:07.180> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
so you might see a slight bloom on the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.180 
so you might see a slight bloom on the
on<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.990> top<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.500> akadama

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
on the top of the akadama

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.060 
on the top of the akadama
now<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.120> due<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.600> an<00:03:11.470> organic<00:03:11.800> fertilizer

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
now this is due to an organic fertilizer

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.540 
now this is due to an organic fertilizer
that's<00:03:12.610> been<00:03:12.790> applied<00:03:13.800> that's<00:03:14.800> now<00:03:14.980> starting

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
that's been applied that's now starting

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.090 
that's been applied that's now starting
to<00:03:15.580> react<00:03:16.000> through<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.330> moisture<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:18.040> it

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
to react through the moisture and it

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.940 
to react through the moisture and it
shows<00:03:18.280> me<00:03:18.460> that<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.060> organics<00:03:19.780> is

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
shows me that the the organics is

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:57.660 
shows me that the the organics is
breaking<00:03:20.950> down<00:03:21.160> its<00:03:21.430> feeding<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.890> simplifies

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
breaking down its feeding it simplifies

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.900 
breaking down its feeding it simplifies
the<00:03:57.700> symbiotic<00:03:58.210> relationship<00:03:59.080> between<00:03:59.110> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the symbiotic relationship between the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.700 
the symbiotic relationship between the
mycorrhizal<00:04:00.910> fungi<00:04:01.480> that<00:04:01.660> helps<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.320> tree<00:04:02.500> to
