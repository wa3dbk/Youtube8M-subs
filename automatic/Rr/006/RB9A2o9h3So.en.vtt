the night tomorrow night early Sunday we

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.970 
the night tomorrow night early Sunday we
could<00:03:33.660> see<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> few<00:03:33.959> strong<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.590> severe<00:03:34.860> storms

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
could see a few strong to severe storms

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.430 
could see a few strong to severe storms
here<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.780> limiting<00:03:37.110> factor

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.699 
here but this is the limiting factor
this<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.830> the<00:03:38.010> instability<00:03:39.110> at<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.590> after

and the air is unstable from love

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.470 
and the air is unstable from love
roughly<00:03:46.290> i-20<00:03:46.860> south<00:03:47.250> but<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.970> really<00:03:48.090> better

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
roughly i-20 south but the really better

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.540 
roughly i-20 south but the really better
instability<00:03:49.230> values<00:03:49.620> are<00:03:49.770> clearly<00:03:50.100> over<00:03:50.430> the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
instability values are clearly over the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.660 
instability values are clearly over the

southern part of alabama the shear

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.590 
southern part of alabama the shear
values<00:03:54.120> are<00:03:54.440> you<00:03:55.440> know<00:03:55.590> relatively

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
values are you know relatively

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.280 
values are you know relatively
significant<00:03:57.600> but<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.930> little<00:03:58.050> out<00:03:58.260> of

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
significant but it's a little out of

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.930 
significant but it's a little out of
phase<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.830> better<00:03:59.040> instability<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.820> this

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
phase with a better instability and this

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.199 
phase with a better instability and this
is<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.209> eh<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.680> energy<00:04:02.100> helicity<00:04:02.459> index

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
is the eh I the energy helicity index

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.970 
is the eh I the energy helicity index
which<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> good<00:04:03.780> index<00:04:04.080> that<00:04:04.350> takes<00:04:04.770> both

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
which is a good index that takes both

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.860 
which is a good index that takes both
into<00:04:05.220> account<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.180> bigger<00:04:06.360> numbers<00:04:06.720> are

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
into account and the bigger numbers are

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.449 
into account and the bigger numbers are
way<00:04:06.989> down<00:04:07.200> there<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.530> South<00:04:07.739> Alabama<00:04:08.190> downer

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
way down there in South Alabama downer

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.100 
way down there in South Alabama downer
and<00:04:08.640> mobile<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.209> Baldwin<00:04:09.330> counties<00:04:09.930> up

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
and mobile and Baldwin counties up

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.860 
and mobile and Baldwin counties up
toward<00:04:10.320> Monroeville<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.010> Thomasville<00:04:11.519> so

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
toward Monroeville and Thomasville so

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.330 
toward Monroeville and Thomasville so
again<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> idea<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.860> best<00:04:13.980> chance

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
again the idea is that the best chance

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.159 
again the idea is that the best chance
of<00:04:14.519> really<00:04:14.820> significant<00:04:15.660> severe<00:04:16.019> weather

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
of really significant severe weather

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.229 
of really significant severe weather
will<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.769> over<00:04:17.130> South<00:04:17.400> Alabama<00:04:17.880> tomorrow

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
will be over South Alabama tomorrow

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.449 
will be over South Alabama tomorrow
night<00:04:18.450> but<00:04:19.019> we<00:04:19.230> might<00:04:19.410> see<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> severe<00:04:20.040> storm<00:04:20.280> as

the trough sharpens up over the east and
it<00:05:03.210> gets<00:05:03.300> even<00:05:03.479> colder<00:05:03.780> I<00:05:04.400> don't<00:05:05.400> think<00:05:05.669> we

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
it gets even colder I don't think we

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.340 
it gets even colder I don't think we
make<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.060> out<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.330> 40s<00:05:06.720> on<00:05:06.840> Tuesday<00:05:07.229> if

make it out of the 40s on Tuesday if

make it out of the 40s on Tuesday if
this<00:05:07.500> is<00:05:07.620> right<00:05:07.880> we<00:05:08.880> start<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.210> day<00:05:09.330> around

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
this is right we start the day around

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.060 
this is right we start the day around
freezing<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.200> then<00:05:10.290> Wednesday<00:05:10.620> morning<00:05:10.950> it's
