00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.900 

and<00:02:41.380> as<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.560> see<00:02:42.709> there<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.370> didn't<00:02:43.610> notice

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
and as you see there you didn't notice

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.030 
and as you see there you didn't notice
but<00:02:44.120> I'd<00:02:44.239> missed<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.780> ferret<00:02:45.230> he<00:02:45.890> was

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
but I'd missed the ferret he was

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.400 
but I'd missed the ferret he was
actually<00:02:46.220> hiding<00:02:46.550> in<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> bush<00:02:47.230> I'm<00:02:48.230> not

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
actually hiding in the bush I'm not

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.960 
actually hiding in the bush I'm not
gonna<00:02:48.530> replay<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.310> if<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.519> talk<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.880> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
gonna replay it but if you talk on the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.970 
gonna replay it but if you talk on the
ferret<00:02:50.329> he'd<00:02:50.510> runs<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.110> he<00:02:51.410> goes<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.920> he

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
ferret he'd runs and he goes and he

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.789 
ferret he'd runs and he goes and he
escapes<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.079> see<00:02:54.230> there<00:02:54.410> there<00:02:54.590> are

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
escapes so as you see there there are

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.500 
escapes so as you see there there are
possibilities<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:55.790> can<00:02:55.970> miss<00:02:56.209> things

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
possibilities that you can miss things

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.330 
possibilities that you can miss things
like<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.959> just<00:02:57.019> said<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.380> ferret<00:02:57.860> I<00:02:57.950> missed<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
like I just said the ferret I missed the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.819 
like I just said the ferret I missed the
ferret<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.090> probably<00:02:59.510> might<00:03:00.079> capture<00:03:00.500> him<00:03:00.650> if

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
ferret you probably might capture him if

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.190 
ferret you probably might capture him if
you<00:03:00.950> will<00:03:01.070> walk<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.430> carefully<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:05.200> haven't

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
you will walk you carefully I haven't

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.500 
you will walk you carefully I haven't
played<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.470> level<00:03:06.709> yet<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:07.430> it's<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.360> give

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
played this level yet so it's just give

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:33.720 
played this level yet so it's just give
it<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.660> quick<00:03:08.810> play

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.330 

scheme<00:03:34.390> does<00:03:34.599> not<00:03:34.750> require<00:03:35.110> internet<00:03:35.740> access

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
scheme does not require internet access

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.250 
scheme does not require internet access
so<00:03:36.700> it's<00:03:37.330> one<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.599> those<00:03:37.720> games<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.170> could

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
so it's one of those games you could

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.460 
so it's one of those games you could
play<00:03:38.319> on<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:39.459> bus<00:03:39.670> or<00:03:40.090> X<00:03:40.290> don't<00:03:41.290> play<00:03:41.440> that

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
play on the bus or X don't play that

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:54.080 
play on the bus or X don't play that

some<00:04:29.710> missions<00:04:30.010> have<00:04:30.190> secret<00:04:30.729> hidden<00:04:31.000> items

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
some missions have secret hidden items

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.870 
some missions have secret hidden items
which<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:31.840> have<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.169> attain<00:04:32.470> some<00:04:33.370> them<00:04:33.610> I

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
which you have to attain some them I

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.920 
which you have to attain some them I
guess<00:04:34.240> don't<00:04:34.540> but<00:04:35.020> there's<00:04:35.580> different<00:04:36.930> scenes

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
guess don't but there's different scenes

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.810 
guess don't but there's different scenes
it's<00:04:38.320> a<00:04:38.410> different<00:04:38.710> story<00:04:38.890> for<00:04:39.250> each<00:04:39.340> mission

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
it's a different story for each mission

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.760 
it's a different story for each mission
and<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.090> actually<00:04:40.570> like<00:04:40.930> that<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.470> give<00:04:41.620> you<00:04:41.740> a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
and I actually like that to give you a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.490 
and I actually like that to give you a
little<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:43.180> know<00:04:43.210> prologue<00:04:43.840> before<00:04:43.870> each

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
little you know prologue before each

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.640 
little you know prologue before each
mission<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.450> this<00:04:46.450> is<00:04:46.600> tiny<00:04:46.840> thief<00:04:47.110> check<00:04:47.500> it

that<00:04:50.919> was<00:04:51.039> my<00:04:51.070> little<00:04:51.430> quick<00:04:51.580> review<00:04:52.060> and

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
that was my little quick review and

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.670 
that was my little quick review and
played<00:04:52.479> through<00:04:52.630> a<00:04:52.690> tiny<00:04:52.990> thief<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.500> only

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
played through a tiny thief the only

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.469 
played through a tiny thief the only
thing<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:53.950> could<00:04:54.160> really<00:04:54.280> ask<00:04:54.580> for<00:04:54.910> more<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.300> if

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
thing I could really ask for more is if

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.750 
thing I could really ask for more is if
they<00:04:55.630> added<00:04:55.840> more<00:04:56.050> levels<00:04:56.740> or<00:04:56.919> something<00:04:57.430> else

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
they added more levels or something else

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.880 
they added more levels or something else
within<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.300> game<00:04:58.510> like<00:04:58.840> maybe<00:04:59.080> achievements

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
within the game like maybe achievements

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.920 
within the game like maybe achievements
or<00:05:00.070> I<00:05:00.340> guess<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.030> leaderboard<00:05:01.450> for<00:05:01.720> the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
or I guess a leaderboard for the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.990 
or I guess a leaderboard for the
quickest<00:05:02.320> time<00:05:02.530> beat<00:05:02.830> on<00:05:03.039> the<00:05:03.250> map<00:05:03.460> that's

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
quickest time beat on the map that's

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.909 
quickest time beat on the map that's
just<00:05:04.240> my<00:05:04.390> opinion<00:05:04.539> I<00:05:05.110> would<00:05:05.260> like<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.500> see<00:05:05.680> more

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
just my opinion I would like to see more

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.500 
just my opinion I would like to see more
