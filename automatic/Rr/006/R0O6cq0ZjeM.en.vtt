00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.280 
hi guys it's me this is my bias tape
thing<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:05.670> made<00:00:06.000> my<00:00:06.120> bias<00:00:06.450> tape<00:00:06.660> around<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
thing I made my bias tape around the

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.419 
thing I made my bias tape around the
roll<00:00:07.760> this<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.970> one<00:00:09.000> inch<00:00:09.450> tip<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> needed<00:00:11.099> 2

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
roll this is one inch tip so I needed 2

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.259 
roll this is one inch tip so I needed 2
inch<00:00:11.610> bias<00:00:12.000> tape<00:00:12.889> I<00:00:13.889> basically<00:00:14.519> made<00:00:14.910> my<00:00:15.059> bias

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
inch bias tape I basically made my bias

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.900 
inch bias tape I basically made my bias
tape<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.839> just<00:00:16.109> rolled<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.730> there

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
tape and just rolled it up on in there

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.410 
tape and just rolled it up on in there
very<00:00:18.420> simple<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.050> easy<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:20.970> it's<00:00:21.119> going

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
very simple and easy I think it's going

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
very simple and easy I think it's going
to<00:00:21.449> be<00:00:21.600> easier<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.439> load<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.100> tip<00:00:24.109> up<00:00:25.250> here

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
to be easier if I load the tip up here

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.990 
to be easier if I load the tip up here
with<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.390> off<00:00:27.599> first<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.340> already<00:00:32.610> turn<00:00:32.850> my

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
with it off first and I already turn my

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
with it off first and I already turn my
machine<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.440> nice<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.860> hot<00:00:35.100> while

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
machine on so it get nice and hot while

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.590 
machine on so it get nice and hot while
I'm<00:00:35.760> doing<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.670> then<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.910> just<00:00:38.940> take

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I'm doing this and then you just take

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.490 
I'm doing this and then you just take
this<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:41.629> slide<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.660> in

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.340 

the<00:00:47.920> best<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.340> you<00:00:48.489> can<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.149> then<00:00:49.809> once<00:00:50.050> you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
the best that you can and then once you

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.880 
the best that you can and then once you
start<00:00:50.680> seeing<00:00:50.920> fabric<00:00:52.469> take<00:00:53.469> a<00:00:53.500> pair<00:00:53.860> of

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
start seeing fabric take a pair of

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.750 
start seeing fabric take a pair of
scissors<00:00:54.250> or<00:00:54.789> something<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.829> you<00:00:57.219> push<00:00:57.579> it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
scissors or something and you push it

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.450 
scissors or something and you push it
down<00:00:58.030> through<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:01.710> once<00:01:02.710> you<00:01:02.890> have<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.280> down

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
down through and once you have it down

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.760 
down through and once you have it down
through<00:01:06.930> seems<00:01:07.930> like<00:01:08.110> it's<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.380> little<00:01:08.530> bit

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
through seems like it's a little bit

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.300 
through seems like it's a little bit
more<00:01:09.100> on<00:01:09.280> one<00:01:09.490> side<00:01:09.729> than<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.000> other

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
more on one side than the other

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.279 
more on one side than the other
so<00:01:12.310> not<00:01:12.909> just<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:13.479> just<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.990> hair<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:16.810> even

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
so not just that just a hair it's even

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.219 
so not just that just a hair it's even
on<00:01:17.409> both<00:01:17.530> sides<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:19.750> what<00:01:19.929> I'm<00:01:20.050> going<00:01:20.200> to

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
on both sides and then what I'm going to

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.109 
on both sides and then what I'm going to
do<00:01:20.409> is<00:01:20.530> I'm<00:01:20.679> going<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.890> clip<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.580> back<00:01:21.850> down

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
do is I'm going to clip that back down

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:30.139 
do is I'm going to clip that back down
in<00:01:22.450> there

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:47.000 

slide<00:01:30.929> it<00:01:31.200> in

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.710 

okay<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:49.060> on<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.740> some<00:01:50.950> flat

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.390 

put<00:01:56.440> that<00:01:56.710> in<00:01:59.910> nope<00:02:01.680> guess<00:02:02.680> I<00:02:02.830> have<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.070> get<00:02:03.310> it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
put that in nope guess I have to get it

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.170 
put that in nope guess I have to get it
all<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.580> way<00:02:03.760> over<00:02:03.910> to<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.300> wheel<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.280> pull

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
all the way over to the wheel so pull

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.420 
all the way over to the wheel so pull
that<00:02:07.210> over<00:02:08.640> till<00:02:09.640> we<00:02:09.790> have<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.360> wheel

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
that over till we have it on the wheel

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.490 
that over till we have it on the wheel
and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:13.540> what<00:02:13.690> we're<00:02:13.870> going<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.080> do<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.350> we're

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and then what we're going to do is we're

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.100 
and then what we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.710> clip<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.350> hit<00:02:17.620> run<00:02:18.840> there<00:02:19.840> it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
going to clip it in and hit run there it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.560 
going to clip it in and hit run there it
goes<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.840> coming<00:02:23.200> out<00:02:23.820> nice<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:24.880> even

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
goes and it's coming out nice and even

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:33.540 
goes and it's coming out nice and even
and<00:02:26.460> making<00:02:27.460> a<00:02:27.490> nice<00:02:27.790> bias<00:02:28.240> tape

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.700 

even<00:02:34.240> though<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.900> wrinkly<00:02:35.470> it's

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
even though it's going in wrinkly it's

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.100 
even though it's going in wrinkly it's
coming<00:02:36.100> out<00:02:36.220> nice<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.490> flat<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.150> even<00:02:37.690> on

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
coming out nice and flat and even on

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:48.700 
coming out nice and flat and even on
both<00:02:38.410> sides

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.960 

you<00:02:49.100> can<00:02:49.280> make<00:02:49.550> our<00:02:49.700> guides<00:02:50.030> move<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:52.640> guides

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
you can make our guides move the guides

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:06.030 
you can make our guides move the guides
in<00:02:53.210> a<00:02:53.270> little<00:02:53.630> bit<00:02:53.750> easier<00:02:54.230> and

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.800 

looks<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:06.970> only<00:03:07.150> going<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.390> take<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.540> few

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
looks like it's only going to take a few

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:38.729 
looks like it's only going to take a few
seconds<00:03:08.290> tax<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.860> do<00:03:08.920> 15<00:03:09.790> feet<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.269> bias<00:03:10.510> tape

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.740 

I<00:03:38.769> think<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.370> took<00:03:39.489> me<00:03:39.700> longer<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.120> wind<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.629> up

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
I think it took me longer to wind it up

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.539 
I think it took me longer to wind it up
on<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.019> real<00:03:41.230> than<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.709> actually<00:03:41.860> did<00:03:42.280> for

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
on the real than it actually did for

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.960 
on the real than it actually did for
this<00:03:42.670> machine<00:03:42.879> to<00:03:43.360> actually<00:03:43.959> make<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:47.970> only

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
this machine to actually make it only

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.160 
this machine to actually make it only
took<00:03:49.209> seconds<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.049> heat<00:03:50.260> up<00:03:51.780> okay<00:03:52.810> shut

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
took seconds for it to heat up okay shut

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.300 
took seconds for it to heat up okay shut
it<00:03:53.200> off<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.970> your<00:03:54.970> bias<00:03:55.390> tape<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:56.260> all<00:03:56.590> even<00:03:56.920> in

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
it off and your bias tape is all even in

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.869 
it off and your bias tape is all even in
all<00:03:57.640> one<00:03:58.030> inch<00:03:58.239> wide<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:59.310> all<00:04:00.310> I<00:04:00.340> have<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.700> do

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
all one inch wide and all I have to do

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.589 
all one inch wide and all I have to do
now<00:04:01.120> is<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:02.200> fold<00:04:02.769> it<00:04:03.010> in<00:04:03.099> half<00:04:03.129> and<00:04:03.700> iron<00:04:04.390> it

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
now is I can fold it in half and iron it

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.350 
now is I can fold it in half and iron it
or<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.900> can<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:05.829> run<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.549> through<00:04:06.730> my<00:04:06.819> bias

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
or I can just run it through my bias

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.089 
or I can just run it through my bias
tape<00:04:08.290> foot<00:04:08.980> which<00:04:09.879> the<00:04:10.239> foot<00:04:10.480> itself<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.709> put

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
tape foot which the foot itself you put

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.759 
tape foot which the foot itself you put
it<00:04:12.340> in<00:04:12.640> and<00:04:12.940> it<00:04:13.299> will<00:04:13.420> actually<00:04:13.660> sew<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.319> evenly

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
it in and it will actually sew it evenly

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.370 
it in and it will actually sew it evenly
on<00:04:15.040> both<00:04:15.069> sides<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:16.180> will<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.539> close<00:04:17.109> it

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
on both sides and it will just close it

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.069 
on both sides and it will just close it
with<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.889> foot<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.299> don't<00:04:19.479> have<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> seam

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
with the foot so you don't have a seam

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.070 
with the foot so you don't have a seam
on<00:04:20.109> the<00:04:20.470> edge<00:04:20.590> if<00:04:20.799> you<00:04:20.919> don't<00:04:21.100> like<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.549> scene

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
on the edge if you don't like the scene

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.040 
on the edge if you don't like the scene
so<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.560> that's<00:04:23.740> basically<00:04:24.729> it<00:04:25.030> by<00:04:25.419> steps<00:04:25.840> all

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
so but that's basically it by steps all

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.139 
so but that's basically it by steps all
done<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:28.300> seems<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.660> work<00:04:28.690> just<00:04:28.840> fine
