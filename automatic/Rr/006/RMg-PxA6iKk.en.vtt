00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
home and I love it a lot and then this

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.610 
home and I love it a lot and then this
is<00:03:39.790> just<00:03:39.819> a<00:03:40.030> body<00:03:40.239> wash<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.659> the<00:03:41.140> real<00:03:41.290> reason

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
is just a body wash and the real reason

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.170 
is just a body wash and the real reason
actually<00:03:41.709> bought<00:03:42.099> these<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.700> obviously

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
actually bought these because obviously

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.390 
actually bought these because obviously
I<00:03:43.480> came<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.989> Lille<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:44.409> I<00:03:44.470> needed<00:03:44.680> them<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:44.950> like

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
I came to Lille so I needed them to like

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.039 
I came to Lille so I needed them to like
travel-size<00:03:45.879> but<00:03:46.239> I'm<00:03:46.330> also<00:03:46.450> going<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.780> yard

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
travel-size but I'm also going to yard

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.199 
travel-size but I'm also going to yard
with<00:03:47.200> him<00:03:47.319> like<00:03:47.620> four<00:03:47.920> days<00:03:48.129> for<00:03:48.670> another<00:03:48.760> four

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
with him like four days for another four

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.520 
with him like four days for another four
days<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.659> thought<00:03:49.750> they'd<00:03:49.989> be<00:03:50.019> really<00:03:50.140> handy

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
days so I thought they'd be really handy

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.809 
days so I thought they'd be really handy
and<00:03:50.920> there<00:03:51.040> definitely<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.519> for<00:03:51.640> example

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
and there definitely is for example

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.789 
and there definitely is for example
applying<00:03:52.360> oil<00:03:52.569> so<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.260> end<00:03:53.379> of<00:03:53.620> my

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
applying oil so this is the end of my

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.830 
applying oil so this is the end of my
spring<00:03:54.099> makeup<00:03:54.640> essentials<00:03:54.879> video<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.569> really

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
quality is obviously a lot better in

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.199 
quality is obviously a lot better in
this<00:03:59.170> video<00:03:59.440> but<00:03:59.890> it<00:04:00.160> will<00:04:00.370> go<00:04:00.549> back<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.790> being
