00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
the reason I really don't know why the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.370 
the reason I really don't know why the
reason<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.180> people<00:02:34.569> think<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.959> collateral

bad<00:02:35.680> for<00:02:35.920> us<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.239> really<00:02:37.420> about

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
bad for us you know it is really about

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.300 
bad for us you know it is really about

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
free radicals aartiyan that is really

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.780 
free radicals aartiyan that is really
the<00:02:41.410> cause<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.739> lot<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.459> lot<00:02:42.640> of

the cause a lot of a lot of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.330 
the cause a lot of a lot of
cardiovascular<00:02:43.299> issues<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.350> don't<00:02:45.190> worry

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
cardiovascular issues so don't worry

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.309 
cardiovascular issues so don't worry
about<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.910> eggs<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.450> eggs<00:02:46.480> are<00:02:46.750> fine<00:02:46.959> for<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
about the eggs the eggs are fine for you

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.280 
about the eggs the eggs are fine for you
we're<00:02:47.530> going<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.739> look<00:02:47.860> exactly<00:02:48.239> why<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:50.260> need

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
we're going to look exactly why you need

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.199 
we're going to look exactly why you need
the<00:02:50.739> whole<00:02:50.980> egg<00:02:51.190> vs<00:02:52.180> egg<00:02:52.360> whites<00:02:52.600> alone<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:54.209> let

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
the whole egg vs egg whites alone so let

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.110 
the whole egg vs egg whites alone so let
me<00:02:55.330> just<00:02:55.480> give<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.780> an<00:02:55.840> idea<00:02:55.930> here<00:02:57.120> protein

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
me just give you an idea here protein

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.820 
me just give you an idea here protein
right<00:02:58.450> that's<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.870> big<00:02:59.049> reason<00:02:59.080> people<00:02:59.739> like

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
right that's the big reason people like

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.680 
right that's the big reason people like
to<00:03:00.040> know<00:03:00.160> their<00:03:00.280> egg<00:03:00.400> whites<00:03:00.640> I'm<00:03:01.420> just<00:03:01.540> going

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
to know their egg whites I'm just going

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.240 
to know their egg whites I'm just going
to<00:03:01.750> do<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.049> stats<00:03:02.319> your<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.709> again<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.099> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
to do some stats your this again this is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.589 
to do some stats your this again this is
based<00:03:03.549> on<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:04.510> USDA<00:03:05.049> nutrient<00:03:05.860> database<00:03:06.599> so

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
based on the USDA nutrient database so

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.710 
based on the USDA nutrient database so
this<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.840> obviously<00:03:07.989> kind<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.500> big

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
this is obviously kind of a big

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.339 
this is obviously kind of a big
encyclopedia<00:03:10.720> of<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.049> Ministry<00:03:11.290> of

encyclopedia of all the Ministry of

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.800 
encyclopedia of all the Ministry of
breakdowns<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.920> pretty<00:03:12.099> much<00:03:12.190> all<00:03:12.340> food<00:03:12.810> and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
breakdowns is pretty much all food and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.440 
breakdowns is pretty much all food and
in<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.680> typical<00:03:15.040> egg<00:03:15.220> you're<00:03:15.910> looking<00:03:16.269> at<00:03:16.359> about

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
in a typical egg you're looking at about

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.050 
in a typical egg you're looking at about
six<00:03:16.870> grams<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.380> protein<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.060> fifty-seven

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
six grams of protein and fifty-seven

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.580 
six grams of protein and fifty-seven
percent<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.540> protein<00:03:19.930> will<00:03:20.049> be<00:03:20.140> found<00:03:20.410> in

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
percent of the protein will be found in

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.050 
percent of the protein will be found in
the<00:03:20.650> egg<00:03:20.799> whites<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> other<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:22.000> know

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
the egg whites and the other you know

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.940 
the egg whites and the other you know
forty<00:03:22.630> three<00:03:22.870> percent<00:03:22.989> will<00:03:23.470> be<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.769> egg

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
forty three percent will be in the egg

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.530 
forty three percent will be in the egg
yolk<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.579> if<00:03:24.670> you're<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:24.970> eating<00:03:25.090> egg<00:03:25.299> white

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
yolk so if you're just eating egg white

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.880 
yolk so if you're just eating egg white
or<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:25.870> getting<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.170> little<00:03:26.380> bit<00:03:26.530> more<00:03:26.620> than<00:03:26.829> a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
or just getting a little bit more than a

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.110 
or just getting a little bit more than a
half<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:28.209> protein<00:03:28.690> in<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.850> other<00:03:30.850> than

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
half of the protein in that a other than

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.750 
half of the protein in that a other than
that<00:03:31.269> you<00:03:31.630> know<00:03:32.280> ninety-nine<00:03:33.280> percent<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.700> the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
that you know ninety-nine percent of the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.460 
that you know ninety-nine percent of the
fact<00:03:34.000> is<00:03:34.269> found<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.780> egg<00:03:34.870> yolk<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.290> that's

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
fact is found in the egg yolk and that's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.099 
fact is found in the egg yolk and that's
where<00:03:35.650> people<00:03:35.890> have<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.340> no<00:03:36.459> problem<00:03:37.109> but

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
where people have you no problem but

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.830 
where people have you no problem but
again<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.799> good<00:03:39.250> right<00:03:39.700> most<00:03:40.239> fats<00:03:40.600> are

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
again that is good right most fats are

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.840 
again that is good right most fats are
good<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.650> know<00:03:41.739> some<00:03:41.980> are<00:03:42.100> not<00:03:42.220> some<00:03:42.519> animal

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
good you know some are not some animal

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.120 
good you know some are not some animal
fats<00:03:43.060> are<00:03:43.239> not<00:03:43.359> great<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.859> beautiful

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
fats are not great but the beautiful

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.849 
fats are not great but the beautiful
thing<00:03:45.310> about<00:03:45.430> egg<00:03:45.790> yolks<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.709> they

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
thing about egg yolks is that they

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.330 
thing about egg yolks is that they
contain<00:03:48.600> DHA<00:03:49.600> which<00:03:50.200> is<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.470> form<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.859> omega-3

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
contain DHA which is a form of omega-3

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.460 
contain DHA which is a form of omega-3
fatty<00:03:51.579> acid<00:03:52.030> which<00:03:52.540> is<00:03:52.569> actually<00:03:52.870> very<00:03:53.079> very

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
fatty acid which is actually very very

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.979 
fatty acid which is actually very very
good<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.489> know<00:03:54.609> brain<00:03:55.269> function<00:03:55.840> and
