00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello everyone, Sasha today I want 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 show here is such a beautiful pig 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.660
 from minecraft she went out and made just 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.120
 huge size like this you can see 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.449
 so here I am holding it in my hands and this 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.680
 here it is straight even here so lively and 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.210
 bacon straight just stripes on it I them 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
 specifically made so big even with 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.260
 baby not big belly started thinking that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.359
 it will be a dog but a method so therefore 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.140
 I decided that it would be very pig 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.100
 like a pig 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.079
 that's it but she painted and completely 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.480
 it may be red big 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.910
 divorces she was very ugly and when 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.739
 there were no such stripes here 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 here it was all very ugly 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.300
 it is still very beautiful on stripes 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 all more or less so brighten 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.270
 all this is ugly time with 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.520
 paints so perfect that's probably 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.070
 it is impossible that it was exactly like 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 would it be so maybe pupper hall spit 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 colored paper I do not know in general here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.820
 so completely painted but not for long 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.220
 so stood on this video for a long time was not 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 because somehow I did not have time 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.640
 did not have time and hoped 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.180
 This thing is literally when there is a couple 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 days ago 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.369
 these stripes and everything finished 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.100
 marigolds painted and immediately it can 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.740
 be like in the original swing everything is here 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.560
 here is also a period of mouse all that you 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.290
 clearly visible and tried to set up so 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.079
 so that the light falls normally and yes here 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.150
 tail as you can remember if 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.770
 increased my previous video I did this 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.799
 pig in a small paper 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.710
 by the way here are the peasants compare small now 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.380
 I'll take it neatly what size 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.180
 just what she is huge because 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 into the skin of the world and how much of it to us 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.520
 length height here see the channel just 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.640
 the greatest is the back you put 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.900
 set and see no now this is not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.610
 it is seen 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.620
 put in here, see what this 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.940
 piggy what is piggy compared to 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.890
 she just made a huge difference I said 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.290
 what's wrong did the tail on 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.110
 the original of the mumps is the opposite is true 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.700
 but when I thought to do in this grid 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.730
 Everything is fine, but when I started to paint 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.260
 In general, I also redrawn and only 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.650
 When I painted, I understood that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.490
 tail again in the wrong direction 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.410
 twisted around her but I think it is not 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.180
 the big problem is somehow find nobody 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.290
 probably not paying attention except me 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.240
 so everything is right in it all rollers 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.580
 dots all just like in that 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.430
 piggy here by the way here came out 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.140
 a bit darker because i'm not this 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.510
 connection I did not end 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.459
 were i finished the card pink 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.020
 the paint that's what's beautiful here 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.540
 I had to mix colors to 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.730
 get more or less pink in principle 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.590
 to pink it looks like because like 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.470
 too, the feature is far from mega looks 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.320
 just fine this damn i did 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.510
 especially here do not be stupid. 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.250
 here everything is solid here 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.260
 Here is a little penny and so 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.209
 these are precisely the colored squares 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.900
 it has not become an object already it is very much 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.489
 marafet he doesn't know many many hours and 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.519
 days to kill it all to decorate 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.489
 squares and such a holistic mumps and 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:28.100
 with stripes could be their ears 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.709
 on both sides as well as here all 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.560
 diesel water dripped as well as 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.140
 here in general is all right 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.100
 I took as if one gives a square in one 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.830
 pixel per centimeter here and everything 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.840
 she came out now and even as I am 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.160
 and 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.879
 Kirill namely from the beginning you are now 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 I will attach 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.849
 and until the very end it turns out but 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.680
 See how much 24 centimeters 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.629
 it turns out plus minus a few 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.390
 millimeters 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:04.209
 24 centimeters all mumps that is from 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.629
 wear without his snout is here 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.480
 and before zhopki 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:14.769
 in width i am not a sign in on in width 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:18.160
 how many are here 10 centimeters here 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:21.030
 notice lived a little 42 and 32 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.680
 crooked no exactly just seen 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.050
 parted here in general yes it is exactly 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.060
 ten centimeters seemed to think 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.120
 under pixels by squares by this 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.910
 just like here and sweep 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.220
 I myself did not take it is the court that 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.950
 sweep the scheme I drew myself umbrella 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.840
 Pig opened in the game and somehow 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.010
 tried to run around her 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 count how much there is not much 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.800
 square so she came out in general so 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.510
 real here is one brigade nose by her on 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.200
 Piglet that is, they can be seen 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.910
 centimeter precisely and that is how it would be 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.130
 see what you can after what 's all 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.190
 centimeter the coolest look from 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.470
 ordinary eyes they are so expressive 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.780
 little curves on expressive and for her 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.270
 that's how good she looks like 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.639
 Brazil mordashki not know on daughter 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.289
 probably leave so bright though to me 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.419
 I like it so light I already think it 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.610
 Do not repaint, I think that I piggy 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.530
 Already completed and she fell away a little 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.050
 paw all right now they're a little 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.660
 shorter crooked stuck on it 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.910
 understandable because of the fact that 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.889
 painted water a lot of it went here as if on 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.810
 paint to dissolve so that it does not exist 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.389
 such straight dark because right here 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.820
 Here is very dark despite the fact that I 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.280
 I painted pure pink I did not mix 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.000
 colored hours pink little here to learn 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.760
 I have already mixed colors 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.340
 a lot of water and paper bent in principle 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.919
 it may well be seen it is not very 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.880
 noticeable difference any paper from water 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.900
 this is understandable and 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.720
 normal process and so here you are 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.880
 what is here as always on paper models 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.150
 here in the same way she is shorter too 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.170
 arched if I did not work that with 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.000
 paws I even probably turned out here 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.610
 they somehow stand differently for me 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.100
 degree I pushed the front screw 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.980
 rear developed and rear here 4 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.530
 act exactly the same here put on 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.920
 Guy 0 Pig here two legs next 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.480
 just come front and 2 back too 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.790
 near and also stand 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.980
 speaking they brought on centimeter i 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.200
 it didn’t have me on you all this 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.620
 I wondered what I could stick 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.500
 exactly stuck like a relatively 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.510
 it looks good and it is worth it 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:43.900
 also quite worthy everything is visible like this 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.610
 But in general, this is all I think will be soon 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.690
 many issues on paper 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:52.780
 minecraft I have some new 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.570
 ideas on you can here time wall 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.520
 he and he, too, think to do exactly no 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:01.750
 imprint and draw but it is already 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.400
 will be in time so everything to everyone 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:09.390
 thank you for your attention subscribe to 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.390
 channel put likes like everybody thanks and bye
