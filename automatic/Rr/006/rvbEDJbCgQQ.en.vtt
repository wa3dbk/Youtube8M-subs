00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hi everyone, this video lesson I made her to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.890
 order more a video lesson about the bike 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.349
 today 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.389
 usually those who bought motog 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.610
 found neither in the file manager 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.420
 but it does have a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.369
 files 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.050
 although in its very good manager 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.779
 but he does have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 Now I'll show you yours. 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.029
 go to your cell phone's desktop 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.510
 you will click here under you 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.809
 will look for the application that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.520
 flame is the green confins in green 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.250
 yellow and blue you will click 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 in it the first moment will not open the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.960
 folders option the own option 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.899
 application is you see this little folder to 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 a click up here you see these 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.469
 three dots give a click go in 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 settings 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 note that was unchecked these two 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.520
 then you will mark the option 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 display advanced device and view 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 file size 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.180
 after marking these two options you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.549
 come back, you can see it's on the side 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.030
 sd card internal storage 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.260
 here you can access your 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.130
 phone everything on your phone 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.830
 you can open can you read and you? 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.509
 can also access what is in the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.590
 your sd card 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.090
 You can access and see only what to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.030
 me this app is of no use 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 because you need to have ruth to have 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.280
 full access to your folders, ie you 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.320
 can not delete can not move 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.930
 nothing if you do not have the last cell phone 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.710
 and when I do not like ruth 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.200
 so the best option is to install 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.229
 other and file manager 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.689
 for that, just pre-history argentina 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.759
 hugo play as you prefer 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.579
 here we will look for a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.590
 file manager or the people 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.180
 will type that on the top of the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.360
 search 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.819
 the file manager there goes 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.600
 appear several options here you choose 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.330
 Which one did you want to download? 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.630
 and then downloaded installs on your 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.000
 phone and I pretty much like itself is 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.360
 this son and explore it is very good that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.580
 this blue here but there are several others 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.610
 your choice you test what you 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.430
 to like you stay lately i was in 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.680
 a look that I need from him that is called 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.180
 Hi, man, this is the folder's and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.460
 yellow here 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.580
 I can access all the files in the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:44.040
 my phone even without ruth here I 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.280
 I can move photos with you 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.510
 delete with you copy then I 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.110
 I'm particularly liking that it was 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.880
 steady managem I 'm still testing and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.830
 when I needed it on another 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.470
 application came to me for two 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.080
 things to manage my cell phone for 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.180
 use in another application that I have 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.120
 but you can choose what you want 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.250
 For me, the one that is very good and I do not 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.620
 I know why this file manager 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.040
 living on the cell phone 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.690
 do not let them manage do not let people 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 change the pay or anything unless the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.860
 people have ruth 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.150
 Unfortunately I do not have why this 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.190
 stamp is 16 gigabytes of internal memory and 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:31.000
 can card up to 32 gb 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.820
 so it's stupid to do ruth in him and 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.920
 lose the guarantee at least in the next 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.380
 year two years, especially when the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.640
 people make that extended warranty that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.530
 it was my case 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.540
 you will lose the warranty simply 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.440
 to make ruth because to fill the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.180
 16GB memory is considerable 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.680
 little then it is not advisable to do 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.470
 ruth on the bike g-16 say so far is the 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.640
 same thing you bought that new one 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.140
 motomax that left the motorola 32 gb and 64 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.270
 gb 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.270
 if you get a cell phone from that do 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.110
 routine to be well defeat even now 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.270
 after a year or two he has already lost 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.260
 the warranty may even try to risk more 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.510
 I do not know 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.320
 while I 'm satisfying myself with 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.000
 16gb great otherwise I see that 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.740
 Thank you guys, I hope you guys 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.600
 have taste 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.030
 any doubt or anything that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.050
 you want to know about the second motogp 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.390
 generation 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.730

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.730
