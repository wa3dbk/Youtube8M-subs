00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.480
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 a partner plugin programmer today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.020
 I'll show you how she got huge items 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.900
 Maybe we can do that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 that the server knows with the big bed 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.990
 or something that floats easily in the air 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.939
 and that's exactly what I want you to do today 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 Show I have the player plug in Miami 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 already prepared the command needed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 not I've already prepared and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 as well as mine and yes, too 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.890
 implemented the lister respectively 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.760
 registered and I would start at 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.770
 with a new function public of 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 far and then we prepare ourselves first 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.520
 the function in front of the stack and ours 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.219
 location or location we pass 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.649
 at the beginning location location so come on 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.219
 is our designer for this 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.930
 function we import the right one 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.260
 and we need to work with that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.650
 a giant name already said that with the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.650
 three equal location points world on 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.909
 location client class so want it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 we have a joint on ours 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.810
 desired location giant scores 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.880
 equipment item in hand then sets that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 item from this client in ours 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 certain item the whole thing works 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.280
 namely with a client in breath in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.770
 has the hand and is invisible 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.650
 giant scores push effect jo-jo effect 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.460
 Porsche effect point in visibility 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.920
 comma integer and then comes max value 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 that is the size of the largest possible 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 integrated registered with this 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.200
 drank for an infinite amount of time 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 is quite simple with the strength 9 99 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.549
 that he is invisible and therefore for 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.380
 always so he would only be on the 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.790
 ground and the item could work 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.100
 not be in the air , respectively 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.079
 higher in the air than the giant big one 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.400
 and to work around that now 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.120
 a poor ostend holder equal 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.520
 we want that as well as our giant 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:17.660
 only a doctor took wars fans so 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.800
 and then we have to be here at ours 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.960
 holder set gravity if he does not 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 falls down and owner of sad know 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.970
 picture if so invisible and 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.400
 Now we just do folder 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.250
 passenger our giant with it the giant 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.530
 do not fall down on this arm 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.630
 ostend sits and thus not 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.120
 can move or just drop down like that 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.820
 the function is in principle already for it 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.610
 there to make our item spawn now 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.190
 we still have a function that this 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.550
 get item or jake and damage 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.830
 can 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:03:01.280
 public further damage entity damage event 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:06.590
 and then event.at ntt instance of giant 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.870
 then simply event.at dances true with it 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.480
 this contains no harm 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.769
 can block through for example or he 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.570
 is only invisible but can beat 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.060
 you can, for example, anyway so and 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.160
 Now we build it best 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.390
 Let's just take somebody for that 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:29.000
 some events that nico wendt player 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:31.130
 toxic event event point is never went 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.959
 So if he does not, that's just it 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.930
 call and then spontaneously that is 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.260
 series at the location event.at 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.410
 player of cat location of the players 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.620
 and as items we take away new tech 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.470
 material point bed we just take 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.760
 there will be a giant bed over the 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.130
 player of the bond that is now relative 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:59.480
 that means that the location is worthwhile 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:01.910
 and draw something abstract 070 that is 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.680
 that the giant 7 blocks under the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.049
 player respond will use it to open the bed 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.150
 the height of the player is about 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.410
 that will be a little bit higher now 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.170
 we can export and loden and 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.260
 if we nod now you are here 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.630
 the huge bed what we wanted 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.579
 you see it works flawlessly up 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.230
 Now the bed has it and if we have something else 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.570
 Not 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.860
 occupied it is now in the air 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.850
 is not falling down we can do that 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.900
 Do it again up here 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.610
 it really stays up here and yes 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.170
 you see it works fine 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.400
 we can do the old one too 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:40.290
 change to diamond shovel we want 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.780
 for example, have worked the same way 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:47.680
 We invite each other to nod and you see 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.520
 here is the diamond shovel the whole 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.950
 you can go back to the team 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.870
 see server in the lobby there it is 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.360
 just as you can also remove here 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.000
 items tags just take that 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.190
 decisive handed over to the 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.570
 function of the same is used i 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.590
 I hope the tutorial I liked 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.520
 and I hope you can do something with it 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.570
 I would start over one 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.350
 appreciation 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.350
 Until next time
