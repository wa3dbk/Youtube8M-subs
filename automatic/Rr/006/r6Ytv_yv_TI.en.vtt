perspective<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:58.350> shown<00:00:58.800> over<00:00:59.100> here<00:01:01.460> right

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
perspective is shown over here right

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.609 
perspective is shown over here right
here<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> red<00:01:04.110> violet<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.810> say

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
here in the red violet and it's from say

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.870 
here in the red violet and it's from say
north<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.340> east

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
north to east

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.320 
north to east
they're<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.799> two<00:01:11.010> vanishing<00:01:11.400> points<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
they're the two vanishing points so it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.560 
they're the two vanishing points so it
takes<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.860> space<00:01:14.360> this<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
takes in about that much space this is a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.270 
takes in about that much space this is a
two<00:01:15.750> point<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.259> coming<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
two point that's coming out of the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.520 
two point that's coming out of the
Renaissance<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.930> three<00:01:19.229> point

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
Renaissance and in three point

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190 
Renaissance and in three point
perspective<00:01:20.509> there's<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> couple<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
perspective there's a couple of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
perspective there's a couple of
different<00:01:22.619> three<00:01:22.830> points<00:01:23.310> here<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
different three points here but this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
different three points here but this
violet<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> three<00:01:25.200> point<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.920> see<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
violet is a three point you can see the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.700 
violet is a three point you can see the
page<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.490> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.000> curled<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.509> here<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
page just kind of curled up here and it

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.730 
page just kind of curled up here and it
comes<00:01:28.950> over<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.079> complete

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
comes over to here so it's a complete

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.050 
comes over to here so it's a complete
triangle<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.750> see<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:35.060> so

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
triangle that you see right there so

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
triangle that you see right there so
that<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.009> typical

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
that would be that would be a typical

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.640 
that would be that would be a typical
three<00:01:38.909> point<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.570> would<00:01:39.780> also<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.200> another

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
three point this would also be another

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.730 
three point this would also be another
three<00:01:41.009> point<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.490> above<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.229> were<00:01:43.560> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
three point up above if you just were to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.020 
three point up above if you just were to
take<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.280> top<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.740> north<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.189> over<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
take the top up here north and over to

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.620 
take the top up here north and over to
east<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.590> section<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.670> combine<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.420> two

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
east so that section you combine the two

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.249 
east so that section you combine the two
together<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.630> get<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.689> four<00:01:54.960> point

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
together and you get a four point

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.370 
together and you get a four point
perspective<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:57.210> another<00:01:57.630> type<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> four

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
perspective and another type of four

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.010 
perspective and another type of four
point<00:01:58.710> would<00:01:58.950> run<00:01:59.219> through<00:01:59.520> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
point would run through the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.499 
point would run through the
this<00:02:00.439> if<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.250> were<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.579> spin<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.210> pretty

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
this if you were to spin this pretty

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.160 
this if you were to spin this pretty
fast<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.229> cut<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.340> trough<00:02:04.990> through<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
fast and cut the trough through the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.580 
fast and cut the trough through the
center<00:02:06.500> like<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:07.030> it'd<00:02:08.030> be<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.239> cylinder<00:02:08.869> kind

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
center like this it'd be a cylinder kind

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.740 
center like this it'd be a cylinder kind
of<00:02:09.739> perspective<00:02:10.369> that's<00:02:10.519> another<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.060> call

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
of perspective that's another I call

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.680 
of perspective that's another I call
that<00:02:11.959> a<00:02:12.019> continuous<00:02:12.739> four<00:02:13.069> point<00:02:13.370> five<00:02:14.269> point

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
that a continuous four point five point

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.920 
that a continuous four point five point
is<00:02:14.989> like<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.440> orange<00:02:16.480> runs<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.810> way

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
is like the orange runs all the way

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.050 
is like the orange runs all the way
around<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.500> ball<00:02:18.680> divides<00:02:19.129> it<00:02:19.370> exactly<00:02:19.849> in

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
around the ball divides it exactly in

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.199 
around the ball divides it exactly in
half<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:22.069> would<00:02:22.250> be<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.400> typical<00:02:22.640> five

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
half so that would be a typical five

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.630 
half so that would be a typical five
point<00:02:23.540> perspective<00:02:23.900> you'd<00:02:24.860> get<00:02:25.069> a<00:02:25.099> half<00:02:25.370> of

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
point perspective you'd get a half of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.509 
point perspective you'd get a half of
the<00:02:25.790> sphere<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:26.480> have<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.500> little<00:02:27.709> one<00:02:28.190> point

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
the sphere I have the little one point

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.030 
the sphere I have the little one point
floating<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.239> middle<00:02:29.360> of<00:02:29.599> five<00:02:29.930> point<00:02:30.230> but

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
floating in the middle of five point but

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.520 
floating in the middle of five point but
it<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:32.319> fisheye<00:02:33.319> lens<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:35.450> type<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.200> thing

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
it bit of fisheye lens a type of thing

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.789 
it bit of fisheye lens a type of thing
but<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.250> six<00:02:37.489> point<00:02:37.819> then<00:02:38.120> is<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:39.319> point<00:02:39.620> on

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
but the six point then is the point on

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.030 
but the six point then is the point on
the<00:02:39.980> backside<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:42.140> makes<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.709> continuous

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
the backside and it makes the continuous

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.430 
the backside and it makes the continuous
scene<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:47.030> this<00:02:47.269> case<00:02:47.540> can<00:02:47.930> like<00:02:48.200> out<00:02:48.410> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
scene in this case can like out a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.670 
scene in this case can like out a
cityscape<00:02:49.480> I'll<00:02:50.480> show<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:50.930> throughout<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
cityscape I'll show up throughout the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.569 
cityscape I'll show up throughout the
whole<00:02:51.829> piece<00:02:52.989> so<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.230> was<00:02:54.470> a<00:02:54.500> study<00:02:55.099> in

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
whole piece so this was a study in

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.229 
whole piece so this was a study in
perspective<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.470> breakdown<00:02:57.920> breakdown<00:02:58.489> of
