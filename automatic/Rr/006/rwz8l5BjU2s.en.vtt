00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Well then, hello everyone today I will not 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.000
 speak so thoroughly about none of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.400
 devices that are now on the table 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 it will be a kind of announcement of what I am 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.750
 I plan to talk as soon as possible 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.340
 time but probably some things given 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.929
 a little more time a little less time 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 but I didn't think that more than three minutes is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.150
 The video will take Yes well, in general, how already 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 could be seen on this table 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.650
 there are only gadgets and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.510
 device accessories from sony to the planet 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.740
 in the next few days i will tell 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.090
 about sony smartex on ti3 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 generally smart tags from march where is that thing 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.719
 quite interesting myself and use everything 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 I recommend how to use just 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.410
 I'll tell you how long I got for my 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 favorite sony xperia z1 compact 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 for dock for charging and interesting stuff 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 I'll probably give him a few words too 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.870
 some kind of separate video of course 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.789
 the main unit will be about sony xperia z2 i 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.500
 I think because before this smartphone 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.989
 I got quite a long time ago 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 I have something to say so rather it 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.750
 there will be some kind of operating experience and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 news i think but everything else is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.290
 parts of the sound are stereo headphones 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.240
 sony bluetooth headset and save 80 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.250
 successor with 800 old 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.710
 headset caissone Erickson still 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 very very interesting thing i her 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.700
 listened listened to quite a lot 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.770
 amount of time naturally i think 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 that my hands will reach this very 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.030
 headsets tell exactly in 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 video format on your channel 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.710
 supported and optics nfc codec 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.689
 bluetooth form 8 pieces very very 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.869
 interesting but also accumulated in me 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.490
 several specific audio devices 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 I'll probably start with something simple and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.650
 help with the sony presentation to me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.259
 got 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.909
 sony mdr and x 310 and lpi i just 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.490
 was going to do something about them 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.320
 tell headphones for off used 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.579
 just they usually write for what 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.799
 data is recommended 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.590
 headset headphones are ordinary headphones 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.110
 mp3 ipod in windows well i.e. standard 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
 for the player they listened for a while on 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.439
 dinner like headphones on one side of the new 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.689
 in general, all the same as something more 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.670
 it’s probably worth it to say 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.129
 there are some full days sony on 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.920
 the channel is just awful some but 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.880
 nothing can be done sony i love 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.739
 and I myself have to reckon with it 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.580
 this is a headset called sony mdr 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.099
 x650 as I remember about very 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.989
 interesting listened to her long 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.540
 time I like it very much 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.330
 it is inexpensive that only 2 with something thousand 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.040
 rubles sound at least this money 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.980
 on exactly work out also tell 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.870
 detail and the largest representative in 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.380
 this video of the audio device from 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.170
 sony is sony mdr zx750 bn 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.080
 these are wireless stereo headphones too 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.510
 nfc this headset 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.850
 also overheard work work well 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.420
 like the same impression unnatural 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.610
 will share 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.049
 Well, honestly, I do not really understand 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.459
 how do I get that 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.950
 effective here is a huge amount 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.780
 devices on cione accumulates in May 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.790
 well as the criteria to accumulate, I still 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.530
 This is all used for different tasks as 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.709
 since I can tell the same as for 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.060
 what well and probably bluetooth headphones I 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.280
 for the most part will test 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.870
 talk about how they sound when 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.049
 sony smartphone interaction 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.700
 In this case, it is sony xperia z2 very 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.170
 A good smartphone will also need to be pro 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.820
 him something write it already something 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.900
 it hurts I somehow rolled up the last 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.920
 time impressions would be necessary 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.680
 really share 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.200
 Well, I will not try wired headphones 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.720
 Once the device yoghurt and of most in 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.970
 overall favorite meizu m3 quality 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.950
 sound produced by it by mobile standards 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.290
 Well, in general, it is beyond praise if 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.519
 songs take into account all sorts 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.070
 portable audio solutions 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.900
 which at a cost of 2 3 4 times 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.730
 surpasses that meizu mx3 itself 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.100
 so these are my plans for 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.930
 soon it is besides that 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.630
 Naturally it would be necessary to continue the story 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.030
 about lg g3 which is now in my hands 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.640
 but and so there are several stories that 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.180
 should go get development on the channel 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.200
 but I think that in a week I’m different 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.980
 scheduled just this time and 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.250
 get under control 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.620
 so don't switch everything yet 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.620
 as we can understand we will see
