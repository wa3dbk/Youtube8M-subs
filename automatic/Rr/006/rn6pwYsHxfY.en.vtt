 their home stations round token 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.630

 Top Four Equipment Cards Game 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.610
 consists of a series of rounds each of 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.060
 which is divided into five phases and in each 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.630
 phase 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.700
 players take turns in the event phase 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.430
 players do what is prescribed 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.860
 the current position of the round token is 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.439
 maybe getting attack resources 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.810
 monsters or even adopting a law in 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.119
 In this case, the first player opens 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.030
 top card in the appropriate pile and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.539
 read it out loud and then all the players 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.640
 vote for or against successfully accepted 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.430
 the law takes effect immediately and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.860
 replaces the previous phase 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.950
 mobilization players first pay 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.080
 Army maintenance is below 6 for free 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.880
 a more numerous army is needed 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 feed pork or she 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.540
 players will then run away 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.330
 new soldiers 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.010
 every army boost is worth one 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.890
 cartridge and one pig 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.350
 army phase can do one 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.530
 of the three actions you can attack any 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.690
 adjacent station except empty ones 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.640
 stations by the way can be ignored when 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.650
 counting neighbors because they 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.980
 calmly let in troops 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.260
 but no more than one at a time attacking 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.750
 neutral station player compares 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.840
 strength of your army with the top card in 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.900
 a deck of threats and attacking the faction station 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.150
 will have to fight with his army for any 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.840
 the battle between the players in battle is also 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.100
 used bonus cards combat deck 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.010
 shuffled and each player gets 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.680
 three pieces one card each 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.500
 hand is played in closed and then 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.310
 simultaneously opened and indicated on 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.990
 cards bonuses are added to the strength of the parties 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.810
 after a successful attack station you can 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.120
 attach putting your own badge on it 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.340
 but it will cost one mushroom and one 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.130
 pig in case of capture neutral 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.610
 stations or just one mushroom if you 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.850
 to select a station from an opponent by grabbing 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.400
 station player gets victory points 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.830
 giving them up loses but any player doesn't 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.650
 may be less than three stations and if 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.860
 this happens it will automatically capture 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.410
 new instead of attacking the army station 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.540
 can attack the hero then the strength of the army 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.270
 will be compared with the power of the hero and 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.310
 bonuses from his equipment if a hero 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.740
 lose he will lose one of the cards 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.490
 gear and go to home 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:03.010
 the station to heal wounds and finally the army 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.340
 can spend a move on mining one 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.650
 any resource chosen by the player 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.050
 Then comes the movement of the hero they 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.420
 more choice besides attacking 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.430
 another station or hero they can 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.950
 move around with on the map 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.230
 line station speeds 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.110
 the hero can either purchase any 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.540
 gear then cartridges one mushroom either 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.530
 for the same amount see two cards from 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.600
 decks of tasks leaving one of them 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.350
 such cards set special conditions and 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.990
 we get 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.790
 for their performance bonuses and also brings 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.340
 one victory point 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.740
 ibid on the ring character can 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.220
 exchange any number of resources one 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.070
 kind of 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.680
 on the same number of other resources and 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.230
 finally being at the neutral station 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.110
 the hero can reconnoiter he 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.000
 gets the top card from the threat deck in 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.550
 the next move the player can attack 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.190
 to the army map he has already studied or 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.370
 heroes either return it under not from the pile 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.830
 in the final phase first thing checked 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.320
 has anyone become the winner 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.200
 happens if player scored necessary 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.150
 for winning 10 points or grabbing all 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.630
 four policy stations 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.090
 if no one won the first 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.790
 the player passes his token to the neighbor on the left 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.750
 and the round token moves to the next 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:28.360
 division and it all starts again 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.280
 second edition of the desktop metro 2033 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.980
 became much more interesting and 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.660
 strategic than the first therefore if 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.190
 do you like the relevant 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.590
 Glukhov's work 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.590
 be sure to try this game
