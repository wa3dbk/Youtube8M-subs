well if you watch the Housewives for

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.899 
well if you watch the Housewives for
drama<00:01:39.720> between<00:01:40.049> women<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> lot<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
drama between women we have a lot of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.380 
drama between women we have a lot of
that<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.170> our<00:01:43.680> show<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.490> unique

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that so I think that our show is unique

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.139 
that so I think that our show is unique
because<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:46.020> one<00:01:46.079> show<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.250> three<00:01:47.970> or

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
because in one show you have three or

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.710 
because in one show you have three or
four<00:01:48.390> different<00:01:48.630> shows<00:01:49.110> combined<00:01:49.619> into<00:01:50.040> one

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
four different shows combined into one

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.569 
four different shows combined into one
all<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:51.930> I'm<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.049> curious<00:01:52.439> why<00:01:53.040> why

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
all right now I'm just curious why why

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460 
all right now I'm just curious why why
you<00:01:53.640> yourself<00:01:54.299> personally<00:01:54.810> decided<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.380> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
you yourself personally decided to be on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709 
you yourself personally decided to be on
