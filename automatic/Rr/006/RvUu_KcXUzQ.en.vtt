this<00:00:00.450> is<00:00:00.659> an<00:00:01.020> ex<00:00:02.899> 60-66<00:00:03.899> I<00:00:04.259> see<00:00:04.770> Asus<00:00:05.730> laptop

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
this is an ex 60-66 I see Asus laptop

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.669 
this is an ex 60-66 I see Asus laptop
black<00:00:07.080> screen<00:00:07.550> no<00:00:08.550> video<00:00:09.260> we're<00:00:10.260> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.530> go

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
black screen no video we're going to go

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.209 
black screen no video we're going to go
ahead<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:12.230> rework<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.469> graphic<00:00:13.830> chip<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
ahead and rework the graphic chip on the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.929 
ahead and rework the graphic chip on the
motherboard<00:00:15.619> actually<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:16.740> one<00:00:17.010> has<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:19.939> PCI

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
motherboard actually this one has a PCI

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.359 
motherboard actually this one has a PCI
card<00:00:21.260> which<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> separate<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> black

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
card which is separate from the black

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.019 
card which is separate from the black
motherboard<00:00:24.710> as<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:29.029> engineers

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
motherboard as you can see so engineers

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:52.140 
motherboard as you can see so engineers
opening<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:30.750> now

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.850 

there's<00:00:53.150> no<00:00:53.360> never<00:00:53.810> force<00:00:54.140> unless<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.710> know

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
there's no never force unless you know

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.530 
there's no never force unless you know
exactly<00:00:55.370> what<00:00:55.550> you're<00:00:55.730> doing<00:00:55.970> you<00:00:56.330> might

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
exactly what you're doing you might

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:18.860 
exactly what you're doing you might
break<00:00:56.780> something<00:00:56.840> without<00:00:57.290> knowing

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.580 

this<00:01:19.870> is<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.200> Nvidia<00:01:20.650> chip<00:01:22.050> which<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.080> causing

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
this is the Nvidia chip which is causing

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:33.850 
this is the Nvidia chip which is causing
the<00:01:23.680> problem

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.150 

okay

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:02:02.200 

what

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.110 

and<00:02:02.660> always<00:02:03.230> be<00:02:03.500> very<00:02:03.770> delicate<00:02:04.250> I'm<00:02:04.820> doing

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
and always be very delicate I'm doing

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.620 
and always be very delicate I'm doing
something<00:02:05.330> like<00:02:05.510> this<00:02:06.040> put<00:02:07.040> neat<00:02:07.580> leverage<00:02:08.330> on

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
something like this put neat leverage on

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.240 
something like this put neat leverage on
the<00:02:08.869> wrong<00:02:09.080> part<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.560> second<00:02:10.009> one<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the wrong part of the second one you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:21.589 
the wrong part of the second one you
could<00:02:10.399> split<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.880> half

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.369 

this<00:02:22.140> doesn't<00:02:22.530> always<00:02:22.680> come<00:02:23.310> off<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:24.230> when<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
this doesn't always come off but when it

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.589 
this doesn't always come off but when it
does<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.920> prefer<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.939> me<00:02:27.150> off<00:02:27.269> so<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
does you prefer it to me off so it

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:47.589 
does you prefer it to me off so it
doesn't<00:02:27.629> know

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:03:28.320 

closed

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.840 

so<00:03:29.330> chips

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
so chips

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.890 
so chips
show<00:03:31.030> results

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
show results

00:03:32.900 --> 00:04:18.620 
show results
perceive<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.890> heat<00:03:34.099> around<00:03:34.519> only
