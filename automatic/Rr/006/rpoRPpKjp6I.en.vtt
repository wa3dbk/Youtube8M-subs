00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 short video on the topic what it means 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.120
 not about your own circumstances too 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 Life 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.570
 For example, money can be your life 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.550
 make it easier if just a move 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.429
 is for example and you have money then 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.379
 You do not have to think how 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 I invite 20 of my friends to me 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.400
 help and so I pay the pizza 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 must and then help me in vain 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
 you do not have to think about where do I get 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.539
 you have to move boxes for free 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.849
 not even the cheapest transports 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.410
 somehow manage with 20 students 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.820
 discounts and so on and so forth 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 you can just call one 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.809
 Moving companies can say here 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.579
 that with the date you move and the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.070
 Do that for you is easy and you 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.930
 have time and energy, so to speak 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.980
 saved up 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.710
 on the other side it is natural 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 also probably money in life 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 from such a much bigger role 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.890
 will play in the course, too 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 accordingly does a lot for it and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.510
 accordingly much attention to that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.809
 theme money so dedicated he is such a thing 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 can afford , for example 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.899
 Lawyer will be much more time 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.670
 purely invest in his professional life 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.460
 run as someone much less 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.799
 money earned there is then just take 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.350
 the reputation and the career much more space 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.159
 one in the life and that means if you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 you look at the detail he needs more time and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.610
 invest more energy purely 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.140
 to have too much money at all with it 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.670
 then on the other side when it comes to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.380
 example, the move or something 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 save time and energy 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.159
 So if you both sides the arrival 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.320
 realize that probably so 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.920
 about as plus minus zero and what is 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.000
 is now the lesson behind the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.060
 lesson is that every kind of life to live 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.740
 no matter at what financial level 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.290
 okay is as long as you do not have yours 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 relationships on the left that means so if 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.130
 such a poor swallower normally 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.829
 Normally everything would save over 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.490
 would do it yourself and get through it 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.880
 would imagine 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.799
 and without money if 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.720
 who fell for his neighbor and 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.240
 Victory or after when ordered simply 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.630
 the company and he makes the to 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.160
 This great things and then wants this 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.730
 those poor gobblers, so to speak, will 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.140
 even then he would run the risk that he 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.300
 suddenly living beyond his means 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.480
 that he suddenly does something for him 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.180
 other useful up for the 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
 lawyers or whatever makes sense 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.620
 because he also just a lot of pure 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.240
 But there is something in his professional life 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.310
 for him actually about it at all 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.090
 makes no sense because there is the balance 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.209
 is not there, and funnily enough, the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.890
 a lesson we had before 2000 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.040
 years in the good old book 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.140
 have seen written down and the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.870
 Lesson means you should not desire 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.400
 your neighbor's body and so on and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.950
 immediately 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.700
 that is the lesson behind that is 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.459
 not that greed and stuff like that 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.920
 Sin is sunny if you like yours 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.660
 Neighbor was in demand or if you want that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.190
 car desired by a neighbor and so on 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.260
 that does not mean that you then 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.630
 it would sin somehow but it 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.580
 just means that one falls 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.250
 and if you get in there in this tapst 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.430
 fall if you let yourself be tempted 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.350
 that you would be unhappy then so it 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.570
 if you look to the neighbor and he drives 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.540
 an expensive car and you will now 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.890
 also even though you actually with a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.380
 for his circumstances the car is not 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.580
 need and can not afford you, you can 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.780
 not as much money have you you the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.010
 can buy car is my man should 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.350
 Do not buy anything from here 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.670
 could buy two things that is if 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.410
 someone could not afford two 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.370
 then to buy such cars that should I 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.690
 also do not shop and that one 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 side the other side is it you 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.080
 you need somehow with that 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.239
 Lawyer is such a doctor or is 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.540
 no idea maybe he needs 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.590
 should he meant to need it 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.030
 to be able to keep up with the colleagues 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.230
 maybe it's important in the circle 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.760
 maybe not 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.830
 that I only have one but definitely 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.420
 these are his relationships and not 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.230
 yours and you can not automatically 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.019
 watch may be 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.640
 that looks good and that's why 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.380
 must also have to have to look 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.440
 if it fits into your circumstances 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.669
 and that means this rule from the Bible 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.500
 that says there you should not desire 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.160
 yours 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.810
 neighbors so and so does not mean that 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.120
 no moral rule in the sense that 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.250
 you should be ashamed if you have a look 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.170
 as you covet something like that 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.930
 someone else has but that you then 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.970
 for a moment, it's natural to realize that 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.440
 I have this reaction have this envy 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.140
 that is exactly what it wants to have 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.430
 but it's a nasty fall if I am 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.500
 I have reached and when I am at it 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.330
 orient what other people have 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.250
 always giving people will have more 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.720
 as me and the bigger things have and 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.060
 have faster things and be more expensive 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.060
 as me and if I always feel like it 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.160
 I always get dissatisfied 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.380
 be with my life always i will 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.690
 never arrive then multimillionaire 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.490
 I can have a yacht and as soon as I have someone 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.240
 see bigger yacht has like us 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.450
 dissatisfied 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.530
 that means that there is a recipe around 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.000
 to be unhappy when I follow that 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.680
 and that's why the rule 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.500
 Thou shalt not covet your neighbor 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.510
 so and so that does not mean that you 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.919
 who go to hell when you are 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.210
 while doing ups, if you are jealous 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.490
 something up that just means you 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.470
 on the ground in hell, so to speak 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.940
 comes when you do that because you are 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.040
 never happy and never 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.130
 are satisfied with your circumstances 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.229
 That's why the big secret is with you 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.669
 Satisfied with his own circumstances 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.380
 to be and to say own 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.580
 to stand on conditions that means we 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.190
 can not afford it 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.630
 removal company is to pick 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.430
 perfectly fine if he has everything 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.330
 makes himself and if he has his own 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.460
 away and not ashamed 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.169
 that he is not at the same level 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.520
 plays along like the other one I mean 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.320
 Alone the word level is 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.290
 actually is actually wrong than 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.729
 advantage that it somehow a height and 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.800
 a low result so only 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.890
 different kinds and ways of life 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.590
 It is important to his 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.240
 own way to believe not on the 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.890
 to scare others and see what the 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.720
 and then want to be the same 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.240
 just because the others are like that because you 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.919
 wants to adapt but you have to 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.350
 always make the effort 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.150
 watch it fits now at all 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.890
 For me, that's just it 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.410
 right for me right now in this 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.440
 situation fits this to mine 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.550
 conditions in the end you will do 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.860
 Lanes are much better 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.629
 feel for you 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.150
 let yourself be much less stressed 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:37.840
 and you will be much happier too 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.400
 with what reaches so much for this 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.689
 video and I would suggest 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.689
 See you in the next video
