Potro<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.730> epic<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.750 
think he deserved the win and he played
an<00:00:57.960> excellent<00:00:58.260> match<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.070> if<00:00:59.160> he'd<00:00:59.280> Djokovic

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
an excellent match and if he'd Djokovic

really like Maurice chances at the US
Open<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.570> important<00:01:28.200> for

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
Open I think it was very important for

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
Open I think it was very important for
him<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> win<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.400> second<00:01:29.820> Grand<00:01:30.060> Slam<00:01:30.180> you

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
him to win the second Grand Slam you

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.469 
him to win the second Grand Slam you
don't<00:01:30.810> want<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> one-hit<00:01:31.470> wonder<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
don't want to be a one-hit wonder and I

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.480 
don't want to be a one-hit wonder and I
think<00:01:33.720> last<00:01:33.960> year's<00:01:34.200> US<00:01:34.380> Open<00:01:34.829> sort<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> was

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
think last year's US Open sort of was

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
think last year's US Open sort of was
his<00:01:35.700> first<00:01:35.970> break<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.420> run<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> grand<00:01:36.930> slam

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
his first break to run a grand slam

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.920 
his first break to run a grand slam
stage<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> release<00:01:38.540> heralded<00:01:39.540> his<00:01:39.630> arrival

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
stage that release heralded his arrival

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
stage that release heralded his arrival
he<00:01:40.380> did<00:01:41.220> play<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> australian<00:01:41.939> open<00:01:42.210> final

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
he did play the australian open final

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.030 
he did play the australian open final
but<00:01:42.960> lost<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.380> djokovic<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:45.390> could<00:01:45.570> have

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
but lost to djokovic and that could have

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.639 
but lost to djokovic and that could have
definitely<00:01:47.040> said<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> back<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:49.020> confidence

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
definitely said in back in confidence

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.130 
definitely said in back in confidence
because<00:01:50.430> there's<00:01:50.729> many<00:01:50.970> players<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.810> example

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
because there's many players for example

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
because there's many players for example
Andy<00:01:52.350> Roddick<00:01:52.680> there's<00:01:52.829> only<00:01:52.979> ever<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.280> 1

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
Andy Roddick there's only ever one 1

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
Andy Roddick there's only ever one 1
grand<00:01:53.729> slam<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.720> has<00:01:55.049> featured<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.619> finals

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
grand slam but has featured in finals

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
grand slam but has featured in finals
and<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:56.969> brandi<00:01:57.540> marie<00:01:57.689> was<00:01:57.899> very

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and I think brandi marie was very

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.319 
and I think brandi marie was very
important<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.860> past<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.280> hurdle<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.240> get

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
important to get past that hurdle to get

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.810 
important to get past that hurdle to get
the<00:02:00.509> second<00:02:00.899> Grand<00:02:01.649> Slam<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.009> think<00:02:02.189> now

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the second Grand Slam and I think now

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.880 
the second Grand Slam and I think now
having<00:02:03.270> won<00:02:03.420> two<00:02:03.689> grand<00:02:03.990> slams<00:02:04.110> he's<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.770> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
having won two grand slams he's going to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.789 
having won two grand slams he's going to
be<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> lot<00:02:05.520> more<00:02:05.579> confident<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.409> think<00:02:07.590> as

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
be a lot more confident and I think as

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.800 
be a lot more confident and I think as
well<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.489> pointed<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:08.910> Natalie<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.450> being

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
well as you pointed out Natalie it being

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.199 
well as you pointed out Natalie it being
a<00:02:09.899> historic<00:02:10.440> victory<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.489> him<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.760> all<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
a historic victory for him to all that

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760 
a historic victory for him to all that
pressure<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.810> he<00:02:12.900> faced

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
pressure that he faced

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.650 
pressure that he faced
as<00:02:13.830> now<00:02:14.130> off<00:02:14.490> his<00:02:14.760> shoulders<00:02:15.150> he<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.420> really

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
as now off his shoulders he can really

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.200 
as now off his shoulders he can really
relax<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.410> swing<00:02:16.500> freely<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.070> I<00:02:17.160> think<00:02:17.370> he's

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
relax and swing freely and I think he's

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.820 
relax and swing freely and I think he's
definitely<00:02:18.750> one<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.050> frontrunners<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.560> my

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
the tank so Djokovic has definitely come

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.590 
the tank so Djokovic has definitely come
close<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.160> winning<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:57.060> adding<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.540> his

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
collection of titles and this is a

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.850 
collection of titles and this is a
player<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.750> very<00:03:01.080> sensitive<00:03:01.530> about<00:03:01.680> his

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
player that is very sensitive about his

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.330 
player that is very sensitive about his
place<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> game<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.320> he's<00:03:04.320> he's<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> player

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
place in the game and he's he's a player

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.910 
place in the game and he's he's a player
that<00:03:05.550> wants<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:06.210> find<00:03:07.170> his<00:03:07.380> place<00:03:07.590> in<00:03:07.710> history

that wants to find his place in history

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.940 
that wants to find his place in history
I<00:03:08.340> think<00:03:08.430> alongside<00:03:09.200> federer<00:03:10.200> nadal<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.860> all

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
I think alongside federer nadal and all

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.740 
I think alongside federer nadal and all
the<00:03:11.070> previous<00:03:11.490> grades<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.360> came<00:03:12.570> before

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the previous grades that came before

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.890 
the previous grades that came before
them<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.560> he's<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> pair<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:15.120> only<00:03:15.450> comes

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
them so he's a pair that only comes

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.930 
them so he's a pair that only comes
through<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.230> Grand<00:03:16.440> Slam<00:03:16.940> tournaments

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
through the Grand Slam tournaments

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.670 
through the Grand Slam tournaments
looking<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.450> win<00:03:18.660> he<00:03:18.900> doesn't<00:03:19.170> come<00:03:19.290> there<00:03:19.500> to

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
looking to win he doesn't come there to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.580 
looking to win he doesn't come there to
just<00:03:19.950> factor<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.480> USA<00:03:21.750> will<00:03:22.110> be<00:03:22.260> played<00:03:22.470> on

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
just factor the USA will be played on

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.800 
just factor the USA will be played on
hard<00:03:22.770> court<00:03:23.190> which<00:03:23.940> plays<00:03:24.180> are<00:03:24.330> stronger<00:03:24.720> on

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
hard court which plays are stronger on

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.310 
hard court which plays are stronger on

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
only just to serve and a forehand he's

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.290 
only just to serve and a forehand he's
got<00:05:22.710> some<00:05:23.010> game<00:05:23.250> since<00:05:23.790> I<00:05:23.940> think<00:05:24.150> he's

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
got some game since I think he's

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.610 
got some game since I think he's
definitely<00:05:24.720> another<00:05:24.960> player<00:05:25.230> that<00:05:25.440> could

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
definitely another player that could

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.650 
definitely another player that could
factor<00:05:26.250> at<00:05:26.550> this<00:05:26.610> tournament<00:05:26.970> shake<00:05:27.390> up<00:05:27.540> the

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
factor at this tournament shake up the

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.750 
factor at this tournament shake up the
draw<00:05:27.870> I'm<00:05:28.530> not<00:05:28.710> sure<00:05:28.770> that<00:05:29.040> he<00:05:29.190> will<00:05:29.280> win<00:05:29.340> it<00:05:29.490> i

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
draw I'm not sure that he will win it i

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.700 
draw I'm not sure that he will win it i
think<00:05:29.790> that<00:05:30.120> requires<00:05:30.780> experience<00:05:31.230> because

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
think that requires experience because

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.620 
think that requires experience because
when<00:05:31.830> you<00:05:31.920> look<00:05:32.040> at<00:05:32.160> the<00:05:32.250> men's<00:05:32.430> game<00:05:32.630> there's

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
when you look at the men's game there's

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.270 
when you look at the men's game there's
only<00:05:33.750> only<00:05:34.170> been<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.470> handful<00:05:34.860> of<00:05:34.950> players<00:05:35.160> that

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
only only been a handful of players that

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.800

over the last 10 13 years almost so so

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.560 
over the last 10 13 years almost so so
be<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.830> long<00:05:41.130> shot<00:05:41.340> for<00:05:41.400> somebody<00:05:41.880> outside<00:05:42.090> of
