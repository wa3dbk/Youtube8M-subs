00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
will make it a little bit more difficult

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.760 
will make it a little bit more difficult
I<00:05:46.130> think<00:05:46.310> we'll<00:05:46.430> just<00:05:46.460> go<00:05:46.700> for<00:05:46.970> six<00:05:47.870> I<00:05:48.230> think

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
I think we'll just go for six I think

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.770 
I think we'll just go for six I think
six<00:05:49.310> will<00:05:49.490> be<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.640> very<00:05:49.970> difficult<00:05:50.360> challenge

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
six will be a very difficult challenge

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.960 
six will be a very difficult challenge
