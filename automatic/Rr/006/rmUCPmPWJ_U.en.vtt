00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.950
 and good afternoon 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.610
 how 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.860
 well as how do you know how to make roll 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.240
 the title the video says it all as 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.680
 observe our android processor not 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.310
 good 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.050
 and so 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 a little bit shy of a different color 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.660
 the screen 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 that does not matter is the failure of a small 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 recorder that I have but for the moment 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.900
 it's all I could get for 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 record this and good 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.610
 I will do everything to get it back ok 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.910
 Now what we are going to do is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.510
 enter our for our action 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.980
 google play 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.120
 with marketta 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:01.100
 this is for any android and there 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.590
 I will comment 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.940
 there is everything I need to 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.640
 download this that is completely 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.490
 free is the place thorne and they quote 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.880
 of credit card or anything and then for 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 start is called a control we can not 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.470
 load play store you can download 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.590
 also then the same link of the play 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.980
 they are and I'm going to leave them here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.390
 we can enter 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.110
 do not 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.110
 acp 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.110
 and we can find here our 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.460
 maximum frequency and our registration 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.860
 minimum current and here it is said required in 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.979
 the required you will come by 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.950
 default as it is in the current everything 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.130
 exactly the same 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.310
 but you can either diminish it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.310
 which would be very illogical 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.130
 or otherwise 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.130
 go up 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.030
 you can upload it to a certain 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.290
 amount for example my device 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.390
 from a 1,008 traveler a giga heart and 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.020
 half with the plate but I put it in 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.739
 two gigabytes that would enter audio in 1.2 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.099
 gigahertz that in theory would be 1,200 is 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.400
 a little bit faster not much 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.409
 after 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.450
 is what you need and can not 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:36.099
 find here also the minimum frequency 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.590
 here is 60 the minimum of all is 60 and the 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.349
 maximum then you 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.810
 can be increased can be increased in 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.560
 the minimum also and in the statistics 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 we can notice 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.290
 there are no figures show us the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.299
 frequencies in the five seconds that 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.439
 we have selected a frequency of no 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:02.940
 it's treated we've had it 300 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:06.390
 megahertz zero but yes 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.180
 and I know it is but I 'm in it 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.620
 Right 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.620
 the one that puts you maximum 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.540
 It is total because there the 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.700
 larger processes that can be in 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.700
 all cases would be the applications etc 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.110
 for example here we have a serious 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.670
 number of games 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.670
 and etc etc 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.790
 this application is third what can 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.760
 download anywhere to the play 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.840
 shank store 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:46.590
 black brand in portalet up toy from where 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.150
 be there is but it is those who have 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.890
 markets I do not know if it is already 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.569
 proseista already because they can download 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.960
 you are also in play store les 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.580
 I assure you it's okay to be 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:01.040
 and those who do not have two more because they do not 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.760
 is in apt and have also been 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.420
 also in forsythe were portals not 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.620
 they will come updated 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.620
 good this
