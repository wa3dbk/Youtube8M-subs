00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hi here is from or bio cook again 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 we are already promising today 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.470
 vegetable broth or vegetable salt das 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.480
 replaced 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.480
 in principle, euro in stent vegetable stock 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:25.410
 we need salt for our vegetable salt 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.899
 Celery some celery krÃ¼n here 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.750
 but also taken something from the shell 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.529
 that had washed thoroughly and then 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.949
 dried 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.260
 This can be done well in the vending machine 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.239
 It's worth it from such a middle garden 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.600
 But you can also go to the heater 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 or baking now does baking 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.339
 at 50 degrees and makes him a bit 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.830
 but that's not very important 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.360
 energy saving to the terror device or 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.680
 Heating is already to be preferred 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 then we have a long time and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.339
 also try the carrots easily 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.339
 dried then added 

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:07.920
 salt pretty much more salt nutmeg cloves 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.960
 and juniper 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.439
 all that comes to tenant lined 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.439
 just everything in 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.260
 May 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.260
 the fairy tales to it 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:32.130
 The spices nutmeg always a pinch 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 that just makes full-bodied taste 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.909
 in addition 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.260
 then I just take one of the ground 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.840
 corner is in itself very very 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.420
 vigorously holger vehren 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:49.619
 I like that I like it now 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:54.310
 goes in well and then the sea salt 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.020
 just top of the ratio 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.550
 I do that about after he finished it 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.229
 a part of herbs is mixed 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.110
 or vegetables it is here for 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.610
 part and a part as then that fits 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.119
 Of course, take more but more 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:14.170
 salt the more durable it gets but you are 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.329

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.450
 vegetable broth for you as vegetable broth as 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.299
 vegetable roll to use 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.190
 Super delicious that is pure nature 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.720
 By the way, this is great here 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.549
 upholstery misjudges that it is from the mathaf 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.730
 machata can be bombed very nicely 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.650
