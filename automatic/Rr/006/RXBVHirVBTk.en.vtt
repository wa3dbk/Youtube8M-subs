we did in the last lesson we're going to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.530 
we did in the last lesson we're going to
put<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> all<00:01:11.550> together<00:01:11.760> now<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.510> hand

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
put it all together now the right hand
goes<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.140> this

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.969 

the<00:01:20.850> siege<00:01:21.120> shop<00:01:22.040> in<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> left<00:01:23.400> bound

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:38.960 

again

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.120 

now<00:01:39.480> this<00:01:39.660> is<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.870> kind<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.200> turnaround<00:01:40.590> which

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
now this is the kind of turnaround which

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
now this is the kind of turnaround which
people<00:01:41.460> might<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.790> difficulty<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
people might have difficulty with it

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.240 
people might have difficulty with it
finishes<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.650> when<00:01:43.800> you<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.160> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
finishes like this when you go up to the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:56.929 
finishes like this when you go up to the
five<00:01:44.460> chord

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.660 

I'll<00:01:57.359> just<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.859> 5-quart<00:01:58.859> finish<00:01:59.399> again

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I'll just do that 5-quart finish again

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.099 
I'll just do that 5-quart finish again
because<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.420> where<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.869> most

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
because that's really where I think most

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:15.230 
because that's really where I think most
people<00:02:01.409> will<00:02:01.530> find<00:02:01.740> tricky<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.399> it's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:32.960 

a<00:02:15.320> little<00:02:16.320> bit<00:02:16.440> tricky<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.220> more<00:02:17.400> time

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.790 

now<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> can<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.440> put<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.680> all

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
now if you can do that and put it all

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.920 
now if you can do that and put it all
together<00:02:34.980> you've<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.670> boogie<00:02:36.090> woogie<00:02:36.540> so
