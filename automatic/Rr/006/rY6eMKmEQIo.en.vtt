00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:11.880
 Well, today I cut a small 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.559
 a piece of metal the bottom of the window has become 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.900
 much freer especially in terms of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.850
 going outside cut off a piece of fringe with 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.130
 internal threshold in order to be possible 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:29.849
 had to see another fringe 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:35.059
 Here is the metal that's bent 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:38.280
 metal is an internal metal rack 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.730
 visible stand at the bottom but also all 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.270
 fringe 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.870
 That's about as it all looks after 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.870
 big cleaning times 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:07.860
 here is so much dirt fell out of the threshold more precisely 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:11.680
 part of the mud and this part of the sidewall 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.030
 lost touch with the car in it lies 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.880
 a piece of cut metal here on this 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 holes put the slide bracket here it is 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.290
 there is a suspicion that the outer panel 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:34.290
 rocks have already changed because you can see such 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:42.270
 welding grubby pretty 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:47.370
 and here is this little corner close here 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.670
 this metal here it here it 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:56.480
 internal threshold passed here and that's what 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.480
 from it's left here is not stable 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.920
 We are now in such a state pakich at the left 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.920
 wheels 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:17.370
 This is how it looks like 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 present day
