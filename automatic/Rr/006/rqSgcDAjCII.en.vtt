around<00:01:15.560> immediately<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:17.070> gonna<00:01:17.220> cut<00:01:17.520> a

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
around immediately we're gonna cut a

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340 
around immediately we're gonna cut a
little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> inside<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.930> line

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
little bit on the inside of that line

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.520 
little bit on the inside of that line
and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.700> gonna<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> side

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and then you're gonna want to the side

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
and then you're gonna want to the side
I'll<00:01:26.280> test<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.729> again<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.020> it's

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
I'll test it again and see and it's

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.780 
I'll test it again and see and it's
still<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> little<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.130> bigger<00:01:29.369> than<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.610> I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
need so I'll keep trimming it down until

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.749 
need so I'll keep trimming it down until
I<00:01:32.159> get<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.540> to<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.689> size<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.320> need<00:01:34.700> now<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
glass so that there aren't any

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
then we want to work on a surface that

you'll be able to peel it off of then

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
you'll be able to peel it off of then
you're<00:02:26.730> gonna<00:02:26.850> squish<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.750> down<00:02:29.870> right<00:02:30.870> onto

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you're gonna squish it down right onto

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.040 
you're gonna squish it down right onto
the<00:02:32.370> paper<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.660> it's<00:02:34.260> cloudy<00:02:34.680> right<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:36.050> but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the paper and it's cloudy right now but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.910 
the paper and it's cloudy right now but
the<00:02:37.200> Mod<00:02:37.410> Podge<00:02:37.680> will<00:02:38.160> dry<00:02:38.790> clear<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:40.410> what<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
the Mod Podge will dry clear so what you

the Mod Podge will dry clear so what you
are<00:02:41.160> going<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.430> do<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.940> put<00:02:42.240> some<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.870> back

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.619 

the<00:02:50.560> only<00:02:50.739> tip<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.129> really<00:02:51.159> have<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.299> is

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
the only tip I really have for this is

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.839 
the only tip I really have for this is
that<00:02:52.709> sometimes<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:54.010> paper<00:02:54.219> will<00:02:54.489> stretch<00:02:54.819> a

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
that sometimes a paper will stretch a

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.610 
that sometimes a paper will stretch a
little<00:02:55.090> bit<00:02:55.359> you<00:02:55.569> just<00:02:55.780> never<00:02:55.900> know<00:02:56.170> what<00:02:56.379> the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
little bit you just never know what the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.220 
little bit you just never know what the
paper<00:02:56.859> that<00:02:57.099> you're<00:02:57.250> using<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.540> if<00:02:58.599> it<00:02:58.719> does<00:02:58.930> if

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
paper that you're using so if it does if

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.839 
paper that you're using so if it does if
you<00:02:59.379> know<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.650> trim<00:02:59.890> it<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.280> hair<00:03:00.310> bit

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
you know if you trim it just a hair bit

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.449 
you know if you trim it just a hair bit
smaller<00:03:01.209> than<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.959> glass<00:03:02.230> then<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.250> should

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
smaller than the glass then you should

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.059 
smaller than the glass then you should
be<00:03:03.640> good<00:03:03.849> so<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.629> want<00:03:04.780> to<00:03:04.900> seal<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.230> edges<00:03:05.739> of

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
be good so you want to seal the edges of

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.509 
be good so you want to seal the edges of
the<00:03:06.129> paper<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:08.530> might<00:03:08.680> want<00:03:08.920> to<00:03:08.980> do<00:03:09.099> two<00:03:09.400> or

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
the paper you might want to do two or

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.569 
the paper you might want to do two or
three<00:03:09.760> more<00:03:09.879> coats<00:03:10.209> as<00:03:10.450> this<00:03:10.840> dries<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.620> then

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
three more coats as this dries and then

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.319 
three more coats as this dries and then
just<00:03:12.790> lay<00:03:13.000> it<00:03:13.209> face<00:03:13.930> down<00:03:13.989> overnight<00:03:15.120> or<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.150> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.460 
right onto there I want to make sure
there's<00:04:32.030> enough<00:04:32.090> glue<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.020> bail<00:04:33.170> bond

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
there's enough glue and the bail bond

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.110 
there's enough glue and the bail bond
dries<00:04:34.220> perfectly<00:04:34.820> clear<00:04:36.730> and<00:04:37.730> if<00:04:37.850> you<00:04:37.970> don't

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
dries perfectly clear and if you don't

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.780 
dries perfectly clear and if you don't
think<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.420> have<00:04:38.570> quite<00:04:38.930> enough<00:04:39.490> put<00:04:40.490> one<00:04:40.640> more

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
think you have quite enough put one more

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.440 
think you have quite enough put one more
on<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.220> well<00:04:43.370> bond<00:04:43.610> dries<00:04:43.880> clear<00:04:44.120> so<00:04:44.240> you

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
on and the well bond dries clear so you

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.700 
on and the well bond dries clear so you
don't<00:04:44.690> have<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:44.960> worry<00:04:45.140> about<00:04:45.290> anything

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
don't have to worry about anything
