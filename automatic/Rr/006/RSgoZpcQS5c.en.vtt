00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.009 
to a flat here and then F then a flat
now<00:02:14.940> there's<00:02:15.120> lots<00:02:15.299> of<00:02:15.420> skips<00:02:17.390> may<00:02:18.390> think<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
now there's lots of skips may think I

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.530 
now there's lots of skips may think I
can't<00:02:19.349> play<00:02:19.530> skips<00:02:19.860> yes<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.640> because<00:02:21.239> you

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
can't play skips yes you can because you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.449 
can't play skips yes you can because you
don't<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.019> stretch<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.500> reach<00:02:22.709> it<00:02:23.010> we've

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
don't have to stretch and reach it we've

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.180 
don't have to stretch and reach it we've
got<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.090> really<00:02:24.360> big<00:02:24.630> hand<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.950> can

got a really big hand so I can I can

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.059 
got a really big hand so I can I can
reach<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.750> still<00:02:28.349> don't<00:02:28.500> try<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.799> reach

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
reach it but I still don't try to reach

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.680 
reach it but I still don't try to reach
a<00:02:29.190> night<00:02:29.340> around<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.459> play<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.849> D<00:02:33.000> laminin

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
a night around so play the D laminin

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.430 
a night around so play the D laminin
move<00:02:34.260> your<00:02:34.470> wrist<00:02:34.680> up<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:36.110> move<00:02:37.110> your<00:02:37.200> wrist

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
move your wrist up here move your wrist

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.370 
move your wrist up here move your wrist
to<00:02:37.799> all<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> risk<00:02:38.640> as<00:02:38.970> many<00:02:39.209> things<00:02:39.450> are

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.930 

you<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.440> time<00:02:43.680> you<00:02:44.460> know<00:02:44.490> throw<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:44.880> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
you know time you know throw it a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.700 
you know time you know throw it a
football<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.480> say<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.020> all<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.320> risks

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
football you say it's all the risks

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.560 
football you say it's all the risks
playing<00:02:47.250> tennis<00:02:47.490> all<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> wrist<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.330> lot<00:02:48.480> of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
playing tennis all in the wrist a lot of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.950 
playing tennis all in the wrist a lot of
things<00:02:48.660> wrong<00:02:48.930> there<00:02:49.140> is<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:52.940> okay

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
things wrong there is so is this okay

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.090 
things wrong there is so is this okay
now<00:02:54.960> you're<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.380> do<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.620> pattern

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
now you're going to do that pattern

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.150 
now you're going to do that pattern
that's<00:02:56.220> pattern<00:02:56.610> one<00:02:57.230> here's<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.320> way<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.950> do

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
that's pattern one here's the way to do

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.600 
that's pattern one here's the way to do
it<00:02:59.190> pattern<00:02:59.820> one<00:03:00.000> goes<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.240> time<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:00.900> 2<00:03:01.080> times

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
it pattern one goes to time so 2 times

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.060 
it pattern one goes to time so 2 times
12<00:03:05.120> now<00:03:06.120> we're<00:03:06.240> going<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.510> pattern<00:03:07.070> 22

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
12 now we're going to do pattern 22

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.890 
12 now we're going to do pattern 22
times<00:03:08.310> as<00:03:08.490> well<00:03:08.610> what's<00:03:08.850> pattern<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.330> all<00:03:09.780> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
times as well what's pattern to all you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.220 
times as well what's pattern to all you
do<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.140> replace<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.740> D<00:03:10.890> flat<00:03:11.130> with<00:03:11.340> an<00:03:11.459> E<00:03:11.580> flat

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
do is replace the D flat with an E flat

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.449 
do is replace the D flat with an E flat
here<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.440> then<00:03:13.680> play<00:03:13.830> exactly<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.280> same

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
here and then play exactly the same

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.370 
here and then play exactly the same
thing<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.330> e<00:03:15.540> flat<00:03:15.690> goes<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.080> low<00:03:16.230> it

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
thing it's this e flat goes the low it

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.720 
thing it's this e flat goes the low it
looks<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.650> it's<00:03:16.800> above<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.100> D<00:03:17.370> flat<00:03:17.580> but

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
looks like it's above the D flat but

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.790 
looks like it's above the D flat but
it's<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.840> Heidi<00:03:19.080> Flint<00:03:19.410> but<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.620> right

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
it's this Heidi Flint but it's right

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.110 
it's this Heidi Flint but it's right
here<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.220> then

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.780 

yeah<00:03:27.840> now<00:03:28.170> we're<00:03:28.290> going<00:03:28.379> to<00:03:28.470> do<00:03:28.560> pattern<00:03:28.950> 32

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
yeah now we're going to do pattern 32

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.289 
yeah now we're going to do pattern 32
times<00:03:30.120> here's<00:03:30.870> pattern<00:03:31.200> 3<00:03:31.440> jinglun<00:03:32.190> so<00:03:33.030> you're

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
times here's pattern 3 jinglun so you're

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:54.020 
times here's pattern 3 jinglun so you're
new<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:41.220> then<00:03:41.580> we<00:03:41.700> do<00:03:41.849> pattern<00:03:42.269> 12<00:03:43.200> times<00:03:43.610> okay

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.180 

so<00:03:55.030> lots<00:03:55.750> more<00:03:56.050> in<00:03:56.140> there<00:03:56.290> it's<00:03:56.680> really<00:03:56.860> fun<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so lots more in there it's really fun to

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.240 
so lots more in there it's really fun to
fly<00:03:57.400> had<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.820> blast<00:03:58.390> learning<00:03:58.810> it<00:03:58.900> today<00:03:59.170> so

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
fly had a blast learning it today so

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.320 
fly had a blast learning it today so
there's<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.370> part<00:04:00.580> one<00:04:00.730> for<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.090> check<00:04:01.300> out

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330
