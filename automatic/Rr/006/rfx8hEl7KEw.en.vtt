anywhere it's just a really good feature
to<00:00:17.110> have<00:00:17.230> in<00:00:17.529> might<00:00:17.710> seem<00:00:17.920> confusing<00:00:18.250> but<00:00:18.910> once

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
to have in might seem confusing but once

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.650 
to have in might seem confusing but once
then<00:00:19.960> was<00:00:20.200> always<00:00:20.470> just<00:00:20.590> it's<00:00:21.369> just<00:00:21.520> sugar<00:00:22.419> to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
then was always just it's just sugar to

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.900 
then was always just it's just sugar to
be<00:00:22.779> true<00:00:22.960> ok<00:00:23.860> so<00:00:23.919> this<00:00:24.130> two<00:00:24.279> types<00:00:24.610> is

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
be true ok so this two types is

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.179 
be true ok so this two types is
automatic<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.480> manual<00:00:25.599> automatic<00:00:26.110> so<00:00:26.560> turn

seven the next day I'm not going to do

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.370 
seven the next day I'm not going to do
that<00:00:30.669> because<00:00:31.180> to<00:00:31.840> make<00:00:31.960> things<00:00:32.169> more

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
that because to make things more

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.440 
that because to make things more
difficult<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.489> I'm<00:00:33.579> scooting<00:00:33.790> manual<00:00:34.270> and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
difficult so I'm scooting manual and

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.049 
difficult so I'm scooting manual and
also<00:00:35.200> because<00:00:35.470> Manuel<00:00:35.770> seems<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.579> bit<00:00:36.730> more

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
also because Manuel seems a bit more

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.099 
also because Manuel seems a bit more
realistic<00:00:37.359> like<00:00:37.780> this<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:40.510> karma<00:00:40.899> doesn't

00:00:41.099 --> 00:00:41.109 
realistic like this it's karma doesn't

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.939 
realistic like this it's karma doesn't
only<00:00:41.260> have<00:00:41.469> to<00:00:41.620> be<00:00:41.710> realistic<00:00:42.660> ok<00:00:43.660> so<00:00:44.050> we<00:00:44.800> need

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
only have to be realistic ok so we need

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.040 
only have to be realistic ok so we need
a<00:00:45.100> load<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:45.910> my<00:00:46.030> interiors<00:00:46.449> that<00:00:46.660> i've<00:00:46.870> loaded

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
up my interiors test space this can be

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.759 
up my interiors test space this can be
in<00:00:49.480> any<00:00:49.600> house<00:00:49.839> I'll<00:00:50.199> ready<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.469> get<00:00:50.589> my<00:00:50.739> other

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
area so we need a lever and go to

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.430 
area so we need a lever and go to
activator<00:00:54.699> and<00:00:54.789> world<00:00:55.059> objects<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:56.230> can't

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
activator and world objects you can't

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.750 
activator and world objects you can't
use<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.589> static<00:00:56.890> one<00:00:57.159> I<00:00:57.190> don't<00:00:57.399> even<00:00:57.489> after

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
use a static one I don't even after

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.579
