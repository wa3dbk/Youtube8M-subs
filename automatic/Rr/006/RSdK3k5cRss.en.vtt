00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 and we all hope you will 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.879
 well no I 'm coming back today in a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.440
 video that will be a video tutorial hairstyle 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.960
 so that's the hairstyle I wore 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.820
 for my video and the sales and also on 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 a picture on instagram and you've been 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 many to ask me for a tutorial so 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.140
 on this hairstyle so in this video 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.720
 I will show you the basic hairstyle 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.460
 we'll say and some variations so 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 thought hairstyle I advise you not to 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.930
 not do them on too smooth hair and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.490
 outreau clean we'll say because all 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.560
 simply the hair is really going 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.059
 too much slip on the headband and this 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.860
 will not really be the same result 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.079
 So here I am doing it there on hair 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.329
 some waving to buckle when it will 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.370
 even a little better for the material there 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.739
 must already have of course a nbn it will be 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.920
 the main element and some 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.570
 elastic if possible for the suite and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.039
 so we started by placing the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.180
 headband simply on the head 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 so now we're going to take a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.649
 first wick that will come rolled up 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.079
 simply return from hezb n is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 according to the size in fact the roll will be 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.989
 more or less big so that's yours 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 to see but I take a wick 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.860
 we will say mean to continue there 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.439
 just repeat just 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.659
 the operation on the next wicks and 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 we continue to stop just before 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.259
 the ear so here it is already finished 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.490
 for the first time was red is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.490
 really very simple 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.490
 so now we'll go to the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.970
 second time were with another 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.970
 variant 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.840
 so it's just to repeat the 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.970
 same operation as just now for 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.540
 to get right behind the ears of 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.540
 two sides 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.679
 2 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 no 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.670
 and so this way too 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.380
 allow the fbi to stay in place 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.490
 because the hair of the blow go on the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.490
 to hold in it's handy 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.720
 all 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.099
 once arrived from both sides approximately 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.930
 behind the ears you can 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.569
 take an elastic to make you a 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 low ponytail to leave her 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:52.519
 behind to bring her back to the side that 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:54.140
 it's according to your taste third variant 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.390
 now we will be able to remove 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.280
 the elastic is always continue the 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.349
 same operation as earlier in 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.000
 winding the locks on the nber of 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.470
 two sides of the head by really going 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.470
 towards the back of the head 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 years 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.250
 2 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.530
 and we're going to wrap the wicks up 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.450
 really left more than a wick at 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.450
 middle so at the back of the head 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.530
 and here we can either stop there left 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:54.150
 hair like this or either resume 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.150
 our elastic and make a braid 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.909
 in braids you have the choice 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.830
 so to make a room very simple 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.689
 like that where as I showed you 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.789
 afterwards a braid made of wheat ears 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.860
 which for my part I prefer I find it 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.360
 more beautiful and for more details I 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.250
 advise you to go see tutorials 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.250
 really specialized on her 13.6 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.900
 we 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.220
 no 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.379
 and for a more beautiful effect I 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.819
 you advise shooting and a bit 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.559
 mesh of the truce it's really going to do 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:29.159
 a more natural effect and a more beautiful 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:31.199
 surrendered so here I hope this 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:32.459
 hairstyle and its variants your oral more 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.259
 I'm sure it's really something 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:36.270
 very simple I'm not really good 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.219
 in hairdressing and yet I get there very 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.679
 easily so do not hesitate to tell me
