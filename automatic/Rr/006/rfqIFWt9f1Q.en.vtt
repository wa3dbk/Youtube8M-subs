home<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.860> unit<00:02:03.250> so<00:02:03.429> right<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:03.789> way<00:02:03.970> we

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
home in the unit so right this way we

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.889 
home in the unit so right this way we
have<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:05.709> Ferengi<00:02:06.160> card<00:02:06.429> exchange<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:07.690> this

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
have the Ferengi card exchange is this

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.350 
have the Ferengi card exchange is this
like<00:02:08.140> an<00:02:08.649> ATM<00:02:09.160> machine<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:09.819> sort<00:02:10.060> of<00:02:10.119> like<00:02:10.240> an

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360

is what we've come up with well you'd

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.870 
is what we've come up with well you'd

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
need a large module like this to

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.030 
need a large module like this to
accommodate<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:26.079> habitability<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:26.950> the

crew I'll have a crew of four and

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.860 
crew I'll have a crew of four and
they're<00:03:29.799> gonna<00:03:29.859> be<00:03:30.040> up<00:03:30.130> here<00:03:30.359> not<00:03:31.359> only<00:03:31.540> 90

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
they're gonna be up here not only 90

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.870 
they're gonna be up here not only 90
days<00:03:32.079> some<00:03:33.010> experiments<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.639> we're<00:03:33.790> looking

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
days some experiments that we're looking

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.030 
days some experiments that we're looking
at<00:03:34.180> will<00:03:34.299> be<00:03:34.480> run<00:03:34.810> over<00:03:34.840> longer<00:03:35.260> periods<00:03:35.410> so<00:03:35.920> we

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
at will be run over longer periods so we

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.879 
at will be run over longer periods so we
need<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> crew<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.819> be<00:03:36.940> up<00:03:37.060> here<00:03:37.620> 180<00:03:38.620> days

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
need a crew to be up here 180 days

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.120 
need a crew to be up here 180 days
possibly<00:03:39.250> longer<00:03:40.380> what<00:03:41.380> about<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.739> shower<00:03:41.980> I

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
possibly longer what about this shower I

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.009 
possibly longer what about this shower I

the<00:03:51.099> crew<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.459> get<00:03:51.639> in<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.090> will<00:03:52.480> have<00:03:52.660> a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
the crew can get in I will have a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.809 
the crew can get in I will have a
control<00:03:53.319> volume<00:03:53.560> with<00:03:54.010> some<00:03:54.130> airflow<00:03:54.340> in<00:03:54.700> it

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
control volume with some airflow in it

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.610 
control volume with some airflow in it
you<00:03:55.569> know<00:03:55.599> basically<00:03:55.870> keep<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.440> water

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
you know basically keep the water

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.009 
you know basically keep the water
trapped<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.639> shower<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.239> then<00:03:58.359> recycle

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
trapped in the shower and then recycle

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.360 
trapped in the shower and then recycle
yeah<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.410> this<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.560> how<00:03:59.769> people<00:03:59.799> will<00:04:00.130> stay

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
yeah and this is how people will stay

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.640 
yeah and this is how people will stay
clean<00:04:00.700> it's<00:04:00.910> really<00:04:01.090> something<00:04:01.530> we're<00:04:02.530> gonna

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
clean it's really something we're gonna

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.530 
clean it's really something we're gonna
need<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.950> do<00:04:03.160> on<00:04:03.430> a<00:04:03.459> regular<00:04:03.639> basis<00:04:04.269> because

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
need to do on a regular basis because

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.809 
need to do on a regular basis because
right<00:04:05.049> now<00:04:05.079> one<00:04:05.739> of<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:05.859> biggest<00:04:06.040> issues<00:04:06.549> with

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
right now one of the biggest issues with

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.870 
right now one of the biggest issues with
habitability<00:04:07.690> on<00:04:08.169> the<00:04:08.380> shuttle<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.889> the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
habitability on the shuttle is the

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.089 
habitability on the shuttle is the
inability<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.419> really<00:04:10.989> get<00:04:11.260> clean<00:04:11.620> everyone's

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
inability to really get clean everyone's

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.159 
inability to really get clean everyone's
alone<00:04:12.430> whether<00:04:12.669> it's<00:04:12.849> every<00:04:13.150> other<00:04:13.209> day<00:04:13.780> or<00:04:13.810> so

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
alone whether it's every other day or so

or<00:04:14.349> every<00:04:14.530> week<00:04:14.709> or<00:04:15.069> and<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.030> for<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.359> prolonged

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
or every week or and so for a prolonged

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.080 
or every week or and so for a prolonged
stay<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.620> space<00:04:18.010> we're<00:04:18.489> going<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.669> need<00:04:18.820> that

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
stay in space we're going to need that

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.740 
stay in space we're going to need that
and<00:04:19.299> it'll<00:04:19.599> be<00:04:19.750> part<00:04:19.989> of<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.109> hab<00:04:20.260> module

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
and it'll be part of the hab module
