00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 is the supporter supported and saw that it was a 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.240
 total supremacy of the second half a 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.219
 big time as the cruise minced and we 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.250
 playing all the time by the sides we changed 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.830
 how to play with the boys on the field 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.439
 football is for those who understand, do not you look 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.689
 only the result sometimes and often 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 then it is true that we 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.720
 we were superior 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.640
 we took a goal for six minutes and did not 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
 I wish you did not do anything else in the game, right? 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.269
 The bay is missing many passes. 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.930
 mainly finalizations that are 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.670
 happening at the end is not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.450
 training, maybe we can not 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 we can train but it is the main 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.110
 most difficult game in football and create 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 situations and we created 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 superior 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.070
 I found the second time the cruise very 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 bad is we have largely lacked 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.469
 now the technical part that is my 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 function did not think we did 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.780
 very well the players who entered 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 they entered well 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 I think it was joining together with the game 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.400
 of the team was the match 30 years result 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.110
 more unjust to this it certainly has 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150
 grown in the second half 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.360
 and this has happened other times in 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 other games are 55 56 55 days without 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.850
 win at home 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.590
 in your assessment has it been happening 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 for that the result did not happen 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.390
 despite the good performance in some games 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.860
 I've been here for 15 days. Grandson 55 is a lot. 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.920
 thing behind 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.829
 I can not get into this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.930
 I think the team did deserve it 's and 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.360
 the fan also did his part 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.180
 encouraged but it is not easy when you 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.880
 do not win the ball is always difficult 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.920
 explanation everybody knows that in the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.130
 football when you lose 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.110
 It's just an explanation but it 's not the truth. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.600
 This, I'm paid to talk about 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.509
 tactical part the technical part we went 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.490
 but we had a goal to six 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.470
 minutes that really decided the match 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.799
 and it was only with the cruise he made the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.960
 cruise had only one opportunity to 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.210
 Goal scored in the goal Bay won 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.259
 create some but can not finish 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.890
 the problem is bahia's problem attack 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.090
 a bit mental right is anxiety and 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.810
 concern is not easy to win right are 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.769
 players with a nÃ© character 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.049
 and what they feel and anxiety disturbs 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.260
 things have not gone well because 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.340
 taken Bonini this generates more anxiety 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.750
 but what happened was a superiority 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.819
 total 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.430
 playing on the sides a beautiful football 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.390
 I think even the supporter was excited 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.390
 unfortunately the goal did not come out
