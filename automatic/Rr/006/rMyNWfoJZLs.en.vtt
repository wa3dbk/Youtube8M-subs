00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.980

 that our ps4 loaded is we show 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 the three times when you get that from the xbox 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.590

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.329
 have the foul after hopefully yes yes 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.040
 yes, that's what I had 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.020
 last week gets the dead orbit there 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.399
 heard above or yes the marching 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 had this all is ready 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.239
 gravitational lifeline have some in 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.840
 the comments last time said that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.930
 well then not too bad 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.030
 Maybe you should maybe level 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.739
 I want my primary device already 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.620
 rather, it's not for me because I say 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.590
 games when I something in there in the primary 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.359
 from either something exotic or halt 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.010
 something that had a drawback that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.409
 do you believe a mixture from the braker 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.510
 and that's why automatic rifles are from 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.520
 the fedor from the crucible also not 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.950
 so my thing and he has to say 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 in any case, that's right 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.250
 when an apotheosis veil a great 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.960
 expensive 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.960
 very nice really nice part 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.140
 the devil no or what do you have there where 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.410
 the next even the devil no his 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 Exodus plan also dead orbit or what is 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.480
 it looks like this definitely was 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.130
 she has and devils 1 we just got in 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:46.380
 grand got it off so yesterday 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.180
 on Saturday all right as it can go 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.650
 What are you doing there ? What are you doing? 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.440
 because then the orbit is reached 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.230
 has to play around a bit 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.700
 I mean mine because they are the spectators 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.350
 on 88 but not to have to say yes 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.240
 say this week was very very 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 just from the dawn troika 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.410
 the elementary damage does too 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.630
 Generally, I find that very very 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.190
 just up to the first part where 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.830
 you then lock these three 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720
 then it goes but some find money it goes 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.300
 In any case, that's a whole lot 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.650
 beautiful the grenade did not yet 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.709
 more such people are called ats arachne 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.780
 without cape very nice no bomb today 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.160
 you always 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.750
 keep that in mind if you love people though 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.300
 you do not know the weapon that was used 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.010
 One week bikes sold the thing is 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.420
 a pumpgun you can in the primary 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.890
 slot hail and is not 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.130
 bad that means you can fight 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.319
 quite akram colors or other pumpgun 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.610
 lover a dream there you could 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.050
 actually from review or 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.110
 because the people still know that 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.150
 not because you could do something like that goes 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.500
 after new monarchy something out 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.959
