00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.940
 A very good day, Rodrigo, the founder of 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.190
 lose weight from time to time and author of 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.890
 bes electronic book she slim down 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.180
 time what today is a great day here to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 I lose weight once because I have 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.359
 pen with a thicker tip then 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.339
 It will take that you get it and lethal it 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.269
 the clearest way that is written in the 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:32.189
 board is not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 3 the Flemish get for now who 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.329
 I think I hope it's enough. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.710
 It's a great day today, not only for 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 because I want to share 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.329
 with you a recent knowledge that 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 also appeared if you accompany in the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.590
 third time you already know that a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 calorie is not a calorie 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.300
 calories are not all the same if you 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.250
 As one who enters the calories of a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.010
 steak is quite different than calories 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.629
 of an ice cream for example the two are 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.219
 500 calories however the way the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.480
 body processes that is completely 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.949
 different 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.870
 so I hope you do not believe it 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.339
 Then you follow the site, make sure 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.310
 you do not believe it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.560
 but at last it came out but the recent study 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.660
 step check this kind of thing I 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.580
 I want to stay with you the difference between 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.500
 eat that families a real food 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.300
 healthy movement and who knows 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.000
 food that does not favor health 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.820
 okay this recent study that came out on 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.980
 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 I put the reference in the article of the site 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.940
 You can see below, okay then 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.670
 The following were divided into simple 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.130
 catapult divided into two groups of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.860
 men from 18 to 35 years old was divided into 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.080
 two groups and for the public to jump and 01 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 a food meal that had a 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.990
 high glycemic index and by group be 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.570
 was a meal that instigates and 5 down 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.750
 glycemic index as you should know is 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.790
 with quick that those foods 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.550
 change the blood sugar level 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.870
 Okay then neither if here or in the car 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.910
 change in production would be more 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.250
 faster than this one and I 'm going to talk 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.290
 then it is then after the meal they 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 measured blood sugar levels 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.030
 of the two groups in the group to which 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.500
 referred to by major singles m or 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.430
 rich in simple carbohydrates for example 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:18.299
 tÃ¡ blood sugar levels is 2.4 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.020
 times larger than the 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.630
 group d 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.640
 in comparison that means th level 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.740
 high blood sugar means a 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.590
 large and strong action of insulin 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.860
 means blood means you 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 will store twice point 4 more 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.540
 fat than group b at least ok 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 but everything is not just about this 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.620
 so you see your difference in the index 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140
 is the same amount of 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.630
 calories to understand the same size as 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.820
 only difference was the glycemic index 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.740
 like is the same only the index 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.590
 glycemic is different then the greater 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.330
 glycemic index 24 times greater 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.750
 change in blood sugar levels 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.550
 of the group a and the other thing that is 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.480
 legal to mention is also that four 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.320
 hours after the meal has the issue here 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.210
 group a 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.060
 said he was much more hungry 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.890
 because the group of four hours after 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.020
 four hours after this meal would be a 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.580
 coincident time mind you 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.650
 would have another meal right then 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.810
 this result suggests that the people of 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.790
 group would be prone to eating too 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.730
 more at the next meal than the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.670
 b group which is still investigating the 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.709
 in the brains of people is in the two 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.420
 groups that in the case of the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.860
 it was observed that some areas of the 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.350
 are related to the issue of 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.209
 greed and emotional hunger were 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.520
 stimulated with this high 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.470
 in always following what then calories 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.240
 not so they are not all the same what it is 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.420
 This is yet another proof that comes to 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.280
 confirm all this and for God's sake 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.560
 without paying attention to this objective 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.810
 weight loss and what causes the index 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.820
 to carbohydrates to choose from 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.600
 intelligent care because I hit that 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.220
 key 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.590
 the high glycemic index carbohydrates 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.200
 are those that take care of easy digestion 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.060
 about simple and refined sugars 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.740
 noodles nelly breads white rice 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.660
 potato in which all this is 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.880
 high glycemic index and will favor 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.740
 all these negative things that 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.209
 I just talk now you choose 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.609
 work smart by 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.890
 example leafy vegetables which are also 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.810
 carbohydrates and that's all going to go 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.730
 facilitate the growth theme that will not 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.040
 stay 15 to follow always will not have 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.650
 alteration of blood sugar in a 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.270
 atomic power under control then 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.729
 This is the secret then the 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.199
 weight loss information here 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.330
 I know the other one for you and I suggest that 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.159
 you subscribe to the YouTube channel of 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.259
 head and also puts his and 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.879
 mail and have fun dot com for 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.889
 receiving and receiving the information 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.779
 and stay within that whole information 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.819
 revolutionizing the issue of 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.770
 slimming and health in Brazil who 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.610
 So we'll talk next, stay here. 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.610
 a big hug
