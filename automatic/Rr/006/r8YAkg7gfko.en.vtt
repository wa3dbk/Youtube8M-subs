00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.190
 a moment it sounded in argentina so 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.690
 less if you a few days ago that you're 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.219
 here working with the team the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.110
 possibility of juan román riquelme this 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.639
 it was a simple rumor journalistic rumor or 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.639
 there was some survey or some offer 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.869
 look how little he found out about me 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.410
 how there was an approach to see 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.489
 if it was the possibility I do not know if it was 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.989
 concrete or not at the time they made us 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.019
 know to us that the intention of 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:38.379
 it was to be able to count on román but not 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.510
 I know if they have advanced very little what 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.930
 we try to internalize is 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.449
 a little on the part of how is roman and 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.070
 what time will it take you for the asset 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.440
 because we in ten days already 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.780
 we are competing then many 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.040
 times add a box by name and 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.089
 because it is not in the best 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.369
 conditions is a difficulty but I do not know 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.170
 how far have they advanced I have the 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:05.170
 last I read and I thank you also with the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.270
 theme of riquelme this arises from 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.280
 you be an idea of ​​yours the body 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.740
 technical of the leaders that report does not 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.509
 it is an offer and broadly 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.689
 Would you like to have Riccarme in Cerro 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.689
 porteño 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 look at this came from the part of the 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.819
 directive I do not know if I know what has fenced 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.039
 some entrepreneur or if the idea of them 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.590
 by the fact that the beyond 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.630
 disconnected from Argentines has made 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.390
 that they had the illusion of power 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.920
 count on him I always like 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.310
 has a player already characteristic of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.560
 roman but I was just telling you that if román 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.490
 I was a month and a half ago inactive 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.349
 we want to know the time that we 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.060
 it takes us to activate it because we 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.209
 We have full competition in 10 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.679
 days and you saw as the agent already with 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.049
 the fact of being the name already wants 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.459
 that participates and if we put it to 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.899
 participate and then he answers us the 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.580
 responsible are we then 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.060
 we have to be 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.550
 very analytical in this and they want to be 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.500
 sincere now if the last wealth 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.330
 could you get in anyway you pulled out 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.250
 Richeme other names that is there that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.500
 I spend juli fernandez would be the wolf 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.130
 ledesma you are interested in the teas you 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.130
 they mentioned it 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 it was one of the biggest difficulties that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.250
 we have for the quota the quota 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.920
 we have covered with sperduti with guise 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.110
 Let's face it, there was a difficulty 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.770
 both in the case of wealth and for 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.430
 case of ledezma 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.080
 to me of ledesma not mission get anything 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 except that the managers have thought for 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.580
 there to take two other foreigners over 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.750
 milk from the cup competition but 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.910
 we the cup still do not have 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.560
 assured we have a repechage 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.150
 between the táchira that is a very rival 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 difficult in which we have to know 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.780
 only sauteing and from there they 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.610
 think about the group phase but we carry 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.830
 today I think the players that I have 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.360
 let's say I think today they made a very 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.060
 good preparation were very good 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.400
 predisposed to work back we are 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.890
 trying to have them have a rhythm what 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.000
 as soon as possible to be able to compete with the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.000
 táchira that our first objective
