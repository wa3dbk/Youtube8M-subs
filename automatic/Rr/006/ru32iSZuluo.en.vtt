00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.310 

and<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.630> repeats<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.109> over

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and that's it it just repeats that over

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.990 
and that's it it just repeats that over
and<00:00:25.439> over<00:00:25.619> again<00:00:25.710> there<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.609> different<00:00:26.880> parts

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
and over again there are different parts

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
and over again there are different parts
in<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.180> song<00:00:27.390> but<00:00:27.660> that's<00:00:27.840> just<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.170> intro

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
in the song but that's just the intro

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.759 
in the song but that's just the intro
and<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.340> how<00:00:29.429> I'm<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.640> be<00:00:29.730> teaching

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
and that's how I'm going to be teaching

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.450 
and that's how I'm going to be teaching
so<00:00:31.769> first<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.750> D<00:00:33.750> major<00:00:33.989> chord<00:00:34.460> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so first you have a D major chord and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.720 
so first you have a D major chord and
just<00:00:36.390> add<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.140> D<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.410> top<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.219> D<00:00:38.870> G<00:00:39.870> flat<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
just add the D on top so it's D G flat a

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.860 
just add the D on top so it's D G flat a
D<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:44.930> then<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:47.100> goes<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.579> G<00:00:47.910> inverted<00:00:48.629> chord

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
D and then it goes to a G inverted chord

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.729 
D and then it goes to a G inverted chord
which<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.320> D<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.160> bottom<00:00:50.430> scale<00:00:50.670> G<00:00:51.890> B<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
which is D on the bottom scale G B so it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.779 
which is D on the bottom scale G B so it
sounds<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:58.070> okay<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> left

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
sounds like okay and then in the left

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.380 
sounds like okay and then in the left
hand<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.629> so<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.649> B<00:01:02.420> G

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
hand on that just so you know it's B G

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.440 
hand on that just so you know it's B G
okay<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:08.430> next<00:01:08.610> chord<00:01:08.910> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.210> hand

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
okay the next chord in the right hand

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.250 
okay the next chord in the right hand
keeps<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> D<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> bottom<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.520> d

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260
