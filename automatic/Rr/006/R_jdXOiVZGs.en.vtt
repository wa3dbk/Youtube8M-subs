 then leads the remote northeast of the chief 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 it's the profession of the second part of life there are little things I'm 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.420
 happy that I was very young when I decided that I wanted to be a 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.630
 conductor nogent theotokos help the young however this is only 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.220
 the age of 45 I realized what it meant she was looking for 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.880
 places 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.079
 less than four hours a day in the channel threw me flowers 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.479
 apatow chagny does not buy what 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.160
 so today because a lot of musicians 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.900
 very good musicians 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.860
 the instrumentalists she later directs he directs all the orchestras 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.600
 on the closed side they do not know what the chef's job really is 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.820
 and the world 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.480
 he told me more then I hope now the best guitarist

 15 Mass understand what it means 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 so there is one more shock 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.280
 probably what the newspaper meant was that conducting an orchestra 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.550
 showed up to the musicians to reveal to them what is not his crimes 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.700
 for what is right between the notables in liberia the signatures brad becker 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.470
 sabia like the head there are two young leaders to lead according to the only 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.040
 indications of the created collective score 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.820
 see for example fort montreal we have big games on TV and the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 musician starts when this case 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.530
 atanasov at this beach and I typed the musician 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.870
 telephony were killed around very great leaders 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.030
 In the past, the detainees in the Marseille area were, in my opinion, 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.830
 welcomes two quarter hours to yamagata which only the good graces 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.880
 to posterity 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.670
 for this report 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.399
 of this youth who also writes 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.670
 I came I wanted to play the topic until the heart of houses started 

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:58.679
 in the middle of such a reference for me not to lose your head like 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.430
 for everyone this is something that is a Russian composer but 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.460
 this one is not so crucial that of Mussorgsky for example 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.300
 hired a good track 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.360
 when he is undoubtedly the most European 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.689
 what will people say that the cultural thing 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.169
 andrew is content with what can be the record that the russian Russian cruces to 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.439
 deeper of itself because Russian composers are not afraid 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.209
 to open their hearts through their music that open it completely 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.599
 great talent 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.409
 asserting himself without shame 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.980
 da but put who is involved but little by little towards the examples area 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.359
 the contrary it is the German composers in this case it does not address 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.409
 not to each spectator who bought a ticket individually 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.949

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.739
