00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
sitting in a rocket ship and it totally

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.580

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
than being very very slow and you start

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.830 
than being very very slow and you start

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
get used to have to get a couple of fuel

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.330 
get used to have to get a couple of fuel
stops<00:02:37.140> just<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> hundred<00:02:38.160> miles

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
stops just to get like a hundred miles

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.020 
stops just to get like a hundred miles
but<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.540> rocketed<00:02:40.470> along<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.880> that

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
but it just rocketed along and that

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.470 
but it just rocketed along and that
really<00:02:42.599> transformed<00:02:43.290> my<00:02:43.319> view
