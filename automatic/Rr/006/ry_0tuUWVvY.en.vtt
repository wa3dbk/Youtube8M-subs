now<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.530> song<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.100> playing

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:59.039 

this<00:01:47.979> is<00:01:48.100> what<00:01:48.280> sounds<00:01:48.670> like<00:01:48.729> without<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
this is what sounds like without the

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:11.670 
this is what sounds like without the
bass<00:01:59.319> is<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.530> heavy<00:02:10.230> and<00:02:11.230> that's<00:02:11.530> an

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
bass is really heavy and that's an

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.850 
bass is really heavy and that's an
example<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.489> how<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.730> use<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:14.049> treble<00:02:14.709> mid

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
example of how you use the treble mid

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.280 
example of how you use the treble mid
and<00:02:15.099> bass
