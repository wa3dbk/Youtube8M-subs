00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
bob is that normally out there there's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.350 
bob is that normally out there there's
no<00:01:42.179> ice<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.009> insert<00:01:44.399> your<00:01:44.640> pics<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
no ice and you can insert your pics and

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.959 
no ice and you can insert your pics and
talk<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:46.590> twist<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.219> make<00:01:47.250> sure<00:01:47.579> they're

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:47.969 
talk and twist to make sure they're

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.139 
talk and twist to make sure they're
secure<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.530> covered<00:01:50.039> in<00:01:50.219> a<00:01:50.670> really

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
secure but now it's covered in a really

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.789 
secure but now it's covered in a really
thin<00:01:51.539> like<00:01:51.899> five<00:01:52.829> millimeter<00:01:53.490> peter<00:01:54.420> i<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
thin like five millimeter peter i so you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.999 
thin like five millimeter peter i so you
can<00:01:56.039> just<00:01:56.069> touch<00:01:56.869> like<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.560> small

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
can just touch like a really small

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:17.630 
can just touch like a really small
amount<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> it<00:02:00.179> can<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:01.110> careful

climbing hood mix climbing routes and
dried<00:02:47.650> tooling<00:02:48.040> also<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:49.030> working<00:02:49.450> pretty

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
dried tooling also it's working pretty

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.770 
dried tooling also it's working pretty
well<00:02:49.810> because<00:02:50.580> everybody<00:02:51.580> know<00:02:51.880> what<00:02:52.630> is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
well because everybody know what is

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.710 
well because everybody know what is
lower<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:54.040> she<00:02:54.250> wants<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:55.000> climb

lower now and what she wants to climb

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.100 
lower now and what she wants to climb
and<00:02:55.989> what<00:02:56.440> he<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:57.010> expecting<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:57.820> this<00:02:58.810> is<00:02:58.989> the

and what he is expecting and this is the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:13.550 
and what he is expecting and this is the
route<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.320> we've<00:02:59.650> chosen<00:02:59.920> as<00:03:00.400> an<00:03:00.640> example<00:03:04.500> a

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.650 

really<00:03:14.560> important<00:03:14.950> stages<00:03:15.489> for<00:03:16.120> some<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.480> them

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
really important stages for some of them

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.490 
really important stages for some of them
they<00:03:16.690> discover<00:03:17.350> new<00:03:17.709> media<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.239> new

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
they discover new media and a new

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.130 
they discover new media and a new
playground<00:03:21.000> yeah<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.360> depends<00:03:22.750> him<00:03:22.959> that

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
playground yeah it depends him that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:38.510 
playground yeah it depends him that
usage<00:03:24.000> bumpy<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.600> good

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.090 

what<00:03:39.520> the<00:03:40.510> big<00:03:40.720> difference<00:03:41.170> on<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.560> ice<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:42.070> a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
what the big difference on the ice is a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.670 
what the big difference on the ice is a
unique<00:03:42.670> time<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.390> feel<00:03:43.630> confortable<00:03:43.990> on<00:03:44.530> it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
unique time to feel confortable on it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.700 
unique time to feel confortable on it
that<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.880> the<00:03:46.120> first<00:03:46.390> thing<00:03:46.600> and<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.380> second

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
that the the first thing and the second

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.870 
that the the first thing and the second
thing<00:03:47.740> is<00:03:48.330> climbing<00:03:49.330> with<00:03:49.540> risk<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:51.070> to

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
thing is climbing with risk to to

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.699 
thing is climbing with risk to to
calculate<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.170> have<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.470> lot<00:03:53.650> of

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
calculate so you have a lot of

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.580 
calculate so you have a lot of
parameters<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.790> think<00:03:55.030> about<00:03:55.360> and<00:03:55.630> it's<00:03:56.470> a

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
parameters to think about and it's a

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.230 
parameters to think about and it's a
really<00:03:57.400> good<00:03:57.670> training<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.240> all<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.440> other

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
really good training for all the other

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:25.190 
really good training for all the other
climbing<00:04:01.240> mountains

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.770 

make<00:04:26.200> your<00:04:26.380> soul<00:04:26.620> I<00:04:26.800> told<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:28.000> let<00:04:28.210> you<00:04:28.420> one

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
make your soul I told so let you one

00:04:28.780 --> 00:05:00.339 
make your soul I told so let you one
thing

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.919 

it's<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.499> sound<00:05:01.800> day<00:05:02.069> you<00:05:02.909> make<00:05:03.149> a<00:05:03.179> whole<00:05:03.509> year

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:03.929 
it's the sound day you make a whole year

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:07.219 
it's the sound day you make a whole year
the<00:05:04.019> water<00:05:04.229> running<00:05:04.619> and<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.889> needed
