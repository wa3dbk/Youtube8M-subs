description<00:03:48.819> box<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.180> his<00:03:49.390> video<00:03:49.750> if<00:03:49.900> you're

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
description box to his video if you're

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.640 
description box to his video if you're
interested<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.590> checking<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.099> out<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:52.650> think

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
interested in checking it out I think

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.039 
interested in checking it out I think
really<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.220> main<00:03:54.579> difference<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.750> his

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
really the main difference in his

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.460 
really the main difference in his
technique<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:57.900> actually<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.959> think<00:03:59.200> we<00:03:59.319> have<00:03:59.440> a

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
technique and actually I think we have a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.640 
technique and actually I think we have a
similar<00:03:59.950> technique<00:04:00.340> start<00:04:00.700> with<00:04:00.879> a<00:04:00.909> braid<00:04:01.239> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
similar technique start with a braid and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.259 
similar technique start with a braid and
twist<00:04:02.650> down<00:04:03.569> his<00:04:04.569> were<00:04:04.810> smaller<00:04:05.760> its<00:04:06.760> partings

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
twist down his were smaller its partings

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.080 
twist down his were smaller its partings
a<00:04:07.420> lot<00:04:07.569> neater<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:09.190> believe<00:04:09.459> he<00:04:09.640> used<00:04:09.670> that

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
a lot neater and I believe he used that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.869 
a lot neater and I believe he used that
shorter<00:04:12.150> shorter<00:04:13.150> kinky<00:04:13.629> ball<00:04:13.840> care<00:04:14.879> but

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
shorter shorter kinky ball care but

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.939 
shorter shorter kinky ball care but
other<00:04:16.090> than<00:04:16.269> that<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:17.109> know<00:04:17.139> you<00:04:17.289> can<00:04:17.739> get<00:04:17.889> a

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
other than that you know you can get a

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.860 
other than that you know you can get a
better<00:04:18.160> idea<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:20.970> how<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.030> do<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.419> by<00:04:22.630> watching

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
better idea of how to do it by watching

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:13.369 
the little scraggly ends off so that's

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:13.929 
the little scraggly ends off so that's
it

00:06:13.929 --> 00:06:13.939 
it

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.779 
it
this<00:06:14.449> one<00:06:15.039> this<00:06:16.039> brand<00:06:16.339> of<00:06:16.489> hair<00:06:16.610> that<00:06:16.729> I

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
this one this brand of hair that I

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.809 
this one this brand of hair that I
bought<00:06:16.999> was<00:06:17.209> a<00:06:17.269> hundred<00:06:17.629> percent<00:06:17.800> Kanekalon

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
bought was a hundred percent Kanekalon

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.719 
bought was a hundred percent Kanekalon
fibers<00:06:19.819> so<00:06:20.209> I<00:06:20.509> find<00:06:21.499> that<00:06:21.559> it<00:06:21.829> if<00:06:22.490> it's<00:06:22.669> a

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
fibers so I find that it if it's a

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.009 
fibers so I find that it if it's a
hundred<00:06:22.969> percent<00:06:23.059> it<00:06:23.449> doesn't<00:06:23.719> bother<00:06:23.839> me

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:24.019 
hundred percent it doesn't bother me

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:27.309 
hundred percent it doesn't bother me
whereas<00:06:24.889> if<00:06:25.129> it's<00:06:25.339> a<00:06:25.490> blend<00:06:26.089> of<00:06:26.329> Kanekalon<00:06:27.019> and

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
whereas if it's a blend of Kanekalon and

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.069 
whereas if it's a blend of Kanekalon and
Toyo<00:06:27.619> :<00:06:28.069> then<00:06:28.759> it<00:06:28.969> actually<00:06:29.149> really<00:06:29.599> irritates

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:30.079 
Toyo : then it actually really irritates

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:35.879 
Toyo : then it actually really irritates
my<00:06:30.289> scalp<00:06:30.669> but<00:06:31.669> this<00:06:31.849> one<00:06:31.999> is<00:06:32.119> fine

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889
