00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
slant it one side another and you're

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.120 
slant it one side another and you're
like<00:03:29.120> if<00:03:29.630> there's<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.960> right<00:03:30.110> wing<00:03:30.350> video<00:03:30.680> you

I think JibJab maybe goes either
direction<00:03:36.740> like<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.130> it<00:03:37.220> has<00:03:37.310> an<00:03:37.460> agenda<00:03:37.700> it's

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
direction like if it has an agenda it's

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.150 
direction like if it has an agenda it's
different<00:03:38.540> but<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:38.840> it's<00:03:39.530> kind<00:03:39.770> of<00:03:39.830> making<00:03:39.980> a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
different but like it's kind of making a

it was Michelle Obama's voice because I
actually<00:03:59.510> thought<00:03:59.840> Obama's<00:04:00.380> voice<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.800> pretty

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
actually thought Obama's voice is pretty

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.130 
actually thought Obama's voice is pretty
close<00:04:01.520> to<00:04:01.550> his<00:04:01.850> voice<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.390> mean<00:04:02.660> he<00:04:02.750> doesn't<00:04:02.900> say

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
close to his voice I mean he doesn't say

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.590 
close to his voice I mean he doesn't say
the<00:04:03.290> nonsense<00:04:03.830> stuff<00:04:04.040> but<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.760> inflection

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
the nonsense stuff but the inflection

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.430 
the nonsense stuff but the inflection
was<00:04:05.750> pretty<00:04:05.990> right

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
was pretty right

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.620 
was pretty right
can<00:04:07.070> we<00:04:07.190> get<00:04:07.310> Michelle<00:04:07.640> Obama's<00:04:08.120> will<00:04:08.270> the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
character there because she she seems to

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.860

least<00:04:39.210> brings<00:04:39.449> up<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.720> question<00:04:39.840> but<00:04:40.199> I<00:04:40.229> overall

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
least brings up a question but I overall

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.920 
least brings up a question but I overall
I<00:04:41.010> think<00:04:41.160> I<00:04:41.400> want<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.639> TYT<00:04:41.940> Supreme<00:04:42.449> Court<00:04:42.690> and

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
I think I want the TYT Supreme Court and

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.060 
I think I want the TYT Supreme Court and
it<00:04:43.110> doesn't<00:04:43.350> really<00:04:43.470> matter<00:04:43.740> if<00:04:43.949> it's

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
it doesn't really matter if it's

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.890 
it doesn't really matter if it's
racialist<00:04:44.520> or<00:04:44.669> not<00:04:44.850> and<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.389> love<00:04:45.600> using<00:04:45.780> that

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
racialist or not and I love using that

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.020 
racialist or not and I love using that
word<00:04:46.139> now

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
word now

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.810 
word now
the<00:04:48.030> bottom<00:04:48.300> line<00:04:48.449> is<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:49.020> it's<00:04:49.460> absurd<00:04:50.460> it's

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
the bottom line is that it's absurd it's

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.490 
the bottom line is that it's absurd it's
totally<00:04:51.449> misleading<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.650> it's<00:04:53.310> goofy<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.630> it

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
totally misleading and it's goofy and it

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.820 
totally misleading and it's goofy and it
