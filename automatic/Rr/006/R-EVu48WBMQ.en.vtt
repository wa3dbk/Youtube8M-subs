digital camera it's a really horrible
thought<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> probably<00:01:26.970> do

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
thought and I think you can probably do

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
thought and I think you can probably do
some<00:01:27.540> real<00:01:27.810> real<00:01:28.140> damage<00:01:28.590> if<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> gets

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
some real real damage if that gets

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
some real real damage if that gets
inside<00:01:29.640> obviously<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:31.110> hard<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.799> avoid<00:01:31.920> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
inside obviously it's hard to avoid and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
inside obviously it's hard to avoid and
if<00:01:33.000> you're<00:01:33.210> shooting<00:01:33.479> somewhere<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.170> sandy

once<00:03:37.930> again<00:03:38.320> when<00:03:38.739> you're<00:03:38.860> shooting

once again when you're shooting
somewhere<00:03:39.549> like<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.850> beach<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.360> beach<00:03:40.540> is

somewhere like the beach the beach is

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.650 
somewhere like the beach the beach is
full<00:03:41.230> of<00:03:41.470> horrible<00:03:42.340> predatory<00:03:43.239> things<00:03:43.450> for

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the camera like water obviously and

the camera like water obviously and
that<00:03:46.530> we've<00:03:46.650> already<00:03:46.830> covered<00:03:47.159> salt<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.480> also

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
that we've already covered salt can also

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.539 
that we've already covered salt can also
be<00:03:49.080> dangerous<00:03:49.260> if<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.830> does<00:03:50.040> get<00:03:50.189> into<00:03:50.340> your

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549

camera it can be very corrosive over
time<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.700> can<00:03:53.849> really<00:03:54.090> do<00:03:54.360> some<00:03:54.720> horrible

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
time and it can really do some horrible

time and it can really do some horrible
horrible<00:03:55.680> damage<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.579> be<00:03:56.730> wary<00:03:56.970> of<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.390> once

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
horrible damage so be wary of it once

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.289 
horrible damage so be wary of it once
again<00:03:57.959> wipe<00:03:58.439> down<00:03:58.739> your<00:03:58.980> camera<00:03:59.189> and<00:03:59.579> after

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
again wipe down your camera and after

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.330 
again wipe down your camera and after
you've<00:04:00.450> been<00:04:00.659> shooting<00:04:01.079> on<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.769> beach<00:04:02.040> and

you've been shooting on the beach and

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.430 
you've been shooting on the beach and
where<00:04:02.849> possible<00:04:03.030> again<00:04:03.750> put<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.260> one<00:04:04.409> of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
where possible again put it in one of

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.500 
where possible again put it in one of
those<00:04:04.620> sealable<00:04:05.069> bags<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.640> so<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.239> can<00:04:06.360> make

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
those sealable bags and so you can make

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.869 
those sealable bags and so you can make
sure<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.870> stays<00:04:07.079> as<00:04:07.290> safe<00:04:07.560> as<00:04:07.769> possible<00:04:08.010> my

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
sure it stays as safe as possible my

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.380 
sure it stays as safe as possible my
next<00:04:09.599> one<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:10.170> you<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.590> bumps<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.400> drops<00:04:12.090> this

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
next one for you is bumps and drops this

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.759 
next one for you is bumps and drops this
is<00:04:12.540> another<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:12.989> seems<00:04:13.290> really<00:04:13.530> obvious

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
is another one that seems really obvious

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.490 
is another one that seems really obvious
drops<00:04:14.459> quite<00:04:15.060> obviously<00:04:15.659> because<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.320> can

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
drops quite obviously because you can

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.860 
drops quite obviously because you can
drop<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.100> smash<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.510> smithereens

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
drop it and smash it to smithereens

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.170 
drop it and smash it to smithereens
depending<00:04:19.829> on<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.010> height<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> drop<00:04:20.729> but

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
depending on the height of the drop but

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.000 
depending on the height of the drop but
bumps<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.870> maybe<00:04:22.199> something<00:04:22.590> that<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.770> don't

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
bumps is maybe something that you don't

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.070 
bumps is maybe something that you don't
think<00:04:23.190> about<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.789> much<00:04:24.000> if<00:04:24.300> your<00:04:24.720> camera's

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
think about so much if your camera's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.020 
think about so much if your camera's
being<00:04:25.350> shaked<00:04:25.680> around<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.370> bumped<00:04:26.760> against

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
being shaked around and bumped against

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.550 
being shaked around and bumped against
things<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:27.780> mean<00:04:27.930> there's<00:04:28.110> obviously

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
things just I mean there's obviously

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.290 
things just I mean there's obviously
normal<00:04:28.979> wear<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.190> tear<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.940> will<00:04:30.090> happen

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
normal wear and tear and it will happen

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.050 
normal wear and tear and it will happen
but<00:04:31.050> try<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.380> avoid<00:04:31.620> these<00:04:32.039> bumps<00:04:32.370> as<00:04:32.490> much<00:04:32.850> as

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
but try to avoid these bumps as much as

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.420 
but try to avoid these bumps as much as
possible<00:04:33.419> because<00:04:34.139> they<00:04:34.410> will<00:04:34.710> really<00:04:35.190> start

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
possible because they will really start

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.430 
possible because they will really start
to<00:04:35.550> affect<00:04:35.910> your<00:04:36.030> camera<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.600> eventually

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
to affect your camera and eventually

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.250 
to affect your camera and eventually
break<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.919> down<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:38.699> like<00:04:38.850> if<00:04:39.449> you're<00:04:40.020> on<00:04:40.199> a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
break it down it's like if you're on a

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.110 
break it down it's like if you're on a
long<00:04:40.530> walk<00:04:40.830> and<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.280> keep<00:04:41.490> bumping<00:04:41.760> into

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
long walk and you keep bumping into

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.969 
long walk and you keep bumping into
things<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.690> ultimately<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.440> doesn't<00:04:43.710> hurt

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
things and ultimately it doesn't hurt

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.040 
things and ultimately it doesn't hurt
that<00:04:44.039> much<00:04:44.250> but<00:04:44.729> at<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.880> end<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.330> day<00:04:45.539> you

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
that much but at the end of the day you

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.779 
that much but at the end of the day you
look<00:04:46.080> at<00:04:46.350> yourself<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.889> you<00:04:46.979> are<00:04:47.010> covered<00:04:47.580> in

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
look at yourself and you are covered in

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.700 
look at yourself and you are covered in
bruises<00:04:48.030> and<00:04:48.419> everything<00:04:49.199> aches

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
bruises and everything aches

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.740 
bruises and everything aches
similarly<00:04:50.370> for<00:04:50.639> your<00:04:50.760> camera<00:04:51.000> it's<00:04:51.330> not<00:04:51.389> going

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
similarly for your camera it's not going

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.240 
similarly for your camera it's not going
to<00:04:51.810> be<00:04:51.900> very<00:04:52.080> happy<00:04:52.289> if<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.500> keep<00:04:52.800> bumping<00:04:53.010> it

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
to be very happy if you keep bumping it

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.879 
to be very happy if you keep bumping it
over<00:04:53.460> time<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.120> really<00:04:54.389> do<00:04:54.630> try<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.139> keep<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.710> as

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
over time so really do try to keep it as

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.070 
over time so really do try to keep it as
safe<00:04:56.190> as<00:04:56.340> possible<00:04:56.550> I'm<00:04:56.970> definitely<00:04:57.599> a<00:04:57.630> terror

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
safe as possible I'm definitely a terror

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.719 
safe as possible I'm definitely a terror
for<00:04:58.380> doing<00:04:58.620> this<00:04:58.770> kind<00:04:59.039> of<00:04:59.070> thing<00:04:59.250> with<00:04:59.370> my<00:04:59.520> own

for doing this kind of thing with my own

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.670 
for doing this kind of thing with my own
belongings<00:05:00.150> and<00:05:00.539> it<00:05:00.630> really<00:05:00.900> does<00:05:01.169> shorten

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
belongings and it really does shorten

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.950 
belongings and it really does shorten
the<00:05:01.800> life<00:05:02.010> of<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:03.000> my<00:05:03.210> final<00:05:03.599> one<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.840> watch
