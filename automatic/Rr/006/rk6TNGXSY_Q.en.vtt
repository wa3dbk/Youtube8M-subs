00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:52.580 

you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 

make<00:00:53.250> sure<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.490> watch<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.760> video<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.240> end

make sure you watch the video to the end
as<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:54.660> because<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.320> best<00:00:55.530> part<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
as well because I think the best part is

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.130 
as well because I think the best part is
when<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:56.790> guys<00:00:56.970> get<00:00:57.210> heckled<00:00:57.540> by<00:00:57.630> a<00:00:57.750> woman<00:00:57.930> on

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
when the guys get heckled by a woman on

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.590 
when the guys get heckled by a woman on
the<00:00:58.200> tube<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:59.550> check<00:01:00.060> out<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.360> they<00:01:00.480> do

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.120

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.430 
the trick of the week this week comes
from<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.180> video<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.540> found<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.080> American

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.830 
from a video I found on the American
parkour<00:02:14.830> forums<00:02:15.250> itself<00:02:16.239> is<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> pretty<00:02:16.630> good

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
parkour forums itself is a pretty good

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.589 
parkour forums itself is a pretty good
video<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.319> but<00:02:18.130> at<00:02:18.310> 1<00:02:18.549> minute<00:02:18.700> 7<00:02:18.940> seconds<00:02:19.450> in

video and but at 1 minute 7 seconds in

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.190 
video and but at 1 minute 7 seconds in
they<00:02:19.780> do<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.959> trick<00:02:20.290> which<00:02:21.390> immediately<00:02:22.390> maybe

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
they do a trick which immediately maybe
