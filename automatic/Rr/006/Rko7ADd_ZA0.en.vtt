00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
one of the best ones in the barn and he

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.100 
one of the best ones in the barn and he
has<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.740> just<00:00:50.950> at<00:00:51.070> raw<00:00:51.300> talent<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.390> so<00:00:52.900> he

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
has that just at raw talent and so he

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.520 
has that just at raw talent and so he
got<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:54.030> show<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.150> off<00:00:55.210> yesterday<00:00:55.720> how<00:00:56.140> long<00:00:56.380> do
