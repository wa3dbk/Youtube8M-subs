00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.889
 Hi everyone here with a new video 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.540
 tutorial always dedicated to the holidays though 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.980
 this time the new year 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.110
 I wanted to do a tutorial 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.900
 in the auction this time combined with make 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.060
 up only that some one has decided 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.520
 to break and therefore it didn't seem to me 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.460
 very nice to make a nail art tutorial 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.650
 as a nail longer than the other 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.300
 if he missed it, step surprised the make 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.610
 up with this eye makeup a lot 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
 bright but quite light 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.750
 apart from the false eyelashes that a new year 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 they can be worn at least in New Year's Eve 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.120
 you can use these lips instead 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.050
 they are the protagonists of a lot of makeup 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.470
 strong impact with this lipstick 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.300
 very bright fuchsia more like a lot 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.850
 but I decided to make two alternatives 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.860
 for the lips look which is the big net 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.370
 then in the video and nothing I hope you will 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.020
 like it and leave it there first 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.140
 I'm going to apply the primer on everything 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 the eye 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.909
 after that I go to get this color 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 champagne and I click on all the 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.420
 mobile eyelid 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.520
 now I take this brown with micro 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:32.060
 golden glitter and apply it in the fold 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:35.230
 of the eye also bringing it slightly 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.230
 towards the outer corner 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.390
 I continue upwards applying this 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.390
 color 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.150
 to create light points I use this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.240
 I apply pearly white under the 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.240
 eyebrows 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.610
 it's at the inner corner 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.250
 in the internal rhyme plico costs pencil 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.250
 color ivory 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.709
 below the rhyme below those themselves 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:33.709
 monetics applied above 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.060
 now I'm going to create a nice line of 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.060
 eyeliner 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.890
 finally to complete the look of the 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:12.819
 eyes decided to apply eyelashes 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.230
 fake now apply some mascara to 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.430
 make sure you don't notice too much 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.430
 difference with my natural eyelashes 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.180
 read on how to apply a lot of blush 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.180
 bright 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.349
 I fix my base with a powder 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.349
 transparent 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:07.870
 for the lips decided to offer you two 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:09.430

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.269
 second alternative instead this 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.269
