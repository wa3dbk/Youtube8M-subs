00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.260
 miguel herrera ruled out having received 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.729
 call some from the federation 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.830
 mexican soccer to show you 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.390
 interest after the wave of rumors that 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.890
 they placed him as a possible technician of the 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.050
 Mexican team facing the last 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.480
 two games of the final hexagonal course 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.180
 Brazil-2014 did not receive any calls 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.050
 yesterday I had two commitments made 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.090
 personal 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.840
 and I did not have any call the only 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.310
 call that I had was from my directive 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 telling me what happened that I was 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.570
 Choose a place looks just before 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.760
 that means out of here I am in the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 dressing here he spoke to me yon de luisa 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.490
 reads do you want me to go to the office not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.050
 I'm not the office how are you calm 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.320
 concentrate on what I have to do 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.600
 what is thinking about saints with my phone 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.700
 in my house eat that your house 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.200
 and then 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.880
 I went to the agreements that I had to 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.880
 do I charge telephones charged 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.290
 up to the clothes but the phone 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:10.400
 I was never just just fortunately 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.610
 I got the phones removed in the house 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.470
 already when we are going to increase the commitment 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.330
 by the phone of the person with whom 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.260
 I was talking to michelle so he would not 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.080
 I was answering the calls was 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.560
 the natural candidates forces that more 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.810
 does not have no equipment and well, because 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.630
 was within the proposal from the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.460
 start of this I think today what more 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.640
 we are not all at all is to support the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.930
 selection today and look for it to get 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.660
 because mathematically all that power 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.510
 direct the draw is the same as before 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.650
 from honduras and panama it would seem that we 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.840
 harmed but on the contrary because 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.580
 still mathematically you can 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.920
 get that miracle that sometime with 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.320
 aguirre was achieved I have that goal 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.830
 at the moment you have to get there 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.270
 we will be today my head is absolute all 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.270
 the time was put in america 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.970
 that started the tournament that started 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.140
 rumored I was in South America looking 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.780
 players for the america 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.170
 bayern had 22 these are the personal ones 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.980
 my head was 100% thinking of saints 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.959
 how the selected ones will return 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.880
 fortunately for us he reiterated 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.910
 they had participation and they are going to return 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.060
 whole to be able to have a 100% team 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.440
 complete and power and with the best to a 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.330
 party that is going to be very difficult as it is 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.760
 the saints market I think it's the 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.430
 suitable since they already presented it 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.950
 support it we like it or we do not like it 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.070
 do not like it because today you have to join 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.320
 to the project that that ideal pixel that 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.090
 take us to the world support the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.590
 selection is the main thing 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.870
 If we want to follow the World Cup, we have to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.060
 support in the determinations 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.459
 take fortunately is not a team 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.170
 very vast very large the team comes 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.510
 doing things well and the one that is going 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.730
 it does is really good and the one that 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.090
 comes in relief does it also or sometimes 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.269
 better than the one who is playing then 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.980
 we will join that project to support and 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.930
 we will comply with our 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.690
 commitments with the people we have if 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.200
 it is unfortunate to be thinking of nothing in 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.420
 to have 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.750
 and we beat panama, I say, there's no 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.360
 that beat him 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.190
 and beat him with authority and 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.680
 then go to visit each costa rica and 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.590
 also also try to overcome it 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.950
 because it seems to me that the difference 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.160
 There are local or European players 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.830
 as you want to put it is great between 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.660
 the rivals that we always face the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.580
 selection are sometimes not the best 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.420
 but they should be the best 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.730
 moment they go through 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.500
 and well, I think that matosas did not say 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.020
 no lie the best time 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.569
 goes through at this time in this era 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.450
 of soccer are the players of america 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.959
 lion and morelia are other teams are 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.800
 playing well and are doing 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.959
 personally what they have to do 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.370
 within the league without underestimating the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.560
 others and there they are also all make their 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.170
 work but they are the ones that best moment 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.510
 they go through the case for example of queen 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.610
 that through a start 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.010
 impressive also that take advantage of that 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.680
 moment 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.500
 that will determine what busse who is going 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.910
 to work is also important that the 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.340
 technician who has arrived then take 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.990
 the people who more quickly assimilate what 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.870
 he wants because he has very little time 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.150
 to work and the next party 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.650
 it is vital the rudder of the sacred 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.330
 he reiterated all his support for vÃ­ctor manuel 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.949
 vucetich who took the reins today 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.360
 the Mexican national team and said no 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.560
 I had trouble releasing their 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.330
 players in case these are 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.699
 summoned for training 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.080
 prior to the match against panama from the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.940
 Mexico City in Ramses images 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.750
 varona juan manuel is in line with 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.750
