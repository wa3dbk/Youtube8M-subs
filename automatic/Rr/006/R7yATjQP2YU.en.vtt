glitch<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.210> how<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.390> get<00:00:06.540> loads<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.960> xB<00:00:07.500> so

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
glitch this is how to get loads of xB so

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.890 
glitch this is how to get loads of xB so
you<00:00:08.189> can<00:00:08.340> rank<00:00:08.610> up<00:00:08.730> fast<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.059> obtain<00:00:09.450> other

you can rank up fast and obtain other

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.810 
you can rank up fast and obtain other
abilities<00:00:10.469> like<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.400> let's<00:00:12.059> get<00:00:12.300> into<00:00:12.420> it

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
abilities like that let's get into it

you'll get a bit of money bull lows of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.160 
you'll get a bit of money bull lows of
XP<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> one<00:01:27.000> skill<00:01:27.390> point<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.049> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
XP and one skill point this is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
XP and one skill point this is
definitely<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.799> best<00:01:28.979> method<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.399> rank<00:01:29.670> up<00:01:29.759> at

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
definitely the best method to rank up at

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.340 
definitely the best method to rank up at
the<00:01:29.969> moment<00:01:30.149> so<00:01:30.689> someone<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.109> almost

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the moment so someone will almost

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319 
the moment so someone will almost
definitely<00:01:31.799> call<00:01:32.219> the<00:01:32.369> police<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
definitely call the police on you so

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
definitely call the police on you so
what<00:01:33.539> you<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.140> jump<00:01:34.649> off<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.979> side

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
what you have to do is jump off the side

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
what you have to do is jump off the side
and<00:01:35.490> kill<00:01:35.939> yourself<00:01:36.149> or<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and kill yourself or you could just

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
and kill yourself or you could just
drive<00:01:37.649> away<00:01:37.829> this<00:01:38.039> easier<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.490> kill<00:01:38.670> yourself

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
drive away this easier to kill yourself

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.599 
drive away this easier to kill yourself
as<00:01:39.179> you<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.750> keep<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.469> money<00:01:40.679> and<00:01:40.799> XP<00:01:41.460> and

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
as you do keep the money and XP and

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.310 
as you do keep the money and XP and
everything<00:01:42.119> else<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.359> you<00:01:42.539> earn<00:01:42.780> during<00:01:43.109> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
everything else that you earn during the
