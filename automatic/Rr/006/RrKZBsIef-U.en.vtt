00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.550
 study and then beauty prepared for more 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.380
 a cool biology class in our class 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.450
 today will talk about know him because it is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250
 This is our dna. 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 So our class today is going to be about 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.779
 part related to the genetic code 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.939
 I'll bring you an overview and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.350
 I'll invite you know here to continue. 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.920
 watching our classes on this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.900
 theme 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 in fact come to watch biology all 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 with us and attend to know the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.170
 studio 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 come on then look at the genetic code 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.250
 in this class we will have a vision 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.469
 of the importance of the study code 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.300
 genetic and you will realize you will 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 understand that there are several things here that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 you have notion 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.610
 It will be necessary to organize in straight 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.329
 your head is ready so let's go 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.120
 well we call it metabolism as we already 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 I commented earlier on the cytology 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 early part of cytology we call 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.030
 of cellular metabolism 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.940
 the set of chemical reactions that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.430
 occur inside the cell is fine. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.010
 chemical reactions that can be 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.909
 reactions of breaking union reactions is of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.740
 synthesis 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.950
 they are not reactions that occur by 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 are they reactions that are 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 coordinates are reactions that are 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.380
 controlled 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 It's there I put here for you three 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 important first comments 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.640
 this set of chemical reactions that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.170
 occur in the cell 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.280
 in fact they occur mainly 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.049
 in the cytoplasm, and let's imagine a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.360
 little she is a cell 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.310
 that it is a cell the carioca that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.500
 cell that can be an animal that can be 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.960
 which can be a funk of a 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.549
 class of a protozoan is a cell 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.420
 with a core and several 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.270
 organizations control all 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 These reactions are coordinated by all those 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.969
 the dna that in this case will be located 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.070
 in the cell's core okay now with the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.640
 purpose of these chemical reactions 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.500
 allow the cell to survive 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.210
 she needs to perform these reactions 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.459
 chemicals to stay alive and 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.899
 perform its function without imagining 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.370
 be pure and cellular 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.810
 I may be speaking for example of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.640
 a cell 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.440
 nervous a neuron so it will have 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.310
 that function of driving impulses 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.989
 nervous 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.720
 then it has to perform the reactions 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.670
 specific for this is now the great 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.140
 detail is the following that I know you 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.599
 already learned that I know you already know 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.220
 who does these reactions? 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.830
 who does this 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.349
 metabolism are the enzymes the enzymes 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.930
 which are catalytic proteins 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.530
 proteins with catalytic function now 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.950
 that's where the dna controls and who executes 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 are the proteins that perform the enzymes 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.860
 perfectly 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.530
 From there I bring you to you. 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.709
 to understand you tie this idea 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.230
 the central dogma of the molecular biology 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.480
 which says the code that says the central dogma 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.530
 of molecular biology on the code 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.959
 genetic 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.290
 it says the following that the molecule that 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.410
 stores the information in an edit manner 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.810
 area that you receive for your 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.989
 ancestors and passes to your 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.359
 descent is the dna and so you 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.489
 you can pass the information to your 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.349
 descent or simply for you 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.019
 pass this on to other cells 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.230
 the dna must have the capacity to 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.090
 replicating DNA replication 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.579
 it is nothing more than the capacity he 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.870
 have to duplicate to originate another 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.319
 similar molecule 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.000
 It's okay that it 's the subject of classes that you 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.250
 will you see that I'm sure you 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
 will come watch biology with us 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.739
 study very well 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.200
 in addition I have a transcript to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.310
 transcription is when the message that is 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.790
 not dna 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.530
 a part of this message are you going 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.930
 imagine giving it to them as if it were a 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.030
 cookbook and when you want to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.819
 open that cookbook you have there 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.549
 a certain recipe imagines that this 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.930
 recipe is a genius and information 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:08.230
 intelligence and information that 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.440
 her recipe will be transcribed she goes 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.769
 be written in another way 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.320
 originating the rfa and from this rn 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.340
 from this transcribed recipe of a 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.200
 other way 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.300
 where you have there the whole sequence of 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.250
 ingredients you will get your product 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.780
 end your protein 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.610
 you'll get your ass 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.280
 You'll have your door, you'll have it there. 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.010
 your bread that is your final product 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.350
 now 10 I can not understand why 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.020
 You explain that is making a 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.360
 relation to cellular metabolism 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.240
 I said that whoever does the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.910
 metabolism are the enzymes that are 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.880
 catalytic proteins then why is the 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.490
 dna that controls all metabolism 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.760
 because it is he who will say what the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.200
 enzymes and what these enzymes do 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
 in that metabolism 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.220
 so that's why it's the core of a 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.290
 cell or carioca or better is the DNA that 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.480
 controls the entire metabolism of a 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.130
 and that's what we're going to discuss. 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.350
 from now on we 'll go 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.440
 know the details of the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.310
 duplication of dna formation 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.380
 children 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.680
 Let's get to know everything about transcription. 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.860
 and everything about the translation where it occurs who 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.419
 What is the purpose of what are the 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.979
 particularities 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.139
 This is all for you to get along with. 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.930
 in the vestibular enem or in the test that 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.650
 Are you preparing the company? 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.080
 people 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.320
 ok a big hug and see you to 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.320
 local
