the image I want to set as my dashboard

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.670 
the image I want to set as my dashboard

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
background is um it's here somewhere

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.850 
background is um it's here somewhere
it's<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
it's this I'm because that's the

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.430 
it's this I'm because that's the
background<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> Mission<00:02:09.209> Control<00:02:09.660> as<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.319> can

fit<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.180> put<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.599> my<00:02:14.629> dashboard

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
fit if I put it as my dashboard

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.479 
fit if I put it as my dashboard

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
background um so I'm going to take this

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
your dragon to my desktop and it's just

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.039 
your dragon to my desktop and it's just
going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.760> set<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:22.909> copy<00:02:23.150> then<00:02:23.720> I'm<00:02:23.870> going<00:02:24.019> to

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
going to set a copy then I'm going to

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.570 
going to set a copy then I'm going to
duplicate<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:24.970> um<00:02:26.409> but<00:02:27.409> since<00:02:27.709> you<00:02:28.280> most

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
duplicate this um but since you most

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.030 
duplicate this um but since you most
likely<00:02:28.849> will<00:02:29.000> use<00:02:29.569> your<00:02:29.690> own<00:02:29.900> image<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.920> would

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
likely will use your own image you would

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.520 
likely will use your own image you would
just<00:02:31.940> take<00:02:32.209> your<00:02:32.329> image<00:02:32.599> at<00:02:32.780> duplicate<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.440> and

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
just take your image at duplicate it and

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.589 
just take your image at duplicate it and
you<00:02:34.069> have<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.340> make<00:02:34.519> sure<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.909> they're<00:02:35.090> pngs

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
you have to make sure that they're pngs

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.850 
you have to make sure that they're pngs
that's<00:02:35.840> very<00:02:36.110> important<00:02:36.440> they<00:02:36.530> can't<00:02:36.739> be

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
that's very important they can't be

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.880 
that's very important they can't be
JPEGs<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:38.209> here<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.659> two<00:02:39.470> copies<00:02:39.680> of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
JPEGs so here you have two copies of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.080 
JPEGs so here you have two copies of
your<00:02:40.400> desired<00:02:41.120> background<00:02:41.510> image<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:43.090> then

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
your desired background image and then

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.069 
your desired background image and then
you're<00:02:45.079> going<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.489> name<00:02:46.489> one<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.790> them<00:02:47.079> pirelli

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
you're going to name one of them pirelli

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.819 
you're going to name one of them pirelli
and<00:02:48.819> then<00:02:49.819> they<00:02:50.000> another<00:02:50.660> one<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.870> them<00:02:51.109> mini

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
and then they another one of them mini

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.440 
and then they another one of them mini
and<00:02:52.220> then<00:02:52.390> under<00:02:53.390> dash<00:02:54.310> Corelli<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.640> you<00:02:56.269> can

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.930 
pirelli dot PNG and you're going to take
these<00:03:06.049> two<00:03:06.290> files<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.890> drag<00:03:07.459> them<00:03:07.609> into<00:03:07.819> this

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
these two files and drag them into this

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.210 
these two files and drag them into this
folder<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.709> it's<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:09.829> to<00:03:09.920> ask<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.190> to

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
then you're going to hit okay then you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.089 
then you're going to hit okay then you
can<00:03:15.319> clean<00:03:15.560> up<00:03:15.609> so<00:03:16.609> they<00:03:17.620> move<00:03:18.620> back<00:03:18.859> right

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
can clean up so they move back right

here and now if you want the changes to
take<00:03:23.000> effect<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.980> can<00:03:25.190> because<00:03:25.489> as<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:25.730> can

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
take effect you can because as you can

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.640

go<00:03:52.699> to<00:03:52.730> Mission<00:03:53.090> Control<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:53.900> also<00:03:54.139> changed

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
go to Mission Control it's also changed

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.900 
go to Mission Control it's also changed
on<00:03:54.919> the<00:03:55.699> little<00:03:55.849> thumbnail<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:57.609> as<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:58.760> can

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
on the little thumbnail and as you can

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.189 
on the little thumbnail and as you can
see<00:03:58.940> I<00:03:59.060> chose<00:03:59.329> that<00:03:59.449> background<00:03:59.810> because<00:04:00.079> it

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
see I chose that background because it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.189 
see I chose that background because it
kind<00:04:00.349> of<00:04:00.379> goes<00:04:00.530> with<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.799> flow<00:04:00.919> of<00:04:02.199> Mission

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199
