replace driver and wait and sometimes

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.190 
replace driver and wait and sometimes
you'll<00:01:54.250> wait<00:01:54.400> quite<00:01:54.670> a<00:01:54.700> while<00:01:55.000> I've<00:01:55.659> sped<00:01:56.049> this

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
you'll wait quite a while I've sped this

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.410 
you'll wait quite a while I've sped this
up<00:01:56.409> for<00:01:56.619> video<00:01:56.920> but<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.280> may<00:01:57.460> be<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.820> much<00:01:58.000> as<00:01:58.180> 5

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
up for video but it may be as much as 5

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.170 
up for video but it may be as much as 5
minutes<00:01:59.490> while<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.670> doing<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.030> it's

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
minutes while it's doing that it's

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.100 
minutes while it's doing that it's
changing<00:02:01.810> out<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.110> drivers<00:02:02.530> for<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.390> in

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
changing out the drivers for you so in

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.719 
changing out the drivers for you so in
this<00:02:05.229> case<00:02:05.470> it<00:02:05.650> tells<00:02:05.860> me<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.100> failed<00:02:06.430> but<00:02:06.670> it

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
this case it tells me it failed but it

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.240 
this case it tells me it failed but it
didn't<00:02:07.210> it<00:02:07.810> gave<00:02:07.960> me<00:02:08.080> a<00:02:08.140> timeout<00:02:08.649> error<00:02:08.860> so

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
didn't it gave me a timeout error so

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.399 
didn't it gave me a timeout error so
I'll<00:02:09.340> go<00:02:09.549> ahead<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.789> close<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.659> then

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
I'll go ahead and close that up and then

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.159 
I'll go ahead and close that up and then
I'm<00:02:11.500> gonna<00:02:11.620> try<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:11.950> out<00:02:12.159> now<00:02:12.459> if<00:02:13.419> you<00:02:13.930> have

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:14.169 
I'm gonna try it out now if you have

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.199 
I'm gonna try it out now if you have
problems<00:02:14.650> at<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.829> point<00:02:15.219> you<00:02:15.730> might<00:02:15.909> want<00:02:16.150> to

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
problems at this point you might want to

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.510 
problems at this point you might want to
get<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.419> most<00:02:16.629> recent<00:02:16.959> version<00:02:17.620> of

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
get the most recent version of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.250 
get the most recent version of
which<00:02:18.940> I've<00:02:19.120> got<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.450> address<00:02:19.540> for<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.140> up

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
which I've got the address for it up

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.930 
which I've got the address for it up
there<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.710> that'll<00:02:21.250> take<00:02:21.400> care<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.700> some<00:02:21.850> of

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
there and that'll take care of some of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.200 
there and that'll take care of some of
the<00:02:22.000> usb3<00:02:22.570> problems<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.580> now<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> I've<00:02:25.030> done

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
the usb3 problems but now that I've done

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.180 
the usb3 problems but now that I've done
this<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.600> go<00:02:25.780> ahead<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.260> try<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.530> flash<00:02:26.890> to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
this I go ahead and I try to flash to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.400 
this I go ahead and I try to flash to
the<00:02:27.280> firmware<00:02:27.600> for<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.720> transmitter<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the firmware for the transmitter and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.920 
the firmware for the transmitter and
there<00:02:30.070> goes<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.760> flashed<00:02:31.060> correctly<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
there goes and it flashed correctly and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.090 
there goes and it flashed correctly and
voila<00:02:32.890> problem<00:02:33.580> solved
