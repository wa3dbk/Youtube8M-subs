00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.310 

it's<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> big<00:01:08.820> open<00:01:09.149> space<00:01:09.659> right<00:01:09.930> now<00:01:10.079> and

this whole area is going to be turned
into<00:01:12.329> like<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> incubation<00:01:13.680> co-working

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
into like a incubation co-working

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
into like a incubation co-working
environment<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.869> still<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.560> gonna<00:01:16.710> probably

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
environment it still it's gonna probably

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.789 
environment it still it's gonna probably
take<00:01:17.040> six<00:01:17.340> months<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.759> really<00:01:18.259> gentrify<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.320> so

spread<00:02:03.869> lieth<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.709> also<00:02:04.830> just<00:02:05.009> like

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
spread lieth in but also just like

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.039

things<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.000> office<00:02:06.330> space<00:02:06.509> there's<00:02:06.899> just

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
things like office space there's just

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.589 
things like office space there's just
not<00:02:07.229> enough<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.679> accommodate<00:02:08.130> everyone<00:02:08.599> so

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
not enough to accommodate everyone so

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.599 
not enough to accommodate everyone so
filling<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.799> not<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:10.979> problem<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.489> it's

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:11.609 
filling it up is not a problem and it's

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.740 
filling it up is not a problem and it's
not<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.940> hurt<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.269> other<00:02:12.299> co<00:02:12.600> work

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
not going to hurt the other co work

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.910 
not going to hurt the other co work
environments<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.350> fact<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:13.680> I'll<00:02:13.829> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
environments in fact I think I'll be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.970 
environments in fact I think I'll be
very<00:02:14.070> complimentary<00:02:15.079> but<00:02:16.079> really<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.709> going

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
very complimentary but really it's going

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.530 
very complimentary but really it's going
to<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.549> going<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.850> have<00:02:17.970> its<00:02:18.090> own<00:02:18.180> biome

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
to be it's going to have its own biome
