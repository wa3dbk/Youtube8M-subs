00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.980
 yeah 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.430
 yo everyone opened a small 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.209
 video so it'll be a pretty video 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.939
 quick 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.950
 it's just to show you how 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.090
 to connect in tandem not feel 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.070
 blocker think a lot tell me that 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.800
 the blocker pack makes that buggy and 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.560
 by the way that's true and so a lot 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.669
 ask me if I could connect 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.910
 alive because he wanted me 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.230
 connects years he passes with them they me 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.480
 asked how I did it for 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.200
 his boxing boxing to disconnect them and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.910
 all that so you can see me 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.760
 the game dairy for me it's a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.780
 special trick because it's a patch 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.510
 is for example there when I do 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.719
 information this is a point 1.13 the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.969
 strong modern version 2 and lcl to 1.11 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.809
 so I'm not above 1.13 and 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.239
 yet I can surely go from one 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.300
 strong 2 quietly so in fact for 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.989
 that 's going to be very simple you have in 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.960
 your network settings as usual 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.940
 so always have to go then 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.710
 made custom so we do not eat 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.370
 simple but settings as soon as you 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.690
 get to serock if you do used 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.500
 is there in the proxy server or I had 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:24.820
 marked this ip 210 points 101 points 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.050
 131 points 231 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.990
 so that's when you did that where 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.210
 m you put hockey in port number 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.570
 you're going to put 80 80 so no that's it 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.690
 is already 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.940
 there is no need to add your bags 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.730
 at home I spent my connection there you 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.950
 this is a small passage you 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.100
 have it validated and actually not if the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.540
 connection you leave previous here 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.080
 you will see that there it is 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.490
 connect 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.680
 so this is once the connection in 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.520
 course when I'm going to wait for a little 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.000
 little i'm going i'm gonna click on it 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.070
 so we expected actually sold is because 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.810
 that there are ip like that where he has to 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.580
 to have I do not know how we called it 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.710
 I do not find the words of the servers or 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.940
 things like that that handles ip so 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.090
 that's where you see I'm connected 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.970
 psn I have no update above 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.050
 on mana lighthouse 2 and yet you go 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.069
 see that as soon as I will launch the game 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.200
 it's good and 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.030
 and for those who do not know that they do not 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.069
 do not really know how that is 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.049
 can still use the lobbies surely 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.519
 Garrafach of all German hackers 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.569
 who have patches they do not have the setting 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.530
 a bench 14 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.569
 we're still at 1.13 actually that's not 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.920
 do not stop me at all two good days 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.939
 sorry if you hear good game I 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.870
 going to do that was multi player at 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.829
 continue towards multiplayer so the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.060
 only to put a little time and you 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.700
 see that I will connect but 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.859
 without any problem and that all 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.129
 parties it will be parties with people 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:56.900
 that are updating 1.14 this is what 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:00.439
 will not be departed how the by pass 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 1.11 where people really is 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.530
 boring when there are the all the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.609
 parties to 101 kg and the dance is going 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.569
 really help normal part so we 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:15.239
 wait a little bit that his load 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.040
 it inevitably takes time for this bah 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.639
 that you subscribe to the chain on it 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.169
 see here is so here I connect and 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.139
 then there are all the steps in sight 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.340
 connect super fast 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:31.530
 There you go 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.599
 so do not forget I'm doing lobby mw's 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.209
 mw3 echoes of 4 so if you need 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.620
 in the dawn there is a lobby which by 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.540
 against it's paying I want to remind 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.750
 but it's really cheap frankly 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.640
 it does not exceed the five stars pasqua and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.290
 well I 'll put my script in the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.510
 description and then do not hesitate to me 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.220
 contact so here and even not added 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.950
 on that account because it's not my 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.690
 time at the baths here I think I 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.430
 see on this video I may have 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.299
 sent this video to a channel 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.790
 communal 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.530

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.190
