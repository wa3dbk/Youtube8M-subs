00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.090
 it just has to go fast and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 that's why I have that here today 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.650
 Fingernails simply in one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.970
 beautiful red of essence lay here 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.670
 I'll show you what this is after 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.710
 one is and then you can just 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.900
 vary on which finger you exactly 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.000
 the glitter nail polish on it and so on 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.590
 then sees the result of it completely 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.230
 done very fast that's just 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.030
 the ring finger now with me the with 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.560
 a glitzerbody varnish or top coat 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.480
 just went over it again 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.310
 and then you already have this result 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.570
 and it's super fast super easy 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.339
 So I really wanted something 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.630
 straightforward do it for you and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.219
 Of course, hope that here 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.840
 to accept inspiration so that you can 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.590
 simple which has its home 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.539
 Tried then we start 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.429
 together you see my here now 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.109
 nails completely without nail polish and that 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.240
 The first thing I do is one 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.729
 clear varnish give up with it 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.899
 we protect the nails from discoloration 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 and just one for that 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.499
 more even surface get it 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.759
 red nail polish to me afterwards it 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:31.759
 give a really nice look 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.360
 when we are done with it is natural 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.040
 the big question with which red 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.620
 nail polish we work today i have 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.660
 here are a few legend and the color 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.830
 for I have decided 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.980
 of essenens- and indeed the phase 113 and 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.330
 do you speak lafontaines of the kalypso 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.110
 now just normal here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.110
 to paint the fingernails red 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.469
 we come to the highlight of the whole and 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.290
 Although the tipper nail polish I have now 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.989
 that of essens the color 001 confetti 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.069
 and give it to me on the ring finger 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.299
 on it if I have decided 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.549
 that I only on the ring finger 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.560
 do that with those nail polish then 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.420
 Just a little bit on it 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.280

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.109
