live up to the moment at that point in

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.729 
live up to the moment at that point in
the<00:00:32.469> game<00:00:32.500> it<00:00:32.890> was<00:00:33.010> 00<00:00:33.699> and<00:00:34.300> we<00:00:34.690> had<00:00:34.809> 75<00:00:35.289> minutes

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
to win the game and I think we've been

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.240 
to win the game and I think we've been
in<00:00:37.480> that<00:00:37.570> situation<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:38.530> know<00:00:38.620> several<00:00:38.890> times

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
in that situation you know several times

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.919 
in that situation you know several times
this<00:00:39.429> year<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:40.000> wasn't<00:00:40.329> a<00:00:40.359> crisis<00:00:40.780> situation

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
this year it wasn't a crisis situation

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.400 
this year it wasn't a crisis situation
but<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.649> urgency<00:00:42.160> of<00:00:42.190> us<00:00:42.519> being<00:00:43.089> able<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.570> keep

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
but the urgency of us being able to keep

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.310 
but the urgency of us being able to keep
the<00:00:44.589> ball<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.039> when<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.309> game<00:00:45.489> was<00:00:45.519> certainly

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the ball and when the game was certainly

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.349 
the ball and when the game was certainly
the<00:00:47.320> urgency<00:00:47.769> was<00:00:47.949> elevated<00:00:48.519> in<00:00:48.609> my<00:00:48.730> opinion<00:00:49.030> I

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:49.359 
the urgency was elevated in my opinion I

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.910 
the urgency was elevated in my opinion I
think<00:00:49.420> one<00:00:49.839> of<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:49.960> biggest<00:00:50.140> plays<00:00:50.440> on<00:00:50.679> it<00:00:50.800> was

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
think one of the biggest plays on it was

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.770 
think one of the biggest plays on it was
the<00:00:51.039> third<00:00:51.160> down<00:00:51.429> conversion<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.089> Darvin<00:00:52.510> ham

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
the third down conversion to Darvin ham

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.259 
the third down conversion to Darvin ham
takes<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.320> snap<00:00:53.379> fire<00:00:53.859> to<00:00:54.100> Adam<00:00:54.429> and<00:00:54.579> he<00:00:54.940> takes

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
takes the snap fire to Adam and he takes

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.849 
takes the snap fire to Adam and he takes
it<00:00:55.449> away<00:00:55.539> from<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.989> defender<00:00:56.289> again<00:00:56.649> at<00:00:56.769> the

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
it away from the defender again at the

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.220 
it away from the defender again at the
19<00:00:57.339> yard<00:00:57.550> line<00:00:57.730> that<00:00:58.269> guy<00:00:58.629> had<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:58.899> covered

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
19 yard line that guy had it covered

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.649 
19 yard line that guy had it covered
completely<00:00:59.710> well<00:01:00.249> and<00:01:00.550> cam<00:01:01.089> throws<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> bullet

completely well and cam throws a bullet

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.270 
completely well and cam throws a bullet
over<00:01:01.929> then<00:01:02.109> Darvin<00:01:02.499> makes<00:01:02.679> the<00:01:02.800> catch<00:01:03.039> and<00:01:03.190> if

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280
