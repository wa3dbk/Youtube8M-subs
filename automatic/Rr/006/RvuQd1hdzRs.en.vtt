00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
added two I removed the mp40 that was on

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.480 
added two I removed the mp40 that was on
this<00:00:13.559> side<00:00:14.269> and<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.389> had<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> 2j<00:00:16.109> below<00:00:16.320> WP<00:00:16.800> 40<00:00:17.160> on

this side and I had a 2j below WP 40 on

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.060 
this side and I had a 2j below WP 40 on
the<00:00:17.609> top<00:00:17.850> along<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.810> already<00:00:19.619> had<00:00:19.859> those

two<00:00:20.340> tons<00:00:20.640> II<00:00:20.850> 6105<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.279> then<00:00:23.960> on<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.560> top

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
two tons II 6105 and then on the top

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
two tons II 6105 and then on the top
side<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:29.960> changed<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.019> my<00:00:31.080> lighting

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
side I changed up my lighting

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.000 
side I changed up my lighting
arrangement<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.279> added<00:00:33.110> two<00:00:34.110> 250<00:00:35.070> watt<00:00:35.550> hty

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010

arrangement and added two 250 watt hty
15k<00:00:38.010> metal<00:00:38.399> halide<00:00:38.550> bulbs<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.829> along<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
15k metal halide bulbs to go along the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.000 
15k metal halide bulbs to go along the
reef<00:00:41.579> breeder<00:00:42.440> LEDs<00:00:44.570> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> reason<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.079> for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
reef breeder LEDs on the reason for for

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
reef breeder LEDs on the reason for for
doing<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.430> excuse<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.000> little<00:00:48.210> chihuahuas

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
doing this excuse my little chihuahuas

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.420 
doing this excuse my little chihuahuas
the<00:00:49.770> only<00:00:49.950> reason<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.309> doing<00:00:50.700> this<00:00:52.399> was<00:00:53.399> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
the only reason for doing this was that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
the only reason for doing this was that
the<00:00:54.000> VA<00:00:54.180> chose<00:00:55.219> an<00:00:56.219> LEDs<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.090> didn't<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the VA chose an LEDs I didn't like the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.189 
the VA chose an LEDs I didn't like the
combination<00:00:58.340> being<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.420> LEDs<00:01:00.840> are<00:01:01.050> more

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
combination being that the LEDs are more

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100 
combination being that the LEDs are more
directional<00:01:02.300> light<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.719> my<00:01:03.870> Miller

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
directional light so like my Miller

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.370 
directional light so like my Miller
porous<00:01:05.330> weren't<00:01:06.330> getting<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> under<00:01:06.960> shading

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
porous weren't getting the under shading

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.469 
porous weren't getting the under shading
they<00:01:07.530> were<00:01:07.590> needing<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.369> halide<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
they were needing like the halide the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
they were needing like the halide the
livers<00:01:10.100> might<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> little<00:01:11.520> overkill<00:01:11.790> I'm

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
livers might be a little overkill I'm

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
livers might be a little overkill I'm
sure<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.720> far<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.080> wattage<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.680> power

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
sure it is as far as wattage and power

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.719 
sure it is as far as wattage and power
but<00:01:14.869> that's<00:01:16.130> what<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> went<00:01:17.460> with

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but that's what I went with

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:26.950 
but that's what I went with
and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.550 

and<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.860> also<00:01:28.100> added<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:30.070> tablet<00:01:31.750> for<00:01:32.750> my<00:01:32.960> reef

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
and I also added a tablet for my reef

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.900 
and I also added a tablet for my reef
controller<00:01:35.680> my<00:01:36.680> reef<00:01:36.860> angel<00:01:37.280> reef<00:01:37.430> controller

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
controller my reef angel reef controller

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:46.990 
controller my reef angel reef controller
I<00:01:38.740> like<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:41.200> pretty<00:01:42.200> cool

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.660 

on<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.119> backside<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:49.140> added<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:50.330> calc<00:01:51.330> reactor

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
on the backside I added a calc reactor

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.690 
on the backside I added a calc reactor
us<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.420> along<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:58.580> concept<00:01:59.580> of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
us to go along with the concept of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.100 
us to go along with the concept of
calcium<00:02:00.090> reactor<00:02:00.420> already<00:02:00.630> head<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
calcium reactor already head and then I

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
calcium reactor already head and then I
added<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.610> brief<00:02:02.610> octopus<00:02:04.310> dual<00:02:06.320> blade<00:02:07.819> camera

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
added a brief octopus dual blade camera

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.839 
added a brief octopus dual blade camera
neck<00:02:09.030> cleaner<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.700> mounted<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> jaybo

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
neck cleaner and I mounted the jaybo

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.940 
neck cleaner and I mounted the jaybo
controllers<00:02:14.849> over<00:02:15.209> here<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.530> run<00:02:16.739> them<00:02:16.860> in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
controllers over here and I run them in

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.280 
controllers over here and I run them in
wave<00:02:17.190> mode<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.480> tons<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.140> other

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
wave mode and the tons is on the other

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.699 
wave mode and the tons is on the other
side<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:23.569> along<00:02:24.569> with<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:24.870> pad<00:02:25.110> cut<00:02:25.530> out

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
side here along with that pad cut out

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.229 
side here along with that pad cut out
just<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.700> little

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
just a little

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.430 
just a little
rigging<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.350> did<00:02:28.610> nothing<00:02:29.610> impressive<00:02:30.410> but<00:02:31.410> uh

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
rigging I did nothing impressive but uh

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.559 
rigging I did nothing impressive but uh
yeah<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.910> showing<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.269> guys<00:02:33.390> the
