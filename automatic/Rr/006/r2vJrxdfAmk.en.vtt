Russell<00:04:00.330> Wilson<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> then<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.230> fullback<00:04:01.560> I'll

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.020 
guy and I think that should pretty much
to<00:04:07.290> do<00:04:07.530> with<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> orphans<00:04:08.430> once<00:04:08.579> again<00:04:08.790> hike

pretty<00:04:22.680> simple

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
pretty simple

pretty simple
to<00:04:24.129> show<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.490> corvex<00:04:24.909> in<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.150> game<00:04:25.330> are<00:04:25.479> like

00:04:25.559 --> 00:04:25.569 
to show this corvex in the game are like

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:27.719 
to show this corvex in the game are like
five<00:04:25.930> ten<00:04:26.289> for<00:04:26.499> the<00:04:26.560> most<00:04:26.770> part<00:04:27.009> so<00:04:27.219> we're<00:04:27.699> just

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
five ten for the most part so we're just

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.249 
five ten for the most part so we're just
gonna<00:04:27.879> get<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> few<00:04:28.300> five<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.659> ten<00:04:28.810> cornerbacks

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
gonna get a few five to ten cornerbacks

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.629 
gonna get a few five to ten cornerbacks
and<00:04:29.469> that<00:04:29.560> should<00:04:29.710> pretty<00:04:29.860> much<00:04:29.919> do<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.430> and

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
and that should pretty much do it and

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.279 
and that should pretty much do it and
therefore<00:04:30.939> defensive<00:04:31.419> end<00:04:31.629> I<00:04:31.659> might<00:04:31.870> get<00:04:32.020> Jew

therefore defensive end I might get Jew

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.769 
therefore defensive end I might get Jew

on<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.330> team<00:05:07.509> but<00:05:07.659> if<00:05:07.750> not<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:08.199> think<00:05:08.469> we're

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
on the team but if not I think we're

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.499 
on the team but if not I think we're
guilty<00:05:08.680> Neal<00:05:09.099> and<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.580> think<00:05:09.789> of<00:05:09.969> a<00:05:10.029> pac-man<00:05:10.270> I'm

us again four linebackers I don't know I

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.070 
us again four linebackers I don't know I
think<00:05:12.400> Bobby<00:05:12.849> Wagner<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.360> kind<00:05:13.509> of<00:05:13.599> shorts<00:05:13.930> we

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
think Bobby Wagner is kind of shorts we

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.200 
think Bobby Wagner is kind of shorts we
might<00:05:14.289> be<00:05:14.379> able<00:05:14.529> to<00:05:14.590> use<00:05:14.740> him<00:05:14.949> he's<00:05:15.490> only<00:05:15.729> six

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
might be able to use him he's only six

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.329 
might be able to use him he's only six
foot<00:05:16.479> but<00:05:16.629> I'm<00:05:16.719> not<00:05:16.810> sure<00:05:17.110> who's<00:05:17.860> shorter<00:05:18.219> than

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:18.339 
foot but I'm not sure who's shorter than

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.769 
foot but I'm not sure who's shorter than
six<00:05:18.669> foot<00:05:18.909> two<00:05:19.000> plays<00:05:19.180> in<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.360> linebacker

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
six foot two plays in the linebacker

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:20.790 
six foot two plays in the linebacker
just<00:05:20.020> going<00:05:20.169> through<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.349> cards<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:20.650> I<00:05:20.770> have

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
just going through the cards that I have

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.070 
just going through the cards that I have
once<00:05:21.159> again<00:05:21.400> six<00:05:22.150> foots<00:05:22.389> pretty<00:05:22.479> much<00:05:22.810> bare

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
once again six foots pretty much bare

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.899 
once again six foots pretty much bare
minimum<00:05:23.589> for<00:05:23.830> that<00:05:23.860> flying<00:05:24.219> backer<00:05:24.430> position

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
minimum for that flying backer position

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.459 
minimum for that flying backer position
that<00:05:25.240> an<00:05:25.330> outside<00:05:25.719> linebackers<00:05:26.229> you<00:05:26.349> like

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
that an outside linebackers you like

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:29.070 
that an outside linebackers you like
length<00:05:26.889> so<00:05:27.279> I<00:05:27.310> think<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.849> think<00:05:28.360> six<00:05:28.659> foot<00:05:28.990> is

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
length so I think I think six foot is

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.659 
length so I think I think six foot is
that<00:05:29.259> short<00:05:29.650> as<00:05:29.770> we're<00:05:29.919> gonna<00:05:30.009> be<00:05:30.099> able<00:05:30.279> to<00:05:30.430> cut

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
that short as we're gonna be able to cut

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.189 
that short as we're gonna be able to cut
it<00:05:30.789> when<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.300> comes<00:05:31.389> to<00:05:31.599> linebacker<00:05:32.020> so<00:05:32.169> I

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
it when it comes to linebacker so I

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.350 
it when it comes to linebacker so I
think<00:05:32.379> Bobby<00:05:32.529> Wagner<00:05:32.740> might<00:05:33.610> be<00:05:33.819> the<00:05:33.939> middle

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
think Bobby Wagner might be the middle

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.850 
think Bobby Wagner might be the middle
linebacker<00:05:34.719> for<00:05:34.960> us<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.259> think<00:05:35.500> Bobby<00:05:35.680> Wagner

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
linebacker for us I think Bobby Wagner

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.499 
linebacker for us I think Bobby Wagner
will<00:05:36.189> be<00:05:36.250> able<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.550> get<00:05:36.639> it<00:05:36.729> done<00:05:36.909> quickly

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
will be able to get it done quickly

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:38.909 
will be able to get it done quickly
let's<00:05:37.810> check<00:05:37.960> out<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.110> outside<00:05:38.139> linebackers

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
let's check out the outside linebackers

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.309 
let's check out the outside linebackers
Harrison<00:05:39.339> is<00:05:39.490> how<00:05:39.580> far<00:05:39.819> he's<00:05:40.270> six<00:05:40.569> foot<00:05:40.810> ok<00:05:41.139> I

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
Harrison is how far he's six foot ok I

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.170 
Harrison is how far he's six foot ok I
think<00:05:41.469> we<00:05:41.680> could<00:05:41.800> do<00:05:41.889> Harrison<00:05:42.339> James

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
think we could do Harrison James

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.579 
think we could do Harrison James
Harrison<00:05:43.569> might<00:05:43.719> be<00:05:43.839> an<00:05:43.899> option<00:05:44.050> Carrigan's

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589 
Harrison might be an option Carrigan's

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.110 
Harrison might be an option Carrigan's

part<00:06:57.599> and<00:06:58.020> right<00:06:58.199> guess<00:06:58.380> we're<00:06:58.530> done<00:06:58.740> at<00:06:59.160> least

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
part and right guess we're done at least

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.040 
part and right guess we're done at least
so<00:06:59.580> if<00:06:59.639> the<00:06:59.759> offers<00:07:00.030> been<00:07:00.060> office<00:07:00.479> is<00:07:00.630> nice<00:07:00.810> and

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050

so if the offers been office is nice and
usually<00:07:01.470> good<00:07:01.680> so<00:07:01.830> this<00:07:01.919> is<00:07:02.069> a<00:07:02.130> quality

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
usually good so this is a quality

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:08.360 
my own line helps that out a lot but
once<00:07:06.060> again<00:07:06.180> equality<00:07:06.780> ass<00:07:07.229> offense<00:07:07.860> and<00:07:08.130> then
