creating that awareness that will

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
creating that awareness that will

minimize some of the controversy that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.219 
minimize some of the controversy that
has<00:02:05.399> surrounded<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.119> industry<00:02:06.509> flow<00:02:06.719> program

has surrounded the industry flow program

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.199 
has surrounded the industry flow program
that<00:02:07.439> was<00:02:07.560> mostly<00:02:08.340> associated<00:02:08.789> with

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that was mostly associated with

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.059 
that was mostly associated with
uncertainty<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.989> what<00:02:10.020> an<00:02:10.259> in-stream<00:02:10.560> flow<00:02:10.860> is

uncertainty of what an in-stream flow is

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.910 
uncertainty of what an in-stream flow is
