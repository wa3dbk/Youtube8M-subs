now<00:00:04.259> we're<00:00:04.440> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.680> talk<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:04.859> an<00:00:05.339> amazing

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
now we're going to talk about an amazing

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.080 
now we're going to talk about an amazing
technique<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.200> called<00:00:07.440> divided<00:00:08.309> Deco<00:00:08.730> or

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
technique that is called divided Deco or

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.930 
technique that is called divided Deco or
deco<00:00:09.660> division<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.679> here's<00:00:11.219> an<00:00:11.340> example<00:00:11.400> of

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
deco division and here's an example of

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.209 
deco division and here's an example of
it<00:00:12.059> right<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> divider<00:00:13.500> which

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
it right here we have a divider which

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.960 
it right here we have a divider which
makes<00:00:14.940> two<00:00:15.450> compartments<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.710> my<00:00:17.190> deco<00:00:17.550> now

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
makes two compartments in my deco now

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.060 
makes two compartments in my deco now
what<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:18.630> amazing<00:00:18.900> about<00:00:19.289> this<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.949> what

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
what is so amazing about this and what

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.920 
what is so amazing about this and what
makes<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.609> broad<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.600> no<00:00:21.689> single

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
makes it so broad that no single

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.900 
makes it so broad that no single
individual<00:00:22.650> will<00:00:22.859> ever<00:00:23.070> exhaust<00:00:23.699> its

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
individual will ever exhaust its

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.849 
individual will ever exhaust its
possibilities<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.199> fact<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.710> can

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
possibilities is the fact that you can

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.160 
possibilities is the fact that you can
put<00:00:26.070> down<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.550> pulp<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.359> different<00:00:27.720> pulp

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
put down one pulp here a different pulp

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.589 
put down one pulp here a different pulp
there<00:00:28.619> lift<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.640> raise<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> gate<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
there lift them up raise the gate and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.659 
there lift them up raise the gate and
you're<00:00:30.720> putting<00:00:30.900> down<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.560> at<00:00:31.949> least<00:00:32.340> two

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you're putting down to at least two

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.870 
you're putting down to at least two
popes<00:00:33.680> simultaneously<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> single<00:00:35.640> sheet

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
popes simultaneously into a single sheet

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.410 
popes simultaneously into a single sheet
that's<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.870> amazing<00:00:37.230> indeed<00:00:37.770> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
that's very amazing indeed the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.520 
that's very amazing indeed the
possibilities<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> options<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.410> are

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
possibilities and the options that are

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.069 
possibilities and the options that are
available<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.879> simply<00:00:42.600> countless

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
available on this are simply countless

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.930 
available on this are simply countless
let's<00:00:43.320> show<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> how<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.070> works<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.700> very

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
let's show you how it works in this very

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
let's show you how it works in this very
simple<00:00:45.480> form<00:00:45.930> we'll<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> water

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
simple form we'll put that in the water

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.500 
simple form we'll put that in the water
we<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.360> our<00:00:48.539> divider<00:00:48.989> down<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
we have our divider down there like that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.069 
we have our divider down there like that
will<00:00:51.510> pour<00:00:51.750> yellow<00:00:52.110> pulp<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.010> side<00:00:54.079> for

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
will pour yellow pulp in on one side for

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.569 
will pour yellow pulp in on one side for
blue<00:00:55.559> pulp<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:58.129> get<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.370> mixed

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
blue pulp in on the other get them mixed

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.349 
blue pulp in on the other get them mixed
like<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.800> lift<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.699> pull<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
like that lift it up and now we pull the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.920 
like that lift it up and now we pull the
divider<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.559> pulps<00:01:05.100> flow<00:01:05.430> together

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
divider and the two pulps flow together

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.210 
divider and the two pulps flow together
happen<00:01:06.930> quite<00:01:07.140> fast<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.130> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
happen quite fast and don't know if you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
happen quite fast and don't know if you
really<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> but<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
really have to see it but there it is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950 
really have to see it but there it is
and<00:01:10.470> notice<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.369> blue<00:01:11.549> pope<00:01:11.960> overflowed

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and notice that the blue pope overflowed

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.679 
and notice that the blue pope overflowed
the<00:01:13.500> yellow<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.939> never<00:01:15.150> knows<00:01:15.330> quite

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
the yellow and one never knows quite

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
the yellow and one never knows quite
which<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> overflow<00:01:16.890> so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
which one is going to overflow so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.880 
which one is going to overflow so
there's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.820> whole<00:01:17.970> field<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.650> discovery<00:01:19.650> right

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
there's a whole field of discovery right

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.830 
there's a whole field of discovery right
there<00:01:20.189> we'll<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> show<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
there we'll take that out and show you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.609 
there we'll take that out and show you
what<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.200> looks<00:01:22.409> like

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.950 

there<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.829> are<00:01:28.860> isn't<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.729> something<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.659> if

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
there we are isn't that something and if

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960 
there we are isn't that something and if
I<00:01:31.110> took<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:31.829> through<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.430> regular

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
I took that now through the regular

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
I took that now through the regular
paper<00:01:33.240> making<00:01:33.509> steps<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.290> pressing<00:01:34.770> drying

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
paper making steps of pressing drying

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.819 
paper making steps of pressing drying
and<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.610> forth<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.450> would<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.990> something

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
and so forth we would have something

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.730 
and so forth we would have something
like<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> wet<00:01:39.180> hand<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like this and I have a wet hand and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.990 
like this and I have a wet hand and
we're<00:01:40.860> getting<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.280> water<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.820> but

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
we're getting a little water there but

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
we're getting a little water there but
that<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.170> image<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:44.159> can

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
that is the kind of image this can

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.370 
that is the kind of image this can
produce<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.060> produce<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:45.630> fascinating

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
produce it can produce some fascinating

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
produce it can produce some fascinating

indeed<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.640> simply<00:02:06.030> take<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> tray<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
indeed you simply take a tray that is a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.949 
indeed you simply take a tray that is a
foam<00:02:08.160> board<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.780> food

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
foam board that they use for food

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.860 
foam board that they use for food
they've<00:02:10.739> cut<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.280> half

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
they've cut it in half

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.320 
they've cut it in half
have<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> very<00:02:12.500> straight<00:02:12.860> line<00:02:12.890> here<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:14.120> take

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
have a very straight line here we take

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.720 
have a very straight line here we take
that<00:02:14.540> straight<00:02:14.840> line<00:02:15.140> over<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.800> our<00:02:16.010> hand<00:02:16.400> mold

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
that straight line over to our hand mold

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.330 
that straight line over to our hand mold
we<00:02:17.690> hold<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.080> there<00:02:18.260> like<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.739> and<00:02:18.800> very

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
we hold it there like that and very

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.759 
we hold it there like that and very
carefully<00:02:19.910> mark<00:02:20.180> where<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.810> inside<00:02:21.319> edges<00:02:21.560> of

carefully mark where the inside edges of

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.089 
carefully mark where the inside edges of
the<00:02:22.430> molds<00:02:23.209> walls<00:02:23.480> come<00:02:23.900> when<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.680> have<00:02:24.860> done

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
the molds walls come when you have done

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.130 
the molds walls come when you have done
that<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.910> take<00:02:25.940> some<00:02:26.420> kind<00:02:26.599> of<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> straight

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
that you take some kind of a straight

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.770 
that you take some kind of a straight
edge<00:02:27.349> and<00:02:27.379> draw<00:02:27.860> an<00:02:28.040> absolutely<00:02:28.819> 90-degree

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
have done that you have this and that

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.360 
have done that you have this and that
becomes<00:02:42.459> your<00:02:43.459> divider<00:02:44.030> it<00:02:44.329> slides<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.959> easily

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370

have a professional carpenter build you

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.979 
have a professional carpenter build you
something<00:02:52.700> but<00:02:53.239> this<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.569> do<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.930> a

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
something but this you can do in a

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:54.940 
something but this you can do in a
matter<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.319> minutes

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
matter of minutes

when<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.549> wears<00:02:55.790> out<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.390> simply<00:02:57.260> make<00:02:57.530> a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
when this wears out you simply make a

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.300 
when this wears out you simply make a
new<00:02:57.799> one<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.190> that's<00:02:58.370> how<00:02:58.519> easy<00:02:58.579> it<00:02:58.940> is<00:03:00.310> now

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
new one so that's how easy it is now

many art and decorative effects you can
get<00:03:12.260> with<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.560> quite<00:03:12.829> amazing<00:03:13.310> technique

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
get with this quite amazing technique

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.240 
get with this quite amazing technique
here<00:03:14.569> we<00:03:14.720> are<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:15.170> one<00:03:15.319> that<00:03:15.530> we<00:03:15.650> showed<00:03:15.980> you

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
here we are the one that we showed you

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.120 
here we are the one that we showed you
and<00:03:16.549> this<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:17.389> sheet<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.440> we<00:03:18.620> made<00:03:18.829> with

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
and this is the sheet that we made with

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.319 
and this is the sheet that we made with
it<00:03:19.340> now<00:03:19.819> an<00:03:20.060> important<00:03:20.600> thing<00:03:20.660> about<00:03:20.959> this

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
it now an important thing about this

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.300 
it now an important thing about this
technique<00:03:23.329> is<00:03:23.510> that<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.170> get<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.680> two-sided

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
technique is that you get a two-sided

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.120 
technique is that you get a two-sided
sheet<00:03:25.880> here<00:03:26.630> is<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.109> top<00:03:27.319> side<00:03:27.560> where<00:03:27.889> one

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
sheet here is the top side where one

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.240 
sheet here is the top side where one
pope<00:03:28.940> flowed<00:03:29.599> over<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.959> other<00:03:30.200> and<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:31.160> you

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
pope flowed over the other and if you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.849 
pope flowed over the other and if you
turn<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.639> around<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.720> have<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.989> very<00:03:33.410> sharp

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
turn it around you have a very sharp

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.220 
turn it around you have a very sharp
definition<00:03:34.190> between<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.030> two<00:03:35.180> Pope's<00:03:35.660> that

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
definition between the two Pope's that

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.780 
definition between the two Pope's that
will<00:03:36.380> be<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.530> feature<00:03:36.829> of<00:03:37.010> every<00:03:37.250> sheet<00:03:37.639> that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
will be a feature of every sheet that

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.750 
will be a feature of every sheet that
you<00:03:37.970> make<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.569> fashion<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.489> course

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
you make in this fashion and of course

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.059 
you make in this fashion and of course
you<00:03:41.090> would<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.299> have<00:03:41.690> had<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:42.049> pull<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.859> gate

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
you would not have had to pull the gate

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.640 
you would not have had to pull the gate
if<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.489> did<00:03:43.730> not<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.569> could<00:03:44.750> make<00:03:44.930> two<00:03:44.959> small

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
if you did not you could make two small

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.759 
if you did not you could make two small
sheets<00:03:46.040> at<00:03:46.250> once<00:03:46.519> or<00:03:47.150> if<00:03:47.720> you're<00:03:48.169> working<00:03:48.440> with

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
sheets at once or if you're working with

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.039 
sheets at once or if you're working with
our<00:03:48.980> pro<00:03:49.370> kit<00:03:49.669> eight-and-a-half<00:03:50.359> by<00:03:50.599> eleven

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.289 
our pro kit eight-and-a-half by eleven
you<00:03:51.530> could<00:03:51.709> make<00:03:51.919> two<00:03:52.130> sheets<00:03:52.459> like<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:53.000> at

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
you could make two sheets like that at

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.229 
you could make two sheets like that at
once<00:03:53.660> that's<00:03:54.079> without<00:03:54.349> pulling<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.310> gate<00:03:55.609> so

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
once that's without pulling the gate so

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.770 
once that's without pulling the gate so
here<00:03:56.480> we<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:56.959> an<00:03:57.290> example<00:03:57.950> of<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.780> paper

mill<00:04:00.079> we<00:04:00.859> have<00:04:01.040> mixed<00:04:01.400> techniques<00:04:01.880> there's<00:04:02.750> a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
mill we have mixed techniques there's a

mill we have mixed techniques there's a
plain<00:04:03.349> pulp<00:04:03.739> there<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.669> a<00:04:04.700> botanical

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
plain pulp there is a botanical

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
plain white and here a technique of

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.789 
plain white and here a technique of
turning<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.870> blender<00:04:12.230> off<00:04:12.410> before

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
turning the blender off before

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.949 
turning the blender off before
everything<00:04:13.190> comes<00:04:13.400> apart<00:04:13.579> on<00:04:14.030> one<00:04:14.269> side<00:04:14.540> and

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
everything comes apart on one side and

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.589 
everything comes apart on one side and
plain<00:04:15.470> pulp<00:04:15.829> on<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.280> other<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.729> again<00:04:16.849> you

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
plain pulp on the other and again you

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.099 
plain pulp on the other and again you
always<00:04:17.989> have<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.530> two-sided<00:04:19.160> sheet<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.659> if<00:04:20.989> you

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
always have a two-sided sheet and if you

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.520 
always have a two-sided sheet and if you
can<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.769> with<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
can do that with the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.710 
can do that with the
little<00:04:24.530> one<00:04:24.680> we<00:04:24.860> can<00:04:25.129> also<00:04:25.310> go<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.759> our<00:04:26.150> big<00:04:26.539> one

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
little one we can also go to our big one

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960 
little one we can also go to our big one
divide<00:04:27.080> it<00:04:27.229> the<00:04:27.349> same<00:04:27.590> way<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.069> look<00:04:28.610> at<00:04:28.729> this

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
divide it the same way and look at this

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.510 
divide it the same way and look at this
there<00:04:29.300> you<00:04:29.449> have<00:04:29.629> the<00:04:29.780> sharp<00:04:30.050> definition<00:04:30.520> and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
there you have the sharp definition and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.189 
there you have the sharp definition and
if<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.849> turn<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.210> around<00:04:32.270> look<00:04:32.750> at<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:32.990> flow

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
if you turn it around look at the flow

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.469 
if you turn it around look at the flow
over<00:04:33.500> that<00:04:33.830> occurred<00:04:34.189> on<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:34.969> one<00:04:35.210> quite

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
over that occurred on this one quite

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.450 
over that occurred on this one quite
amazing<00:04:35.990> practically<00:04:36.530> everything<00:04:36.830> purple

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
amazing practically everything purple

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.800 
amazing practically everything purple
and<00:04:37.810> again<00:04:38.810> a<00:04:38.840> more<00:04:39.229> subtle<00:04:40.330> division<00:04:41.330> here

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
and again a more subtle division here

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.580 
and again a more subtle division here
and<00:04:42.469> you<00:04:43.280> don't<00:04:43.550> have<00:04:43.849> to<00:04:44.180> stop<00:04:44.569> when<00:04:44.990> you<00:04:45.169> have

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
and you don't have to stop when you have

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.879 
and you don't have to stop when you have
done<00:04:46.069> the<00:04:46.599> divided<00:04:47.599> deco<00:04:47.840> technique<00:04:48.409> you<00:04:48.710> can

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
done the divided deco technique you can

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.580 
done the divided deco technique you can
add<00:04:49.099> to<00:04:49.370> it<00:04:49.400> after<00:04:49.909> you've<00:04:50.060> made<00:04:50.300> your<00:04:50.590> divided

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
add to it after you've made your divided

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.999 
add to it after you've made your divided
deca<00:04:51.830> sheet<00:04:52.219> you<00:04:52.879> can<00:04:53.210> do<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.479> bit<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.009> the

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
deca sheet you can do a bit of the

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.790 
deca sheet you can do a bit of the
technique<00:04:55.610> we<00:04:55.789> have<00:04:56.090> just<00:04:56.360> shown<00:04:56.599> you<00:04:57.229> in

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
technique we have just shown you in

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.119 
technique we have just shown you in
these<00:04:58.099> sense<00:04:58.699> and<00:04:59.240> one<00:05:00.020> shown<00:05:00.500> in<00:05:00.530> another

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:01.129 
these sense and one shown in another

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.029 
these sense and one shown in another
volume<00:05:01.819> which<00:05:02.360> was<00:05:02.599> surface<00:05:03.050> embedment<00:05:03.469> so<00:05:03.860> by

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
volume which was surface embedment so by

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.980 
volume which was surface embedment so by
combining<00:05:04.520> techniques<00:05:05.150> he<00:05:05.659> didn't<00:05:05.840> have<00:05:05.960> a

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
combining techniques he didn't have a

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.260 
combining techniques he didn't have a
quite<00:05:06.319> striking<00:05:07.190> image<00:05:07.610> indeed<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:11.060> of

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
quite striking image indeed and of

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.390 
quite striking image indeed and of
course<00:05:11.449> another<00:05:11.659> option<00:05:12.169> is<00:05:12.349> to<00:05:12.680> divide<00:05:13.099> the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
course another option is to divide the

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.939 
course another option is to divide the
deckle<00:05:13.909> lengthwise<00:05:14.629> and<00:05:14.690> if<00:05:15.259> you<00:05:15.349> do<00:05:15.529> that<00:05:15.800> you

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
deckle lengthwise and if you do that you

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.040 
deckle lengthwise and if you do that you
can<00:05:16.099> make<00:05:16.310> some<00:05:16.789> very<00:05:16.969> beautiful<00:05:17.120> sheets<00:05:17.599> that

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
can make some very beautiful sheets that

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.140 
can make some very beautiful sheets that

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
same sheet and again you get two totally

using your imagination here you can

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.409 
using your imagination here you can
divide<00:06:15.349> the<00:06:15.560> deckle<00:06:15.979> at<00:06:16.370> a<00:06:16.729> different<00:06:17.180> angle

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
how about an angle giving you a color

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.820 
how about an angle giving you a color
there<00:06:23.060> a<00:06:23.089> color<00:06:23.509> there<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:23.900> what's<00:06:24.500> on<00:06:24.680> the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
other side a very nice meld of the two

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.550 
other side a very nice meld of the two
and<00:06:27.830> if<00:06:28.819> you<00:06:29.060> use<00:06:29.479> your<00:06:29.659> imagination<00:06:29.719> even

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
and if you use your imagination even

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.010 
and if you use your imagination even
further<00:06:30.949> how<00:06:31.219> about<00:06:31.459> three<00:06:31.849> divisions<00:06:32.810> a

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
further how about three divisions a

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.730 
further how about three divisions a
plain<00:06:33.259> pulp<00:06:33.589> a<00:06:33.740> plain<00:06:33.979> poke

and<00:06:34.830> one<00:06:35.069> where<00:06:35.280> we<00:06:35.430> turned<00:06:35.699> the<00:06:35.940> blender<00:06:36.449> off

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
and one where we turned the blender off

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.230 
and one where we turned the blender off
early<00:06:37.139> giving<00:06:37.590> us<00:06:37.889> that<00:06:38.160> on<00:06:38.430> that<00:06:38.669> side<00:06:38.970> and

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
early giving us that on that side and

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.480 
early giving us that on that side and
look<00:06:39.419> what<00:06:39.569> we<00:06:39.690> got<00:06:39.870> on<00:06:40.110> that<00:06:40.139> side<00:06:40.620> and<00:06:41.039> you

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
look what we got on that side and you

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.909 
look what we got on that side and you
can<00:06:41.639> even<00:06:41.849> go<00:06:42.150> to<00:06:42.210> four<00:06:42.539> or<00:06:42.840> more<00:06:42.870> if<00:06:43.680> you're

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
can even go to four or more if you're

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.249 
can even go to four or more if you're
capable<00:06:44.160> of<00:06:44.550> figuring<00:06:44.940> this<00:06:45.090> out<00:06:45.330> and<00:06:45.660> using

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
capable of figuring this out and using

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.129 
capable of figuring this out and using
it<00:06:46.380> and<00:06:46.560> there<00:06:47.099> is<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.520> m8<00:06:47.819> on<00:06:47.970> that<00:06:48.210> side<00:06:48.539> so

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
it and there is the m8 on that side so

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.550 
it and there is the m8 on that side so
this<00:06:49.560> is<00:06:49.919> a<00:06:50.419> technique<00:06:51.419> that<00:06:51.750> will<00:06:52.289> challenge
