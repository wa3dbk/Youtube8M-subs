all<00:00:03.179> right<00:00:03.330> so<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.720> my<00:00:04.549> first

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
all right so this is my first

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.360 
all right so this is my first
all-together<00:00:06.960> mock-up<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.890> my<00:00:08.130> motor

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
all-together mock-up of my motor

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.419 
all-together mock-up of my motor
controller<00:00:08.880> I've<00:00:09.150> got<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.860> control<00:00:10.860> board<00:00:11.190> in

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
controller I've got the control board in

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.519 
controller I've got the control board in
there<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.049> 6-pack<00:00:13.049> IGBT<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.360> both<00:00:15.360> capacitor<00:00:16.139> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
there a 6-pack IGBT a both capacitor and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.880 
there a 6-pack IGBT a both capacitor and
a<00:00:16.890> contactor<00:00:17.730> I've<00:00:18.690> got<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.199> all<00:00:19.470> running

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
a contactor I've got this all running

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
a contactor I've got this all running
off<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.570> this<00:00:21.570> power<00:00:21.869> supply<00:00:22.289> which<00:00:22.590> is

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
off of this power supply which is

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.070 
off of this power supply which is
mimicking<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.550> battery<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.869> power

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
mimicking the battery and the power

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.810 
mimicking the battery and the power
supply<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.410> also<00:00:25.800> supplying<00:00:26.220> an<00:00:26.460> inverter

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
supply is also supplying an inverter

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
supply is also supplying an inverter
which<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:28.140> mimicking<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.710> high<00:00:28.830> voltage

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
which is mimicking the high voltage

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.180 
which is mimicking the high voltage
battery<00:00:29.490> through<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:31.520> very<00:00:32.520> dangerous<00:00:32.820> looking

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
battery through a very dangerous looking

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.430 
battery through a very dangerous looking
rectifier<00:00:35.190> there<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.820> then<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.140> going

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
rectifier there and then that is going

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.069 
rectifier there and then that is going
in<00:00:37.860> providing<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> high<00:00:38.850> voltage<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.989> I'm

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in providing the high voltage what I'm

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.229 
in providing the high voltage what I'm
going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> show<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:42.320> pre<00:00:43.320> charge<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
going to show you is the pre charge and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
going to show you is the pre charge and
spin<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.270> sequence<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
spin up sequence of the of the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.360 
spin up sequence of the of the
controller<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> were<00:00:49.469> an<00:00:49.620> electric<00:00:50.129> car

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
controller as if it were an electric car

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
controller as if it were an electric car
so<00:00:51.329> right<00:00:52.170> now<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:54.239> ignition<00:00:54.780> key<00:00:55.170> would

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so right now it's the ignition key would

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.080 
so right now it's the ignition key would
be<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:55.980> position<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.600> showing

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
be in the on position which is showing

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.479 
be in the on position which is showing
as<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.329> see<00:01:00.449> nothing's<00:01:00.780> happening<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
as you can see nothing's happening the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.660 
as you can see nothing's happening the
contactor<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.520> open<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> batteries<00:01:05.400> or

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
contactor is open and the batteries or

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.880 
contactor is open and the batteries or
the<00:01:05.729> capacitors<00:01:06.570> only<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.229> 3<00:01:07.500> volts<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the capacitors only got about 3 volts of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.240 
the capacitors only got about 3 volts of
residual<00:01:08.280> charge<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.619> that's<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
residual charge on it that's because the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.200 
residual charge on it that's because the
main<00:01:11.520> battery<00:01:12.510> isn't<00:01:12.960> hooked<00:01:13.080> up<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:14.210> not

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
main battery isn't hooked up because not

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
main battery isn't hooked up because not
on<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.500> turn<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.920> inverter

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
on so when I turn on the inverter

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
on so when I turn on the inverter
that'll<00:01:17.630> simulate<00:01:18.630> having<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.500> high<00:01:20.009> voltage

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that'll simulate having a high voltage

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.580 
that'll simulate having a high voltage
battery<00:01:20.490> pack<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.750> capacitor<00:01:22.380> will

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
battery pack there the capacitor will

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.490 
battery pack there the capacitor will
then<00:01:22.710> pre<00:01:23.130> charge<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.500> controller

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
then pre charge when the controller

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.190 
then pre charge when the controller
detects<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.340> difference<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.450> less<00:01:27.689> than<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.990> volt

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
detects a difference of less than a volt

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
detects a difference of less than a volt
between<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.240> battery<00:01:30.240> voltage<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
between the battery voltage and the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
between the battery voltage and the
capacitor<00:01:31.320> voltage<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.799> charge<00:01:32.220> or

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
capacitor voltage it will charge or

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.330 
capacitor voltage it will charge or
it'll<00:01:33.210> engage<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> contactor<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> then

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
it'll engage the contactor and then

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.649 
it'll engage the contactor and then
allow<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.570> motor<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.770> controlled<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.540> I'll

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
allow the motor to be controlled so I'll

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.090 
allow the motor to be controlled so I'll
go<00:01:39.810> ahead<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.140> demonstrate<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.799> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
go ahead and demonstrate that for you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.499 
go ahead and demonstrate that for you
now

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
now

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:51.630 
now
so<00:01:42.509> turn<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> battery<00:01:43.740> pack<00:01:45.170> there's<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.700 

which<00:01:52.640> there<00:01:53.300> goes<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.690> contactor<00:01:54.320> so<00:01:54.590> it's

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
which there goes the contactor so it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.340 
which there goes the contactor so it's
detected<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.370> it<00:01:55.580> said<00:01:55.790> it's<00:01:55.970> ready<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.210> go

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
detected that it said it's ready to go

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:19.650 
detected that it said it's ready to go
so<00:01:57.350> I'll<00:01:57.440> go<00:01:57.590> ahead<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.390> turn<00:01:59.390> on<00:01:59.630> my<00:01:59.930> motor

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.300 

and<00:02:20.660> I've<00:02:20.810> also<00:02:20.959> got<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.349> set<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:21.920> when

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
and I've also got it set up so that when

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.040 
and I've also got it set up so that when
it<00:02:22.430> detects<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.910> low<00:02:23.060> voltage<00:02:23.269> it'll<00:02:23.720> go<00:02:23.840> ahead

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
it detects a low voltage it'll go ahead

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.930 
it detects a low voltage it'll go ahead
and<00:02:24.170> cut<00:02:24.319> out<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.709> if<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:24.950> start<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.519> motor<00:02:25.730> up

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and cut out so if I start the motor up

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.640 
and cut out so if I start the motor up
again<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:30.050> then<00:02:30.800> turn<00:02:31.160> off<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.310> battery<00:02:31.849> pack

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
again and then turn off the battery pack

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.670 
again and then turn off the battery pack
essentially<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:34.280> voltage<00:02:34.640> will<00:02:34.790> drop<00:02:34.910> from<00:02:35.239> a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
essentially the voltage will drop from a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.520 
essentially the voltage will drop from a
certain<00:02:36.680> point<00:02:38.019> contactor<00:02:39.019> opens<00:02:39.319> when<00:02:39.440> it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
certain point contactor opens when it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.920 
certain point contactor opens when it
detects<00:02:39.830> that<00:02:40.010> low<00:02:40.160> voltage<00:02:40.810> thanks<00:02:41.810> for

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
detects that low voltage thanks for

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230 
detects that low voltage thanks for
watching
