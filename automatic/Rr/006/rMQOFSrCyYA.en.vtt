00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
with all our clay pots is that we've

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880 
with all our clay pots is that we've
painted<00:01:19.270> them<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.500> can<00:01:20.619> see<00:01:20.740> that

spray<00:01:23.500> painting<00:01:24.100> them<00:01:24.310> I<00:01:24.549> realized<00:01:25.119> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
