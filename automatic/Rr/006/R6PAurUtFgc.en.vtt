00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.600 
the summary when you can see how many
seconds<00:02:42.500> they<00:02:42.620> are<00:02:42.650> on<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.860> road<00:02:43.070> or

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.460 

just<00:02:46.030> does<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.570> just<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:46.840> magnetic<00:02:47.170> back

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
just does it just this magnetic back

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.070 
just does it just this magnetic back
yeah

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.640 

kind<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.680> cadence<00:02:51.830> taste<00:02:52.160> plugin

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
kind of cadence taste plugin

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.920 
kind of cadence taste plugin
so<00:02:54.159> the<00:02:54.250> mountains<00:02:54.700> essence<00:02:55.090> system<00:02:55.599> is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
so the mountains essence system is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.460 
so the mountains essence system is
passive<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.970> cable<00:02:58.720> itself<00:02:59.049> it<00:02:59.440> actually

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
passive but the cable itself it actually

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.440 
passive but the cable itself it actually
removed<00:03:00.099> so<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.459> can<00:03:00.670> choose<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:01.030> first

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
removed so you can choose just first

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.360 
removed so you can choose just first
moment<00:03:01.840> for<00:03:01.930> device<00:03:02.170> or<00:03:02.440> later<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:02.980> became

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
moment for device or later there became

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.410 
moment for device or later there became
rather<00:03:04.239> queue<00:03:04.569> then<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:06.030> want<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.090> take<00:03:07.269> the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
rather queue then I want to take the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.710 
rather queue then I want to take the
device<00:03:07.690> to

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
device to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.570 
device to
have<00:03:09.290> some<00:03:09.440> not<00:03:09.590> to<00:03:09.710> something<00:03:10.040> whose<00:03:10.250> take<00:03:10.430> it

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
have some not to something whose take it

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.820 
have some not to something whose take it
out

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.050 

security<00:03:13.830> take<00:03:14.010> it<00:03:14.130> too<00:03:14.220> much<00:03:14.310> your<00:03:14.490> life<00:03:14.610> and

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
security take it too much your life and

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.000 
security take it too much your life and
then<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.720> cable<00:03:16.020> will<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.470> say<00:03:16.590> in<00:03:16.740> ears

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
then the cable will just say in ears

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.400 
then the cable will just say in ears
when<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.310> come<00:03:17.490> back<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:18.450> just<00:03:18.480> take<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.200> back

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
when you come back you just take it back

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.920 
when you come back you just take it back
in<00:03:19.590> two<00:03:19.680> places<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.250> magazine<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.240> slice<00:03:21.510> and

in two places the magazine to slice and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.250 
in two places the magazine to slice and
