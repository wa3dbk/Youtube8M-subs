actually familiar with Chinese writing
Chinese<00:01:28.049> writings<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:29.040> symbol<00:01:29.700> based<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
Chinese writings are symbol based and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
Chinese writings are symbol based and
apparently<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:30.960> first<00:01:31.320> symbol<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.799> here

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
apparently this first symbol right here

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.910 
apparently this first symbol right here
is<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> simplified<00:01:33.060> symbol<00:01:33.900> for<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> horse<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
is a simplified symbol for a horse I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.230 
is a simplified symbol for a horse I
don't<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:35.340> what's<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> other<00:01:35.880> three

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
don't know what's the other three

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.090 
don't know what's the other three
symbols<00:01:36.479> represent<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.350> four<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.920> them

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
symbols represent but four of them

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310 
symbols represent but four of them
together<00:01:38.310> creates<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.299> sentence<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.840> says

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
together creates a sentence that says

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.740 
together creates a sentence that says
when<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> horse<00:01:41.490> comes<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.240> brings<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
when the horse comes it brings you

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
when the horse comes it brings you
success<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.860> top<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.280> corner<00:01:44.460> right

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
success in the top right corner right

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
success in the top right corner right
here<00:01:44.820> you'll<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.659> three<00:01:45.960> symbols<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
here you'll see three symbols so the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.219 
here you'll see three symbols so the
third<00:01:47.460> symbol<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.060> never<00:01:48.689> changes

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
third symbol right here never changes

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.950 
third symbol right here never changes
and<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.619> symbol<00:01:49.860> means<00:01:50.310> ear<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:51.000> Chinese<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and this symbol means ear in Chinese the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.990 
and this symbol means ear in Chinese the
first<00:01:52.409> symbol<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.950> tells<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.490> blue<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
first symbol here tells you blue the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.120 
first symbol here tells you blue the
second<00:01:54.570> symbol<00:01:54.750> tells<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.380> horse<00:01:55.680> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
second symbol tells you horse so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.310 
second symbol tells you horse so
apparently<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.850> year<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.750> year<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
apparently this year is the year of the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
apparently this year is the year of the
blue<00:01:58.890> horse<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> first<00:02:00.090> heard<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.450> my

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
like a simplified way of the Chinese

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.830 
like a simplified way of the Chinese
character<00:02:17.040> for<00:02:17.070> horse<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.120> they<00:02:18.270> made<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.540> so
