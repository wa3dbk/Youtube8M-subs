my thoughts are kind of cool there are a
new<00:00:33.899> tire<00:00:34.140> technology<00:00:34.380> newer<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:36.059> been

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
new tire technology newer that's been

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.690 
new tire technology newer that's been
getting<00:00:36.420> better<00:00:36.600> every<00:00:36.870> year<00:00:37.579> better<00:00:38.579> than

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
getting better every year better than

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.850 
getting better every year better than
the<00:00:38.820> sense<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.270> they<00:00:40.079> wear<00:00:40.350> better<00:00:40.590> than<00:00:40.770> they

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the sense of they wear better than they

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.479 
the sense of they wear better than they
used<00:00:40.890> to

about<00:00:50.160> 100<00:00:50.640> miles<00:00:51.500> zero<00:00:52.500> air<00:00:52.710> pressure<00:00:53.750> let<00:00:54.750> me

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
about 100 miles zero air pressure let me

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.970 
about 100 miles zero air pressure let me
show<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.079> about<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.440> guy<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.890> we

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
so that well right there it's pretty

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.960 
so that well right there it's pretty
deep<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.740> there's<00:02:00.220> actually<00:02:00.520> one<00:02:00.550> smaller

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
deep and there's actually one smaller

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.190 
deep and there's actually one smaller
one<00:02:01.060> that's<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:01.479> forward<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:04.200> those

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
one that's just forward of it those
