long promised you so a little shot of my

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.639 
long promised you so a little shot of my
electrics<00:00:06.150> turbo<00:00:06.660> charger<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.230> put<00:00:07.500> in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
electrics turbo charger that I put in

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.990 
electrics turbo charger that I put in
supercharged<00:00:08.189> or<00:00:08.309> whatever<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> guys<00:00:08.760> want

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
supercharged or whatever you guys want

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.560 
supercharged or whatever you guys want
to<00:00:09.059> call<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:10.190> it's<00:00:11.190> sitting<00:00:11.639> resting<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
to call it it's sitting resting in the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.180 
to call it it's sitting resting in the
hole<00:00:12.750> comfortably<00:00:13.349> I'll<00:00:13.650> show<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.920> how<00:00:14.040> it's

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
hole comfortably I'll show you how it's

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.010 
hole comfortably I'll show you how it's
connected<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:16.100> put<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> metal<00:00:17.640> clamp<00:00:18.570> around<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
connected I put a metal clamp around the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.130 
connected I put a metal clamp around the
edge<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.910> it's<00:00:20.910> bracing<00:00:21.390> against<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
edge of it and it's bracing against the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.830 
edge of it and it's bracing against the
screw<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.650> put<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.609> see

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
screw that I put in so as you can see

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.099 
screw that I put in so as you can see
it's<00:00:24.840> able<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.170> rotate<00:00:25.350> but<00:00:26.220> stops<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.599> so

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it's able to rotate but stops just so

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
it's able to rotate but stops just so
it's<00:00:28.820> paralleled<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.000> doesn't<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.390> bad

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it's paralleled so doesn't look that bad

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.370 
it's paralleled so doesn't look that bad
as<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> wiring<00:00:32.550> goes<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
as for the wiring goes down from that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.049 
as for the wiring goes down from that
hole<00:00:35.300> under<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.329> fan<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.110> over<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.059> my

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
hole under the fan up and over and my

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
hole under the fan up and over and my
PSU<00:00:39.840> connections<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> other<00:00:40.829> side<00:00:42.920> close

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
PSU connections on the other side close

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.869 
PSU connections on the other side close
that<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:46.100> now<00:00:47.100> I've<00:00:47.219> been<00:00:47.309> running<00:00:47.550> primed

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
that back now I've been running primed

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.850 
that back now I've been running primed
for<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:49.649> over<00:00:50.100> an<00:00:50.550> hour<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:50.910> and

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
for a little over an hour now and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.049 
for a little over an hour now and
obviously<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.070> temps<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.550> pretty<00:00:53.820> hot

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
obviously my temps are pretty hot

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
obviously my temps are pretty hot
considering<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.809> at<00:00:54.930> 3.2<00:00:55.530> n<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> salmon

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
considering I'm at 3.2 n on a salmon

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.540 
considering I'm at 3.2 n on a salmon
cooler<00:00:57.800> plus<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> fact<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.789> about<00:01:00.500> C

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
cooler plus the fact that it's about C

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.100 
cooler plus the fact that it's about C
79<00:01:02.550> degrees<00:01:03.059> Fahrenheit<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.719> room<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.049> think

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
79 degrees Fahrenheit in my room I think

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
79 degrees Fahrenheit in my room I think
that<00:01:04.350> works<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.979> 25<00:01:05.549> 26<00:01:05.790> degrees

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
that works out to like 25 26 degrees

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.670 
that works out to like 25 26 degrees
Celsius<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.990> temps<00:01:10.500> are

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
Celsius so as you can see my temps are

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.719 
Celsius so as you can see my temps are
about<00:01:11.189> 65<00:01:11.640> degrees<00:01:12.240> Celsius<00:01:13.159> now<00:01:14.159> let's<00:01:14.520> see

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
about 65 degrees Celsius now let's see

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:32.469 
about 65 degrees Celsius now let's see
what<00:01:14.880> they<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> fan<00:01:15.659> comes<00:01:16.020> on

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.569 

okay<00:01:33.020> right<00:01:33.229> away<00:01:33.439> we<00:01:33.590> see<00:01:33.829> just<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.130> little<00:01:34.369> two

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
okay right away we see just a little two

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.819 
okay right away we see just a little two
degree<00:01:34.880> drop<00:01:35.180> I<00:01:35.509> expect<00:01:36.200> it<00:01:36.350> should<00:01:36.530> drop<00:01:36.770> a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
degree drop I expect it should drop a

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:44.080 
degree drop I expect it should drop a
little<00:01:37.100> more

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:58.280 

but<00:01:44.689> we'll<00:01:44.869> check<00:01:45.049> back<00:01:45.109> in<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.500> second

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.900 

just<00:01:58.680> how<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.130> hear<00:01:59.280> how<00:01:59.400> loud<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.880> gets

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
just how you can hear how loud it gets

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.820 
just how you can hear how loud it gets
in<00:02:00.240> here

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
in here

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.850 
in here
it's<00:02:02.400> not<00:02:02.610> hitting<00:02:03.030> my<00:02:03.450> cooler<00:02:03.990> directly<00:02:04.650> on

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
it's not hitting my cooler directly on

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.760 
it's not hitting my cooler directly on
and<00:02:05.760> that's<00:02:06.540> causing<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.200> stand<00:02:07.500> on<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:07.740> job

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
and that's causing the stand on the job

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.940 
and that's causing the stand on the job
I<00:02:08.800> checked<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.760> with<00:02:10.350> speedfan<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.680> causes

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
I checked it with speedfan and it causes

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.800 
I checked it with speedfan and it causes
a<00:02:12.340> drop<00:02:12.460> like<00:02:12.730> about<00:02:13.000> two<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.630> three<00:02:13.750> hundred

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
a drop like about two to three hundred

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.180 
a drop like about two to three hundred
rpm

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.540 

okay<00:02:21.790> quick<00:02:22.120> check<00:02:22.420> back<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:23.020> at<00:02:23.350> uh<00:02:23.550> sixty

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
okay quick check back it's at uh sixty

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:37.970 
okay quick check back it's at uh sixty
sixty-two

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.980 

once<00:02:38.280> again<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.760> ambient<00:02:39.300> temperature<00:02:39.480> my

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
once again the ambient temperature my

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.770 
once again the ambient temperature my
rooms<00:02:40.260> about<00:02:41.209> seventy<00:02:42.209> nine<00:02:42.360> degrees

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
rooms about seventy nine degrees

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.990 
rooms about seventy nine degrees
Fahrenheit

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.970 

so<00:02:52.510> all<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:52.870> runs<00:02:53.110> here's<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.590> little<00:02:53.800> quick

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
so all that runs here's a little quick

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.110 
so all that runs here's a little quick
tour<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.610> computer<00:02:55.150> case

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.880 

of<00:02:59.510> course<00:02:59.780> overclock<00:03:00.379> dotnet

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.270 

some<00:03:05.220> hard<00:03:05.430> drives

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
some hard drives

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.420 
some hard drives
and<00:03:07.490> good<00:03:07.760> old<00:03:07.910> 1800<00:03:08.870> GT<00:03:09.230> which<00:03:09.440> is<00:03:09.590> caused

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
and good old 1800 GT which is caused

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:20.290 
and good old 1800 GT which is caused
from<00:03:10.730> folding<00:03:11.150> right<00:03:11.270> now

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.980 

I'm<00:03:20.600> shot

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:30.960 

you

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.320 

so<00:03:31.480> it's<00:03:31.690> about<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.380> guess<00:03:32.800> it's<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.160> 61<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
so it's about so I guess it's a 61 and
