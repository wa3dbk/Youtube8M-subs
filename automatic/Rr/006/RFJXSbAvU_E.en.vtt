00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:11.030
Kevin Stacey: Some of the original problems
we saw with the existing wireless network

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.680
was an issue of sort of contention with the
number of devices we could connect at any

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.929
single time.

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:33.260
Announcer: http://newent.gloss.co.uk/demo.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:01:13.110
What we're looking for is, is it going to
run?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.590
And we're done.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.000
Thank you very much for your help, it's been
invaluable.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.470
Mark Howell: The problem for many school IT
departments who are now inviting students

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.299
to bring in their own devices is they have
little control over the devices students are

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.299
bringing in.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:41.020
This requires a wireless network to be able
to support multiple bands, 2.4 gig 11n as

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.259
well as 5 gig 11n across the whole school
site.

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.530
It's something that Meru achieves and other
solutions don't.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.750
Gary Hardy: With continual testing, with live
tests and demos that we've done at schools,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.689
they have all fed back incredibly positive
results.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:00.220
That has led us to a situation now where we
lead with Meru.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.229
Whoever we're talking to, if they want wireless,
we talk to them about Meru first.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.009
Jen Wells: We've recently invested in Meru
Wireless technology.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.080
It means that they can pick up something in
an hour that would normally take them three

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.220
hours, four hours to do.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.420
It's meant that I can not demonstrate, but
pose better questions.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.940
If they have their little handheld device,
they can logon to Nelly, they can pick up

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.410
something from there and they can watch it
instead of having to wait for me to get there.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.890
It just means they're not sitting around thinking
I don't know what to do about this, they do

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.890
know what to do about it.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.430
Hamish Young: We've seen students progress
much more rapidly than they have been in the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.430
past.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.860
They're able to now not just logon anywhere
on a laptop but also use mobile devices and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.070
actually leave comments and feedback.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.680
Ashley Mortimer: It's been an absolute revelation
because it now means we can get all our devices

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.600
logged on when we need to, and all the students
can access the learning materials that we

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600
need them to.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.100
We're now in the 21st century.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.320
We're not in slates and chalk anymore, we
need to embrace the technologies that are

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320
there.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.670
Mark Ellis: If I can get everybody in front
of a laptop, there are things we can do collaboratively

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.510
that there is no way we can do if we're sitting
around a desk.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.040
George: The cameras and the laptops, they're
helping us to improve our technique a lot

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.290
because we can really see what we're doing
instead of sir telling us what we've done.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.720
Ian Britten: I think the kids are just used
to technology.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.610
They use it every day, every single day.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.330
And with the big screen as well.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.200
Every lesson, we can visually show the children
what we're after.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.470
It is very hard to quantify it, but just from
the time that I've been here I've seen a massive

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.470
difference.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.070
Billie: You can just logon and just be at
your work like that.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.400
You don't have to find your room, find a computer.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.760
Philippa: the Wi-Fi's helping me because I
can work from the laptop and my phone in the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760
common room.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.180
I can work harder, as I've got access to resources.
