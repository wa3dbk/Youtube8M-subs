00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
been looking my landing here to say hey

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.550 
been looking my landing here to say hey
babe<00:02:14.510> let's<00:02:14.540> fold<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.990> landing<00:02:15.260> gear<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.380> this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
babe let's fold the landing gear on this

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.230 
babe let's fold the landing gear on this
helicopter<00:02:15.950> here<00:02:16.280> why<00:02:16.460> they<00:02:16.640> look<00:02:16.760> funny

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
helicopter here why they look funny

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.880 
helicopter here why they look funny
I'll<00:02:17.630> turn<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.930> landing<00:02:18.200> gear<00:02:18.320> backwards<00:02:18.770> on

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
I'll turn the landing gear backwards on

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.710 
I'll turn the landing gear backwards on
all<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.100> helicopters<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.760> build<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
all the helicopters that I build so that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.450 
all the helicopters that I build so that
when<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.020> remove<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.410> battery<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.160> kind<00:02:22.430> of

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
when you remove the battery it kind of

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.710 
when you remove the battery it kind of
keeps<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.760> center<00:02:23.030> gravity<00:02:23.210> underneath<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
keeps the center gravity underneath the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.940 
keeps the center gravity underneath the
back<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.080> helicopter<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.740> doesn't

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
back of the helicopter so it doesn't

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.010 
back of the helicopter so it doesn't
flip<00:02:25.130> over<00:02:25.310> on<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.730> fall<00:02:25.940> back<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.480> lot<00:02:26.900> of

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
flip over on you to fall back a lot of

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.510 
flip over on you to fall back a lot of
guys<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.320> flip<00:02:27.530> their<00:02:27.680> helicopters<00:02:28.220> over

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
guys that flip their helicopters over

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.340 
guys that flip their helicopters over
and<00:02:28.640> they<00:02:28.760> fall<00:02:29.390> over<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.780> damage<00:02:30.110> something

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
and they fall over and damage something

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.870 
and they fall over and damage something
well<00:02:30.860> if<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.040> kind<00:02:31.280> of<00:02:31.310> turn<00:02:31.520> your<00:02:31.550> landing

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
well if you kind of turn your landing

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.120 
well if you kind of turn your landing
gear<00:02:31.910> backwards<00:02:32.450> it'll<00:02:33.110> kind<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.440> keep<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.770> CG

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
gear backwards it'll kind of keep the CG

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.980 
gear backwards it'll kind of keep the CG
it<00:02:34.280> may<00:02:34.400> still<00:02:34.670> fall<00:02:34.820> over<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.240> it'll<00:02:35.780> stay

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
it may still fall over but it'll stay

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.330 
it may still fall over but it'll stay
there<00:02:36.140> if<00:02:36.320> you<00:02:36.440> have<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> receiver<00:02:36.950> battery

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
there if you have a receiver battery

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.400 
there if you have a receiver battery
pack<00:02:37.520> with<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.760> lot<00:02:37.910> better<00:02:38.150> if<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.140> notice

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
pack with a lot better if you notice

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.050 
pack with a lot better if you notice
look<00:02:39.560> at<00:02:39.620> these<00:02:39.800> two<00:02:39.950> helicopters<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.550> ESP<00:02:40.970> of

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
look at these two helicopters the ESP of

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.090 
look at these two helicopters the ESP of
the<00:02:41.150> pro<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.960> see<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> 2-inch<00:02:42.620> difference<00:02:42.950> in

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
the pro you see a 2-inch difference in

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.250 
the pro you see a 2-inch difference in
height<00:02:43.310> yes<00:02:44.150> they<00:02:44.510> redesigned<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.200> whole

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
height yes they redesigned the whole

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.500 
height yes they redesigned the whole
thing<00:02:45.710> on<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.980> probe<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.790> landing<00:02:47.180> gear<00:02:47.360> is

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
thing on the probe the landing gear is

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.690 
thing on the probe the landing gear is
shorter<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.200> little<00:02:48.230> beefier<00:02:48.860> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
shorter and a little beefier the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520 
shorter and a little beefier the
helicopter<00:02:50.240> itself<00:02:50.510> is<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.720> lot<00:02:50.930> squatty<00:02:51.350> ER

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
helicopter itself is a lot squatty ER

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
helicopter itself is a lot squatty ER
and<00:02:51.710> closer<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> deck<00:02:52.460> I'm<00:02:53.330> going<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.720> pop

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
and closer to the deck I'm going to pop

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.010 
and closer to the deck I'm going to pop
the<00:02:53.990> canopy<00:02:54.440> off<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.830> ESP<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:59.210> then<00:02:59.900> off

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
the canopy off of the ESP and then off

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.170 
the canopy off of the ESP and then off
the<00:03:00.170> probe<00:03:00.440> one<00:03:01.160> thing<00:03:01.340> I'll<00:03:01.490> tell<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.850> that's

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
the probe one thing I'll tell you that's

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.420 
the probe one thing I'll tell you that's
different<00:03:02.330> with<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:02.990> newer<00:03:03.200> helicopters<00:03:03.890> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
different with the newer helicopters the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.550 
different with the newer helicopters the
ESP<00:03:04.940> version<00:03:05.330> actually<00:03:05.630> had<00:03:05.750> two<00:03:06.020> canopy

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
ESP version actually had two canopy

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.160 
ESP version actually had two canopy
mounts<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.640> pro-x<00:03:07.910> has<00:03:08.330> for<00:03:08.630> camping<00:03:08.959> mounts

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
mounts the pro-x has for camping mounts

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.340 
mounts the pro-x has for camping mounts
like<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.470> t-rex<00:03:09.760> 700<00:03:10.760> up<00:03:10.880> top<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:12.020> makes<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.320> a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
like the t-rex 700 up top it makes it a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.420 
like the t-rex 700 up top it makes it a
little<00:03:12.440> hard<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.830> get<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.130> your<00:03:13.250> helicopter

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
little hard to get to your helicopter

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.470 
little hard to get to your helicopter
but<00:03:14.390> can't<00:03:15.230> even<00:03:15.410> fly<00:03:15.680> all<00:03:15.890> right<00:03:16.430> all<00:03:17.420> right

but can't even fly all right all right

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.020 
but can't even fly all right all right
here<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:17.810> go

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
here we go

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.370 
here we go
notice<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.150> phrase<00:03:20.390> a<00:03:20.420> lot<00:03:20.660> squatting<00:03:21.200> on<00:03:21.320> the

notice the phrase a lot squatting on the
end<00:03:21.739> on<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.010> probe<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.610> here's<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.880> ESP<00:03:23.360> one

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
end on the probe and here's the ESP one

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020 
end on the probe and here's the ESP one
thing<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.650> did<00:03:24.830> change<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.370> made<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.790> lot

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
thing that did change that made a lot

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.300 
thing that did change that made a lot
made<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.720> helicopter<00:03:27.260> suppose<00:03:27.890> it's<00:03:28.130> fly<00:03:28.280> a

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
made the helicopter suppose it's fly a

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.340 
made the helicopter suppose it's fly a
lot<00:03:28.489> better<00:03:28.700> we<00:03:29.330> will<00:03:29.480> find<00:03:29.750> out<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:30.050> take<00:03:30.200> to

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
lot better we will find out we take to

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.050 
lot better we will find out we take to
the<00:03:30.380> field<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:31.250> they<00:03:31.459> took<00:03:31.610> everything<00:03:31.910> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
the field is they took everything and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.910 
the field is they took everything and
compress<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.570> together<00:03:32.989> they<00:03:33.530> move<00:03:33.739> your

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
compress it together they move your

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.590 
compress it together they move your
batteries<00:03:34.370> back<00:03:34.580> underneath<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.000> center<00:03:35.360> the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
batteries back underneath the center the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.050 
batteries back underneath the center the
center<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.959> gravity<00:03:36.290> your<00:03:37.160> motor<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.580> moot<00:03:37.910> it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
center of gravity your motor is moot it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.910 
center of gravity your motor is moot it
moves<00:03:38.270> up<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.540> top<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.530> they<00:03:39.680> kind<00:03:39.890> of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
moves up to the top so they kind of

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.410 
moves up to the top so they kind of
compressed<00:03:40.340> everything<00:03:40.760> we<00:03:40.880> have<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.120> radio

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
compressed everything we have a radio

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.449 
compressed everything we have a radio
trail<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.989> front<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.410> helicopter<00:03:42.680> like<00:03:43.430> a

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
trail in front of this helicopter like a

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.550 
trail in front of this helicopter like a
t-rex<00:03:43.880> 700<00:03:44.450> cool<00:03:44.930> thing<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.440> have<00:03:45.530> a

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
t-rex 700 cool thing is you have a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.810 
t-rex 700 cool thing is you have a
button<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:45.950> you<00:03:46.070> push<00:03:46.250> and<00:03:46.430> release<00:03:46.610> in<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
button that you push and release in the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.840 
button that you push and release in the
front<00:03:47.739> which<00:03:48.739> takes<00:03:48.980> your<00:03:49.100> battery<00:03:49.459> tray<00:03:49.700> out

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
front which takes your battery tray out

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.420 
front which takes your battery tray out
so<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.600> have<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:51.050> use<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> velcro<00:03:51.950> strap<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
so you have to use a velcro strap the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.370 
so you have to use a velcro strap the
strap<00:03:52.459> up<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.060> them<00:03:53.239> but<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.870> can<00:03:54.019> push<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.320> in

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
strap up to them but you can push it in

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.300 
strap up to them but you can push it in
front<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.620> lucky<00:03:54.860> enough<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.160> worry<00:03:55.280> about

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
front of lucky enough to worry about

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.810 
front of lucky enough to worry about
strapping<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.850> you<00:03:57.430> another<00:03:58.430> thing<00:03:58.610> they

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
strapping to you another thing they

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.120 
strapping to you another thing they
changed<00:03:59.239> on<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.570> probe<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.500> ESP<00:04:00.890> didn't

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
changed on the probe that the ESP didn't

changed on the probe that the ESP didn't
have<00:04:01.280> was<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.940> ESP<00:04:02.420> used<00:04:02.660> bellcranks<00:04:03.440> and

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
have was the ESP used bellcranks and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.729 
have was the ESP used bellcranks and
used<00:04:04.160> a<00:04:04.400> push-pull<00:04:04.940> system<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:06.050> new<00:04:06.260> t-rex

they did change from the original

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.410 
they did change from the original
version<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.430> these<00:04:28.580> two<00:04:28.760> versions<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.270> first

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
version to these two versions the first

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.880 
version to these two versions the first
version<00:04:29.990> actually<00:04:30.080> had<00:04:30.350> three<00:04:30.500> bearing

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
version actually had three bearing

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.650 
version actually had three bearing
blocks<00:04:31.130> but<00:04:31.670> they<00:04:31.760> weren't<00:04:31.940> made<00:04:32.120> of<00:04:32.150> plastic

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660

it<00:04:33.410> had<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.650> top<00:04:33.950> bearing<00:04:34.340> block<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.550> middle

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
it had a top bearing block a middle

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.100 
it had a top bearing block a middle
bearing<00:04:35.210> block<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.540> one<00:04:35.690> right<00:04:35.900> underneath

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
bearing block the one right underneath

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.520 
bearing block the one right underneath
to<00:04:36.350> the<00:04:36.980> magnet<00:04:37.580> itself<00:04:37.750> this<00:04:38.750> one<00:04:38.990> here<00:04:39.230> has

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
to the magnet itself this one here has

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.080 
to the magnet itself this one here has
two<00:04:39.800> bearing<00:04:40.100> blocks<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.640> does<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.940> new

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
two bearing blocks and so does the new

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.880 
two bearing blocks and so does the new
release<00:04:41.360> have<00:04:41.570> two<00:04:41.720> bearing<00:04:41.990> blocks<00:04:42.200> but<00:04:42.740> they

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
release have two bearing blocks but they

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.820 
release have two bearing blocks but they
are<00:04:43.040> CNC<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:44.570> helicopters<00:04:45.230> themselves<00:04:45.680> are

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
are CNC the helicopters themselves are

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.290 
are CNC the helicopters themselves are
really<00:04:46.070> really<00:04:46.280> nice<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.790> engineering

to<00:05:03.350> program<00:05:03.890> your<00:05:04.100> head<00:05:04.310> for<00:05:04.520> fc3<00:05:04.880> flight<00:05:05.300> and

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
to program your head for fc3 flight and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.750 
to program your head for fc3 flight and
3d<00:05:06.320> flight<00:05:06.590> you've<00:05:06.800> got<00:05:06.980> positions<00:05:07.490> that<00:05:07.610> you

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
3d flight you've got positions that you

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.970 
3d flight you've got positions that you
can<00:05:07.940> move<00:05:08.120> on<00:05:08.390> your<00:05:08.900> bellcranks<00:05:09.530> and

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
can move on your bellcranks and

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.170 
can move on your bellcranks and
positions<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.580> move<00:05:10.700> on<00:05:10.820> your<00:05:10.970> blade

this<00:05:12.020> makes<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.380> helicopter<00:05:12.890> more<00:05:13.040> versatile

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
this makes the helicopter more versatile

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.370 
this makes the helicopter more versatile
or<00:05:14.000> it<00:05:14.120> makes<00:05:14.300> helicopter<00:05:14.750> more<00:05:14.900> stable

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380

like<00:05:19.550> I<00:05:19.670> said<00:05:19.910> but<00:05:20.060> there<00:05:20.240> are<00:05:20.270> some<00:05:20.450> changes

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
like I said but there are some changes

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.350 
like I said but there are some changes
they<00:05:20.900> made<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.260> came<00:05:21.500> back<00:05:21.770> on<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.610> ESP<00:05:23.150> in

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
they made that came back on the ESP in

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.300 
they made that came back on the ESP in
the<00:05:23.450> previous<00:05:23.840> version<00:05:24.350> your<00:05:24.800> server<00:05:25.070> was

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
monitoring your tail boom so you can

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.450 
monitoring your tail boom so you can
adjust<00:05:27.320> it<00:05:27.440> back<00:05:27.650> here<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:27.950> tell<00:05:28.160> them<00:05:28.340> what

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000

in the back on the probe it's a CNC tail
casing<00:06:11.390> but<00:06:11.450> it's<00:06:11.600> a<00:06:11.660> lot<00:06:11.870> beefier<00:06:12.170> a<00:06:12.470> lot

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
casing but it's a lot beefier a lot

casing but it's a lot beefier a lot
stronger<00:06:13.100> I<00:06:13.490> don't<00:06:13.910> know<00:06:14.090> the<00:06:14.240> reasoning

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
stronger I don't know the reasoning

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.150 
stronger I don't know the reasoning
behind<00:06:14.780> that<00:06:15.110> but<00:06:15.440> it<00:06:15.530> does<00:06:15.710> look<00:06:15.950> it's

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
behind that but it does look it's

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.470 
behind that but it does look it's
machined<00:06:16.580> a<00:06:16.640> lot<00:06:16.760> better<00:06:16.970> it<00:06:17.060> looks<00:06:17.240> really

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
machined a lot better it looks really

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.870 
machined a lot better it looks really
nice<00:06:17.630> but<00:06:18.560> for<00:06:18.890> some<00:06:19.100> reason<00:06:19.430> they<00:06:19.550> made<00:06:19.580> that

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
nice but for some reason they made that

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.400 
nice but for some reason they made that
a<00:06:19.940> lot<00:06:20.090> beefier<00:06:20.330> back<00:06:20.690> to<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:20.930> back<00:06:21.110> I<00:06:21.140> don't

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
a lot beefier back to the back I don't

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.750 
a lot beefier back to the back I don't
know<00:06:21.530> that

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
know that

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.730 
know that

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
version out of the box is designed to

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.530 
version out of the box is designed to
fly<00:06:53.480> off<00:06:53.660> 12s<00:06:54.380> so<00:06:55.340> you<00:06:55.910> can<00:06:56.060> probably<00:06:56.300> still

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:56.540 
fly off 12s so you can probably still

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.630 
fly off 12s so you can probably still

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
get to fly office success but why would

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.730 
get to fly office success but why would
you<00:06:58.760> want<00:06:58.970> to<00:06:59.150> you're<00:07:00.020> just<00:07:00.110> going<00:07:00.350> to<00:07:00.380> be<00:07:00.530> back

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
you want to you're just going to be back

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.410 
you want to you're just going to be back
to<00:07:00.950> where<00:07:01.100> these<00:07:01.310> here<00:07:01.550> came<00:07:01.820> from<00:07:01.850> with<00:07:02.270> no

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:02.420 
to where these here came from with no

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.740 
to where these here came from with no
power<00:07:02.690> so<00:07:03.500> it<00:07:03.740> is<00:07:03.890> a<00:07:04.070> 12s<00:07:04.580> system<00:07:05.060> for<00:07:05.630> those

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
power so it is a 12s system for those

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.660 
power so it is a 12s system for those
guys<00:07:05.930> who<00:07:05.990> originally<00:07:06.830> had<00:07:06.950> these<00:07:07.400> and<00:07:07.610> they
