00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.310
 the dear the same mass with the 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.309
 protection and from cultural felipe 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:17.590
 million autistic laurel 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:19.570
 the hand that is preparing to circulate yes 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.029
 or yes because he has not gaining a half 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.340
 rectangular medical movements though 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.619
 you will know how to do it in this case already 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.800
 we have one of the oil fillers 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.280
 olive white onion and scallion 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.079
 garlic we are going to put chicken remains of the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.960
 another day 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.140
 for the stew a little spoon 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.949
 waved and also if you want if you 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.530
 like me I know if I do not recommend it 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.899
 ginger and all this mixed well with 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.609
 a little salt and nothing else remembers 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.250
 which is one of the many possibilities 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.250
 to be pancito rellenos 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.750
 putting the ideal thing would be to let it cool 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.750
 do 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.070
 here being rising like that because if not 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.630
 we can do it if the filling is 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.149
 hot each other 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.890
 certainly I as a woman the heat to 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.399
 help develop a little more 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.939
 it appears very well 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.939
 in the middle 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.520
 in this way green onion or something 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.520
 more wants to put you 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.570
 and I do not have another variable in this more 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.570
 amount no no not good 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.939
 well closes closing 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.130
 so easily start for bread 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.939
 and we put the closure down the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.790
 coma 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.120
 Clear 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:59.420
 Now we have you asking for a bit of 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:01.760
 Silver ham and cheese cubes you 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.340
 I like basil a lot and yes it seems to me 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.729
 that we all like and with our hands 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.729
 the goal well so olive low 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.729
 perfectly 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.280
 the black box we can also put a 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:28.800
 little tomato shaped aure form 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:31.220
 sliced stuffed ham basil cheese 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.220
 tomato 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.900
 for when people fall 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 and take advantage with the base of the mass of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.300
 cake everything you find in the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.300
 cupboard 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.390
 and everything is a good way to 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.390
 get you out of your way 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:04.450
 and like earth the earth 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.180
 it's very simple we have to go through very 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.569
 slow 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.280
 this first raised blanditas we do 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.280
 another wind in a 2 against 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.200
 but what you have are roasted peppers or 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.019
 green brown dead roses 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.540
 in this case that peladito is said without 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.639
 skin without being a tantito out there 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.730
 we have and for three a little here 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.799
 ground no air say what success I 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.110
 I love I love the spicy 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.090
 inside spicy spicy I know 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.500
 let's say it leaves your mouth that you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.500
 exactly tear 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.930
 the mouth but somewhere 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.140
 good that has the mortadela because 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.940
 he wants envious have the morrones 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.230
 roasted the gustito to humans are 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:13.430
 peeled and has this the fact 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.430
 to the center 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:36.650
 that mass put a little more to a final 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
 plus 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.249
 perfect and other 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.699
 We'll let you take it to stay 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.769
 like a raised bread stuffed or well 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.219
 as it is from a very strong oven and 

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:57.119
 there remains a crunchy dough and the filling of 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.119
 another let's go
