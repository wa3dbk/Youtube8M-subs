00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310 

then<00:01:20.210> depend<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.300> what<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.600> did<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.990> wander

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
then depend on what we did just wander

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
put your lock into position and that's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.690 
put your lock into position and that's
your<00:01:29.940> position<00:01:30.300> stuff

so<00:01:32.700> our<00:01:32.759> next<00:01:32.880> we'll<00:01:33.119> stop<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.539> change<00:01:33.720> press

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so our next we'll stop and change press

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
so our next we'll stop and change press
your<00:01:34.259> reset<00:01:34.649> button<00:01:34.679> first<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.720> pressure

which<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
which is on

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.640 
which is on
I<00:01:43.479> think<00:01:43.689> it's<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:43.960> about<00:01:45.479> 35%<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:47.110> think<00:01:47.380> there

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
I think it's on about 35% I think there

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.359 
I think it's on about 35% I think there
it<00:01:48.340> starts<00:01:48.759> your<00:01:48.880> Donecker<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.189> nice

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
it starts your Donecker see the nice

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.030 
it starts your Donecker see the nice
rotating<00:01:52.060> and<00:01:52.869> simply<00:01:53.259> bring<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> hand<00:01:53.830> or

rotating and simply bring the hand or
paws

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.999 

so<00:02:00.009> easily<00:02:00.280> don't<00:02:00.640> jam<00:02:01.329> it<00:02:01.360> through<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.869> roll

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.260 

and<00:02:06.009> your<00:02:06.189> field<00:02:06.430> will<00:02:06.579> stop<00:02:06.850> them<00:02:07.030> they<00:02:07.119> hit

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
and your field will stop them they hit

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.680 
and your field will stop them they hit
the<00:02:07.360> core<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.920> that's<00:02:09.069> it

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the core and that's it

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:17.100 
the core and that's it
release<00:02:10.690> your<00:02:10.869> break<00:02:12.420> indexable<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:16.110> your

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
release your break indexable on you your

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.350 
release your break indexable on you your

engage<00:02:19.870> your<00:02:19.900> break<00:02:20.410> again

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:03:00.350 

so<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:26.939> pull<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> forward<00:02:27.659> smooth<00:02:28.019> smoothly

and with everyone stuck think we can

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.030 
and with everyone stuck think we can
just<00:03:02.730> need<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:03.030> go<00:03:03.180> back<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.290> stop<00:03:04.530> praising

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
just need to go back to stop praising

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
you said reset back to zero so you just

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.550 
you said reset back to zero so you just
