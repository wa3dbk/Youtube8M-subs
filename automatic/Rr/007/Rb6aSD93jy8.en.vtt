00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 daily is a broker of 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.269
 Safe to show off your bike to give envy to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
 works there, if it works, too. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 also have a right to turn left 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.769
 right here I have a laser that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 delimits an area around the bicycle 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.970
 so the car is not invade the room 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.750
 light is to night has a cannon of light that 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.020
 he 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.910
 it flashes quite make it display 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.770
 has the little cold that accompanied the own 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.570
 light bike and I boarded 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.579
 on this cycling tour around curitiba 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.860
 to get to know the electric magrela better 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.820
 the battery has a battery life of 60 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.219
 kilometers 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.610
 varies according to the weight and path 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.719
 of the driver on the way up is a cinch with 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.180
 engine help 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.489
 the pedal continues smooth and without much 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 ideal effort for those who want to start 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.359
 pedaling and catching light at first I 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.840
 I usually say the electric bicycle 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.439
 are the delights of descent time 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 all 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 the maximum speed with the engine is 25 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.799
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 the bike is waterproof so it's even 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.479
 in rain it is possible to use it 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.390
 the battery can also be removed if 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.549
 the cyclist does not want this help the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.220
 recharge is equivalent to that of the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.040
 a cell phone within four hours the charge is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 and its useful life is two 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.159
 three years on average 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.450
 I just went through a seven-way 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.540
 miles here with the bike 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.180
 even though it had some climbs 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 along the way I can talk without 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 to have a breathy voice too 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.540
 practically on your electric bicycle 1 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.640
 is it the evolution of common bike 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.710
 so you can pedal can do 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.030
 motor exercise is an extra help in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.369
 upload for anyone who wants for example 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.810
 work can not get sweaty like it is 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.780
 which was the electric bicycle path 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 It's great, it was really cool. It helps. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.750
 enough people on the climbs 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.149
 especially we can keep the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.610
 legal speed and mainly is 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.280
 in a group this was very nice a good 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 experience you also found 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.420
 I really liked the first time I do 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.860
 a bicycle ride to the end I feel 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.880
 desire to come for being an electrical 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.250
 also sounded 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.590
 father mother and son decided to pedal together 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.660
 what was just a walk aroused the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.140
 desire to take the habit for the day to 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.360
 day 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.610
 prefer to work from bike also looks 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.340
 knows that he has not even crossed his mind 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.170
 to do this is what comes back in Curitiba and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:35.240
 I think in the one in most cities 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.490
 are bike paths for you to have 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.620
 safety on a bicycle if it were 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.540
 I'm sure a lot of people 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.690
 would abandon the car 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.930
 electric preference bike help 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930
 good
