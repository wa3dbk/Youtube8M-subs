 according to the pages or at home without materials 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.560
 fat in a pan to bring 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.159
 even more taste and crunch the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.049

 sugar cooked with honey is not very sweet b 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:01.729

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:04.600
 you wait there I let you cradle the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.600
 mesh sugar

 that's mariana speed 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.840
 relationship had fun 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.840
 it smells like the meringue cure 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.820
 and that's already way too much 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.560
 you have the steam you saw the 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.480

 Italian language and except that it's cooked 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.100
 at 140 Â° precisely in there but we will 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.820
 cool it down 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.820
 for that we 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.799
 that's getting really cold 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.540
 no no no it's still a little sky 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:53.099
 I'm going to add the fruits 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.560
 dry for the roasted here it stays 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.129
 soft it's very malleable messana 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.910
 cool down and it just lasts that 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.260
 no 3 it's beautiful 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.610

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.910
 whole fruit drink crocos in a 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.650
 fed up 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.629
 if you like a toubib texture 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.450
 lipids to crush your 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.870
 dried fruit a coffee of the grapes we are going 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.700
 take 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
 we are going to do it in small 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.319
 silicone molds agree one screw 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.930
 but traditionally dry between 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.879
 two sheets of unleavened bread so we 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.930
 will you do the side we family 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:30.840
 go you go see it's great but 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.450
 deep down I'm working on it and we're in 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.510
 the loans the wali his spatulas after 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:43.440
 that 's when it's cold we can 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:45.630
 break and have pieces via there 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.849
 we will let it harden quietly in 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.590
 a corner of the kitchen two players it's 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:56.160
 well, we'll be able to unmount them 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.470
 without any very very good care this side 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.709
 honey dried fruit it reminds the south of
