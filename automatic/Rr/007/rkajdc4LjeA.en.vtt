00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
looking for in this Otzi well Minnesota

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.660 
looking for in this Otzi well Minnesota
has<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.080> energy<00:00:07.259> from<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.980> third<00:00:08.220> period<00:00:08.490> you

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
has the energy from the third period you

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.520 
has the energy from the third period you
think<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.179> they<00:00:09.300> would<00:00:09.420> come<00:00:09.690> out<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
think that they would come out in the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.259 
think that they would come out in the
first<00:00:10.830> three<00:00:11.099> minutes<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.670> try<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> put<00:00:12.120> this

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
first three minutes and try to put this

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.030 
first three minutes and try to put this
game<00:00:12.480> away<00:00:12.540> because<00:00:13.170> they<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> momentum

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
game away because they have the momentum

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160 
game away because they have the momentum
and<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> energy<00:00:14.250> if<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.089> goes<00:00:15.360> more<00:00:15.660> than<00:00:15.870> five

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and the energy if it goes more than five

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.500 
and the energy if it goes more than five
minutes<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.859> overtime<00:00:17.400> then<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.029> think<00:00:18.359> it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
minutes in this overtime then I think it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.269 
minutes in this overtime then I think it
goes<00:00:18.720> into<00:00:18.930> Yale's<00:00:19.230> favor<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.980> bit<00:00:20.130> as

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
goes into Yale's favor a little bit as

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.820 
goes into Yale's favor a little bit as
they<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.640> sit<00:00:21.539> back<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.439> first<00:00:22.619> five

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
they can sit back in the first five

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.109 
they can sit back in the first five
minutes<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.160> bounce<00:00:23.369> back<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.789> then<00:00:23.910> come

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
minutes and bounce back and then come

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.570 
minutes and bounce back and then come
back<00:00:24.260> aggressively<00:00:25.260> after<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.130> first<00:00:26.369> five

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
back aggressively after the first five

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.980 
back aggressively after the first five
but<00:00:26.789> Minnesota<00:00:27.090> definitely<00:00:27.570> has<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> edge

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
but Minnesota definitely has the edge

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.570 
but Minnesota definitely has the edge
