00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.190
 greetings guardians today we continue with 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.700
 the history of the previous chapter plays 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.170
 learn more about driving york and hawthorn 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.030
 improved by means of dark practices 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.160
 the hawthorn was once the weapon of a 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.619
 hero his abrupt frame hinted a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.420
 truly sinister the powerful connection 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.850
 with the frightening witchcraft of the hive 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.650
 the hawthorn legend is linked to 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.330
 apogee and the fall of train your a 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.970
 guardian whose name we remember with 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.710
 indignation and shame it was thought that 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.210
 the weapon had been destroyed but the 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.910
 rumors of its existence still 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.579
 they stay out there the noble man is 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.230
 stood up and people admired him was 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.480
 a beacon of hope while still 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.980
 being only one man and it was in that 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.899
 true where were the greatest 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.780
 promise if a man could face 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.330
 the night could also be done by others or 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.950
 all in his right hand the man carried 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.510
 a rose and its aura shone 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.820
 resplendent 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.250
 when the man resumed his way the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.110
 people did not forget where the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.360
 hope stretched but man 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.610
 he hid a secret fear his 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.470
 thoughts were dark a sadness 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.930
 threatened to leave the bowels of 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.190
 his being had been a hero for so long 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.800
 time that pride had taken him 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.600
 Although the trail gradually 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.820
 Whisper of the shadows became 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.530
 a voice a gloomy call that offered 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.710
 Enough glory to do 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.050
 wander into the most ardent light he knew 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.900
 that he was paying but he longed 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.760
 glory on his last day he sat down to see 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.740
 the sunset its last 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.200
 thoughts still of pure body and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 they clung to the fleeting hope 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.010
 that the world would remind them for whom 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.300
 had been and not because of the suffering that 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.760
 it was going to cause 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.530
 so the honorable man is hidden after 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.990
 a darkness that never meat ever 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.870
 he should touch and abandon his mortal part 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.700
 to claim your natural right if it was 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.950
 by own choice or a whim of the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.770
 fortune is a truth that only knows the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.960
 destination in the warm air of that 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.360
 dusk while the night devoured the 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.850
 twilight the noble man stopped 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.670
 exist in its place another man stood up 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.400
 the same flesh the same bone but a 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.990
 very different man the first and last 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.810
 of his lineage the only ancestor 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.060
 descendant of the name of georg in his 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.220
 first instant as a new individual the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
 man contemplated his rose and for the first 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.210
 once he realized he did not have 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.580
 petals just the creepy purpose 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.470
 of the rabid thorns 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.480
 the last known data of the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.430
 legend your is a transcript that 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.900
 saves in the tower files in 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.790
 she picks up a conversation between 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.220
 several individuals one of them george 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.750
 that seems to have been related to the 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.580
 events that occurred in palamós 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.620
 although there is no god available to me 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.730
 I have to narrate the said conversation 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.440
 good is what you have there 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.440
 I can see your cannon 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.050
 I know you 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.470
 that I know not 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.410
 and you want to take my gun 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.500
 I had never seen so 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.430
 of course not 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.430
 it seems dangerous 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.810
 Maybe that is the purpose 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.390
 I imagine at least 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.160
 unlikely 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.660
 where you found it you hear me 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.670
 If you have made you a question 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.670
 I did not find it I made it 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.450
 I'm going to give you that you have hair 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.170
 that looks like a warrior appearances 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.420
 cheat 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.260
 that's true 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.360
 there is some problem 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.910
 it does not have to 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.980
 so that we have clear that to see the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.980
 cannon you've been to the moon 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.400
 the moon has been nobody has done it 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.680
 It really is a fact 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.060
 it has grace remains of this distinction what 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.220
 what is clear is that you believe very 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.019
 special with that attitude the way in the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.599
 who treat us as if we were nothing 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.940
 as if it were very invisible is a fact 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.259
 that you 're not as solid as you think 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.359
 fact is that the special is only 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.580
 special until it stops being my 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.480
 bones disagree 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.940
 speak clearly 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.529
 nobody said and my bones say what 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.260
 contrary to bones 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.900
 all of them 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.050
 and that they are talking about 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.419
 too many to count 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.230
 you are going down we just wanted 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.670
 a chat 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.430
 that's not what you wanted 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.070
 look at the social and ready 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.960
 veteran more than ready in the experience 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.729
 It has many advantages 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.259
 in experience what makes you so 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.120
 impertinent with people who just look 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.030
 to converse 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.849
 yes insisting and maybe we're going to 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.529
 talk talk 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.599
 that's not what we 're doing now 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.969
 my conversations tend to be something 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:10.969
 noisiest 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:13.960
 you are threatening me alone the truth 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.180
 but who the devil do you think you are 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.460
 by the others said nobody however 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.259
 I'm here 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.419
 no matter how beautiful your cannon is 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.819
 follow this path and we will see how many 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:28.580
 of taste the noise does not say anything else 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:31.780
 guys it seems that you have found your site 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.750
 have you ever had nightmares 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.810
 this whatsapp you are silly 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.490
 I know you've had them in this world is 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.620
 inevitable 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.199
 I do not have nightmares just the cause 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.260
 see that you are cliché the embodiment of 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.240
 perfect bandit I hear your voice was heard 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.680
 the thing that says it hurts makes me a 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.820
 hard man trying to give 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.820
 there is no image 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.810
 sit, sit down now, have just chase 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.480
 to kill your colleagues is what happens to you 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:11.390
 for getting bored and right now I am but 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:15.590
 how very boring he hears hey no no look 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.650
 silence but but you are you are one of 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.920
 them a guardian is not supposed to do 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.260
 it being one of the good may be assumed 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.790
 maybe it's if we're the good guys 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:31.950
 these days who knows I wanted to be my 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.010
 trophy no no no 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.990
 take care of him 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.600
 the ior and that is not going to help you with what 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:44.670
 that comes next listen to look at it 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.490
 open your eyes there are not many who see it 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.010
 so close to the bone you see it jagged 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:53.010
 like with thorns I used to think it was 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.990
 a rose concentrated in bloom 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.240
 but flowering is the product of its 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.449
 go to 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.180
 You know what they are nightmares ever 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:04.069
 you've seen a nightmare you've opened the 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.160
 eyes and you 've realized that it was not 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:09.310
 no dream that gets it and I see 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.229
 nightmares live in the shadows 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.849
 watching I thought crazy I know 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.580
 but I thought I had found a 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.800
 way a way to win maybe we will achieve 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.479
 survive having a window between 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.729
 shadows it becomes very difficult to walk in 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.490
 the light or maybe it was no longer what 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:27.289
 strong enough maybe but now 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.960
 I feel strong and larroudé to the 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:32.599
 darkness or maybe he stole me and me from all 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.909
 modes here we are and I'm hungry has 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:37.340
 hunger you have no more light than a small 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:42.420
 pathetic life spark but better 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:45.230
 a spark that nothing does not open the eyes 

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.230
 but no 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.729
 good guardians it seems that the heroes 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.650
 of the golden age of humans 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:52.729
 hide more shadows than lights I hope 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.439
 that you liked the story of drag 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:58.599
 in york and his hawthorn a like and share 

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:58.599
 and as always we see ourselves at the border
