during<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:00.960> video<00:00:01.140> presentation<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:02.010> are

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
during this video presentation we are

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.770 
during this video presentation we are
going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.550> show<00:00:02.730> you<00:00:02.790> how<00:00:03.060> we<00:00:03.120> can<00:00:03.360> repurpose

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
going to show you how we can repurpose

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990 
going to show you how we can repurpose
an<00:00:04.170> existing<00:00:04.710> Windows<00:00:05.040> XP<00:00:05.430> professional

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
an existing Windows XP professional

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.140 
an existing Windows XP professional
machine<00:00:06.200> into<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> fully<00:00:07.680> secured<00:00:08.189> thin<00:00:08.670> client

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
machine into a fully secured thin client

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.390 
machine into a fully secured thin client
so<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> first<00:00:10.349> thing<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.620> need<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.130> go

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
so the first thing we need to do is go

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.339 
so the first thing we need to do is go
ahead<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.639> install<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.690> thin<00:00:12.960> thin

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
ahead and install the so thin thin

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.250 
ahead and install the so thin thin
client<00:00:13.740> software<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.839> by

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
client software and we can do that by

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.070 
client software and we can do that by
running<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.980> MSI<00:00:17.369> package<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.119> addition

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
running the MSI package in addition

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
running the MSI package in addition
we've<00:00:19.260> also<00:00:19.439> created<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.400> command<00:00:20.850> file<00:00:21.060> which

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
we've also created a command file which

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.230 
we've also created a command file which
pre-configured<00:00:22.380> our<00:00:22.740> Southend<00:00:23.609> installation

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
pre-configured our Southend installation

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.200 
pre-configured our Southend installation
so<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> ready<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.859> connect<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.970> our

thin client or use a command file like
we're<00:01:03.690> doing<00:01:03.809> today<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.700> have

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
we're doing today so that all you have

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
we're doing today so that all you have
to<00:01:05.939> do<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> run<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> installation<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.320> then

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
to do is run the installation and then

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.460 
to do is run the installation and then
allow<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> install<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> reboot<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
allow it to install and reboot into a

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
allow it to install and reboot into a
thin<00:01:10.710> client<00:01:16.729> so<00:01:17.729> we've<00:01:17.939> completed<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
thin client so we've completed the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.170 
thin client so we've completed the
execution<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.490> thin<00:01:20.729> thin<00:01:20.909> client

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
execution of the so thin thin client

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.450 
execution of the so thin thin client
installation<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.650> order<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> convert<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
installation and in order to convert a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
installation and in order to convert a
workstation<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.360> thin<00:01:24.630> client<00:01:24.990> mode<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.380> have

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
workstation to thin client mode we have

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.140 
workstation to thin client mode we have
to<00:01:25.680> restart<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.250> system<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:27.000> what

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
to restart that system so that's what

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.719 
to restart that system so that's what
we're<00:01:27.270> doing<00:01:27.509> at<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.720> point<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> now<00:01:32.430> we're

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
we're doing at this point so now we're

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.640 
we're doing at this point so now we're
coming<00:01:32.909> back<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.450> thin<00:01:33.869> client<00:01:34.229> mode<00:01:34.350> we've

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
coming back into thin client mode we've

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.620 
coming back into thin client mode we've
pre-configured<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.729> thin<00:01:35.939> thin<00:01:36.210> client

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
pre-configured the so thin thin client

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
pre-configured the so thin thin client
so<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> will<00:01:37.049> automatically<00:01:37.799> log<00:01:38.759> on<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so that it will automatically log on to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
so that it will automatically log on to
the<00:01:39.180> machine<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.590> set<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the machine and we also set it up to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.130 
the machine and we also set it up to
automatically<00:01:42.030> connect<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> our<00:01:42.930> terminal

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
automatically connect to our terminal

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
automatically connect to our terminal
server<00:01:43.500> back-end<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.220> again<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> mentioned

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
server back-end and again as I mentioned

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.359 
server back-end and again as I mentioned
earlier<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.259> done<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.590> any<00:01:46.619> thin

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
earlier this can be done with any thin

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.889 
earlier this can be done with any thin
back-end<00:01:47.759> system<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.600> might<00:01:48.720> be

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
back-end system that you might be

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
back-end system that you might be
running<00:01:49.049> so<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:50.939> running

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
running so now you can see we're running

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170 
running so now you can see we're running
in<00:01:51.750> actual<00:01:52.290> thin<00:01:52.500> client<00:01:52.890> mode<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:54.060> a
