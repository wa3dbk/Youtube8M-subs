00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.680
 hi to all those ghosts to do 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.540
 I hope you are well so here we 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.410
 is already for the first time 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.940
 representation of weapons that you 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.470
 even so you propose there it is at the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.800
 6 request when who was to do 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.510
 a certain peace 5 with a charger 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.420
 one is a sign of reloading 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 similar to annex 5 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.109
 So here is basically so it's not a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 ump sense because you've seen it look like a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 little but it's not manic tessin the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.529
 lord then it's a trellis hears 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.529
 same block 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.150
 there she is 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.440
 so yeah good is nevertheless it is 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.570
 so the g takes as a task for 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 what is to put the charger already 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.100
 so it's kind of a system similar to 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.820
 the map so it could not really do 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.059
 like a mpc 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.010
 but hey I find this opa badly like 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.720
 that it allows me to have a charger that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.960
 is already a little bit leaning like that team has 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.180
 law 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.989
 if it's a system that really wants 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.700
 well spent proud so we can not 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.740
 take it off like that a ride for this 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.740
 which is the game here is a little we ask ourselves 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.180
 is not it a crazy thing so that's it 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:25.210
 view fps already so we have a lever 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:30.720
 of armament as ump that and so they 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.869
 open the breech if we can see 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.729
 elastic 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.280
 so that's fine so I can have 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.190
 an eye on it and therefore not necessarily 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.140
 m-pesa known I think of any more 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.780
 important that unnecessary mambé it's a 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.780
 something that gets up like that so charging 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:56.610
 ok I think back to the docks do not have 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.799
 up 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.690
 so you'll understand it really a pc 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.610
 so in terms of their gains from 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.280
 aiming high is especially to look like 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.510
 because there is no shooting system 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.369
 So here basically that's how it is 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.730
 something that looks like a mp5 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.370
 normal here with a wheel like that 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.519
 to change the screen of focus 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.800
 and then what about the front side 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:27.430
 now that's normal all stupid so here it is 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.620
 Okay, it's well done will pass 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.420
 panem p5 1 day 10 days of that ends 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.070
 hunt proud even if we 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.310
 the aesthetics good it's going this not pass 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.960
 too much 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:45.160
 it's not too bad so here I go 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.280
 stay for the submachine gun with 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.350
 a big task and so here with a 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.760
 small loader is an attack since 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.820
 - I like to put the dot everywhere 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 then here we know it's the same one 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.250
 you would have seen well I left the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 metal vision well that's it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:16.570
 it's the same always reloading even 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:23.800
 way so we can also reload everything 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:26.740
 stupid so always in my heart 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.950
 my club and also one thing I'm going 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.230
 not specified is that the lever 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.650
 arming off charges a dog who to 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.320
 interior 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:41.370
 finally hammer like that I do 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.370
 pull with the trigger 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.780
 then it's perfect 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.780
 they also buy very active 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:58.099
 So here is that poster of the gun is 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:58.459
 a trick our hands level of the bus tomorrow 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.430
 as well 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.900
 hey its plate like that with 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.639
 so I do not know if we can say 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.620
 interrail on the sides or else this 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.420
 would discover haye me I do not know 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.359
 very well where we look mum stupid 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.540
 with a rail month what would be a rail 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.989
 peak to hold on top of 20 mm a rally 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.729
 standard 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.410
 even if there it's just lego good for 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.050
 the handle we see the shade where the nail 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:30.289
 all wood is also known as whole 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.349
 that I'm doing here that after that we can 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.349
 make 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:48.229
 chargers that's how it can be 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:49.310
 do something so that's how they 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.879
 know quite well at the level of 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.740
 change 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:56.740
 the rate therefore seems the little loader 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:03.169
 so that's the end of the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.550
 presentation of this submachine gun and 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.580
 so not a peace without hiding what I 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.560
 so wrong that I find that I 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.599
 rather successful I hope so when 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.000
 his competitor the result is in everything 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.349
 case not continue to send me your 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.319
 proposals even if you already have some 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:20.509
 done you can still my sent 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.159
 yesterday if you have something that happens to you 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.529
 by the head you are who you are 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.180
 think it could be given 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:34.370
 send that's all I have to say 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:38.740
 here we go for sainté mp5 it's over 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.740
 next by everyone
