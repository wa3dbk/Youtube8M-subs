00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
of the snap with healthy I'm

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.530 
of the snap with healthy I'm
replenishing<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.160> with<00:03:25.340> things<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.150> amino

replenishing you with things like amino

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.960 
replenishing you with things like amino
acids<00:03:27.110> vitamins<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.800> electrolytes<00:03:27.860> so<00:03:28.640> I'm

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
acids vitamins and electrolytes so I'm

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.290 
acids vitamins and electrolytes so I'm
Josh<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.360> say<00:03:29.680> they<00:03:30.680> contain<00:03:31.100> branched<00:03:31.610> chain

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
Josh and say they contain branched chain

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.240 
Josh and say they contain branched chain
amino<00:03:32.330> acids<00:03:33.260> would<00:03:33.350> provide<00:03:33.709> extra<00:03:34.100> energy

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
amino acids would provide extra energy

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.400 
amino acids would provide extra energy
during<00:03:34.640> exercise<00:03:35.300> play<00:03:35.870> a<00:03:35.900> key<00:03:36.140> role<00:03:36.170> in

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
during exercise play a key role in

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.990 
during exercise play a key role in

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
maintaining concentration and

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.240 
maintaining concentration and
accelerating<00:03:38.959> recovery<00:03:39.470> from<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.040> hard

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
accelerating recovery from a hard

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.430 
accelerating recovery from a hard
workout<00:03:40.550> of<00:03:40.700> race<00:03:40.820> another<00:03:41.750> interesting<00:03:41.959> fact

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
workout of race another interesting fact

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.199 
workout of race another interesting fact
is<00:03:42.650> these<00:03:42.890> chumps<00:03:43.280> are<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.640> only<00:03:43.820> energy

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
is these chumps are the only energy

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.270 
is these chumps are the only energy
chews<00:03:44.690> on<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.989> market<00:03:45.350> with<00:03:45.500> amino<00:03:45.860> acids

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
chews on the market with amino acids

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.490 
chews on the market with amino acids
yeah<00:03:46.940> how<00:03:47.300> interesting<00:03:47.510> is<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:48.200> think

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
yeah how interesting is that I think

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.620 
yeah how interesting is that I think
it's<00:03:48.620> great<00:03:48.860> yeah<00:03:49.459> provides<00:03:50.150> meaningful

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
it's great yeah provides meaningful

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.110 
it's great yeah provides meaningful
levels<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.320> electrolytes<00:03:52.010> when<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.760> supported

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
levels of electrolytes when it supported
