00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.820
 portrait 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.180
 run in ragged mode that is first 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 run some time at the same pace then 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.400
 increase or decrease speed by more 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.190
 fast or slow pace will be now 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.080
 shows an example of a 1 minute average pace and 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.060
 30 seconds fast and so 2 episodes 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 we switch to 1 mode we run on average 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.410
 tempo 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.480
 one minute in our training 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.030
 programs we will often use 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.880
 It is this type of running with different 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.270
 intervals and speeds in one 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.210
 three speeds will be applied 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.000
 slow or can be called jogging 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.800
 further average pace and fast pace 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.690
 fast paced is the pace at which 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.670
 scheduled seconds you can 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 run maximum speed and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.550
 last second feel tired 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.670
 and now the answer to the question why 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.249
 running torn mode because exactly 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.999
 This style of running as much as possible fights 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:10.979
 overweight 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.899
 as well as enhances your 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.359
 endurance and capabilities 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.969
 cardiovascular and respiratory systems 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.369
 and it happens because our bodies 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.369
 does not have time to get used and adapt 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.279
 to ever- changing loads further 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:31.499
 switch to fast paced and run 30 

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:34.079
 seconds if we just run in one 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:36.929
 tempo for hours then first let there be an effect 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.759
 and will go extra kilos but 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.329
 after a while it will stop 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.829
 occur as our body 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.439
 will get used to the same load and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.489
 will spend on this job a little 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.489
 amount of energy 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.090
 halls you can often see such a picture 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.060
 like girls with the stubbornness of marathoners 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.310
 torment the treadmill but peering that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.650
 same club in a month you will notice that 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 in spite of enhanced form 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.030
 the girls are just as beautiful 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.670
 as before so if you want 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.010
 lose those extra pounds do not need 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.040
 spend hours jogging yourself or another 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.950
 cyclical work century at an even pace 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.680
 we apply the beginning of the training apart lay down 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.950
 most often at the end of a workout or her 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.260
 main parts also be careful 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.900
 if you have any 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.610
 cardiovascular disease 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.540
 respiratory systems up to a quartet you 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.540
 contraindicated
