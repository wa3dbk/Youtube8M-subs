bearing<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.380> mind<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> first<00:00:19.830> attempt<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
bearing in mind the first attempt was a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160 
bearing in mind the first attempt was a
complete<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.820> total<00:00:20.880> disaster<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:21.960> them

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
both technically community wise the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
both technically community wise the
whole<00:00:25.740> thing<00:00:25.949> was<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.340> disaster<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.029> they

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
whole thing was just a disaster so they

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.939 
whole thing was just a disaster so they
went<00:00:27.720> away<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.080> they've<00:00:28.199> tried<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> rebuild

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
went away and they've tried to rebuild

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.769 
went away and they've tried to rebuild
the<00:00:29.160> game<00:00:29.310> again<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.820> called<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.539> realm

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the game again and called it a realm

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.150 
the game again and called it a realm
reborn<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:32.719> what<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:34.230> cannot<00:00:34.559> fathom<00:00:34.920> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
reborn and what I just cannot fathom is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.950 
reborn and what I just cannot fathom is
how<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.520> could<00:00:35.670> go<00:00:35.820> ahead<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.270> basically

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
how they could go ahead and basically

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
how they could go ahead and basically
screw<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.410> all<00:00:37.590> over<00:00:37.620> again<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> second

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
screw it up all over again the second

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.000 
screw it up all over again the second
time<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.760> know<00:00:39.180> people<00:00:39.570> say<00:00:40.050> oh<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.290> brilliant

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
time I know people say oh it's brilliant

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.380 
time I know people say oh it's brilliant

looked at the graphics in this game have
you<00:00:44.730> seen<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:45.329> badly<00:00:45.780> they'd<00:00:46.110> built<00:00:46.379> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
you seen how badly they'd built this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.490 
you seen how badly they'd built this
world<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.520> atrocious<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.170> biggest

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
world it's atrocious and the biggest

world it's atrocious and the biggest
problem<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.640> final<00:00:50.910> fantasy

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
problem I really have with final fantasy

problem I really have with final fantasy
realm<00:00:51.390> reborn<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.710> feels<00:00:52.890> very

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
realm reborn is that it feels very

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.880 
realm reborn is that it feels very
lazily<00:00:53.460> converted<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.629> consult<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
lazily converted to consult which is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
lazily converted to consult which is
strange<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.430> mean<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> appeared<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.090> ps3<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
strange I mean it appeared on ps3 I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.529 
strange I mean it appeared on ps3 I
played<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> fair<00:00:58.350> bit<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.590> ps3<00:00:58.940> hated<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
played it a fair bit on ps3 hated it the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.770 
played it a fair bit on ps3 hated it the
graphics<00:01:00.750> were<00:01:01.109> were<00:01:01.530> rubbish<00:01:02.780> certainly

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
graphics were were rubbish certainly

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.109 
graphics were were rubbish certainly
compared<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> most<00:01:04.439> PC<00:01:04.890> games<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
compared to most PC games and it just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.060 
compared to most PC games and it just
felt<00:01:06.450> by<00:01:06.630> keeps<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> thrown-together<00:01:07.439> game<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
felt by keeps a thrown-together game to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.520 
felt by keeps a thrown-together game to
attempt<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> fix<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.850> was<00:01:09.030> broken<00:01:09.530> but

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
attempt to fix what was broken but

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.039 
attempt to fix what was broken but
actually<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.850> game<00:01:12.030> engine<00:01:12.390> itself<00:01:12.689> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
actually the game engine itself it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
actually the game engine itself it's
just<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.590> suited<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.030> they're<00:01:15.180> trying

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
just not suited to what they're trying

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
just not suited to what they're trying
to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> key<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.369> found

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
to do one of the key things that I found

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
to do one of the key things that I found
quite<00:01:18.409> disgusting<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.770> about<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> way

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
quite disgusting actually about the way

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
quite disgusting actually about the way
this<00:01:20.280> game<00:01:20.490> engine<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.909> operating<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
this game engine is operating is have a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230 
this game engine is operating is have a
look<00:01:22.470> at<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> way<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.700> lighting<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
look at the way that the lighting and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510 
look at the way that the lighting and
shadows<00:01:24.479> are<00:01:24.840> constantly<00:01:25.320> flickering<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
shadows are constantly flickering in the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
shadows are constantly flickering in the
back<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> every<00:01:27.090> scene<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.600> incredibly

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
back of every scene it's incredibly

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
back of every scene it's incredibly
distracting<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.220> saw<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.759> same<00:01:30.090> problem<00:01:30.299> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
distracting I saw the same problem on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
distracting I saw the same problem on
the<00:01:30.630> ps3<00:01:30.930> version<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> same<00:01:32.040> problem<00:01:32.220> on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the ps3 version and the same problem on

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.249 
the ps3 version and the same problem on
the<00:01:32.490> pc<00:01:32.850> version<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.689> afraid<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the pc version so I'm afraid this is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.190 
the pc version so I'm afraid this is
engine<00:01:34.619> related<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.790> honestly<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.689> appears

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
engine related and honestly it appears

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.640 
engine related and honestly it appears
to<00:01:37.500> me<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.390> they've<00:01:39.390> used<00:01:39.720> some<00:01:40.049> tricks<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to me that they've used some tricks to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.649 
to me that they've used some tricks to
attempt<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> bring<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> resolution<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
attempt to bring the resolution and the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.480 
attempt to bring the resolution and the
texture<00:01:43.020> quality<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.040> think<00:01:44.369> they

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
texture quality up and I think they

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
texture quality up and I think they
might<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.729> using<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.060> tiling<00:01:45.659> system<00:01:46.170> because

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
might be using a tiling system because

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.340 
might be using a tiling system because
when<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> camera<00:01:47.670> moves<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
when the camera moves you can see the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499 
when the camera moves you can see the
texture<00:01:49.740> levels<00:01:50.070> dropping<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.850> objects<00:01:51.360> all

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
texture levels dropping on objects all

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.910 
texture levels dropping on objects all
around<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.079> especially<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.649> things<00:01:52.829> like

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
around you especially on things like

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.710 
around you especially on things like
