00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.279

 pretreated we have a nice 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.490
 turned to turn 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.660

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 Complemented dry for four weeks 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.050

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 a really fantastic meal afterwards 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.070
 What minutes will be hot for a few minutes 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.070
 and then we can start 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.660
 The two release almost takes five 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.650
 minutes a server forward and 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.180
 reverse rotation of the grill is hot and 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.750
 I would like to have this piece directly 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.960
 in it 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.190

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.470
 Damn hot embers that about one 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:09.050
 temperature of 300 degrees in the grill 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 has 90 seconds are over isolated 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:30.709

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.950
 cool side think that here too 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.030

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.030
 absolutely nothing at all 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.670
 but to cook for implementing finished 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.280
 the temperature with the many poles 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.800

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:43.240

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:46.230

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.160
 It's about 100 degrees, that's a whole 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.440
 lasts until the core temperature of 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:24.600
 Meat went up thermometer 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.919
 teeming can reach temperature and 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.690
 in here is so cool that it 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.760
 can almost touch with a hand 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:36.870
 that is, I'm putting the same thing on it 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:42.780
