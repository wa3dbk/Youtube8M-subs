00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.770
 in this video we are going to study how 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.189
 the relative movements of the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.060
 sun and the polar star along 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:37.220
 the months we will start with the sun 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.880
 we are at the winter solstice 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.000
 December 21 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.920
 and we are increasing the days and we see how 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 the sun is increasing its decline 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.030
 at twelve o'clock noon we see that the sun 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.340
 is located south of the place of 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.930
 observation 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.930
 and we have come to 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.180
 April 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.549
 a moment when the sun is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.430
 approximately near the equator and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.680
 now we are in June very close to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.730
 the position of maximum declination of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.490
 sun we are going to approach the 21st 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.040
 and the sun has arrived at the moment of 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.120
 maximum decline now as we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.510
 we increase the days in July it goes down 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.510
 Tall 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.189
 and decreasing its decline we have 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.259
 approached now to September and again 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.750
 is near the equator because we are already 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.390
 at the autumn equinox very close to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 autumn equinox in October follows 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.450
 going down 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.460
 Y 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.220
 as we approach the solstice 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.530
 of winter in December 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.320
 for he turns the sun to put on a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.800
 decline of minus 23 degrees ie 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.980
 very close to the horizon we are 40 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.930
 degrees of latitude in the place of 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.930
 Madrid observation approximately 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.920
 now we see these movements of form 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.370
 fast happening the months one after 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.540
 other 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.659
 six months goes up and six months goes down six 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.659
 months goes up and six months low 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.230
 now let's see how 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.900
 changes how the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.569
 position of the polar star throughout 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.030
 of the months 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.959
 we put ourselves at a time where you see 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.639
 the polar star over the horizon and 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.469
 we are going through the months one after the other 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.620
 and we see that the position of the star 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.950
 polar is always the same this happens 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.640
 why 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.630
 position of the polar is always the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.500
 height in degrees 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.290
 of the place of observation of the latitude 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.469
 of prayer places 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.200
 as we can see it does not change the position 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:28.549
 of the polar in terms of its height 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.549
 regarding the horizon 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.140
 i 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.220
 and now let's see how the 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.380
 position of the sun at dawn 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.280
 we have been looking towards the east 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.190
 and we are going to be happening the months now 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.310
 we are in June when the sun is very 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.340
 near or closer to the polar star 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.739
 that is, the sun in June deviates towards 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.000
 the north and towards December on 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.560
 November of December deviates towards 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.560
 the south as we can see now 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.530
 so what we can see looking towards 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.350
 the east is that the position of the sun is 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.350
 oscillating around a 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.930
 straight that is the plane of the equator 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:56.199
 what can we see 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.090
 like an inclined green stripe is 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:59.530
 inclined because we are in a 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.050
 40 degree observation spot 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.919
 north latitude if we were in the 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.990
 ecuador is to that plane would be 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.740
 completely vertical with respect to 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.740
 our horizon
