 disappointed at having shot him but I 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.610
 you admit that the map of the day is 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.260
 necessarily hip to the king why because 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.940
 that it's a pokemon like dragon my 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.580
 favorite team is a hall 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.230
 hops rivers in beauty I would say 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.670
 even though I prefer non capture 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.470
 I find that the illustration is very 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.000
 beautiful at the edge of a beach that looks 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.340
 to be ice cream is also necessarily 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.710
 than the plasma season but I like everything 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.240

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.870
