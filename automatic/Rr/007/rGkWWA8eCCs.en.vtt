the<00:01:34.360> profile<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.350> really<00:01:35.380> like<00:01:35.710> the

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
the profile of this I really like the

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.490 
the profile of this I really like the
way<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.430> sits<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:36.910> we<00:01:37.420> have<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.690> PSU<00:01:38.140> here

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
way that it sits so we have the PSU here

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.370 
way that it sits so we have the PSU here
there's<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:38.890> USB<00:01:39.660> there's<00:01:40.660> headphone<00:01:41.050> jack

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
there's some LEDs there and then we have

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.570 
there's some LEDs there and then we have
a<00:01:43.869> little<00:01:44.320> volume<00:01:44.560> rocker<00:01:44.920> because<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:45.369> is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
a little volume rocker because this is

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.880 
a little volume rocker because this is
this<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.300> tablet<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.140> now<00:01:47.259> if<00:01:47.410> I<00:01:47.470> just<00:01:47.530> spin

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
this is a tablet so now if I just spin

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.680 
this is a tablet so now if I just spin
this<00:01:47.979> around<00:01:48.130> we<00:01:49.060> can<00:01:49.210> check<00:01:49.390> out<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.600> other

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
this around we can check out the other

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.770 
this around we can check out the other
side<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.850> around<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.119> other<00:01:52.300> side<00:01:52.600> if<00:01:52.720> you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
side so around the other side if you

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.430 
side so around the other side if you
