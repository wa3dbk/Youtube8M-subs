00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello today we hunt together a bot 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.080
 because that is for many newcomers in the game 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.029
 one of the first really strong opponents 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.109
 if we briefly press here then break 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.630
 can you look at which 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.400
 equipment we have used and yes now 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.680
 Started the corresponding quest is 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.750
 Attack leadership and first and foremost 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.060
 Of course we go to the blue box 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.610
 get the map the first help 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.730
 the ration the whetstone the ration 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.910
 Choose a cold drink and possibly color 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.440
 also the cleaner out so to the ball 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.079
 Searching is best done first 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.089
 three there is most often now and then 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.890
 but also a wii 2 or 4 and in 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.899
 rare falls in areas 9 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.239
 Here we are just for example 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.030
 4 and here he digs out of the earth 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.129
 this is a very common method 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.499
 how a bath appears 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.569
 first of all he will be like many big ones 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.139
 How to start screaming 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.850
 if you do not have earplugs then 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:05.950
 your character is briefly stunned 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.090
 since you get hit once that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.799
 but not bad 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.270
 which you absolutely must avoid 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.270
 if you are against such a bharat 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.189
 is fighting to attack him from scratch 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.049
 if you are here between the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.060
 legs is then you are most 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.820
 pretty safe from many of his 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.039
 attacks and most importantly it is 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.079
 definitely avoid his head 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.250
 with the attack you see here 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.270
 one does not distance most 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.680
 harm and can once good 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.340
 already prepared heroes half 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.340
 under boxes 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.650
 by the way, if you're important, 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.840
 even elementary weapons there have also 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.780
 to know that as long as he mudded 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.820
 Covered is very prone to water and 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 ice is and as soon as you are his 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.310
 Sludge layer chipped off against fire 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.960
 and ice is very vulnerable when the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.720
 Baroque by the way sour is then rise 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.940
 out of his head as seen right here 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.470
 such smoke clouds on then you should 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.540
 keep a little distance because then 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.110
 He is very fast and yes I make 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.910
 think a little more harm if 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.769
 Of course, the ball is on the ground 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.110
 the same as for all monsters skin everything 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.519
 what you have and the advisory board has 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.650
 a peculiar r shakes more often 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.480
 mud of it as seen here then 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.100
 It may be if now that we hitht 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.600
 will himself to a mud clump 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.760
 then best to use the cleaner 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.790
 or you like a smaller one here 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.350
 Let's beat a lot if he builds that 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.120
 then he changed his mind 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.739
 and if you want to know where he's running 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.019
 and do not mark him with a fall 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.569
 then you can have this little one 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.739
 Dust clouds follow her then briefly 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.739
 above the surface sees 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 The baroque will be within the fight 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 change the area a few times until he is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.650
 then starts to rumble and a 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.489
 hopefully the very last time in one 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.709
 new area goes 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.280
 Here you can see the dust clouds again 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.520
 then just run after and the 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.050
 fight is as good as decided 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.940
 Incidentally, it is also important that the baron 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.620
 as soon as he no longer sleeps at the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.019
 legs or body has a lot 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.750
 vulnerable manufacturing is so if so 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.030
 then it will attack with water 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.800
 mud fall off of him faster and faster 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 you can just defeat him 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.120
 that was the Baroque if you were one 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.560
 special monster you which we like 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.750
 a guide would then write 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.650
 just in the comments and otherwise 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.650
 Until next time
