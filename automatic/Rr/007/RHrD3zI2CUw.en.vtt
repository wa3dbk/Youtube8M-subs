00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.009 
this particular bird design is that it's
got<00:02:08.840> a<00:02:08.989> lot<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.319> scroll<00:02:09.830> design<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.810> it

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
got a lot of scroll design in it so it

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.500 
got a lot of scroll design in it so it
cuts<00:02:12.349> better<00:02:12.680> larger<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:14.030> i'm<00:02:14.239> going<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.450> go

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
cuts better larger so i'm going to go

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.960 
cuts better larger so i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:15.019> choose<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.439> height

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
ahead and choose the height

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.720 
ahead and choose the height
my<00:02:16.150> bird<00:02:16.330> at<00:02:16.480> seven<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.990> half<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:18.400> is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
perfect moving a little bit and he will

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.180 
perfect moving a little bit and he will
cut<00:02:22.660> in<00:02:22.900> between<00:02:23.050> those<00:02:23.440> red<00:02:23.620> lines<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.130> I'm
