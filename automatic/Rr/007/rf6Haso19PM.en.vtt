00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.550
 Me or something 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:16.200
 I something anyway doing even useless'm Dan 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:16.200
 Screaming so much , he shook his tears with his large tears and hit his knee with his fist again and again 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.940
 When he is in 1 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.940
 Event of one day 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.710
 Events of such a day that failed in the railway that worked hard 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:40.890
 In two years 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 At that time he still does not know that he will pass top high school 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.070
 later 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.900
 He recalls that day 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.370
 I talked to me 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.579
 teacher 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.170
 That crying day 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.100
 Go home 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.100
 Standing thought alone 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.650
 Am I really useless 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.379
 Is it okay to use it as it is? 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.840
 What do you want to do? 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.409
 Any student 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:24.090
 Troubled hit in a number of walls and look-not there 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.180
 Smooth sailing 's not something you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.430
 For example 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.050
 Let's say the ship is floating 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.920
 The ship goes before 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:43.759
 Then white waves will stand and you will receive water resistance 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.759
 The faster you go, the more you will resist the water 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.700
 Advance of the 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.000
 A ship that has been stopped 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 If there is nothing to do, the form will change 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 Just floating in there 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 If you are now 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.060
 I'm sorry 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.350
 It is painful 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.490
 It is painful 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:14.610
 Once it has that feel that way 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.610
 It is noon 7 you are going forward 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.450
 That's right 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.860
 That's great- 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.860
 I wonder what or never wrong 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:38.220
 Sana will cheer you to be Susumo to such before with full force 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:38.220
 Friends to be Susumo before doing so is to have a lot to become the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.600
 I'm not alone 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.560
 Have courage and live before 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.930
 Ikundayo be out rowing it to the ocean of life 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.030
