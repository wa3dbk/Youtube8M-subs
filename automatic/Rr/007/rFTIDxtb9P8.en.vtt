00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
like to show you a few things about how

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.720 
like to show you a few things about how
I<00:00:02.580> chip<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.030> ball<00:00:03.740> as<00:00:04.740> with<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> lot<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.220> my<00:00:05.400> shot

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
I chip the ball as with a lot of my shot

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.880 
I chip the ball as with a lot of my shot
I<00:00:06.049> think<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.109> most<00:00:07.200> important<00:00:07.649> thing<00:00:07.680> is

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
I think the most important thing is

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.209 
I think the most important thing is
consistency<00:00:08.510> something<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.630> repeatable

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
consistency something is repeatable

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.290 
consistency something is repeatable
therefore<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.340> use<00:00:11.519> same<00:00:11.820> technique

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
therefore I use same technique

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.950 
therefore I use same technique
throughout<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:13.049> my<00:00:13.200> tipping<00:00:13.530> clubs<00:00:14.570> my<00:00:15.570> basic

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
throughout all my tipping clubs my basic

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.710 
throughout all my tipping clubs my basic
technique<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:17.180> here<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.449> pitching

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
technique is here I have a pitching

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.580 
technique is here I have a pitching
wedge<00:00:20.029> when<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.060> assess<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.720> shop<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.199> think<00:00:22.500> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
wedge when I assess my shop I think of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
wedge when I assess my shop I think of
two<00:00:22.769> things<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.400> pick<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> point<00:00:24.240> where<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> want

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
two things I pick a point where I want

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
two things I pick a point where I want
the<00:00:24.810> board<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> land<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.849> about

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the board to land and then I think about

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.089 
the board to land and then I think about
how<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> ball<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.660> going<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> react<00:00:28.590> once<00:00:28.920> it's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
how the ball is going to react once it's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.590 
how the ball is going to react once it's
landed<00:00:29.670> IE<00:00:30.300> roll<00:00:30.750> towards<00:00:31.199> our<00:00:31.349> target<00:00:32.600> with

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
landed IE roll towards our target with

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.250 
landed IE roll towards our target with
that<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.870> mind<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:35.780> choose<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.200> appropriate

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
that in mind I choose the appropriate

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.660
