 brought dynamo dresden once again 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.950
 fresh attacking first but comes first 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.140
 it differently

 at points today in mainz actually 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.880
 Duty as if the pressure were not yet 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.950
 enough also worrying martin 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.810
 stefaniak again trouble the logo of ins 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.760
 second team relegated but at the 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.590
 strained athletic situation becomes 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.480
 every man uses eric 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.270
 butter bread is the fan now in mainz 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.100
 reappeared yes that's it 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.050
 stefanie vorarlberg is back in the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 squad for this game even if he 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 must first sit on the bench 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.540
 what his dissatisfaction is not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 it's sure to get smaller 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.660
 change he closes for the summer yes 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.580

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 bremen would be connected 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.240
 like to wave winke make his trainer 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.800
 Does not taste that at all but not 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.480
 affirms that stefan haag his 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.189
 Lesson learned has trained again 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.000
 Neat maybe it's enough today 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.799
 for a short operation over 1000 dynamo 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 Fans have traveled to the first game 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.119
 dresdens at the castle path at them 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.549
 So it should not be today 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.880
 yellow-black has the same progression 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.450
 We found a corner and make 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.499
 Mainzer I can with the Querschläger 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.359
 possibility from the background through 

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:32.189
 rolf ast the first close chance for 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.140
 dresden good start of the yellow-black 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.090
 net in any case like the three today 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.719
 Changes in the startelf too 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.719
 has recorded 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.689
 tenth minute game mainz for the first time 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.649
 in dresden tour on the left side 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.780
 is that müller against kreuzer müller and 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.189
 wiegers attentive of dynamo 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.140
 he has this closing man this week 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.390
 his contract until 2017 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.369
 So he extended by two years though 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.149
 only in September as a contract 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.369
 player to the elbe came close 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.530
 quarter past past first corner mainz 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.849
 But the Danube fans want this 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.099
 do not hinder because the 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.920
 Execution after three minutes then can 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.209
 but go for it 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 who is confused here but it is 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.970
 but not mine and at dresden justin 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.069
 eilers 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.170
 yes, where did the ball actually come from? 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.170
 no way to the opponent but there ends up 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.599
 the sneer quite alone huge opportunity 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.579
 for mainz and giant freak for 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.220
 dresden's first really good chance for 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.200
 the hosts 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.870
 dresden but not long shocked 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.030
 replies playfully that is andrich 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 nice pass on com marius the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.410
 upcoming position and great shot 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.810
 good try centner but safe in the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.120
 mainzer box combo jos strong in this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.670
 scene was also in the meantime in 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.639
 the criticism of his trainer get it 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.109
 no reason to complain download after 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.930
 it is a lively one within 20 minutes 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.670
 can not play against mainz dresden 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.920
 clarify 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.269
 francos in the background and he suits 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.190
 null for the table penultimate dennis 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.980
 putting on the scorer in the 18th 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.139
 minute of play and again pissed off already 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.510
 an early backlog for dynamo 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.060
 in each of the last six league games 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.480
 dresden gegentore cashed and also 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.489
 today because rosbach häfele down müller 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.940
 Run away and then release the ball 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.940
 aviation gasoline he knows no mercy 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:45.879
 dresden is now seeking a reaction 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.590
 the table nuunte engages justin 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.090
 eilers 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.920
 great parade of ziegler and there too 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.599
 once again sunny with the ball 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.920
 direction city center 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.590
 it's just completely bewitched both in 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.810
 the 14th man as well as his 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.970
 only four goals play in the last 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.690
 six games in dresden succeeded 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.690
 it's just continuous 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.690
 load 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.200
 under trainer peter nemeth who can 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.590
 almost sorry for you 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.720
 He suffers from the sideline is good 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.680
 maybe nothing will be better 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.210
 in half two much idle first 15 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.169
 minutes nothing happens and then the 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.690
 chance for help what a 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.830
 possibility 60 the spielminute that must 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.830
 it's one on one 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:42.260
 For this he will be the mainzer defender 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.360
 But what is that in conclusion that 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.360
 has little to do with bad luck that is then 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.460
 simply a piece of assets as well 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.889
 horrible because we have so little and 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.740
 Compagnons then it should be 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.610
 change willing 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.470
 stefania comes for comparis was winters 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.760
 is the question what has dynamo too 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:09.190
 saving money now throws everything away 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.190
 front of the is the new man stefan yes 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.400
 and then that's the right way 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.380
 Great chances are jumping for his pull 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.240
 not here from peter nemeth on what is 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.340
 he might already think of his 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.350
 future or the sporty descent 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.330
 the dynamo the last seconds miller 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.120
 on c shear screwed a higher 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.070
 and centner gets ready 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.190
 long and has the ball firmly in his 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.949
 hands bet the 1 0 victory for mainz 05 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.400
 and thus increases the crisis and 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.590
 judge 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.210
 We were too late in battles 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.130
 were not aggressive enough in 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.229
 battles and we just know better 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.500
 play as we are currently showing what 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.460
 is it still still the 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.320
 next two three days 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.360
 put together and focus 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.830
 I also put up 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.419
 unmistakably actually to the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.710
 stated that we are now exactly 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.840
 look also in the light of the new 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.060
 season 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.210
 who finally comes into question there and 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:14.610
 how we deal with it 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:16.620
 we will not now terribly disappointed 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.270
 and that's also martin stephan hunt 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.219
 but the peace is with dynamo again 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:24.509
 made and how do you continue with 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.949
 he has nothing to do with them either 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.169
 suspension or the like more 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.189
 but was for the moment but is 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.550
 a decision pleased by that 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:34.280
 a topic that was absolutely acceptable 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.090
 and tomorrow belongs to the team and 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.419
 interests young 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.150
 where was that was next year yet 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.740
 Friends of pleasure can be in dresden though 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
 currently no talk 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.910
 seven defeats in eight 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.770
 Duties 2015 it stay 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.770
 stormy days on the same
