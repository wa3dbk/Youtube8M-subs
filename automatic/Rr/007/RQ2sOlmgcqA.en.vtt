00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 the ten points that the project wanted to realize were determined on the basis 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.139
 of the different cards 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.179
 which stores it is good 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.829
 so we can 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.169
 physical access to places for urban development 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.060
 an actor 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.050
 we were given the opportunity or for the moment the natural point of view 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.619
 not like in on the criticism that did not come 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.670
 And those obligations tons are actually the clusters you can be a boy 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 in those places where that of different cards as a let alone 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.230
 have now laid on each other india 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.990
 if ever that might make and bring extras 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.520
 set up with the zoning one afternoon the metro was just that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.059
 both one 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.490
 expires for the time being 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.160
 Which 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.350
 if you go to victory 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.380
 development 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.989
 of the past 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.450
 for this 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.460
 m but is like the key stores 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.440
 vermeer saves 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.560
 the Romanian work and in between the church another medieval piece 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.520
 a landscape with playing 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.830
 with a place in the next round 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.170
 those are the substantive and the members 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 with a sheet 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.390
 that the project 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.390
 the exhibition project 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
 present 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.370
 We invited artists as a winner as the micro show 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.930
 if death is a change 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.120
 the central image one of the exhibition 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.010
 So 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.390
 so I think I have a church that can see through the sun 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.630
 2 that is possible 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.009
 increasingly with a collective strike by two artists 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.490
 why 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.660
 but that the electric therefore 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.909
 with a shot like the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.909
 from a few layers 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.449
 a perfect example and 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.760
 as the largest landscapes in an area affected by the 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.119
 pro round has let alone 24 hours 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 and I find it so close to being and actually a re-use 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.379
 h this year from 2011 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.719
 it would be three times for the first time 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.760
 effective learners and 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.819
 the discussion and debate about 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.139
 the re-use of the effect must be punished 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.290
 guarantee 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.370
 campaign image anp 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.469
 per barrel 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:48.319
 the church atmosphere there plays with the optical illusion of being and not voting well 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.110
 Yes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.210
 the city sits by it's landscape design and it was strongly present 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.819
 effect occurs and 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.819
 it is that experience a the government 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.769
 and by one 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.499
 artwork we want 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.899
 and never before with the garage are all sides intended 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.260
 to the discussion the mortality 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.480
 indefinitely tennis hence the name location as points
