00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.920 

so<00:00:08.519> apparently<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.480> testificandum<00:00:11.780> know<00:00:12.780> it

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
so apparently the testificandum know it

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.310 
so apparently the testificandum know it
could<00:00:13.110> possibly<00:00:13.320> before<00:00:13.740> but<00:00:15.109> it's<00:00:16.109> just

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
could possibly before but it's just

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.200 
could possibly before but it's just
proved<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.920> little<00:00:17.100> bit<00:00:17.250> too<00:00:17.430> difficult<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.029> me

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
proved a little bit too difficult for me

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.759 
proved a little bit too difficult for me
I<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.359> couldn't<00:00:18.960> understand<00:00:19.380> it

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:19.769 
I just couldn't understand it

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.640 
I just couldn't understand it
so<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.930> enroll<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.109> help<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> my

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
so I'm going to enroll the help of my

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.100 
so I'm going to enroll the help of my
friends<00:00:23.070> Billy<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.730> bat<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.780> hack<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.680> system

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
friends Billy the bat to hack the system

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.370 
friends Billy the bat to hack the system
now<00:00:28.789> he's<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:29.940> the<00:00:30.090> fastest<00:00:30.600> of<00:00:30.720> workers<00:00:31.110> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
now he's not the fastest of workers but

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.160 
now he's not the fastest of workers but
can<00:00:32.129> still<00:00:32.250> work<00:00:32.489> quite<00:00:32.820> good<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.780> these

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
can still work quite good so these

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.900 
can still work quite good so these
lights<00:00:34.379> are<00:00:34.500> indicating<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:35.609> far

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
lights are indicating is just how far

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.260 
lights are indicating is just how far
he's<00:00:36.030> gone

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
he's gone

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.189 
he's gone
and<00:00:36.949> once<00:00:37.949> they<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.520> top<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.079> have

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
and once they just top you would have

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.869 
and once they just top you would have
hacked<00:00:40.409> the<00:00:40.589> system<00:00:40.769> and<00:00:41.190> hopefully<00:00:41.760> these

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
hacked the system and hopefully these

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.969 
hacked the system and hopefully these
doors<00:00:42.179> will<00:00:42.359> open<00:00:45.260> he's<00:00:46.260> cracked<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.800> code

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:46.979 
doors will open he's cracked the code

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.910 
doors will open he's cracked the code
the<00:00:47.789> doors<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.210> opened

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
the doors are opened

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
the doors are opened
finally<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.780> test<00:00:51.989> certificate

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
finally so in here the test certificate

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.500 
finally so in here the test certificate
has<00:00:52.559> been<00:00:52.620> hiding<00:00:53.100> out<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.729> they've<00:00:54.089> got<00:00:54.120> cake

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
has been hiding out and they've got cake

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.639 
has been hiding out and they've got cake
for<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:54.929> which<00:00:55.319> I<00:00:55.440> can't<00:00:55.620> eat<00:00:55.859> and<00:00:57.319> all<00:00:58.319> this

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
for me which I can't eat and all this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.500 
for me which I can't eat and all this
treasure<00:00:58.949> affairs<00:00:59.489> I'm<00:00:59.639> sure<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.269> want<00:01:00.389> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
treasure affairs I'm sure they want to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.289 
treasure affairs I'm sure they want to
give<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> me<00:01:01.049> it<00:01:02.010> was<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.459> very<00:01:02.760> nice<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.269> them

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
give to me it was very very nice of them

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:06.140 
give to me it was very very nice of them
now<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.739> works<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.940> pretty

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
now how this works is actually pretty

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.399 
now how this works is actually pretty
simple<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:07.140> just<00:01:07.260> basically<00:01:07.680> uses<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.820> bats

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
simple it just basically uses the bats

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.010 
simple it just basically uses the bats
upwards<00:01:10.409> flying<00:01:10.940> where<00:01:11.940> was<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> called

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
upwards flying where was it called

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.210 
upwards flying where was it called
well<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> flies<00:01:14.460> basically<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:16.220> there's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
well how it flies basically and there's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240 
well how it flies basically and there's
a<00:01:17.280> tripwire<00:01:17.550> which<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.500> push<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.800> stair

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
a tripwire which will push this stair

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.660 
a tripwire which will push this stair
underneath<00:01:20.960> trip<00:01:21.960> wire<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.410> tripwire<00:01:22.800> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
underneath trip wire up the tripwire so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.400 
underneath trip wire up the tripwire so
it<00:01:23.790> can't<00:01:24.000> move<00:01:24.300> downwards<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.290> only

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
it can't move downwards so you can only

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.840 
it can't move downwards so you can only
move<00:01:25.560> upwards<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.580> flying

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
move upwards because it's flying

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.270 
move upwards because it's flying
patterns<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.360> bit<00:01:27.510> random<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> eventually

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
patterns a bit random so eventually

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
patterns a bit random so eventually
you'll<00:01:29.730> get<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.300> top<00:01:30.510> went<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you'll get all to the top went to the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.940 
you'll get all to the top went to the
top<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.010> bit<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:33.360> trip<00:01:33.720> wire<00:01:34.050> which

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
top to this bit this trip wire which

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
top to this bit this trip wire which
will<00:01:35.190> trigger<00:01:35.610> an<00:01:35.760> RS<00:01:36.090> nor<00:01:36.270> latch<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:36.870> which

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
will trigger an RS nor latch and which

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
will trigger an RS nor latch and which
will<00:01:37.770> trigger<00:01:38.370> pistons<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.060> open<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.540> door

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
will trigger pistons and open the door

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.100 
will trigger pistons and open the door
so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.590> pretty<00:01:40.680> simple<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:42.330> believe<00:01:42.810> only

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so it's pretty simple and I believe only

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.860 
so it's pretty simple and I believe only
bats<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.770> open<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.160> so<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:45.420> can't<00:01:45.630> throw

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
bats can open it so you can't throw

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.600 
bats can open it so you can't throw
snowballs<00:01:46.380> Nerys<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.160> stuff<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.430> they'd

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
snowballs Nerys and stuff because they'd

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
snowballs Nerys and stuff because they'd
actually<00:01:47.790> hit<00:01:48.120> them<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:49.290> show<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
actually hit them so I can show you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.270 
actually hit them so I can show you
yes<00:01:50.280> snowball<00:01:51.500> all<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:52.620> now<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.890> something

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
yes snowball all right now get something

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460 
yes snowball all right now get something
by<00:01:53.909> throwing<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.870> doesn't<00:01:55.080> actually<00:01:55.170> do

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
by throwing that it doesn't actually do

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.350 
by throwing that it doesn't actually do
anything

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
anything

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.360 
anything
so<00:01:57.360> yeah<00:01:57.480> it's<00:01:57.840> reasonable<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.440> quite

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
so yeah it's reasonable and quite

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.020 
so yeah it's reasonable and quite
effective<00:01:59.520> if<00:02:00.150> a<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.720> time-consuming<00:02:02.030> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
effective if a bit time-consuming and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.170 
effective if a bit time-consuming and
finally<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.050> like<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.860> make<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.700> big<00:02:05.909> thank

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
finally I just like to make a big thank

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.869 
finally I just like to make a big thank

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because I'd recently surpassed 2500

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.800 
because I'd recently surpassed 2500
subscribers<00:02:13.349> which<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.909> pretty<00:02:14.909> enormous<00:02:15.299> for

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
subscribers which is pretty enormous for

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.080 
subscribers which is pretty enormous for
me

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
me

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.670 
me
and<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.210> started<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.570> about<00:02:18.750> seven<00:02:19.470> months

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
and I started this about seven months

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.100 
and I started this about seven months
ago<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.160> something<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.170> never<00:02:22.170> expected<00:02:22.920> so
