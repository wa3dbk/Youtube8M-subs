00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
different relationship as a different

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.870 
different relationship as a different

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
something that's been generated there

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.340 
something that's been generated there
whether<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.190> some<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.909> peacefulness<00:01:45.840> or

though some have coldly mighty and
dreadful<00:02:16.430> it's<00:02:17.430> interesting<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.269> they

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
dreadful it's interesting that they

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.530 
dreadful it's interesting that they
often<00:02:18.930> will<00:02:19.530> choose<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.760> gestures<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.299> they

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.660 
called me I think that the girls really
enjoy<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.579> beauty<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.870> uris<00:02:40.290> me<00:02:40.530> whereas<00:02:41.489> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670

boys can relate to the strength of
gesture<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:47.690> could<00:02:48.690> say<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.650> way<00:02:49.799> you

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
gesture I could say that in a way you

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.860 
gesture I could say that in a way you
perhaps<00:02:50.310> have<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.820> greatest<00:02:51.150> challenged

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
perhaps have the greatest challenged

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
perhaps have the greatest challenged

to explore who they are so they're
trying<00:03:12.690> all<00:03:12.870> kinds<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.380> different<00:03:13.739> things

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
trying all kinds of different things

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.940 
trying all kinds of different things
that<00:03:15.120> they<00:03:15.300> can<00:03:15.480> be<00:03:15.510> better<00:03:15.810> adjusted<00:03:16.650> and

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
that they can be better adjusted and

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.580 
that they can be better adjusted and
more<00:03:17.490> in<00:03:17.730> touch<00:03:18.000> with<00:03:18.060> themselves<00:03:18.930> on<00:03:19.320> very

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
more in touch with themselves on very

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.250 
more in touch with themselves on very

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
different and various levels I think is

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.230 
different and various levels I think is
something<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.490> rythme<00:03:23.820> can<00:03:24.000> help

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
something that you rythme can help

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.660 
something that you rythme can help
perhaps<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.740> more<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.010> touch<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
perhaps to be more in touch with the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.390 
perhaps to be more in touch with the
sensitive<00:03:27.210> side<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.750> themselves<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.130> more
