00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
angling it that's great because then you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.380 
angling it that's great because then you
pull<00:01:17.369> your<00:01:17.460> opponent<00:01:17.820> off<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> court<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
they are in terrible position but if you

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.600 
they are in terrible position but if you
don't<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.439> angle<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:26.310> hitting

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
any ball that lands short is a liability

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
any ball that lands short is a liability
particularly<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> guy<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.450> 66<00:01:37.439> so

particularly for a guy that is 66 so

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.640 
particularly for a guy that is 66 so
darling<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.490> 64<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.720> those<00:01:40.049> balls<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.470> kick

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
darling is 64 so those balls would kick

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.679 
darling is 64 so those balls would kick
up<00:01:40.770> real<00:01:41.009> high<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.450> going<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
up real high and that's not going to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.510 
up real high and that's not going to
give<00:01:42.869> those<00:01:43.020> guys<00:01:43.229> much<00:01:43.619> trouble<00:01:44.040> someone

wheelhouse<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.939> those<00:01:56.939> short<00:01:57.570> balls<00:01:57.810> if<00:01:57.960> he

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
wheelhouse so on those short balls if he

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.560 
wheelhouse so on those short balls if he
had<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> backhand<00:01:58.680> he<00:01:59.490> hits<00:01:59.670> delpo<00:02:00.119> also<00:02:00.390> hits

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
had a backhand he hits delpo also hits

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.780 
had a backhand he hits delpo also hits
real<00:02:00.750> flat<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.920> ball<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.219> above<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.490> net

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
real flat so the ball is above the net

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
real flat so the ball is above the net
he<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.090> hit<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> flat<00:02:04.140> ball<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.860> hit

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
he can hit that flat ball and really hit

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.210 
he can hit that flat ball and really hit
through<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.960> he<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.350> crack<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
through it and he would just crack the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.240 
through it and he would just crack the
ball<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.819> corner<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> corner<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.129> he<00:02:11.129> was

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
ball from corner to corner and he was

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
ball from corner to corner and he was
running<00:02:11.580> Rafa<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.209> over<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.930> court

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
running Rafa all over the court

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.530 
running Rafa all over the court
and<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:14.220> other<00:02:14.370> thing<00:02:14.430> about<00:02:14.549> Rafa<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.269> he

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and the other thing about Rafa is he

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.240 
and the other thing about Rafa is he
likes<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> typically<00:02:16.769> start<00:02:17.010> from<00:02:17.129> a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
likes to typically start from a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.770 
likes to typically start from a
defensive<00:02:17.700> position<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.299> then<00:02:18.480> you'll<00:02:18.599> see

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
defensive position and then you'll see

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.199 
defensive position and then you'll see
him<00:02:18.930> slowly<00:02:19.650> work<00:02:20.010> his<00:02:20.189> way<00:02:20.340> up<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
him slowly work his way up to the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.600 
him slowly work his way up to the
baseline<00:02:21.959> when<00:02:22.290> he's<00:02:22.409> transitioning<00:02:23.129> offense

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
baseline when he's transitioning offense

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.069 
baseline when he's transitioning offense
well<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:25.069> he<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.400> playing<00:02:27.150> defense<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.780> start

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:28.079 
well if he is playing defense to start

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.800 
well if he is playing defense to start
and<00:02:28.290> he's<00:02:28.920> being<00:02:29.340> kept<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.790> defense<00:02:30.180> by<00:02:30.360> delpo

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
and he's being kept on defense by delpo

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.250 
and he's being kept on defense by delpo
then<00:02:31.620> he<00:02:31.890> has<00:02:32.129> a<00:02:32.459> ton<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.269> real<00:02:33.900> estate<00:02:34.049> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
then he has a ton of real estate to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.770 
then he has a ton of real estate to
cover<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.970> it's<00:02:35.970> going<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.180> be<00:02:36.299> hard<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.720> him

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
cover and it's going to be hard for him

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.509 
cover and it's going to be hard for him
to<00:02:36.840> take<00:02:37.110> control<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.620> point<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.099> he's<00:02:38.370> not

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
to take control the point and he's not

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.479 
to take control the point and he's not
going<00:02:38.579> to<00:02:38.670> win<00:02:38.819> many<00:02:39.030> points<00:02:39.480> unless<00:02:40.010> delpo<00:02:41.010> or

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
going to win many points unless delpo or

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.880 
going to win many points unless delpo or
so<00:02:42.150> darling<00:02:42.420> or<00:02:42.540> whoever<00:02:42.810> mrs.<00:02:43.409> and<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.650> course

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
so darling or whoever mrs. and of course

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.530 
so darling or whoever mrs. and of course
that<00:02:44.159> wasn't<00:02:44.430> happening<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.239> was<00:02:45.359> one<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
that wasn't happening so that was one of

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.710 
that wasn't happening so that was one of
the<00:02:45.599> reasons<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.170> del<00:02:46.739> Potro<00:02:47.359> was<00:02:48.359> really

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the reasons that del Potro was really

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.559 
the reasons that del Potro was really
able<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:49.470> dominate<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:50.129> match<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:51.239> final

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
able to dominate this match the final

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.030 
able to dominate this match the final
point<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:51.840> want<00:02:52.049> to<00:02:52.079> make<00:02:52.139> is<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.799> don't

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
point I want to make is that I don't

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.280 
point I want to make is that I don't
think<00:02:53.280> Rafa's<00:02:53.670> injury<00:02:54.060> played<00:02:54.870> into<00:02:55.170> this

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
think Rafa's injury played into this

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.949 
think Rafa's injury played into this
match<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.889> results<00:02:56.370> too<00:02:56.849> much<00:02:57.120> sure<00:02:57.720> his

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
match the results too much sure his

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.199 
match the results too much sure his
serve<00:02:58.349> wasn't<00:02:58.739> up<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:58.859> snuff<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.790> his<00:03:00.000> serve

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
serve wasn't up to snuff but his serve

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.170 
serve wasn't up to snuff but his serve
is<00:03:00.239> not<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> huge<00:03:00.840> weapon<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:02.430> bottom<00:03:02.970> line

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
is not a huge weapon and the bottom line

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.990 
is not a huge weapon and the bottom line
is<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.450> del<00:03:03.840> Potro<00:03:04.379> had<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.370> perfect<00:03:05.639> game

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
is that del Potro had the perfect game

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.930 
is that del Potro had the perfect game
plan<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.629> he<00:03:07.200> had<00:03:07.319> amazing<00:03:07.889> execution<00:03:08.639> I<00:03:08.760> mean

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
plan and he had amazing execution I mean

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.610 
plan and he had amazing execution I mean
the<00:03:09.000> guy<00:03:09.030> barely<00:03:09.569> made<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> mistake<00:03:10.319> he<00:03:10.500> was

match<00:03:53.609> del<00:03:54.299> Potro<00:03:54.690> vs<00:03:55.049> federer<00:03:55.349> who's<00:03:55.889> going

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
match del Potro vs federer who's going

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.430 
match del Potro vs federer who's going
to<00:03:56.159> win<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.549> think<00:03:57.150> Federer<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.540> four<00:03:57.870> sets<00:03:58.139> but

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
to win I think Federer in four sets but

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.509 
to win I think Federer in four sets but
I<00:03:58.500> wouldn't<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:58.859> surprised<00:03:59.190> if<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.489> was

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
I wouldn't be surprised if it was

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.460 
I wouldn't be surprised if it was
straights<00:03:59.879> now<00:04:00.569> I<00:04:00.599> just<00:04:00.930> talked<00:04:01.109> about<00:04:01.169> how

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
straights now I just talked about how

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.210 
straights now I just talked about how
awesome<00:04:01.769> del<00:04:02.310> Potro<00:04:02.699> was<00:04:02.849> playing<00:04:03.150> but

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
awesome del Potro was playing but

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.949 
awesome del Potro was playing but
Federer<00:04:05.220> is<00:04:05.370> playing<00:04:05.669> even<00:04:06.269> more<00:04:06.480> awesome

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
Federer is playing even more awesome

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.740 
Federer is playing even more awesome
this<00:04:07.590> guy<00:04:07.799> I<00:04:07.829> mean<00:04:08.280> we<00:04:08.519> all<00:04:08.639> saw<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.150> between

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
this guy I mean we all saw the between

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.110 
this guy I mean we all saw the between
the<00:04:09.840> leg<00:04:09.989> shot<00:04:10.229> yesterday<00:04:10.530> but<00:04:11.129> I<00:04:11.370> think<00:04:11.970> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the leg shot yesterday but I think the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.869 
the leg shot yesterday but I think the
the<00:04:12.299> larger<00:04:12.750> issue<00:04:12.930> here<00:04:13.079> is<00:04:13.560> that<00:04:13.879> federer's

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
the larger issue here is that federer's

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.680 
the larger issue here is that federer's
game<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:16.280> Matt<00:04:17.280> matches<00:04:17.849> up<00:04:18.000> pretty<00:04:18.180> well<00:04:18.359> with

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
game is Matt matches up pretty well with

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.629 
game is Matt matches up pretty well with
del<00:04:18.870> Potro<00:04:19.320> del<00:04:19.680> Potro<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.099> not<00:04:20.220> going<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> get

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
del Potro del Potro is not going to get

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.570 
del Potro del Potro is not going to get
high<00:04:21.269> kicking<00:04:22.079> balls<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.770> his<00:04:22.889> forehand<00:04:23.370> or

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
high kicking balls to his forehand or

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.510 
high kicking balls to his forehand or
his<00:04:23.700> back<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.330> he<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.599> turn<00:04:24.840> on<00:04:25.080> and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
his back in that he can turn on and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.440 
his back in that he can turn on and
federer<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.639> actually<00:04:26.909> going<00:04:27.000> to<00:04:27.090> hit<00:04:27.240> him

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
federer is actually going to hit him

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.860 
federer is actually going to hit him
a lot<00:04:28.110> of<00:04:28.140> slices<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.310> did<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.610> video<00:04:29.870> maybe

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
a lot of slices now I did a video maybe

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.840 
a lot of slices now I did a video maybe
a<00:04:30.960> couple<00:04:31.140> months<00:04:31.290> ago<00:04:31.500> about<00:04:31.950> how<00:04:32.250> Federer

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
a couple months ago about how Federer

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.960 
a couple months ago about how Federer
uses<00:04:33.300> his<00:04:33.480> backhand<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.530> set<00:04:34.830> up<00:04:35.040> his<00:04:35.370> forehand

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
uses his backhand to set up his forehand

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.870 
uses his backhand to set up his forehand
and<00:04:36.120> we'll<00:04:36.300> probably<00:04:36.570> see<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.290> today<00:04:37.880> you'll

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
and we'll probably see that today you'll

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.410 
and we'll probably see that today you'll
get<00:04:39.060> fed<00:04:39.390> hitting<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:40.940> variety<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.090> know<00:04:42.180> he'll

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
get fed hitting a variety you know he'll

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.750 
get fed hitting a variety you know he'll
go<00:04:42.540> slice<00:04:42.900> than<00:04:43.200> maybe<00:04:43.350> topspin<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.310> then

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
go slice than maybe topspin and then

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.370 
go slice than maybe topspin and then
slice<00:04:45.060> you'll<00:04:45.300> alternate<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:45.840> particularly

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
slice you'll alternate I particularly

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.350 
slice you'll alternate I particularly
you<00:04:46.650> know<00:04:46.680> expect<00:04:47.100> them<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.310> use<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:48.060> slice<00:04:48.330> a

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
you know expect them to use the slice a

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.930 
you know expect them to use the slice a
lot<00:04:48.660> with<00:04:49.500> del<00:04:49.710> potro<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.490> get<00:04:50.640> them<00:04:50.760> you<00:04:50.850> know

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
lot with del potro to get them you know

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.660 
lot with del potro to get them you know
to<00:04:51.000> make<00:04:51.120> del<00:04:51.330> potro<00:04:51.720> bend<00:04:52.440> down<00:04:52.680> in<00:04:52.980> 66<00:04:53.430> that

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
to make del potro bend down in 66 that

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.250 
to make del potro bend down in 66 that
can<00:04:53.820> be<00:04:53.910> tough<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.270> do<00:04:54.420> over<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.750> course<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:55.170> a

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
can be tough to do over the course of a

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.010 
can be tough to do over the course of a
five-set<00:04:55.710> match<00:04:56.180> but<00:04:57.180> federal<00:04:57.570> give<00:04:57.780> him<00:04:57.870> that

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
five-set match but federal give him that

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.280 
five-set match but federal give him that
slice<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.650> then<00:04:59.370> he<00:05:00.240> will<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.840> then<00:05:01.050> del

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
slice and then he will and then del

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.960 
slice and then he will and then del
potro<00:05:01.770> he's<00:05:02.310> gonna<00:05:02.430> have<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.670> put<00:05:02.820> a<00:05:02.850> little

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
potro he's gonna have to put a little

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.550 
potro he's gonna have to put a little
more<00:05:03.120> spin<00:05:03.390> on<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.660> ball<00:05:03.780> not<00:05:04.050> hit<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.380> quite

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
more spin on the ball not hit it quite

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.260 
more spin on the ball not hit it quite
as<00:05:04.680> hard<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:05.010> make<00:05:05.160> sure<00:05:05.370> he<00:05:05.880> can<00:05:06.000> get<00:05:06.120> it<00:05:06.240> up

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
as hard to make sure he can get it up

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.750 
as hard to make sure he can get it up
and<00:05:06.630> then<00:05:06.720> down<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.320> fed<00:05:08.220> will<00:05:08.430> then<00:05:08.550> run

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
and then down and fed will then run

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.020 
and then down and fed will then run
around<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.990> shot<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.680> hit<00:05:11.250> either<00:05:11.790> an

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
around that shot and hit either an

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.050 
around that shot and hit either an
inside-out<00:05:13.020> forehand<00:05:13.100> over<00:05:14.100> here<00:05:14.430> for<00:05:14.970> an

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
inside-out forehand over here for an

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.260 
inside-out forehand over here for an
insight<00:05:15.420> in<00:05:15.630> for<00:05:15.900> hand<00:05:16.110> over<00:05:16.320> there<00:05:16.530> and

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
insight in for hand over there and

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.250 
insight in for hand over there and
unlike<00:05:18.270> Rafa<00:05:18.810> Federer's<00:05:19.590> forehand<00:05:20.160> is

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
unlike Rafa Federer's forehand is

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.780 
unlike Rafa Federer's forehand is
extremely<00:05:22.260> hard<00:05:22.500> but<00:05:22.740> more<00:05:22.890> importantly<00:05:23.310> it

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
extremely hard but more importantly it

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.850 
extremely hard but more importantly it
penetrates<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.810> court<00:05:25.110> it<00:05:25.290> moves<00:05:25.710> through

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
penetrates the court it moves through

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.700 
penetrates the court it moves through
the<00:05:25.920> court<00:05:26.250> much<00:05:26.820> more<00:05:27.090> effectively<00:05:27.540> than

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
the court much more effectively than

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.980 
the court much more effectively than
Rafa's<00:05:28.710> forehand<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:30.030> del<00:05:30.390> Potro<00:05:30.750> is<00:05:30.810> going<00:05:30.930> to

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
Rafa's forehand so del Potro is going to

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.870 
Rafa's forehand so del Potro is going to
be<00:05:31.080> on<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.320> move<00:05:31.560> his<00:05:31.890> he's<00:05:32.430> not<00:05:32.580> going<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.730> be

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
be on the move his he's not going to be

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.510 
be on the move his he's not going to be
as<00:05:33.030> set<00:05:33.450> up<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:34.380> know<00:05:34.470> with<00:05:34.590> his<00:05:34.710> base<00:05:35.010> set<00:05:35.310> on

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
as set up you know with his base set on

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.120 
as set up you know with his base set on
balance<00:05:36.150> to<00:05:36.240> take<00:05:36.390> huge<00:05:36.720> cuts<00:05:37.050> at<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.830> tennis

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
balance to take huge cuts at the tennis

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.650 
balance to take huge cuts at the tennis
ball<00:05:38.310> like<00:05:38.640> he<00:05:38.790> was<00:05:38.910> able<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.180> do<00:05:39.330> against

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
ball like he was able to do against

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.800 
ball like he was able to do against
Rafa's<00:05:40.140> ground<00:05:40.800> strokes<00:05:41.160> so<00:05:41.940> this<00:05:42.210> is<00:05:42.330> the<00:05:42.480> the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
Rafa's ground strokes so this is the the

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.170 
Rafa's ground strokes so this is the the
main<00:05:43.020> exchange<00:05:43.260> I<00:05:43.620> think<00:05:43.830> we'll<00:05:43.980> see<00:05:44.220> its<00:05:44.400> kind

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
main exchange I think we'll see its kind

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.550 
main exchange I think we'll see its kind
of<00:05:45.360> Federer's<00:05:45.810> bread-and-butter<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.350> mean<00:05:46.500> he

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
of Federer's bread-and-butter I mean he

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.200 
of Federer's bread-and-butter I mean he
does<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:46.860> against<00:05:47.100> most<00:05:47.340> people<00:05:47.670> so<00:05:47.940> I

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
does this against most people so I

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.070 
does this against most people so I
expect<00:05:49.020> him<00:05:49.170> to<00:05:49.290> use<00:05:49.500> this<00:05:49.740> with<00:05:50.010> great<00:05:50.250> effect

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
expect him to use this with great effect

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.240 
expect him to use this with great effect
against<00:05:52.080> del<00:05:52.260> Potro<00:05:52.710> and<00:05:52.860> yesterday

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
against del Potro and yesterday

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.130 
against del Potro and yesterday
Federer's<00:05:53.700> forehand<00:05:54.150> was<00:05:54.360> ridiculous<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.110> mean

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
Federer's forehand was ridiculous I mean

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.320 
Federer's forehand was ridiculous I mean
as<00:05:55.350> soon<00:05:55.500> as<00:05:55.620> that<00:05:55.710> guy<00:05:55.890> got<00:05:56.100> a<00:05:56.160> look<00:05:56.430> he<00:05:57.060> was<00:05:57.210> in

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
as soon as that guy got a look he was in

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.260 
as soon as that guy got a look he was in
control<00:05:57.600> of<00:05:57.720> point<00:05:58.170> and<00:05:59.030> Djokovic<00:06:00.030> didn't

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
control of point and Djokovic didn't

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.430 
control of point and Djokovic didn't
really<00:06:00.450> stand<00:06:00.600> a<00:06:00.750> chance<00:06:00.780> and<00:06:01.110> keeping<00:06:01.350> my

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
really stand a chance and keeping my

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.590 
really stand a chance and keeping my
Djokovic<00:06:01.860> played<00:06:02.070> a<00:06:02.100> very<00:06:02.280> good<00:06:02.400> match<00:06:02.760> but

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
Djokovic played a very good match but

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.910 
Djokovic played a very good match but
towards<00:06:04.080> the<00:06:04.110> end<00:06:04.170> you<00:06:04.440> could<00:06:04.590> kind<00:06:04.800> of<00:06:04.860> tell

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
towards the end you could kind of tell

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.010 
towards the end you could kind of tell
Djokovic<00:06:05.520> was<00:06:05.700> seeing<00:06:05.880> himself<00:06:06.030> you<00:06:06.990> know

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
Djokovic was seeing himself you know

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.060 
to do to win a point off of this guy the
other<00:06:12.660> thing<00:06:12.900> federer<00:06:13.200> is<00:06:13.350> going<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.560> do<00:06:13.770> is

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
other thing federer is going to do is

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.280 
other thing federer is going to do is
stand<00:06:14.430> pretty<00:06:15.390> close<00:06:15.570> to<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.750> baseline<00:06:16.110> and

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
stand pretty close to the baseline and

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.440 
stand pretty close to the baseline and
when<00:06:16.410> he's<00:06:16.530> returning<00:06:16.860> serve<00:06:17.160> Rafa<00:06:18.090> of<00:06:18.180> course

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
when he's returning serve Rafa of course

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.000 
when he's returning serve Rafa of course
is<00:06:18.690> almost<00:06:19.170> in<00:06:19.320> the<00:06:19.410> bleachers<00:06:19.770> when<00:06:19.980> he

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
is almost in the bleachers when he

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.580 
is almost in the bleachers when he
returns<00:06:20.430> surf<00:06:20.700> well<00:06:21.450> feds<00:06:21.810> going<00:06:21.990> to<00:06:22.050> be<00:06:22.170> up<00:06:22.380> on

returns surf well feds going to be up on
the<00:06:22.770> baseline<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.460> that's<00:06:24.390> going<00:06:24.600> to<00:06:24.660> allow

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
the baseline and that's going to allow

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.870 
the baseline and that's going to allow
him<00:06:25.050> to<00:06:25.140> do<00:06:25.260> a<00:06:25.290> couple<00:06:25.650> things<00:06:25.680> first<00:06:26.550> of<00:06:26.760> all

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
him to do a couple things first of all

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.580 
him to do a couple things first of all
he'll<00:06:27.060> be<00:06:27.330> more<00:06:27.480> effective<00:06:27.930> at<00:06:28.080> cutting<00:06:28.410> off

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
he'll be more effective at cutting off

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.400 
he'll be more effective at cutting off
out<00:06:29.280> wide<00:06:29.700> and<00:06:29.730> down<00:06:30.270> the<00:06:30.420> T<00:06:30.600> serves<00:06:30.930> there

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
out wide and down the T serves there

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.740 
out wide and down the T serves there
won't<00:06:31.590> be<00:06:31.740> as<00:06:31.950> big<00:06:32.490> of<00:06:32.520> an<00:06:32.700> angle<00:06:33.060> for<00:06:33.300> delpo<00:06:33.690> to

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
won't be as big of an angle for delpo to

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.070 
won't be as big of an angle for delpo to
work<00:06:33.990> with<00:06:34.200> and<00:06:34.820> second<00:06:35.820> of<00:06:35.880> all<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.840> balls

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
work with and second of all the balls

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.740 
work with and second of all the balls
that<00:06:37.260> Rafa<00:06:38.220> excuse<00:06:38.850> me<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:39.120> Federer<00:06:39.450> does

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
that Rafa excuse me that Federer does

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.300 
that Rafa excuse me that Federer does
get<00:06:39.990> back<00:06:40.170> and<00:06:40.350> keep<00:06:40.470> in<00:06:40.560> mind<00:06:40.770> delpo<00:06:41.070> is<00:06:41.130> going

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
get back and keep in mind delpo is going

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.450 
get back and keep in mind delpo is going
to

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
to

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.890 
to
a lot<00:06:41.729> of<00:06:41.759> points<00:06:42.120> off<00:06:42.240> of<00:06:42.270> his<00:06:42.539> serve<00:06:42.720> he's

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
a lot of points off of his serve he's

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.409 
a lot of points off of his serve he's
got<00:06:43.020> a<00:06:43.050> great<00:06:43.259> serve<00:06:43.500> but<00:06:44.310> when<00:06:44.580> fed<00:06:44.850> does<00:06:45.150> make

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 
got a great serve but when fed does make

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.290 
got a great serve but when fed does make
a<00:06:45.569> return<00:06:45.960> his<00:06:46.650> positioning<00:06:47.340> is<00:06:47.490> much<00:06:48.000> better

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
a return his positioning is much better

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.710 
a return his positioning is much better
he's<00:06:48.630> not<00:06:49.250> over<00:06:50.250> here<00:06:50.280> virtually<00:06:51.000> off<00:06:51.360> camera

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
he's not over here virtually off camera

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.809 
he's not over here virtually off camera
and<00:06:52.110> then<00:06:52.229> he<00:06:52.319> has<00:06:52.380> to<00:06:52.530> recover<00:06:52.830> all<00:06:53.190> the<00:06:53.220> way

00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 
and then he has to recover all the way

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.379 
and then he has to recover all the way
over<00:06:54.539> here<00:06:54.569> he<00:06:54.810> gives<00:06:55.020> delpo<00:06:55.949> a<00:06:55.979> pretty<00:06:56.389> big

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:57.389 
over here he gives delpo a pretty big

00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.570 
over here he gives delpo a pretty big
target<00:06:57.870> to<00:06:57.960> hit<00:06:57.990> at<00:06:58.289> federer<00:06:59.069> is<00:06:59.190> going<00:06:59.310> to<00:06:59.370> be

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 
target to hit at federer is going to be

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.870 
target to hit at federer is going to be
in<00:06:59.880> a<00:07:00.330> much<00:07:00.449> more<00:07:00.509> manageable<00:07:01.639> position<00:07:02.639> and

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
in a much more manageable position and

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.270 
in a much more manageable position and
so<00:07:03.630> he's<00:07:04.110> going<00:07:04.229> to<00:07:04.289> have<00:07:04.470> more<00:07:04.680> points<00:07:05.130> when

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
so he's going to have more points when

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.219 
so he's going to have more points when
he<00:07:05.370> when<00:07:05.669> he<00:07:05.759> gets<00:07:05.789> the<00:07:06.030> returning<00:07:06.360> that<00:07:06.840> start

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
he when he gets the returning that start

Potro's year I think you will win majors
in<00:07:47.610> the<00:07:47.669> future<00:07:48.030> but<00:07:48.599> Federer<00:07:49.080> is<00:07:49.199> playing<00:07:49.470> out

of his mind right now and I think the

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.939 
of his mind right now and I think the
only<00:07:51.930> guy<00:07:52.080> that's<00:07:52.320> going<00:07:52.470> to<00:07:52.530> beat<00:07:52.710> Roger
