I've never done this before you know

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
I've never done this before you know
I've<00:01:24.600> always<00:01:24.750> lifted<00:01:25.110> weights<00:01:25.259> I've<00:01:25.560> always

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I've always lifted weights I've always

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
I've always lifted weights I've always
gone<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> gyms<00:01:26.369> or<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> had<00:01:26.790> my<00:01:26.820> own<00:01:27.030> gym<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
gone to gyms or I had my own gym and and

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.480 
gone to gyms or I had my own gym and and
I<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.560> think<00:01:28.650> there's<00:01:28.890> any<00:01:29.009> real

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I don't think there's any real

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.399

substitute<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.750> think<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
substitute for it but I think that you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.130 
substitute for it but I think that you
might<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.799> able<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.369> away<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:33.110> for<00:01:34.110> a
