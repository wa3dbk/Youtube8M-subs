two percent the other thing I scraped
over<00:01:07.190> 75<00:01:07.730> percent<00:01:07.910> I<00:01:11.080> do<00:01:12.080> hear<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.590> bit<00:01:12.800> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
over 75 percent I do hear it a bit a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.650 
over 75 percent I do hear it a bit a
slight<00:01:13.220> bit<00:01:13.460> I<00:01:15.340> do<00:01:16.340> hear<00:01:16.580> it<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.730> bit<00:01:16.880> more<00:01:17.150> it's

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
slight bit I do hear it a bit more it's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.480 
slight bit I do hear it a bit more it's
probably<00:01:18.080> wouldn't<00:01:18.320> bother<00:01:18.440> anyone<00:01:18.830> unless

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
probably wouldn't bother anyone unless

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.670 
probably wouldn't bother anyone unless
you're<00:01:19.670> really<00:01:20.030> really<00:01:20.240> close<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.750> them<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.650> I

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
you're really really close to them so I

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.550 
you're really really close to them so I
think<00:01:22.010> this<00:01:22.280> is<00:01:22.400> definitely<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.910> pass<00:01:23.210> oh<00:01:23.600> good

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
think this is definitely a pass oh good

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.450 
think this is definitely a pass oh good
job<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.890> 75<00:01:25.340> percent<00:01:25.370> as<00:01:25.790> well<00:01:30.130> Wow

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
job that 75 percent as well Wow

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.520 
job that 75 percent as well Wow
I<00:01:33.100> think<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.190> can<00:01:34.340> all<00:01:34.430> clearly<00:01:34.670> hear<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.530> so

I think you can all clearly hear that so

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.340 
I think you can all clearly hear that so
this<00:01:37.130> probably<00:01:37.580> would<00:01:37.790> bother<00:01:37.940> someone<00:01:38.540> maybe

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
this probably would bother someone maybe

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.880 
this probably would bother someone maybe
not<00:01:39.619> outdoors<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:40.640> indoors<00:01:41.090> definitely<00:01:41.960> so

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
not outdoors but indoors definitely so

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.910 
not outdoors but indoors definitely so
