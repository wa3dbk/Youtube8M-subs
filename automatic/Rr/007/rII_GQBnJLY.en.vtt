00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
guess and that is a mix it was given to

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.529 
guess and that is a mix it was given to
me<00:00:17.730> by<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.390> youtuber<00:00:19.820> to<00:00:20.820> accomplish<00:00:21.300> this

me by a youtuber to accomplish this

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.029 
me by a youtuber to accomplish this
shape<00:00:21.960> which<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> edge<00:00:23.070> or<00:00:23.609> pyramid<00:00:24.480> um<00:00:25.039> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
shape which is the edge or pyramid um a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.509 
shape which is the edge or pyramid um a
triangle<00:00:27.000> shape<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.869> nail<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.349> have<00:00:29.340> to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
triangle shape of the nail you have to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.250 
triangle shape of the nail you have to
fold<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.970> form<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:30.869> doing<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
fold the form just like I'm doing it

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.770 
fold the form just like I'm doing it
here<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.800> cut<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.460> recommend<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> cut<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
here and cut I recommend you to cut that

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.840 
here and cut I recommend you to cut that
triangle<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> middle<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.370> doesn't

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
triangle in the middle so it doesn't

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.150 
triangle in the middle so it doesn't
lose<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> shape<00:00:36.570> when<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.170> moving<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
lose the shape when you're moving on I

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
lose the shape when you're moving on I
don't<00:00:38.820> want<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> tell<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.360> how<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
don't want to tell you how to do the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.010 
don't want to tell you how to do the
things<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> way<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.309> works<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.670> me

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
things this is the way that works for me

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.049 
things this is the way that works for me
the<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.290> brother<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.800> put<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> middle

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the first brother I put it in the middle

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.500 
the first brother I put it in the middle
right<00:00:45.210> where<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> tension<00:00:46.739> goes<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.510> that's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
right where the tension goes in that's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
right where the tension goes in that's
going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.020> strength<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> nail<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
going to be the strength of the nail I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.830 
going to be the strength of the nail I
use<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.789> bit<00:00:51.030> drier<00:00:51.300> than<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> other

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
use it a little bit drier than the other

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.010 
use it a little bit drier than the other
ones<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.730> we're<00:00:53.940> building<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.449> nail<00:00:54.660> try

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
ones so now we're building the nail try

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.369 
ones so now we're building the nail try
to<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.590> course<00:00:56.629> make<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.870> shape<00:00:58.109> already

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
to of course make the shape already

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.369 
to of course make the shape already
since<00:00:59.129> you're<00:00:59.309> building<00:00:59.870> sculpt<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> shape

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
since you're building sculpt the shape

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.210 
since you're building sculpt the shape
very<00:01:02.190> well<00:01:02.550> pad<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.719> sides<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.830> form

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
very well pad in the sides so you form

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940 
very well pad in the sides so you form
that<00:01:05.430> triangle<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.020> splash<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.590> colors

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that triangle for the splash of colors

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
that triangle for the splash of colors
I'm<00:01:08.159> using<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.610> weather<00:01:08.939> acrylic<00:01:09.510> then<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.840> will

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I'm using a weather acrylic then I will

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.350 
I'm using a weather acrylic then I will
normally<00:01:10.619> use<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> way<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.060> blend

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
normally use so that way they blend

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.960 
normally use so that way they blend
together<00:01:12.570> easy<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.920> they're<00:01:14.189> some

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
together easy you can see they're some

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
together easy you can see they're some
of<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.119> other<00:01:15.420> nails<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.960> missing<00:01:16.380> color<00:01:16.680> and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
of my other nails are missing color and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.420 
of my other nails are missing color and
that's<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.090> mistake<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.630> made<00:01:18.900> because<00:01:19.110> it's

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
that's a mistake I made because it's

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.789 
that's a mistake I made because it's
three<00:01:20.430> layers<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.119> built<00:01:21.659> first<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.439> shape

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
three layers I built first the shape

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.330 
three layers I built first the shape
with<00:01:23.460> clear<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.540> came<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.680> stain

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
with clear and then I came in just stain

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.670 
with clear and then I came in just stain
a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:27.090> white<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.810> then<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a little white and then with the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.160 
a little white and then with the
glitters<00:01:29.100> when<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> came<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> file<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> other

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
glitters when I came and file the other

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.640 
glitters when I came and file the other
nails<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:32.040> course<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> colors<00:01:33.000> came<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
nails of course the colors came up so I

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
nails of course the colors came up so I
had<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.490> correct<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.299> after<00:01:36.659> i

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
had to go back and correct that after i

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.190 
had to go back and correct that after i
finish<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.710> now<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.049> I'm

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.590 
finish this now now this now that I'm
doing<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.979> now<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.280> tongue<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.880> did

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
doing for you right now my tongue I did

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.389 
doing for you right now my tongue I did
it<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> correct<00:01:43.170> way<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.890> not<00:01:44.220> as

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it the correct way and it was not as

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
it the correct way and it was not as
thick<00:01:44.610> as<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> other<00:01:45.030> ones<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:46.200> why<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
thick as the other ones but that's why I

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.170 
thick as the other ones but that's why I
advise<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.729> way<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
advise you to do it that way so you

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
advise you to do it that way so you
don't<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.659> make<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.259> mistake<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
don't have to make the mistake that I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830 
don't have to make the mistake that I
didn't<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.700> back<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.210> waste<00:01:51.570> more

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
didn't have to go back and waste more

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.020 
didn't have to go back and waste more
time<00:01:51.920> then<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.950> encapsulate<00:01:54.049> very<00:01:55.049> thin<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
time then you encapsulate very thin and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
time then you encapsulate very thin and

shape
and<00:02:00.100> that's<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:01.030> I<00:02:01.270> mean<00:02:01.690> it's<00:02:01.840> not<00:02:01.960> one<00:02:02.200> of<00:02:02.230> my

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
and that's it I mean it's not one of my

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.220 
and that's it I mean it's not one of my
favorite<00:02:02.890> sets<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:03.580> i<00:02:03.760> said<00:02:04.090> i<00:02:04.420> didn't

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
favorite sets like i said i didn't

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.500 
favorite sets like i said i didn't
realize<00:02:05.290> them<00:02:06.010> by<00:02:06.340> doing<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.090> splash

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
realize them by doing the splash

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.410 
realize them by doing the splash
technique<00:02:08.320> on<00:02:08.619> them<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.190> was<00:02:09.670> gonna<00:02:09.880> lose<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
technique on them I was gonna lose the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.450 
technique on them I was gonna lose the
symmetry<00:02:10.960> of<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.230> nail<00:02:11.440> it<00:02:11.800> was<00:02:11.980> very<00:02:12.220> dumb

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
symmetry of the nail it was very dumb

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.500 
symmetry of the nail it was very dumb
from<00:02:12.790> me<00:02:12.970> i<00:02:13.120> recommend<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:16.000> if<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.300> do

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
from me i recommend you that if you do

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.260 
from me i recommend you that if you do
it<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.440> round<00:02:17.770> nail<00:02:18.070> or<00:02:18.460> maybe<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
it do it in a round nail or maybe a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.910 
it do it in a round nail or maybe a
square<00:02:19.660> nail<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.110> will<00:02:20.260> look<00:02:20.440> better<00:02:20.650> than

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
square nail it will look better than

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.490 
square nail it will look better than
this<00:02:21.160> then<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:22.210> don't<00:02:22.330> waste<00:02:22.600> all<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.230> work

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050
