00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.900
 in the end where we will test 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.490
 by process 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.409
 and graphic features 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.139
 After all, if Kiev 3 m remind you that you are here 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:13.999
 used dual core 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.440
 CPU 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.009
 with a clock frequency of 1 and 2 gigahertz 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.890
 I saw a card from 10 districts 220 Kiev itself 

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:25.390
 qualcomm processor n 8 6 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.060
 sixty don't mean chipset 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.449
 so we will begin 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.489
 please multitouch test new result 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.129
 immediately see this four touch for 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.129
 so that there are no questions here 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.910
 I will show you 4 touch 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.530
 the fifth does not work 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.130
 Further 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.110
 t on a foreign car, he, too, was previously launched 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.840
 the result is ready 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.289
 it's 20 5 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.719
 frames per second just in case you 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.579
 I will say that 30 frames give Galaxy and Turks 11 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.550
 up to 2 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 here are pirate bay 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750
 farther 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.050
 on injections 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.220
 I will not run the loot he showed 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.980
 60 frames just do not want to spend time 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.740
 show sixty frames 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.320
 give me a sec 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.450
 normal result anton tom 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.350
 there is also a result we just 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.480
 look 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.500
 how much 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010
 4388 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.520
 o protein stewart gaining 4 thousand 900 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 about 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.580
 that is, villa stewart a little faster 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.360
 square standard let's see 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.640
 to specifications that is from its we will try 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 and we find out why 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.000
 the program could not recognize the processor 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 neither its purity is minimal 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.560
 maximum if I realized that 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.750
 dual core 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.850
 so 800 megabytes 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.040
 540 resolution for 960 UAH and 220 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.260
 here he showed why there is one on 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.940
 one percent but foreign cars 2 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.110
 texture 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.640
 about 4 megabytes 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.799
 further on it various ore sensors at the end 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:10.679
 rotation sensor 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.039
 orientation gyro in general and so on 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.439
 light sensor proximity sensor 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.709
 we run quadrants 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.920
 interesting to see the result I 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.779
 I assume that he will leave from 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.979
 it should be but at least that people are 3200 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.979
 two and a half 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.339
 weak 4 to 15 frames per second 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.659
 here more bright 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.680
 doctors food and on the street to 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.089
 so about 40 percent of schools at 30 40 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.539
 top 60 from but it falls out what should be 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.419
 quite good from pure 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
 at the expense of now that's probably you 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.669
 here is amazing Nikitinke 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.019
 30 approximately 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.260
 but what to give, I assume that two with 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.479
 half maximum 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.539
 smoked yes 

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:14.579
 we waited in vain 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.389
 we have the internet is not connected 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.359
 was and therefore it was impossible 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.359
 view 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.279
 so kosovo frame about 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.639
 it is bad that here of course 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.729
 no 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.819
 samsung window but 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.059
 m but also to help so it is called 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.689
 there is no light air gap 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:06.909
 here it is 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.639
 and the air gap exists but what we 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.469
 look and photo ap 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.339
 and 1850 call it quite active 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:17.779
 I will certainly not price 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:20.349
 States that 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.270
 this is very bad 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.620
 and that phone is slow but in 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.270
 as the result is not very 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.330
 I am impressed at least 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.430
 gallacher 3000 dials travel delayed until 1 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.680
 3000 well, probably will bring in numbers unfortunately 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.250
 we have to quote 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.169
 information 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.189
 so the following 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.680
 what else is white there are 3 st 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.199
 we him 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.199
 run 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.849
 naturally 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.849
 hockey and recession 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.159
 I went testing accordingly and how 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.610
 only it will end and then I will continue 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.610
 video recording 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.620
 so we already have the result of this 777 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.889
 points 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.120
 We look about the characteristics 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.900
 steel 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.000
 so what goes on at least understandable 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.460
 sco case it 3d 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.490
 tire breakage sensation 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.759
 so we go further designers asad 34 DJs 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.400
 etc 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.389
 but in general it is impressive 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.770
 result 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.050
 u on this think all thanks to all 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.370
 kabakam
