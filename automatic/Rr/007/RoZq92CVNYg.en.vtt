00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
feed right on so evil of course the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.770 
feed right on so evil of course the
wooly<00:03:46.549> bugger<00:03:46.819> King<00:03:47.150> here<00:03:47.329> you<00:03:47.420> went<00:03:47.599> back<00:03:47.720> to

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
wooly bugger King here you went back to

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.500 
wooly bugger King here you went back to
the<00:03:47.959> bugger<00:03:48.170> yeah<00:03:48.530> but<00:03:49.489> why<00:03:50.120> would<00:03:50.299> you<00:03:50.389> do

the bugger yeah but why would you do
that<00:03:50.540> well<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.379> figured<00:03:51.889> that<00:03:52.099> purple<00:03:52.819> bugger

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
that well I figured that purple bugger

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.240 
that well I figured that purple bugger
with<00:03:53.209> little<00:03:53.510> flash<00:03:53.720> abou<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.379> we<00:03:54.590> had<00:03:54.799> we

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
with little flash abou in it we had we

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.189 
with little flash abou in it we had we
were<00:03:55.459> well<00:03:56.209> we<00:03:56.329> didn't<00:03:56.540> have<00:03:56.660> anything<00:03:56.870> that

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
were well we didn't have anything that

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.960 
were well we didn't have anything that
we<00:03:57.620> tried<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:57.980> chrono<00:03:58.220> meds<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:58.699> didn't<00:03:58.879> have

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
we tried the chrono meds and didn't have

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.509 
we tried the chrono meds and didn't have
any<00:03:59.120> action<00:03:59.510> there<00:03:59.720> so<00:04:00.160> seems<00:04:01.160> like<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.430> only

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
any action there so seems like the only

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.490 
any action there so seems like the only
logical<00:04:01.790> thing<00:04:02.209> was<00:04:02.389> to<00:04:02.510> go<00:04:02.629> deeper<00:04:03.079> try

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
logical thing was to go deeper try

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.170 
logical thing was to go deeper try
something<00:04:03.919> large<00:04:04.160> there's<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.609> many<00:04:04.760> shrimp

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
something large there's so many shrimp

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210 
something large there's so many shrimp
and<00:04:05.419> things<00:04:05.629> we've<00:04:05.840> seen<00:04:06.049> in<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.440> lake<00:04:06.799> that

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
and things we've seen in the lake that

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.890 
and things we've seen in the lake that
they<00:04:07.669> have<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:07.909> much<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.239> feed<00:04:08.419> on<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:08.750> might

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
they have so much to feed on you might

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.270 
they have so much to feed on you might
as<00:04:08.989> well<00:04:09.109> try<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.319> feed<00:04:09.530> him<00:04:09.560> something<00:04:09.889> large

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
as well try to feed him something large

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.479 
as well try to feed him something large
maybe<00:04:11.239> that'll<00:04:11.690> stand<00:04:11.959> out<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:12.620> Tyson<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:13.310> I

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
maybe that'll stand out and Tyson and I

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.979 
maybe that'll stand out and Tyson and I
just<00:04:13.849> change<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.419> and<00:04:14.540> what<00:04:14.659> I've<00:04:14.780> had<00:04:14.930> to

just change to it and what I've had to

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.649 
just change to it and what I've had to
fish<00:04:15.409> on<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.949> yeah<00:04:16.729> less<00:04:17.060> than<00:04:17.209> five<00:04:17.419> minutes

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:17.659 
fish on and yeah less than five minutes

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.539 
fish on and yeah less than five minutes
self<00:04:18.019> seems<00:04:18.530> like<00:04:18.739> whoa<00:04:18.919> we'll<00:04:19.190> give<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.370> a

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
self seems like whoa we'll give that a

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.120 
self seems like whoa we'll give that a
try<00:04:19.639> for<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:20.060> while<00:04:20.239> longer

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.320 

today<00:04:28.130> on<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.430> cast<00:04:28.670> we're<00:04:29.000> going<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.180> learn

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
today on the cast we're going to learn

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.200 
today on the cast we're going to learn
how<00:04:29.390> to<00:04:29.570> mend<00:04:29.900> line<00:04:30.260> at<00:04:30.620> long<00:04:30.980> distance<00:04:31.550> this

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
how to mend line at long distance this

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.880 
how to mend line at long distance this
is<00:04:32.330> one<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.660> more<00:04:32.810> difficult<00:04:33.020> things<00:04:33.440> to

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
is one of the more difficult things to

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.060 
is one of the more difficult things to
do<00:04:34.040> in<00:04:34.250> fly<00:04:34.520> casting<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.500> not<00:04:36.500> only<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.920> it

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
do in fly casting and not only is it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.320 
do in fly casting and not only is it
just<00:04:37.280> because<00:04:37.310> you're<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.730> little<00:04:37.910> throwing<00:04:38.240> a

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
just because you're a little throwing a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.210 
just because you're a little throwing a
lot<00:04:38.510> more<00:04:38.690> line<00:04:38.990> but<00:04:39.320> also<00:04:39.500> learning<00:04:39.920> how<00:04:40.160> to

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
lot more line but also learning how to

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.450 
lot more line but also learning how to
throw<00:04:40.910> a<00:04:40.940> line<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.480> control<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.740> fly<00:04:43.010> at<00:04:43.280> that

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
throw a line and control the fly at that

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.550 
throw a line and control the fly at that
distance<00:04:43.700> is<00:04:44.030> difficult<00:04:44.540> here's<00:04:45.050> one<00:04:45.290> of<00:04:45.410> my

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
distance is difficult here's one of my

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.010 
distance is difficult here's one of my
favorite<00:04:45.980> techniques<00:04:46.400> for<00:04:46.550> doing<00:04:46.730> that

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
favorite techniques for doing that

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
favorite techniques for doing that
casting<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.080> little<00:04:48.410> bit<00:04:48.530> quartering

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
casting a little bit quartering

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.240 
casting a little bit quartering
