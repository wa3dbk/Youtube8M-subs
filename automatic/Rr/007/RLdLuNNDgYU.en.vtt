 efe 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.400
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 a new video and good is a game in 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 hot spot multi team in look that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.020
 I do not usually go up many games like this 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.400
 the new maps lately as well as 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.990
 the new 16 are about to come out 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.990
 I think it's good 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:43.110
 As you can see, it's a bit slow because 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.680
 At the beginning, as you can see, I took the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.839
 orbital and immediately taking and leaving 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.030
 they entered and retaking well 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.830
 taking it out pretty early and in the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.589
 moment of single dogs and the swarm 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.500
 they explained the game three or 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.850
 four do not know exactly what they were 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.489
 but nothing for you to see also that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.739
 they will also serve the games and that 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.780
 took the caixa is true in the sights of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.720
 red dot the look be and the cannon 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.390
 long lately I've been testing like this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.210
 when normal with my account and that has 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 molated pretty with the unsheathed he 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.440
 the laser sight and the long barrel these 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.450
 three accessories for sidewalks and quick 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.440
 scope with the shotgun the truth that cool 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 quite and nothing can come out when you pull out like this 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.200
 he looks at her before, because he does not get enough 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.869
 game and that here as you see I already had 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.690
 what is the dogs and the swarm and 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.580
 was released and taught you will see that it 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 inspires two or three and well I have cut 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.370
 what is the streak while killing him 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.920
 the dogs and the swarm can be 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.010
 cut to make it so if it's at 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.630
 long because maybe he was about 20 or 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.530
 30 seconds passing it to fast camera and 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.360
 It was not a plan either because it made me dizzy 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.550
 quite be there all the time there on camera 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.160
 fast and if it was not more than a minute to what 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.220
 better while finding someone and 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.340
 while they killed the gusts and nothing 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.700
 put also a chain of casualties already 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.580
 I saw that we would also be happy to see a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.640
 low chain with sg lacquer and good 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.560
 pretty fucked up to get this because 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.050
 to the minimum shot that we failed with the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.320
 caixa g well you know what you stay there 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.880
 because in him face to face and while loading 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.560
 and that is quite complicated but good 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.400
 when carrying so much ammunition the shotgun 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.020
 this is how good it is that there are times 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.850
 than to draw a chain of casualties from 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.610
 you can get it out even without 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.130
 load the weapon 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.400
 and do not die enough to get out like that 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.260
 make me low and super low of these 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.560
 56 lately is that to get the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.380
 nuclear with this weapon also cost me 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.410
 quite because lately it's that 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.240
 tried to get more mega-low points and 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.510
 things of these ultra low and all this 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.450
 that nuclear, I do not know how to do it 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.880
 step better there making losses of these 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.950
 multiple hot I do not know if it will happen to you 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.770
 you also suppose that yes that you 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.590
 like to go more to sack and not go so little to 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.770
 little copying one by one or two 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.020
 in two with the shotgun mostly with 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.600
 with your rifles and that you can go more to 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.940
 sack but with shotguns of these the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.340
 true that it is quite complicated and 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.430
 well I was already 20 streak and as you see 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.140
 but the gusts is that you had to 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.090
 have saved me and not throw so many 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.160
 spurts the best so if there 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.100
 taken the nuclear a little faster 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.870
 but good as you see here I got him 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.000
 I had given to that one who had hit me 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.410
 market and he gave me a jump that half me 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.300
 It gives bad because 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.490
 I could have quite the streak 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.620
 but nothing yet we were playing 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.620
 against two alone that when they threw 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.450
 but hey, he's a nuclear and he wanted to go up 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.310
 which also ye shall see that I 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.670
 they throw lots of lots over 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.350
 of which you imagine the other day 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.050
 also what happened to me was that I was wearing 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.380
 streak of 50 and 80 a game of those that 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.390
 everything goes to you and there at the moment 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.070
 finished the first round they caught and I 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.410
 They pulled cable and I do not know what happened 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.170
 that did not stay I do not know if it is that 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.630
 was recording or something and ya and that and 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.460
 I lost the game they were not in the 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.460
 Capture was not in movie mode 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.200
 neither and the truth that I wanted to upload it 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.760
 because I was almost nuclear 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.940
 there were two or three in the first round 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.430
 an incredible and good game has 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.160
 disappeared I do not know I do not know what happened 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.980
 cinema mode every two times I lost 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.290
 the games less bad that I do not record them 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.960
 of the cinema mode normally if a strip 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.330
 a head as cool to give him 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.909
 in the head with this shotgun from 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.090
 at least 20 or 30 meters you can 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.770
 load perfectly and nothing has 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.599
 liked quite the time goal of this 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.870
 I wish it would have lasted a little longer because 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:04.259
 I do not know if it has been done quite short and 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.080
 that we will try then to try with the 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.629
 specials and that because with the rpg I 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.670
 you have commented a few also 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:16.090
 but the rpg only leads now takes 2 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.620
 two shots of those and I do not know I think with 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.830
 the scavenger can not go picking 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.550
 then it would be pretty pretty fucked up 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.830
 to play so a little goal with the rpg 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.660
 above also the crossbow I've been 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.180
 trying the well a bit with the account 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.850
 with this account that I have it because I have 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.850
 about 40 casualties think it's a thing 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.680
 came to me right there the nuclear as you see and 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.650
 is that the crossbow because I think that either 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.270
 you can pick up ammunition I do not know if someone 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.760
 He has taken it out and that is why he tells me 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.400
 more or less because I have no idea 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.440
 how are these things going and the ballistic 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.210
 I would also like to know if you can go 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.480
 picking up with the scavenger you can go 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.360
 picking up also the 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.390
 the buds of those and nothing here I leave you 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.640
 with the chain of losses is that the 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.190
 I really liked it here, it fails 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.100
 a couple of shots or three but good if 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.560
 it comes out to me perfect it would have been 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.570
 too much here he asks for all the rest neither 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.100
 well he ran out of ammunition he already had 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.650
 three more here in front and good me 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.860
 is caught behind a bitch because I 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.290
 I would have made the chain of 12 least and 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.530
 Nothing I hope you liked and until 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.530
 the next
