00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.020
 To come back 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.269
 that does not have those who are at peace 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.189
 So the total exports 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.059
 the human being has 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.789
 For nature 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:15.909
 the right 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.279
 to defend itself also from an unjustified attack of an attack by a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.410
 criminal no law in disarming criminals the laws 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.350
 disarmed only honest citizens who care about them bs 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.100
 involved in a criminal case for possession of weapons 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.670
 there are almost always two ways to see a proposal 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 he says we had because some think that firearms do not bring him 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.690
 be in the hands of the citizenry or insurance point is raised that the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.270
 pistols does not solve the insecurity but rather sharpens especially if 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.600
 He wants to carry a weapon, he does not know how to use it. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.350
 he presented his instruments as toys 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.760
 if they were not given their fair dimension 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.160
 that is, they were not considered dangerous 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 it is also spoken that between more weapons more homicides 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.080
 let's see now the other side of the coin 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.179
 other words 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.430
 we will hear arguments 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.940
 citizens can and should be armed 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 if they wish 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 The first argument is that the state does not guarantee safety 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.380
 television which is all very easy 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.420
 the superhero appears in the city and he has all the villains 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.870
 Spiderman does not exist 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.810
 but if the cops 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.050
 in an ideal scenario every criminal should be captured by the police and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.989
 tried by the courts 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.019
 unfortunately, this does not always happen 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.370
 partly because the same state recognizes that it does not have the resources to 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.759
 do what 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.189
 the version of the authorities before an alert call may last several 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.879
 minutes and it's about my adventure cities 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.039
 but if the rural area happens 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.449
 everything could take an eternity 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.799
 the rest of the country the great basilia section of the country 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.139
 the field that was not densely populated the time on television is 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.669
 zero does not exist 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.229
 no possible that this is a site to a farm 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.399
 that a road is given 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:47.719
 and then you totally depend on your ability in the field and in the 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:52.169
 small towns and on the national roads of your ability and your 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.799
 family defend 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.799
 at least they win 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.129
 the citizen has the right to defend himself and nothing 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.769
 attending the business arrived yet 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.319
 some individuals 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.859
 when I got ready he endorsed the merchandise they just took out the 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.149
 weapon looked 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:13.379
 do not move 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.799
 bm 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.049
 I jumped back I covered a wall 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.179
 unburden or weapon 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:23.979
 i by the way the ice a shot 

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.499
 towards those who were inside the business 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.499
 immediately the outsider who was pointing me 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.219
 I shot you no 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.249
 although the day this man acted in self-defense before an assault 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.019
 this is not the first case and it is safe 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.559
 It will not be the last 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.839
 my family never liked him 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.010
 that I went with weapons that I had weapons obviously my father 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.269
 it said and the account of mama transit and they are going to kill you 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.779
 them after the incident obviously percent 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:56.359
 already without forming a little more 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.469
 and it rained 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.560
 they asked me today that obviously we are training x the boe all the 

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:04.769
 weeks to practice 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.489
 and even my brother has already received weapons courses he already has his weapon 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.179
 my mother inclusive 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:16.090
 three days ago the fourth procedure and saw a gun the night table 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.459
 and he said 'when 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.309
 I was taking it to the polygon strip 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.039
 the political constitution 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.520
 in its article 21 establishes that human life is inviolable 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.259
 from this constitutional premise where I mean for myself the right to 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.840
 the legitimate defense to protect not only in my life but to life 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.940
 devotees people no law disarmed the criminals the laws 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.850
 disarmed only honest citizens who care about them bs 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.600
 involved in a criminal case for possession of weapons 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.339
 the third argument of those who are against the total destruction of weapons 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.050
 is that these are not the culprits of insecurity 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:02.400
 the security of everything 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.199
 Market operators 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.749
 plus first 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.990
 the pharmacy but we aim for the camera javier ponce 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.289
 In this polygon located in Pavas, many people come to practice day and night and 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.870
 cooperation with armed band 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.590
 the users are the most varied security officer of the shipments 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:21.889
 What is your name 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.889
 Kenyan Saints 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:28.889
 how many years did he have 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.470
 Some future dad Camacho has weapons for home 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.110
 percent 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.599
 l 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.370
 d wanted accepted that learns more and in case of emergency 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.319
 in kansas monarch and added coz 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.210
 there are people who believe that weapons are bad 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.210
 but in reality bad weapons are the ones in the wrong hands 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:53.059
 who do not know how it works and safety measures 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.039
 the lack of training of those who have weapons 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:02.279
 equally depositor of the hot water a mother that a kitchen with brandy 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:07.819
 and leaves the pit unsupervised a child who comes overturns the pot burns 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.289
 it does not come from good luck 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.289
 we have to teach people to be careful 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:18.059
 the opponents to the total destruction consider that the measure rather 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:21.430
 could generate slight increase in the black market 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.270
 we will go 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.190
 let's say to an underground defense people are going to keep weapons you're going 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.039
 ponce 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.680
 and above all we are going to have a black market like the one we had 20 years ago 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.439
 years that we remember it clearly go to costa rica for illegal guns by 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:40.960
 every side and that is the worst possible scenario during these days we put that 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.520
 theme on the seven day facebook page 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.490
 which we also find divided positions 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.279
 for example that poses

 josÃ© ruiz villalobos 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:53.989
 if the carrying of arms to citizens is prohibited, it would be the same since 

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:56.599
 the thugs would export in the same way 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.610
 Zabel Mujica wrote that guns should be banned 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:06.810
 civilian population after all instead of safety klaus and kinski care and 

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:11.099
 it is a ford said the weapons charge the devil says the famous and ancient saying 

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:16.669
 laura castillo thinks it considered that the problem is that if the weapons of 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.409
 fire are legal or not 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:23.149
 prohibiting them the change would be little noticeable ie the drugs are illegal 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.389
 we are and any place 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.119
 to finish what happens in many countries 

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:32.119
 our experiences are quite different 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:36.010
 South Korea one of the safest countries in the world 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.999
 the carrying of arms in the population is prohibited 

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:42.769
 mexico for its part the most restrictive country in america on the subject of 

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:44.139
 weapon possession 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:46.249
 it is both 1 

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:47.559
 the most insecure in the world
