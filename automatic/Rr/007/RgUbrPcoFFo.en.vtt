00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.799
 hello in touch fruit and today I 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.599
 I'll tell you about the mechanism and I told 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.350
 last episodes just about two 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.930
 mechanism well and on so many principle about 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.390
 nothing to tell them but I will repeat 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.849
 some were mechanism it was 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.449
 iron stove and simple mechanism 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.840
 but in principle a simple mechanism serves 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.739
 only as a block for crafting 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 there is also used as a block and by the way 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.350
 it will be used actively today 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.399
 almost not even almost all 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.770
 of these here and so devices and the second 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 the mechanism it was a regular iron stove 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.460
 we will use it only 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.559
 in one craft 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.039
 and as you guessed it will be 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.350
 used in the map here this stove and 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.439
 I will immediately tell the name of these 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 mechanisms it we have a crusher it we 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.400
 extractor is a compressor and it is ordinary 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 electric stove yes there is another kind 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.780
 another kind of stove well I will not tell in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.509
 next series 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.950
 Again , I transfer everything to the next series 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.100
 and so how does our craft split here 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.770
 in such a way, in principle, I am 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.560
 decided on the subject site 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.350
 so much more convenient and why is it us 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.329
 serves first tell the slots but in 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 principle here everything is clear here energy 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.970
 saved even though in my project on 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.670
 this project is nothing here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.390
 put that is redstone will not be here 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.640
 work but usually it serves here if 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.270
 Of course the assembly is not there what he is there 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 large developer no official 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.450
 industrial 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.119
 or some kind of al-baki called level 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.280
 new okay sorry the author who is not 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.190
 Russian okay okay something I'm on 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.920
 why do we serve you mined ore 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.530
 it is ore that is here we are not in the morning 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.849
 that is, the Lazurite family, they will 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.270
 it is crushed here if you crush iron ore 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:25.380
 it all works the way the sound goes too 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:27.480
 vodka energy is spent a little bit and there is 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.400
 such cheating is in the crusher but 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.650
 This is not the author's cheating. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.180
 probably conceived because here 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.780
 really iron is very necessary and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.680
 and so our two iron originated 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.590
 fingers and their fee can be free 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.390
 you get two iron bars but so 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.600
 can do again repeat with 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.390
 any and ores, even from and for a period of crafting 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.660
 except those that were mined by silk 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.709
 by touch or some other way 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.590
 there is a diamond ore of the red stone kind and 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.239
 other following is our extractors 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.370
 crafting it with us like this 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.650
 in a way 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.150
 if someone does not remember how Kravtsa tap 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.420
 Well I showed the rest the same time 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.630
 Kalka kraftitsya for a stranger, he serves us 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.820
 also serve as such an object 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.910
 get russian if you got latex 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.959
 the tree is not the essence of it in the stove because 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.959
 it will turn out like this 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.489
 1 tires and now your 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:45.220
 drag this rubber into the extractor 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:48.440
 before the process goes a little longer but day 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.390
 wait but then I have the next series 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:58.599
 when mother and tell only when 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:04:03.040
 process you once again 5 10 and and 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:05.659
 3 rubber here is such a way too 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.690
 useful because risen is very necessary here 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.260
 the next thing is a faucet compressor he 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.560
 we are compensated if I am not mistaken 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:17.989
 water capsule in snowballs can 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.910
 can compress as you see 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.750
 noticed in my inventory specifically 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.190
 prepared 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.550
 such a recipe is we get if 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.550
 not mistaken 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.180
 composite up composite can 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.669
 compress and get a plate of 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.889
 composite here immediately leaves two things 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.349
 I also compress for a long time right 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:50.449
 can't wait to take one thing so that 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:51.919
 increase with pine I can not because 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.610
 I will have to tell you how it is 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:59.240
 crafting and basically by the way crafting 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:04.120
 they really need such a cheap one 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.770
 It turns out how to say compensated 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.199
 compensated composite back in 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.010
 the extractor can also be put a capsule with 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.280
 water will turn on charged water 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:22.160
 it looks like we take ordinary water 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.620
 and we are waiting for her to actually let 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.820
 our to recycle i will tell in 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.700
 electric stoves 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.120
 it just works much faster 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.600
 stone stove but basically explain 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.200
 nothing and immediately tell you if you notice 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.139
 Here's the place of the field that this is 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.530
 places for things that speed up 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.900
 okay i will say the name is a module and they 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.500
 just speeds up the process at almost all 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.950
 objects 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:56.380
 More precisely the laptop of all these and it turns out 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.380
 charged water and its possible again 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:06.169
 shove the structor and get if I don't 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:08.450
 am wrong this water is called fret 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:11.720
 if I'm not mistaken, this is ours 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:16.490
 it turns out so distilled water 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:18.110
 it seems like yes though but in principle it serves 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.290
 I will not tell for what because 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.470
 we have not reached such an object as 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.169
 selection 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:29.120
 it will be peace through the series so 15-10 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.960
 basically rule telling mechanism 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.000
 nothing except to connect them well 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.539
 can again through the wires and through 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.080
 any side and they need to 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:42.500
 succumbed 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.300
 32 volts and if someone did not look at 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.600
 look at the last series there 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.030
 digger digs and if i like it 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.360
 would take it buries if right 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.820
 directly connect hands and lymph in the same place 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.210
 in the last series it is told how 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.280
 still connect well, in principle, all 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.640
 himself beat for fruit subscribe to my 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.470
 channel and yes and dns server if i don't 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.500
 mistaken closes us open 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:13.070
 new project if someone knows about the belt 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.200
 mint is like so to speak but spare 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.200
 for me the project is because it is a bit 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.700
 jambs and we have a new project 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.000
 I will not open it until it 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.300
 tell anything but principle all by myself 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.820
 bill name is bye ah yes forgot to say 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.610
 some to me 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.340
 They say that I have too boring 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.680
 video up to now is boring but 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.470
 when simona 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:42.260
 will prepare and I will prepare the assembly we are waiting 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:45.720
 version 147 or g15 is meant 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.570
 Version setting crafting we establish 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.370
 immediately multiplayer build and then I 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.490
 I think it will be much more fun 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:56.240
 so tuturial and of course there will be 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:00.680
 such are boring here but I think they are useful 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.680
 In principle, all all bye
