ground hey about this to go for three my

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.930 
ground hey about this to go for three my
suspicion<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.710> will

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
suspicion is that it will

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660

therefore for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.510 
therefore for
that's<00:02:27.120> probably<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.569> right

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520
