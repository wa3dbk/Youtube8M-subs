00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach is the league 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.060
 So again a victory and make exciting 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.019
 they are except for a point to the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.790
 bayern hans nothing easier than that or 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.840
 you use it purely arithmetic total 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.840
 right you have a high school diploma 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.890
 who shoot at us now 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.520
 sixties notabitur and thus also 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.520
 made in hesse 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.699
 if you holstein it has it in today 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 a sunday paper 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.910
 an interview with the stupid color 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.780
 but I did not give anything 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.160
 a newspaper written 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.129
 I think that's good, but I thought that was right 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.780
 well and he said of course he feels 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.040
 not 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.040
 logically, as a follower of bayern 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.149
 even if that's purely formal through this 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.870
 be unbeaten and that 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.170
 table place 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.780
 one or the other can read purely but 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.300
 he is proud that once the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.850
 performance of his team and of 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.710
 mosques gladbach in the first time to 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.509
 such discussions leads to the confession 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.740
 yes only once with the top of it now 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.520
 currently in third place behind 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 hopeheim and it is beautiful too 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.479
 know that we are in one of the strongest 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.720
 time against the current for me 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.090
 world's best team from this position 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.009
 being undefeated can play it 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.050
 is wonderful for every single one 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.460
 it is for germany is it 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.049
 nice to say hey at least for this 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.619
 sunday we have for real tension 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.619
 provided 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.720
 then we will see if the normal 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.450
 the normal is that bavaria 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.460
 munich can assert itself with us 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.530
 and if that's what football is all about 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.780
 it is possible that these are these 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.490
 research 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.719
 the fact is that I'm completely typing 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.409
 Rarely but then I myself today 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.860
 establish 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.189
 Assume that you do not have to 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.810
 many gates see frankfurt from 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.509
 first peter farmer time pretty much 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.000
 sour on just as history happened 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.890
 is also one with luc's bachelor 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.329
 Striker has been used so he 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.320
 maybe not accepted with 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.329
 he is not in advance so 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.859
 the whole thing has the courage to work 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.120
 then have such a purchase again 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.380
 to correct and say so now 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.510
 I sit down with the coach intensively 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.070
 together and find new purchases 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.210
 I think so 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.800
 someone got me around max got me around 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.690
 someone as these these valuable 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.610
 players had to be delivered and 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.060
 he was above all 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.350
 fast 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.580
 he was faster with these now 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.580
 players you just addressed 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.990
 that speaks for his wonderful work 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.910
 also looking forward to really looking 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.590
 what can gladbach afford where have 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.330
 we have problems where we still need players 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.800
 and he did well if he did 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.520
 as early as the player has contracted 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.740
 and convince everyone can entertain well 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.020
 what max in the last four years 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.090
 skillfully in this function but also has 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.450
 what he knew before in three and a half 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.760
 years of construction of our ours 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.810
 school our our boarding 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.930
 International football over every sofa 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 to have
