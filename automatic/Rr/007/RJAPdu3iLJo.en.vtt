right here and control things like fan

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
right here and control things like fan
speeds<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> stuff<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.290> out<00:02:07.530> already<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
speeds and stuff it's out already I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.460 
speeds and stuff it's out already I
think<00:02:08.399> for<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.670> men<00:02:08.849> right<00:02:09.239> now<00:02:09.269> mobile<00:02:09.959> we're

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
think for the men right now mobile we're

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.860 
think for the men right now mobile we're
still<00:02:10.679> refining<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.550> bit

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
still refining it a little bit

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.930 
still refining it a little bit
but<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.409> should<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.830> should<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:13.129> ready<00:02:13.400> maybe

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
but it should it should be ready maybe

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.880 
but it should it should be ready maybe
in<00:02:14.120> about<00:02:14.239> a<00:02:14.420> month<00:02:14.780> or<00:02:15.019> so<00:02:15.319> maybe<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.830> little

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
in about a month or so maybe a little

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.820 
in about a month or so maybe a little
bit<00:02:16.190> longer<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:17.090> uh<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.470> want<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> make

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
bit longer but uh we just want to make

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.350 
bit longer but uh we just want to make
sure<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.069> works<00:02:19.220> great<00:02:19.459> before<00:02:19.790> we<00:02:19.909> release<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
sure it works great before we release it

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.809 
sure it works great before we release it
so<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.870> right<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.590> actually<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.340> bit

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
so this right here is is actually a bit

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.089 
so this right here is is actually a bit
of<00:02:22.849> an<00:02:23.060> alpha<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.019> this<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.709> actually<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
of an alpha so this is actually the

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.830 
of an alpha so this is actually the
crack<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.790> crack<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.150> mobile<00:02:26.450> app<00:02:26.599> right

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
crack and the crack and mobile app right

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.930 
crack and the crack and mobile app right
now<00:02:26.959> which<00:02:27.170> you'll<00:02:27.769> see<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.069> can<00:02:28.280> change<00:02:28.790> your

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
now which you'll see you can change your

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.319 
now which you'll see you can change your
fan<00:02:29.180> speeds<00:02:29.569> change<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.409> led<00:02:30.799> profile<00:02:31.430> change

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
fan speeds change the led profile change

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.360 
fan speeds change the led profile change
the<00:02:32.450> LED<00:02:32.750> color<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.709> all<00:02:33.980> through

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
the LED color and this is all through

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.420 
the LED color and this is all through
your<00:02:34.519> phone<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:35.030> gonna<00:02:35.239> good<00:02:35.620> via<00:02:36.620> connected

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
your phone it's gonna good via connected

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.539 
your phone it's gonna good via connected
to<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.640> Internet<00:02:38.000> okay<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.129> even<00:02:40.459> if

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549

you're<00:02:40.670> not<00:02:40.879> at<00:02:41.750> home<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.379> still<00:02:42.829> can<00:02:42.980> change

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
you're not at home you still can change

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.729 
you're not at home you still can change
it<00:02:43.370> yeah<00:02:43.519> exactly<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.150> even<00:02:44.629> say<00:02:45.170> I'm<00:02:45.410> out<00:02:45.560> at

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
it yeah exactly so even say I'm out at

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.420 
it yeah exactly so even say I'm out at
work<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.609> my<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.599> one<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:48.260> all<00:02:48.650> earlier<00:02:48.950> easy

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
work and my this one is all earlier easy

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.180 
work and my this one is all earlier easy
yeah<00:02:49.730> my<00:02:50.120> CPU<00:02:50.629> starts<00:02:50.959> overheating<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:52.069> get

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
yeah my CPU starts overheating I can get

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.339 
yeah my CPU starts overheating I can get
a<00:02:52.220> notification<00:02:52.489> on<00:02:52.970> my<00:02:53.000> phone<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.930> can

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
a notification on my phone and I can

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.589 
a notification on my phone and I can
like<00:02:54.500> see<00:02:54.859> the<00:02:55.010> fan<00:02:55.220> speeds<00:02:55.519> like<00:02:55.670> oh<00:02:56.239> one

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
like see the fan speeds like oh one

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.509 
like see the fan speeds like oh one
of<00:02:56.690> my<00:02:56.780> fans<00:02:57.049> broke<00:02:57.379> so<00:02:57.680> maybe<00:02:58.040> I'll<00:02:58.190> run<00:02:58.370> home

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
of my fans broke so maybe I'll run home

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.699 
of my fans broke so maybe I'll run home
and<00:02:58.730> fix<00:02:58.879> it<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.209> things<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.569> so<00:02:59.989> I

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
and fix it and things like that so I

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.259 
and fix it and things like that so I
mean<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.190> yeah<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.700> crack<00:03:01.970> and<00:03:02.180> so

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
mean this yeah so this is crack and so

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.910 
mean this yeah so this is crack and so
let<00:03:02.390> me<00:03:02.420> tell<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.870> about<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.170> new<00:03:03.290> packets<00:03:03.739> as

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
let me tell you about the new packets as

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.690 
let me tell you about the new packets as
well<00:03:04.810> so<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:06.620> kraken<00:03:06.950> x41

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
well so this is the the kraken x41

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.920 
well so this is the the kraken x41
and<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.120> kraken<00:03:08.450> x61<00:03:09.549> these<00:03:10.549> pretty<00:03:10.849> much<00:03:10.940> we

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and the kraken x61 these pretty much we

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.750 
and the kraken x61 these pretty much we
pretty<00:03:12.680> much<00:03:12.829> changed<00:03:13.129> everything<00:03:13.459> from<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
pretty much changed everything from the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.970 
pretty much changed everything from the
ground<00:03:13.940> up<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.659> it's<00:03:15.170> using<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.620> new

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
ground up so this is it's using a new

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.879 
ground up so this is it's using a new
generation<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:17.239> cooler<00:03:17.810> so<00:03:18.079> this<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.380> a<00:03:18.590> new

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
generation of a cooler so this is a new

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.449 
generation of a cooler so this is a new
a<00:03:19.069> new<00:03:19.099> technology<00:03:19.849> for<00:03:20.120> for<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.870> pump<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:22.250> it

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
a new technology for for the pump and it

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.940 
a new technology for for the pump and it
said<00:03:22.700> this<00:03:22.819> is<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> first<00:03:23.450> liquid<00:03:24.349> cooler<00:03:24.709> on

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
said this is the first liquid cooler on

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.250 
said this is the first liquid cooler on
the<00:03:25.099> market<00:03:25.489> close<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.060> cooler<00:03:26.540> that<00:03:26.810> allowed

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
the market close the cooler that allowed

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.280 
the market close the cooler that allowed
the<00:03:27.470> has<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.730> variable<00:03:28.730> speed<00:03:29.150> pumps<00:03:29.540> so<00:03:30.109> what

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
the has a variable speed pumps so what

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.229 
the has a variable speed pumps so what
that<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.590> is<00:03:30.620> it<00:03:31.040> means<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.549> pump<00:03:31.819> inside

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
that is is it means that the pump inside

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.089 
that is is it means that the pump inside
of<00:03:32.359> here<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:33.049> changes<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.739> pump<00:03:33.980> speed

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
of here it changes the pump speed

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.030 
of here it changes the pump speed
automatically<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.810> way<00:03:36.049> your<00:03:36.349> it's

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
automatically that way your it's

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.670 
automatically that way your it's
produces<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.609> lot<00:03:37.849> less<00:03:38.060> noise<00:03:38.560> compared<00:03:39.560> to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
produces a lot less noise compared to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.759 
produces a lot less noise compared to
traditional<00:03:39.829> liquid<00:03:40.760> cooling<00:03:41.030> systems<00:03:41.480> and

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
traditional liquid cooling systems and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.339 
traditional liquid cooling systems and
so<00:03:42.769> we<00:03:42.889> have<00:03:43.099> a<00:03:43.760> new<00:03:44.150> fan<00:03:44.449> manufacturers<00:03:45.109> so

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
so we have a new fan manufacturers so

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.319 
so we have a new fan manufacturers so
these<00:03:45.470> fans<00:03:45.769> are<00:03:45.949> much<00:03:46.310> more<00:03:46.699> efficient<00:03:47.180> than

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
these fans are much more efficient than

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.240 
these fans are much more efficient than
our<00:03:47.419> older<00:03:47.720> fans<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.410> they<00:03:48.560> also<00:03:48.709> run<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> lot

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
our older fans and they also run a lot

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.939 
our older fans and they also run a lot
quieter<00:03:49.519> as<00:03:49.910> well<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:51.079> overall<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:51.769> have<00:03:51.889> a

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:51.949 
quieter as well so overall you have a

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.759 
quieter as well so overall you have a
much<00:03:52.190> quieter<00:03:52.720> cracking<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.930> with<00:03:54.650> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
much quieter cracking and with the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.920 
much quieter cracking and with the
smaller<00:03:55.099> one<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.459> 140<00:03:56.030> this<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.389> the<00:03:56.540> crack

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
smaller one the 140 this is the crack

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.159 
smaller one the 140 this is the crack
and<00:03:57.079> x41<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:58.340> actually<00:03:58.669> has<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.970> 24%<00:03:59.900> thicker

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
and x41 it actually has the 24% thicker

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.610 
and x41 it actually has the 24% thicker
radiator<00:04:00.739> yeah<00:04:01.280> that's<00:04:01.639> like<00:04:01.879> yeah

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
radiator yeah that's like yeah

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.050 
radiator yeah that's like yeah
performance<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:03.799> this<00:04:03.919> is<00:04:04.129> much<00:04:04.579> better<00:04:04.819> than

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
performance on this is much better than

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.610 
performance on this is much better than
the<00:04:05.120> original<00:04:05.239> kraken<00:04:06.049> x-14<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.840> yeah<00:04:09.379> so

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
the original kraken x-14 and and yeah so

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.920 
the original kraken x-14 and and yeah so
so<00:04:09.889> these<00:04:10.220> these<00:04:10.970> two<00:04:11.150> coolers<00:04:11.569> are<00:04:11.720> going<00:04:11.870> to

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
so these these two coolers are going to

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.629 
so these these two coolers are going to
be<00:04:12.049> completely<00:04:12.440> controlled<00:04:12.949> through<00:04:13.099> camera

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
be completely controlled through camera

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.000 
be completely controlled through camera
as<00:04:13.699> well<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.329> you<00:04:15.049> got<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:15.260> sneak<00:04:15.530> peak<00:04:15.829> up<00:04:15.980> there

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
as well so you got a sneak peak up there

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.400 
as well so you got a sneak peak up there
at<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.459> mobile<00:04:16.789> app<00:04:17.030> you're<00:04:17.239> on<00:04:17.389> this<00:04:18.079> will<00:04:18.289> be

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
at the mobile app you're on this will be

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.770 
at the mobile app you're on this will be
here's<00:04:18.590> is<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.160> a<00:04:19.190> desktop<00:04:19.760> app<00:04:19.969> it's<00:04:20.570> about

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
here's is the a desktop app it's about

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.839 
here's is the a desktop app it's about
about<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.229> same<00:04:21.409> idea<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.919> can<00:04:22.159> you<00:04:22.460> can<00:04:22.640> see

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
about the same idea you can you can see

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.640 
about the same idea you can you can see
the<00:04:23.000> liquid<00:04:23.180> temperatures<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
the liquid temperatures the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.219 
the liquid temperatures the
your<00:04:25.009> cpu<00:04:25.430> temperatures<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.330> fan<00:04:26.540> speeds<00:04:26.900> and

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
your cpu temperatures the fan speeds and

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.310 
your cpu temperatures the fan speeds and
you'll<00:04:28.160> actually<00:04:28.340> see<00:04:28.699> right<00:04:29.300> here<00:04:29.660> we<00:04:30.290> have

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
you'll actually see right here we have

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.920 
you'll actually see right here we have
two<00:04:30.949> pockets<00:04:31.460> installed<00:04:31.880> one<00:04:32.150> on<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.449> CPU<00:04:32.900> and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
two pockets installed one on the CPU and

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.189 
two pockets installed one on the CPU and
one<00:04:33.350> on<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.590> GPU<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:35.210> bracket<00:04:35.600> yeah<00:04:35.840> so

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
one on the GPU and the bracket yeah so

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.260 
one on the GPU and the bracket yeah so
so<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:37.009> cool<00:04:37.190> thing<00:04:37.220> is<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.699> the<00:04:37.850> software

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
so the cool thing is in the software

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.909 
so the cool thing is in the software
right<00:04:38.389> now<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:38.630> can<00:04:38.900> actually<00:04:39.350> control<00:04:39.680> both

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
right now you can actually control both

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.029 
right now you can actually control both
Krakens<00:04:40.520> right<00:04:41.270> here<00:04:41.509> um<00:04:41.720> right<00:04:42.650> we're<00:04:42.860> still

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
Krakens right here um right we're still

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.580 
Krakens right here um right we're still
we're<00:04:43.310> still<00:04:43.340> fine<00:04:43.820> tweaking<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.389> UI<00:04:44.570> so<00:04:44.990> in

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
we're still fine tweaking the UI so in

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.200 
we're still fine tweaking the UI so in
the<00:04:45.770> future<00:04:46.100> you'll<00:04:46.310> be<00:04:46.400> able<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.639> label<00:04:47.000> this

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
the future you'll be able to label this

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.350 
the future you'll be able to label this
you<00:04:47.840> can<00:04:48.020> say<00:04:48.169> this<00:04:48.380> is<00:04:48.440> my<00:04:48.949> GPS<00:04:49.430> my<00:04:49.699> GPU<00:04:50.060> and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
you can say this is my GPS my GPU and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.050 
you can say this is my GPS my GPU and
other<00:04:50.630> for<00:04:50.960> your<00:04:51.080> piece<00:04:51.350> yeah<00:04:51.590> yes<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.580> and

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
other for your piece yeah yes so and

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.520 
other for your piece yeah yes so and
then<00:04:53.210> you<00:04:53.300> can<00:04:53.330> control<00:04:53.780> either<00:04:53.990> and<00:04:54.320> things

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
then you can control either and things

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.620 
then you can control either and things
like<00:04:54.650> that<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.160> you'll<00:04:55.940> be<00:04:55.970> able<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.300> do<00:04:56.509> the

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
like that and you'll be able to do the

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.979 
like that and you'll be able to do the
same<00:04:56.810> to<00:04:56.990> your<00:04:57.110> mobile<00:04:57.440> phone<00:04:57.620> as<00:04:57.800> well
