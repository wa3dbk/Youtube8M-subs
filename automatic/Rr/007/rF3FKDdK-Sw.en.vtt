00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.970
 Speak, everybody, it's okay, I'm errant. 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.890
 Five god designer I'm here today 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.750
 to present our first video 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.969
 drawing class that you would be putting 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.840
 every week on our 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.409
 Facebook 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.409
 let's start 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.000
 we'll start designing 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.619
 six-headed character 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.930
 most of my students at the beginning 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:38.970
 think six heads is a character 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:40.410
 alien that has six heads in one 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.820
 Human Body 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.190
 indeed the head count is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 essential for building a character 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.489
 as well 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 to build the character we 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.799
 we need to make a vertical line one 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.930
 line and we will tell you here in 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:03.239
 head of the character let's make an oval 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.060
 to the head of the character having the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.240
 head of the character here we are going to use 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.799
 her with reference to make 600 more 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 one is the head 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:24.240
 come on 1 12 356 so we created it here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.070
 six heads let's put the number 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 zinho not in losing by 56 to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.630
 From here we already have six heads 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 We are going to build the body of the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.520
 character we can notice that the 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.800
 build character body 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.550
 we can see that he is a boy 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.500
 young man by having only six heads when 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.490
 We 'll draw a character who already 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 is an adult 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.960
 we use eight heads that the character 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.560
 because the character was already with the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.300
 whole body thus forming as it is a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.470
 adolescence that my character is a 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.170
 teenager 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.170
 he has six heads 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:11.020
 this here is just an effort for you 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.060
 understand how we count 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.010
 anatomy of the character with we accept 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.770
 in the character's anatomy of course 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:27.230
 is spirit without explanation in detail 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:28.989
 but then the character of six 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.760
 heads are mounted 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.280
 this expression of six heads one 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.739
 character of six heads a character 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.110
 of eight heads and this is the basis that we 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.380
 we need to start our drawing 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.380
 of characters 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.700
 how to tell there is a very technical 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.140
 simple for you to hit the size of the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.060
 your character 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.820
 then this is a simple technique but 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.980
 few people know so I will create 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.290
 a character now with eight heads that 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.870
 it's a being an adult man 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.590
 So I'll start by creating the head of the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:22.530
 character on the line and here I will tell 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:22.530
 the heads since a head 2008 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:31.630
 What happens here? Let's create the 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.060
 body of the character and we will prepare 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.340
 here when you arrive in the middle of 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.190
 the eight head count ends 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.500
 the part of the guy's groin who is where 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.560
 is all part of the hip 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.500
 what happens here from here the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.540
 that the character he has of tron he has 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.120
 skin from the head to the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.190
 we have four heads here and the 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.870
 skin what four heads 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.239
 so what are we going to do here? 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.200
 Let's pull his leg from the head. 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.880
 number 4 the head number 8 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.239
 if we have four heads July it 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.739
 is in the middle in the middle of head number 6 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.930
 and the foot down here 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.570
 at the end with his head number 8 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.989
 so here we know that the character 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.380
 he is told the right way because the 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.330
 eight-headed character have trunk 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.220
 half of these eight heads and legs 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.680
 half of our head 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.870
 if you are going to create a character without 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.720
 make no sketch that you do one 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.780
 character drawing with his body 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.690
 even the crotch can draw the arms 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.240
 That's also what you do there 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.310
 calculate here the head until the life he 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.950
 play but I think you think where's the 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.680
 stone and here 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.570
 it's just you pull the leg of the citizen then 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.390
 Remember what he has to trade with him. 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.280
 has skin and so is easy for you 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.090
 determine the size of your character 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.090
 that's it 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:07.649
 our size that this exercise I 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:09.599
 I have already created the characters here that are the 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:12.209
 characters we have seen that 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.209
 8-head character and 16 heads 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.849
 only we have not made a child yet 

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:20.279
 we need to understand some steps 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.300
 here to start building the 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.489
 characters 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:28.349
 Let's start with the eight-headed man 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:31.110
 it is very important to know that the shadow of 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.789
 character has to have a head of 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.369
 width also why I drew 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.949
 heads here then the character of eight 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:40.529
 when he is already an adult. 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.169
 he needs to have a head away 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:45.869
 to draw a character shoulder 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.269
 already the six-headed boy he has 

00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:50.369
 half of the head to each side that 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:53.279
 determines the size of his egg because 

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:55.050
 because he is younger than already a child 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:56.969
 When are you going to draw her? 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.699
 Let's make a three-headed child 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:03.389
 but let's count it here in the head 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:05.729
 of the healthy child and the head of the 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:09.869
 child will give the size of her shoulder 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:13.019
 for them is small what happens 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:15.599
 the drawing of the child here it will have a 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:16.469
 certain differential of these two other 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:19.110
 on here 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:22.679
 here we were counting the half 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:26.339
 to the trunk and half to the penalty to 

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:29.369
 child she will get a little more 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:31.379
 body and a little less leg 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:33.050
 because the child she is still in 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:36.959
 development 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.860
 so what counts in this child is the 

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.860
 part of the belly 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:51.620
 and it will stay this way then this 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.690
 child does not have three heads 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.430
 she gained a little more body 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.160
 meaning that the penalty is going to be 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.919
 a little smaller not much and the shoulder 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.320
 her is the size of your head 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:06.680
 and remember that the more it goes 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.919
 getting older the longer it gets 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.410
 and this is a calculation for the 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.490
 people make character sizes 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.770
 many different 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.350
 well done we got to the end of our a 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.880
 First class, I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.130
 In the second class we will learn to 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.050
 build the human body with shapes 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.780
 geometric so do not miss 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.419
 if you liked short video short ours 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.800
 page on facebook and gave your comment 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:32.800
 Thank you so much until the next
