00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.080
 we are in shibuya it is night and 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.700
 Well I'm sure you have already seen 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.980
 these images distributed in others 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.510
 videos but the truth I do not get tired of 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.490
 see shibuya 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.850
 I have come several times and always 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.230
 I come good is how the 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.750
 the first time the feeling of amazement did not 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.599
 to see so many people and so many lights and 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.220
 screens are carried this in this video 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.329
 normal I want to talk a little 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.989
 about when I wanted to come to japan 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.519
 in another video and I had already said that 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.649
 before I came to Japan I used to see 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.159
 videos on youtube from other people who 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.640
 they live here in Japanese they traveled to 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.699
 Japan 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.189
 I liked my knowing about their lives 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.949
 and experiences what they felt 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.989
 to live here in japan and I remember that 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.119
 I wanted to see more videos of them 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.429
 I was looking for other people who lived here 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.909
 or live here in japan it was very difficult 

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:09.340
 find someone who is 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.210
 against their experiences especially in 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.579
 Spanish so when I got here 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.829
 that was not as long ago as some 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.189
 six months I said good I also want 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:24.130
 make videos and I want to show people 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.619
 things from japan and for that reason I do 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.240
 informative videos about japan and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.460
 I try to talk a little about my 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.979
 experiences too 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.979
 when I was a child it was when I started 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.960
 interested in japan and I remember that I 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.510
 put to see Japanese cartoons and it was 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.659
 there where the little seed was planted 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.340
 interest in Japan and I could see 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.830
 mazinger z that was a caricature 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.580
 multipolar at that time does not 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.610
 see candy and with my brothers and sisters 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.200
 the transformers the supercampeons the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.530
 gentlemen of the zodiac also that was 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.260
 very popular 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.140
 and little by little I was more interested in what 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.909
 that is Japan and it was not until later that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.069
 was that was about 20 years that I 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.920
 I'm more interested in japan. 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.540
 listen to music by Japanese artists in 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.090
 that then there is one more daughter here was 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.980
 very popular deputy adjusted jÃ­caro 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.489
 also and good for me the motivations 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.330
 that what motivated me to come to japan 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.150
 it was the Japanese culture the story to the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.730
 architecture 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.290
 for me japan was like a very country 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.829
 enigmatic that I wanted to know more gays 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.730
 jazz samurai and all that for me was very 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.519
 interesting and what motivated not to 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.409
 someday I want to come to Japanese and I 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.920
 I know many people who see that 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:51.500
 watch my videos or know many 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.060
 few people that from my videos and that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.569
 are watching this have their own 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.299
 reasons or that motivate them to come to this 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.510
 country do not either anime the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.159
 video games technology music any 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.129
 reason that you have to come is 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.049
 good so when I am I know that 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.450
 when you come to japan 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.019
 they will realize how beautiful 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.569
 this country is going to be in love and 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.430
 fascinated of this country I think that 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.040
 we live in a time where we have 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.690
 lucky to have internet japan is a 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.030
 country that opened to the world does not do much 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.250
 after the second world war 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.200
 good before the internet the only way 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.740
 of knowing about japan was through 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.390
 of books or documentary magazines and 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.390
 now with the good internet we have 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.450
 access to more things we can not know more 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.720
 about Japan by means of your ac 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.190
 so that's why I say that we live in 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.700
 a time when we are lucky 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.800
 have internet and learn more about 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.470
 and finally for those who are 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.610
 planning to come to japan in future I would 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.950
 I would recommend that you start studying 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.500
 Japanese obvious but also very 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.230
 important English is always knowing 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.030
 English makes things easier here in Japan 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.150
 not all people not all Japanese 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.590
 they speak English in Japan but if they do 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.599
 the fight 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.950
 and if you speak good English that way 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.370
 you can communicate with people from 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.500
 other countries that live 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.990
 well that's all for today thank you very much 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.169
 for listening to me and watching the video up 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.169
 then
