00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.900
 ordinary shadow and welcome to one more 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 video 10 and game place today I will show you the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.180
 minecraft play a game to me the chart 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.010
 It'll be another big old move . 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.340
 Today I will show you the basic items of the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.830
 start you need to do the first 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.769
 thing you need to do is the creche table 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.360
 How do you do this will weigh wood 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.910
 So let's find the wood where the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 obviously called stocking of trees 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.469
 so you're going to have a tree and put it in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.120
 punch in the trunk is faster to do with 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.410
 an ax but then I'll explain 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.760
 How does it work? 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.090
 You must first make the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:03.000
 kraft table only get here in the tree and 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:06.780
 stay down with the left button to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.159
 you do and then with this wood without 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.460
 make the wood of the deceased only put 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.830
 here and get ready that kraft and you 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.740
 will fill the whole space with this 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.270
 wood on the kraft table put the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.680
 boot here to show you how you go 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 do the other items well to make 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.930
 to make xique the xique 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:33.180
 He had there and here to do and did 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.509
 only the left button to take is 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.979
 made 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.400
 Now to do, just need to do more. 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.670
 to protect yourself not only put a stick 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.479
 underneath and two in wood will make the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 sword if put one more up here 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.079
 to make a plate there knows how to position 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.790
 this way makes ax 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.130
 Now I'm going to show consoles the pickaxe 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 In this way you will pick the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:09.690
 wood and apa that is only put on top and 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.780
 if you are the first ones you will need 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.959
 to make one more one 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.780
 a more reinforced stone sword one 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.880
 better pick just put tony cubes 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.130
 in place of wood 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.480
 then it will be better to do the items 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.630
 the better as I said you'll need 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.150
 of cobal stone what ended sony is this 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.220
 stone here then arrive with your 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:37.190
 pick and left button destroy 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 and get it for you 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.110
 This is what you will need. 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.110
 one other thing that only needs to be 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.860
 that will be a bit useful is to make a 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.650
 bed 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.010
 How are you going to make a bed to bed? 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.920
 Are you going to need alan wool? 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.620
 sheep obviously this will need 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.780
 three lan and three ways of deceased I 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.420
 I'm going home to show you one. 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.670
 thing you do not get lost that is good is 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.440
 reference workshop big for me 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.170
 to find me easier but if you 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.600
 it's too far and it will not work 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.690
 It's just to prove you're getting close. 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.970
 You do not know very well that it is a point. 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.890
 reference you find and to 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.239
 Night, you 're going to need a bed then. 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.030

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:08.889
 how to pick them up and I'll show you 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.320
 throughout the game you will start to have 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.400
 many items and most of them do not 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.710
 almost anything 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.770
 no hurry you will not use much in 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.930
 start you 're good to keep them then 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.620
 Are you going to make a chest like you're going to do? 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.479
 chest 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:29.250
 is the same layout of the furnace only 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:33.490
 Wood you will surround everything and will do 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.200
 or the chest 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.920
 As the game goes on, you just need 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.170
 protection is to do what is an armor 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.680
 There you pick up the leather that will fall when 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:47.200
 if you kill the cow do not just get caught 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:52.530
 here so you do the boots 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:58.410
 so if you do the helmet so you do 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:07:01.030
 op to your shirt and so do you pants 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.550
 to have a little a little more clarity 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.510
 in your house will make glasses as is 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.270

 I only came here in your furnace to put 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:15.270
 sand and wood or charcoal what you 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:21.790
 You want to use it to burn. 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:23.470
 doing this you will have the glass with the 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:30.820
 The game is good too if you do 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:34.210
 a plantation of wheat carrot potato 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.580
 this is all a thing that is good that they 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:40.930
 can do to later see if it will not 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:42.340
 starve so easily you do 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.280
 similar bet had gone the cup of the 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.280
