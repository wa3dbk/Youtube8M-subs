00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.220
 Hello everyone, Steve Gudovich and you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 Today we invite you to familiarize yourself with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.739
 Jimmy fashion mod and parallel 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.029
 decorate this beautiful home 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.340
 my jimmy hardware includes myself 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.310
 just a huge number of new items and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 blocks that will be useful to us in 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.470
 decorating the interior of our buildings and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.850
 buildings and let's see what's new 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.040
 we will appear after installation 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.840
 modifications and try to decorate with you 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.570
 the room which is in the back 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.070
 plan let's get started so we have here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.650
 such a kitchen let's try 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.380
 make it more interesting and for that 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.590
 try to use items from the mod 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.660
 jamie accessories remove all of our 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 past blocks and try to put 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.979
 something new like this 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.750
 wonderful stove 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.899
 washing machine or rather it 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 dishwasher so here we are 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.600
 set 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 sink and that's such a kitchen cupboard 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.710
 cutting board 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.749
 I hope we just put the usual cabinet 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.109
 all items in the fashion are interactive 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.670
 allow you to interact with them 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:34.310
 for example using a stove we 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.310
 we can cook two at once 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.940
 two items for example we will take 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.729
 raw beef and pork try 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.530
 cook them in a new stove and how 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.770
 see the process immediately went was worth only 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.750
 us add coal and at the same time we 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:58.110
 now we can melt the ores and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 for example cooking something interesting also 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.840
 there is a very interesting blog in fashion 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.209
 which is called trashcan 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.390
 using the trash bin we can 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.160
 delete 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 items from the game that is, we do not 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.050
 it is not necessary to do now 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.110
 various lava and annihilator we can 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.239
 just put us unnecessary items in 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.820
 trash can and after five minutes they 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.430
 so itâ€™s not worth removing automatically 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.150
 think that you can put in the trash 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.459
 diamonds 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.640
 the fact that it is just a storage unit 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.709
 other other things he actually 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.900
 will automatically delete everything in 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.209
 it is exactly five minutes 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.870
 after we put in there 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.030
 any blocks so now let's 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.160
 let's try to beat this one 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.040
 we have space for it 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.190
 there are such wonderful sofas 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.880
 which we will use in one 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.670
 corner 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:02.069
 These and all to Aunt Lena 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:07.920
 so also we will take the lamps 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.750
 board and coffee table and so 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.260
 let's try 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.260
 decorate our kitchen 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.400
 here we will install angular 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.379
 sofas 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.099
 not here does not remain the first time but 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:29.030
 gradually you can get used 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.129
 so ended so here we put 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.060
 coffee tables on which we place 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.560
 our table lamps 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.299
 most as I said items 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.060
 they can interactive with them 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.890
 to interact and for example the lamp can 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.189
 enable and disable right click 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.319
 With the mouse, we can turn it off completely 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:51.530
 lighting or using it to turn on or 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.470
 turn on the element so here I created 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:58.940
 small bathroom here such here 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:00.579
 lamps we hung bathroom can 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.810
 to sit 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.350
 so it will be about our looks 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:10.000
 so here 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.070
 and and we wrap we can take water when 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.620
 help buckets in a bucket of water 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.959
 will automatically appear in inventory on 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.190
 the toilet can also sit and go 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.140
 the characteristic sound of draining water here with us 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.130
 have a washing machine that allows 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.950
 us restore armor and if you have 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.610
 there will be armor which was 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:36.640
 battered as a result of fighting or falling 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.520
 we can place it in the data of four 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.930
 slots add coal here and through 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.780
 certain period of time we 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.140
 pick up and washing machine completely 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.030
 whole armor 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.880
 Also in the fashion there are a number of items 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.360
 which should pay attention to this here 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.920
 such a wonderful TV 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.670
 which is the right mouse click 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.890
 starts making sound and radio time 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.840
 which is similar to tv 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:07.060
 as well as a particularly interesting blog this 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.100
 a clock that can 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.170
 use as a storage chest 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.990
 certain items our these sleuths 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:19.150
 either as a full watch which 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:22.650
 show us the time of day and can also 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.570
 play it on the right mouse click 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:29.440
 it will all work in solitary 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:31.450
 game mode rather in single when 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.590
 using standard game mode i 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.540
 now I am in a creative failing 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.360
 The result can be said that the mod is quite 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.500
 interesting find for all lovers 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.290
 to design their own interiors 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.090
 buildings and with this mod you 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.610
 can add even more to the game 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.240
 diversity with you was steve gudovich 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.240
 bye bye
