00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
use so you can see here this is a very

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
use so you can see here this is a very
heavily<00:00:29.609> sealed<00:00:30.000> case<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> I'll<00:00:30.810> show<00:00:31.019> you

heavily sealed case and I'll show you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170 
heavily sealed case and I'll show you
some<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> moment<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
some more that in a moment but what it

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
some more that in a moment but what it
does<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.719> protect<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.260> iPad<00:00:34.739> from<00:00:34.980> getting

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
does is protect your iPad from getting

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.580 
does is protect your iPad from getting
water<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.450> or<00:00:36.540> anything<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.440> we

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
water on it or anything like that so we

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.290 
water on it or anything like that so we
could<00:00:37.739> toss<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> into<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.309> pool<00:00:38.579> theoretically

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
could toss it into a pool theoretically

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240 
could toss it into a pool theoretically
and<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> worry<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:41.129> I've

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
and not have to worry about it now I've

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.130 
and not have to worry about it now I've
had<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> iPad<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.390> my<00:00:42.510> son<00:00:42.750> uses

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
had this on the iPad that my son uses

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
had this on the iPad that my son uses
for<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> couple<00:00:43.680> weeks<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:45.210> recently

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
for a couple weeks and just recently

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.110 
for a couple weeks and just recently
took<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> off<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.460> worked<00:00:47.700> pretty<00:00:47.820> good

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
took it off and it's worked pretty good

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.729

dirty let me show you this is pretty
heavy<00:00:53.370> duty<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
heavy duty and what you do here is you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.110 
heavy duty and what you do here is you
need<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> water<00:00:56.070> test<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> half<00:00:57.000> an

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
here in a moment but you can see this is

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
here in a moment but you can see this is
pretty<00:01:10.409> deep<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> let<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
pretty deep and let you get into that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.140 
pretty deep and let you get into that
access<00:01:12.960> point<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:14.220> order<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.490> remove<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
access point and in order to remove the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.030 
access point and in order to remove the
back<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:16.049> kind<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
back you actually kind of have to it's a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.320 
back you actually kind of have to it's a
little<00:01:17.250> bit<00:01:17.340> different<00:01:17.700> than<00:01:17.850> anything<00:01:18.060> I've

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
little bit different than anything I've

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.420 
little bit different than anything I've
seen<00:01:18.479> before<00:01:19.040> just<00:01:20.040> pull<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:21.240> ring<00:01:21.600> off

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
seen before just pull this this ring off

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.460 
seen before just pull this this ring off
like<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.700> once<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.630> ring<00:01:24.960> off<00:01:25.140> what

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
like so once you have this ring off what

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
like so once you have this ring off what
we<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> take<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> set<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> aside<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
we can do is take that set it aside and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.249 
we can do is take that set it aside and
then<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.180> seals<00:01:30.180> around<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.900> entire<00:01:31.200> thing

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
then this seals around the entire thing

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
then this seals around the entire thing
here<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> pretty<00:01:33.030> heavy-duty

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
here so this is a pretty heavy-duty

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.679 
here so this is a pretty heavy-duty
ceiling<00:01:34.140> case<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:36.030> secures<00:01:36.509> your

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
ceiling case and really secures your

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.590 
ceiling case and really secures your
iPad<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.220> front<00:01:38.670> piece<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
iPad so this is the front piece and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.030 
iPad so this is the front piece and
you've<00:01:39.750> got<00:01:39.900> your<00:01:40.079> touch<00:01:40.320> screen<00:01:40.530> or<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you've got your touch screen or your

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
you've got your touch screen or your
cover<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> touch<00:01:41.759> screen<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.329> then

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
cover for the touch screen and then

got<00:02:07.860> these<00:02:08.009> four<00:02:08.310> posts<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.819> i'm<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.000> sure

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
got these four posts and i'm not sure

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.820 
got these four posts and i'm not sure
why<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.479> did<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.349> when<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> drop

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
why they did this because when you drop

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.610 
why they did this because when you drop
it<00:02:11.009> i'm<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.160> sure

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
it i'm not sure

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.259 
it i'm not sure
it<00:02:11.680> would<00:02:11.799> help<00:02:12.159> the<00:02:12.340> back<00:02:12.519> any<00:02:12.819> but<00:02:12.970> basically

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
it would help the back any but basically

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.809 
it would help the back any but basically
this<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:13.930> where<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> back<00:02:14.500> rest<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.430> iPad

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
this is where the back rest of the iPad

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.640 
this is where the back rest of the iPad
and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:16.090> you've<00:02:16.930> got<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.170> handle<00:02:17.560> or

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and then you've got this handle or

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.559 
and then you've got this handle or
whatever<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.220> use<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.730> well<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
whatever you can use as well so if I

iPad to place it in here there we go
it's<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.629> place<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:29.110> there<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.500> what

it's on so place it in there and what

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.680 
it's on so place it in there and what
you've<00:02:30.220> got<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:30.819> you<00:02:31.000> have<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.329> align

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
you've got here if you have to align

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.470 
you've got here if you have to align
this<00:02:31.930> up<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:33.159> that<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.670> kind<00:02:33.849> of<00:02:33.970> hard<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.209> see

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
this up so that it's kind of hard to see

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.059 
this up so that it's kind of hard to see
in<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.720> camera<00:02:35.049> angle<00:02:35.170> here<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.829> have<00:02:35.950> to

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
in the camera angle here you have to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.729 
in the camera angle here you have to
align<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.549> so<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.790> switch<00:02:37.739> actually

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
align it up so the switch actually

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.850 
align it up so the switch actually
pushes<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.989> vibrates<00:02:40.989> or<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.409> silent<00:02:41.799> switch

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
pushes the vibrates or the silent switch

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.380 
pushes the vibrates or the silent switch
up<00:02:42.099> and<00:02:42.220> down<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.700> see<00:02:42.730> right<00:02:42.909> there<00:02:43.239> with

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
up and down you can see right there with

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.150 
up and down you can see right there with
that<00:02:43.420> action<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.530> do<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:44.859> say<00:02:44.950> that

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
that action and I do have to say that

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.580 
that action and I do have to say that
that<00:02:45.940> part<00:02:46.299> right<00:02:46.420> there<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.870> little<00:02:47.349> bit

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that part right there is a little bit

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.410 
that part right there is a little bit
harder<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.950> do<00:02:48.250> than<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.549> even<00:02:48.579> expected<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:49.329> to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
harder to do than I even expected it to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.599 
harder to do than I even expected it to
be<00:02:49.450> but<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.840> does<00:02:50.019> work<00:02:50.129> so<00:02:51.129> let's<00:02:51.310> go<00:02:51.579> ahead

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
be but it does work so let's go ahead

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.170 
be but it does work so let's go ahead
and<00:02:51.849> place<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.690> in<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.849> see<00:02:55.000> there's

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and place this in you can see there's

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.080 
and place this in you can see there's
all<00:02:55.239> sorts<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.569> fingerprints<00:02:56.109> on<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.260> there<00:02:57.090> so

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
all sorts of fingerprints on it there so

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.440 
all sorts of fingerprints on it there so
it<00:02:58.209> has<00:02:58.359> been<00:02:58.540> used<00:02:58.780> quite<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.079> bit<00:03:00.090> put<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.269> on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
it has been used quite a bit put this on

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.140 
it has been used quite a bit put this on
or<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.019> work<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.409> around<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.769> bottom<00:03:03.150> make

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
or just work it around the bottom make

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.500 
or just work it around the bottom make
sure<00:03:04.180> everything<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.810> sealed<00:03:05.140> here<00:03:09.390> there<00:03:10.390> we

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
sure everything is sealed here there we

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.619 
sure everything is sealed here there we
go<00:03:10.629> you<00:03:10.870> can<00:03:11.019> see<00:03:11.290> how<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.859> seals<00:03:12.220> in<00:03:12.459> there

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
go you can see how that seals in there

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.000 
go you can see how that seals in there
then<00:03:13.629> we<00:03:13.750> seal<00:03:14.049> it<00:03:14.079> around<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.500> edges<00:03:14.650> and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
then we seal it around the edges and

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.789 
then we seal it around the edges and
then<00:03:15.819> once<00:03:16.090> that's<00:03:16.299> all<00:03:16.510> sealed<00:03:16.840> we<00:03:17.410> take<00:03:17.650> this

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
then once that's all sealed we take this

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.940 
then once that's all sealed we take this

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
makes the ipad pretty heavy actually so

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.020 
makes the ipad pretty heavy actually so
if<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:24.849> can<00:03:24.940> snap<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.480> into<00:03:25.750> place<00:03:26.910> this<00:03:27.910> is

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
if we can snap this into place this is

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.240 
if we can snap this into place this is
not<00:03:28.239> an<00:03:28.419> easy<00:03:28.569> process<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.500> your<00:03:29.799> children

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
not an easy process and your children

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.520 
not an easy process and your children
will<00:03:30.280> definitely<00:03:31.150> not<00:03:31.419> to<00:03:31.660> get<00:03:31.750> this<00:03:31.930> off<00:03:32.139> so

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
will definitely not to get this off so

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.289 
will definitely not to get this off so
that's<00:03:33.280> definitely<00:03:33.579> going<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.120> make<00:03:34.269> a

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
that's definitely going to make a

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.210 
that's definitely going to make a
difference<00:03:34.480> there<00:03:35.910> there<00:03:37.709> that's<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.010> that's

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
difference there there that's and that's

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.159 
difference there there that's and that's
a<00:03:39.310> good<00:03:39.459> thing<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.819> my<00:03:39.879> opinion<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:40.510> there<00:03:40.989> we

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
a good thing in my opinion so there we

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.349 
a good thing in my opinion so there we
have<00:03:41.199> that<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:42.220> adds<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.579> significant<00:03:43.209> half

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
have that and it adds a significant half

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.050 
have that and it adds a significant half
to<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.690> ipad<00:03:44.079> but<00:03:44.440> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.489> still<00:03:45.699> use<00:03:45.910> the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
to the ipad but you can still use the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.640 
to the ipad but you can still use the
ipad<00:03:46.389> through<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> everything<00:03:46.959> there<00:03:47.440> we<00:03:47.530> go

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
ipad through and everything there we go

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.000 
ipad through and everything there we go
it<00:03:48.010> flipped<00:03:48.280> over<00:03:48.690> we<00:03:49.690> can<00:03:49.840> use<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.139> ipad<00:03:50.530> let

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
it flipped over we can use the ipad let

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.449 
it flipped over we can use the ipad let
me<00:03:51.099> go<00:03:51.280> back<00:03:51.669> to<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.910> home<00:03:52.090> screen<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:54.129> see<00:03:54.340> it

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
me go back to the home screen and see it

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.970 
me go back to the home screen and see it
there<00:03:54.669> and<00:03:55.260> let's<00:03:56.260> brighten<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.769> screen

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
there and let's brighten the screen

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.520 
there and let's brighten the screen
there<00:03:57.340> we<00:03:57.489> are<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:57.900> brighten<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> screen<00:03:59.169> and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
there we are and brighten the screen and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.860 
there we are and brighten the screen and
then<00:04:00.099> this<00:04:00.280> thing<00:04:00.489> here<00:04:00.730> on<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.849> bottom<00:04:01.060> we

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
then this thing here on the bottom we

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.710 
then this thing here on the bottom we
just<00:04:02.400> clamp<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.609> shot<00:04:03.910> now<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.239> is<00:04:04.419> going

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
just clamp that shot now this is going

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.270 
just clamp that shot now this is going
to<00:04:04.810> take<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.260> strength<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.709> an<00:04:05.799> adult<00:04:06.010> to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
to take the strength of an adult to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.670 
to take the strength of an adult to
actually<00:04:06.609> do<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.940> now<00:04:07.540> that's<00:04:08.019> very<00:04:08.319> good<00:04:08.530> if

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
actually do that now that's very good if

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.930 
actually do that now that's very good if
you're<00:04:08.799> going<00:04:08.949> to<00:04:09.040> use<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.519> water<00:04:09.760> or

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
you're going to use it in water or

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.520 
you're going to use it in water or
you're<00:04:10.180> afraid<00:04:10.269> of<00:04:10.540> your<00:04:10.660> kids<00:04:10.900> dropping<00:04:11.260> it

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
you're afraid of your kids dropping it

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.949 
you're afraid of your kids dropping it
it<00:04:12.340> makes<00:04:12.609> that<00:04:12.910> a<00:04:12.940> really<00:04:13.299> good<00:04:13.480> thing<00:04:13.750> you

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
it makes that a really good thing you

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.050 
it makes that a really good thing you
also<00:04:14.169> have<00:04:14.949> a<00:04:14.980> really<00:04:15.310> difficult<00:04:15.639> time

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
also have a really difficult time

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.000 
also have a really difficult time
pushing<00:04:16.510> some<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.900> these<00:04:16.989> buttons<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:17.799> if<00:04:17.889> you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
pushing some of these buttons so if you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.860 
pushing some of these buttons so if you
push<00:04:18.250> these<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:19.060> see<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.479> need<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.719> use<00:04:19.840> a

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
push these you see you need to use a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.230 
push these you see you need to use a
good<00:04:20.109> force<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.709> do<00:04:20.829> it<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.159> you<00:04:21.729> can<00:04:21.909> do<00:04:22.090> it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
good force to do it and you can do it

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.880 
good force to do it and you can do it
same<00:04:22.659> with<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:22.960> vibrate<00:04:23.320> switch<00:04:23.469> but<00:04:23.770> it's

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
same with the vibrate switch but it's

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.629 
same with the vibrate switch but it's
just<00:04:24.099> not<00:04:24.159> some

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
just not some

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.420 
just not some
it's<00:04:24.849> very<00:04:24.999> easy<00:04:25.409> I'm<00:04:26.409> not<00:04:26.680> sure<00:04:26.740> there's<00:04:27.310> a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
it's very easy I'm not sure there's a

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.459 
it's very easy I'm not sure there's a
better<00:04:27.550> way<00:04:27.759> to<00:04:27.789> do<00:04:28.060> it<00:04:28.210> but<00:04:28.840> with<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.169> skit

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:29.469 
better way to do it but with the skit

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.989 
better way to do it but with the skit
the<00:04:29.620> size<00:04:29.949> of<00:04:30.129> this<00:04:30.219> case<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.639> definitely

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:30.999 
the size of this case it definitely

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.230 
the size of this case it definitely
makes<00:04:31.120> it<00:04:31.270> harder<00:04:31.659> to<00:04:31.689> do<00:04:32.729> so<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.849> screen<00:04:34.029> is

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
makes it harder to do so the screen is

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.269 
makes it harder to do so the screen is
fully<00:04:34.419> protected<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.319> iPads<00:04:35.740> in<00:04:35.889> there<00:04:36.099> it's

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:36.279 
fully protected the iPads in there it's

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.600 
fully protected the iPads in there it's
been<00:04:36.460> tested<00:04:36.969> for<00:04:36.999> 30<00:04:37.389> minutes<00:04:37.629> underwater

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
been tested for 30 minutes underwater

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.850 
been tested for 30 minutes underwater
before<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.939> put<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.330> ipad<00:04:40.870> screen<00:04:41.409> in<00:04:41.590> here

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
before you put the ipad screen in here

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.610 
before you put the ipad screen in here
so<00:04:42.099> it's<00:04:42.400> pretty<00:04:42.729> good<00:04:43.029> that<00:04:43.270> way<00:04:43.479> and<00:04:43.719> that's

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
so it's pretty good that way and that's

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.140 
so it's pretty good that way and that's
about<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:44.979> so<00:04:45.310> let's<00:04:45.430> take<00:04:45.729> a<00:04:45.789> look<00:04:45.999> at<00:04:46.120> it

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
about it so let's take a look at it

00:04:46.150 --> 00:05:32.280 
about it so let's take a look at it
under<00:04:46.330> water

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.720 

now<00:05:33.290> that<00:05:33.470> I've<00:05:33.590> taken<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.010> life<00:05:34.190> edge<00:05:34.430> case

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
now that I've taken the life edge case

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.200 
now that I've taken the life edge case
out<00:05:35.030> of<00:05:35.060> the<00:05:35.360> water<00:05:35.540> let's<00:05:35.840> open<00:05:36.170> it<00:05:36.260> up<00:05:37.210> take

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
out of the water let's open it up take

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.700 
out of the water let's open it up take
this<00:05:38.390> backing<00:05:38.750> off<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.320> can<00:05:39.440> see<00:05:39.590> it's

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
this backing off it you can see it's

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.680 
this backing off it you can see it's
still<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:39.980> little<00:05:40.190> bit<00:05:40.430> wet<00:05:40.610> here<00:05:45.280> there<00:05:46.280> we<00:05:46.430> go

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
still a little bit wet here there we go

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.030 
still a little bit wet here there we go
so<00:05:47.690> you<00:05:47.750> can<00:05:47.900> see<00:05:48.080> there's<00:05:48.290> water<00:05:48.560> underneath

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
so you can see there's water underneath

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.920 
so you can see there's water underneath
this<00:05:49.340> ring<00:05:49.640> it's<00:05:49.820> actually<00:05:50.210> splattering<00:05:50.780> a

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
this ring it's actually splattering a

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.410 
this ring it's actually splattering a
little<00:05:51.140> bit<00:05:51.260> as<00:05:51.410> I<00:05:51.440> take<00:05:51.800> this<00:05:52.010> off<00:05:52.420> there's

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
little bit as I take this off there's

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.150 
little bit as I take this off there's
water<00:05:53.660> there<00:05:53.960> but<00:05:54.170> there<00:05:54.290> should<00:05:54.530> be<00:05:54.680> no<00:05:54.860> water

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
water there but there should be no water
