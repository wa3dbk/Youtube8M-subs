00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
tools is not enough because the truth is

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.010 
tools is not enough because the truth is
ninety-seven<00:03:15.850> percent<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:16.360> all<00:03:16.450> Christians

have never led a lost soul to jesus and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.150 
have never led a lost soul to jesus and
it's<00:03:19.390> because<00:03:19.840> they<00:03:20.170> never<00:03:20.440> share<00:03:20.950> their

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
it's because they never share their
