00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.509
 the chain

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.749
 what's in there plus sign then right then opened it and it 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.189
 It would take us too long to get back to it, that's why I'm the same 

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.100

 limburg-dietkirchen a big folder 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.800
 the certificate becomes 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.380
 and here percent but sometimes sold 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.000
 rtr should Feldkirchen cars and probably entitled 7 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.210
 Newsprint wrapped 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.480
 the package now best 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.630
 but I was persecuted 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 Euro 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.790
 8th 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.830
 8th 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.710
 here herring 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.200
 wants annually 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.229
 these are 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.060
 Rheine 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.229

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.870
 Herten packed 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.540
 everyone receives cards 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.400
 both Kan as alarming 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.539
 fen 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.020
 and here is the place 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.320
 that we are both blaspheming there as well 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 three cars 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
 to 27 more 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.989
 if last time answers 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.989
 from 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:18.680
 in Munster Lehmann 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.599
 able to see 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.769
 Compare folders Danish had 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.999
 and what's that all about 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.759
 The project maybe then you can test us 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.479
 So from Zurich 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.519
 both here I am again and now I should give you something in the everything 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.770
 batman-film was and what is going on here 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.889
 It is very borderline like the courier maps 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.349
 and I'll show you what you're doing with the best card right on 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.999
 Beginning 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.209
 by doing that it happens long term between Kutlak outside 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.299
 most important I was left as long as no state 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.649
 from the report that does not go on then with a dead man 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.549
 Answer that also that the Turkish foreign minister 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.330
 Daaden no wonder 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.539
 and they go 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.819
 a magnet on 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.659
 also something German 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.139
 risked Raich was great 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:17.209
 and again as the best of the Shah Alkotest 2 issue again to be more firmly protected 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.369
 the animal will become some 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:22.110
 that was difficult 2 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.099
 Ogone hands 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.589
 accident witnesses 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.589
 then here 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:30.269
 look yes 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.369
 Once again, it is clear 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:34.549
 Hann 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.289
 good question 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:38.349
 percent 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.819
 Dirk Hilbert was 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.819
 then here in the blog there is not the day use to look 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.319
 they were cucumbers 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.379
 a team out 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:48.409
 still in July 2 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.119
 a good many six in number 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:51.729
 clearly no to say 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.729
 some other Dambacher magnet 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.959
 here Screen No Godard East operates and why are the cards so 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.209
 all top condition which they are a bit cool right now 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.469
 if here Haren Knowle hear home textiles 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.539
 Pontoise Gurria 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.550
 then there's a magnet for two Japanese gardens 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.900
 Corner 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.859
 Picture above 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.469
 here in Kicklingen 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:20.509
 into the water through holes through it 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.509
 unbelievable then Dost says 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.559
 urge the owners 

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:31.900
 a dark car until 10 because of the ground 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.520
 and another one 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.370
 Yes, here went through 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 a Japanese we go that is one 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.129
 Blumberg 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.539
 in any case, Japanese 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.909
 No, rather a German 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.569
 after obtaining one 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.599
 to meet there every day 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.710
 packed from the book 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.620
 Exactly and that were all Holocaust 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.620
 all the rest I go there now just like that 

00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.580
 but the construction cost a bit of a taste so we are 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.580
 Pretty cool and rare cards 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.580
 so bad 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.779
 a lot of greeting cards and pretty cool as well 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:14.819
 was what you care about writing Pakistan 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.490
 an act 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.920
 the red are shown on the polo and the Romans are 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.160
 and here it continues with the day as others are each folder 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.499
 Eckard Pahlke episode 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:32.969
 here it goes on Federica Brignone but referee, among other things 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.729
 yes here it continues then further defend members and still another 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.409
 few Japanese 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.899
 So pretty cool, I said of Abel and we will be the one on each 

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:52.349
 Case next 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.699
 and this is cool 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.029
 important 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.019
 Walter Baur have shipping and now I've finally got a weird cost 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:01.189
 the already so Galler condition everything 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:04.050
 So 60 cool and around 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.800
 Here again the whole night quotes about a thousand cards in total 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.180
 and how it really was the world below 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.889
 and they are very cool 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.469
 and exactly the OK that is so again in the future 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.389
 Percent after and the BMW around 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.400
 that shows he stood while the post office arrived and that then Gladbeck 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.000
 born 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.119
 but really if it did not work 

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.879
 and instead of and write me the comments 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:33.050
 and the scene is not even there
