lighting the firework off the top of his

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.910 
lighting the firework off the top of his
head<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.050> he<00:00:49.110> was<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> holding<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
head but he was just kind of holding it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.680 
head but he was just kind of holding it
there<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.430> was<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.579> lighting<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
there and he was like lighting it like a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.479 
there and he was like lighting it like a
joke<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.289> he<00:00:52.410> accidentally<00:00:52.920> lit<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.370> and

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
joke and then he accidentally lit it and

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.310 
joke and then he accidentally lit it and
he<00:00:53.850> blew<00:00:54.030> himself<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.230> he

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
he blew himself up and I think he

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.959 
he blew himself up and I think he
literally<00:00:55.590> did<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.190> blow<00:00:56.370> himself<00:00:56.550> up

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
literally did just blow himself up

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.369 
literally did just blow himself up
because<00:00:57.239> someone<00:00:57.480> also<00:00:57.629> said<00:00:57.960> after<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
because someone also said after it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
because someone also said after it
happened<00:00:58.829> there<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.760> nothing<00:01:00.449> left<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.899> him

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
happened there was nothing left of him

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
happened there was nothing left of him
which<00:01:01.170> blows<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:01.440> mind<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.160> big<00:01:02.430> was<00:01:02.609> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
which blows my mind how big was this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.219 
which blows my mind how big was this
firework<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.600> thought<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:03.989> light<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
firework I thought if you light a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.780 
firework I thought if you light a
firework<00:01:04.500> off<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> top<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.339> head<00:01:05.580> the

this<00:01:17.400> poor<00:01:17.640> guy<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.240> wanted<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.720> make

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
this poor guy he just wanted to make

people<00:01:19.140> laugh<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.060> instead<00:01:21.060> he<00:01:21.210> probably

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
people laugh and instead he probably

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.210
