00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.490
 I'm driving today trying the Mazda 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:11.430
 cx-5 gasoline 2 liters and 165 horses 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.430
 with front drive get on with me 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.589
 ah 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.080
 ah 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.600
 in this compact SUV with every 165 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.640
 horses at 6,000 revolutions per minute 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.640
 210 and other meters in 10 laps 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.270
 accelerates from 0 to 100 in 92 seconds and 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.230
 achieve a top speed of 200 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.250
 and spend 75 liters in city 5 with 1 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.310
 liters on the highway and 6 liters on average 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.960
 the 100 kilometers equivalent to 139 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:07.440
 grams per kilometer of missions 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.369
 which means that is cx-5 meets 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.369
 with the euro5 standard 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.960
 to contain the consumption kills included 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.590
 your system and this is a system of 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.299
 automatic start and stop that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 works perfectly and contains the 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.450
 expenditure 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.590
 during this rhythm test that is 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.900
 doing a media on the computer 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.900
 seven with three liters with what not 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:48.040
 this gasoline engine as in other kill 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 it's pretty up to 1,500 laps 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.610
 and even being atmospheric it offers a 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 more or less uniform push is clear 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.990
 who likes to go high back 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.110
 instead of six speeds to which it 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.330
 associated this mechanics has a very tact 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.630
 sporty with a pretty tour 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.160
 short the very exact inspection with 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.390
 some opposition 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.610
 the direction is precise and hardens 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.140
 progressively with speed is more 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:24.580
 dynamic that in this set that brings together 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.000
 the 1,400 kilos of weight 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.640
 has an effective stable suspension and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.990
 comfortable as a front relation that is at 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.990
 limit your caregiver 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.590
 the brakes offer a progressive touch 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.330
 They do not have much travel either 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.330
 yes they are pretty dosable 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.210
 This Japanese model offers a certain dose of 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.410
 even of wine itself that many others 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.410
 the model is a land 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.370
 here the proof of the solid mechanics of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.730
 165 cx-5 horses that sees a car 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.730
 from today
