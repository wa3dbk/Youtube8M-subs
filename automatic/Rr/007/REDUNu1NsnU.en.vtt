00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
the responsibility more on themselves

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.250 
the responsibility more on themselves
and<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.160> they're<00:02:39.400> they're<00:02:40.000> not<00:02:40.170> putting<00:02:41.170> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
and so they're they're not putting the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.780 
and so they're they're not putting the
blame<00:02:41.290> on<00:02:41.440> other<00:02:41.739> people<00:02:42.190> they<00:02:42.340> are<00:02:42.370> realizing

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
blame on other people they are realizing

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.759 
blame on other people they are realizing
that<00:02:42.970> it's<00:02:43.270> their<00:02:43.570> manners<00:02:43.959> their<00:02:44.230> actions

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
that it's their manners their actions

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.070 
that it's their manners their actions
that<00:02:45.070> are<00:02:45.340> responsible<00:02:45.910> for<00:02:46.030> what's<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:46.959> on

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
that are responsible for what's going on

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.900 
that are responsible for what's going on
in<00:02:47.230> their<00:02:47.380> world<00:02:47.410> around<00:02:47.860> them<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.489> I

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
in their world around them and and I

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:59.380 
in their world around them and and I
think<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.330> have<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.570> more<00:02:50.019> peaceful<00:02:50.260> atmosphere

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.930 

our<00:02:59.900> behavior<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.950> in<00:03:01.340> front<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> whole

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
our behavior is in front of the whole

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.120 
our behavior is in front of the whole
world<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.360> see<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.620> think<00:03:03.710> that's<00:03:03.980> really

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
world to see and I think that's really

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.060 
world to see and I think that's really
important<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.880> we<00:03:05.720> pass<00:03:05.960> these<00:03:06.440> behaviors

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
important that we pass these behaviors

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.270 
important that we pass these behaviors
down<00:03:07.820> to<00:03:08.690> our<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:09.380> our<00:03:09.410> kids<00:03:09.710> in<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.980> end<00:03:10.160> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
down to our to our kids in the end the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.670 
down to our to our kids in the end the
generations<00:03:10.820> are<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:11.720> follow<00:03:11.960> you<00:03:12.380> know<00:03:12.410> every
