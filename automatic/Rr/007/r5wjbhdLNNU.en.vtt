00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:30.099
 My philosophy has to respect the personality you have a very simple player guidance 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.809
 I use intensively to make a shot that will be a weapon 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.379
 Make sure your backhand strikes well as many leaders are teaching your students 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.510
 And 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:41.600
 I will teach you the same way as you can to make every shot perfect, but I 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.730
 At the same time 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:51.230
 I will focus on one more thing Every day is to practice the shot that will be a weapon 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.260
 I precisely because through to do it is to have confidence in the player development 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.390
 What I am doing is a very simple system long 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 Clean hit the ball simply for anyone without any obvious motion 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 You should be able to learn 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 There are various ways in order to foster the player I was most important in the first stage 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.940
 The point is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.920
 Techniques and techniques must be absolutely perfect 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.440
 Even if the students were able to practice all through the techniques quickly, all of them in the actual game 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.580
 Can not reflect the technique of 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.260
 Anyway, the stroke is perfect 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:31.420
 Must be green, sharp and sharp motion must be struck 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:36.160
 The next question is about coaching, but how do we communicate student council information 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:41.050
 The most important thing is that we make connections with our students 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.530
 It is often difficult for the car because it can be connected in the mental part 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.690
 Don't know 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.869
 What the student wants to do and what they are thinking about 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.380
 You have to understand and teach it 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:59.320
 That's why it's so important The Bible for the Leader 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.070
 Sure what they are thinking of what and what you want to do is to understand well that the students 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.520
 important 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.060
 Our coaching 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:10.039
 First of all, we are coaching quickly and briefly 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:13.489
 And we always make our students emphasize the sense of the ball 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.019
 That's why I want students to be feeling based 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:21.510
 Political parties are not mechanical races, and the parties have a mechanical base on their strokes 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:26.700
 The time to go back if you fall into a slump while practicing is a princess 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 It will always be difficult How to do I feel the ball when hitting the ball every time 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.540
 It is to strike while it is to strike it many times to repeat it is to practice repeatedly 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.540
 Must be perfect
