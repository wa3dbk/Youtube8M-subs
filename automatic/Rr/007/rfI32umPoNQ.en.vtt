00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
today I'm just going to be pulling

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.600 
today I'm just going to be pulling
sections<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.020> loosely<00:01:46.680> curling<00:01:47.430> them

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
sections out and loosely curling them

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
sections out and loosely curling them
because<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.600> effect<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.409> gives

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
because I like the effect that it gives

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590 
because I like the effect that it gives
when<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.890> loosely<00:01:50.280> curl<00:01:50.490> them<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> I'm<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.390> sure

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
when I loosely curl them so I'm not sure

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
when I loosely curl them so I'm not sure
what<00:01:51.899> size<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
what size this is because it's kind of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.060 
what size this is because it's kind of
berries<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:53.970> gets<00:01:54.119> smaller<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.070> yeah

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
berries because it gets smaller so yeah

to wrap my hair around it for just a few

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.510 
to wrap my hair around it for just a few
seconds<00:02:27.530> I'm<00:02:27.680> actually<00:02:27.860> looking<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:28.430> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
seconds I'm actually looking in the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.490 
seconds I'm actually looking in the
viewfinder<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.090> sorry<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:29.990> that<00:02:30.140> bothers<00:02:30.470> you

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
viewfinder so sorry if that bothers you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.010 
viewfinder so sorry if that bothers you
so<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.700> just<00:02:31.760> willing<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.210> for<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.390> few<00:02:32.540> seconds

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
so I'm just willing it for a few seconds

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.990 
so I'm just willing it for a few seconds
then<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.350> gonna<00:02:33.470> hold<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.920> curl<00:02:34.160> let<00:02:34.490> go<00:02:34.700> and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
then I'm gonna hold the curl let go and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.110 
then I'm gonna hold the curl let go and
it<00:02:35.390> is<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.570> loose<00:02:35.960> curl<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.610> think<00:02:37.700> I'm<00:02:37.970> gonna

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
it is a loose curl so I think I'm gonna

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.270 
it is a loose curl so I think I'm gonna
put<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> mirror<00:02:38.720> out<00:02:39.080> behind<00:02:39.590> me<00:02:39.770> or<00:02:39.920> something

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
put a mirror out behind me or something

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.350 
put a mirror out behind me or something
so<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.550> can<00:02:40.610> see<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.320> lied<00:02:42.320> no<00:02:42.770> so<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:44.060> going<00:02:44.240> to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
so I can see I lied no so it's going to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.380 
so I can see I lied no so it's going to
keep<00:02:44.570> curling<00:02:44.840> then<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.700> actually<00:02:46.700> don't<00:02:47.090> mind

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
keep curling then I actually don't mind

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.870 
keep curling then I actually don't mind
curling<00:02:48.080> my<00:02:48.230> hair<00:02:48.260> opposite<00:02:49.040> ways<00:02:49.220> like<00:02:49.580> I<00:02:49.700> can

easier than pulling my hand all the way

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.440 
easier than pulling my hand all the way

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
couple of pieces down here that needs a

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.700 
couple of pieces down here that needs a
curl<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.890> these<00:03:37.280> are<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.670> curls<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.180> got

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
curl so these are the curls that I got

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.260 
curl so these are the curls that I got
this<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:39.860> what<00:03:40.010> they<00:03:40.160> look<00:03:40.370> like<00:03:40.580> they're<00:03:41.000> all

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
this is what they look like they're all

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.510 
this is what they look like they're all
pretty<00:03:41.660> like<00:03:41.900> smooth<00:03:42.440> down<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.100> stuff<00:03:43.280> only

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
pretty like smooth down and stuff only

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.160 
pretty like smooth down and stuff only
like<00:03:43.880> right<00:03:44.090> here<00:03:44.270> I<00:03:44.300> didn't<00:03:44.600> curl<00:03:44.810> which<00:03:45.020> I

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
like right here I didn't curl which I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.120 
like right here I didn't curl which I
can<00:03:45.320> grow<00:03:45.440> them<00:03:45.620> right<00:03:45.740> now<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:46.930> technique<00:03:47.930> no<00:03:48.620> I

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
can grow them right now a technique no I

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.250 
can grow them right now a technique no I
really<00:03:49.940> think<00:03:50.060> everybody<00:03:50.780> could<00:03:50.960> do<00:03:51.080> this

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
really think everybody could do this

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
then they kind of separate throughout

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.140 
then they kind of separate throughout
the<00:04:15.470> day<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.920> then<00:04:16.100> they're<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.459> like<00:04:16.700> one

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
little or like little bits

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.680 
little or like little bits
curls<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:24.099> that<00:04:25.099> is<00:04:25.250> all<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.490> do<00:04:25.699> in<00:04:26.180> my<00:04:26.210> hair

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
curls so that is all I do in my hair

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.200 
curls so that is all I do in my hair
like<00:04:27.349> literally<00:04:27.979> it<00:04:28.280> doesn't<00:04:28.639> even<00:04:28.729> take<00:04:29.000> that

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
like literally it doesn't even take that

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.820 
like literally it doesn't even take that
long<00:04:29.389> because<00:04:29.659> they're<00:04:30.229> like<00:04:30.409> effortless

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
long because they're like effortless

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.490 
long because they're like effortless
you'd<00:04:31.220> barely<00:04:31.460> have<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.879> even<00:04:31.970> curl<00:04:32.270> them<00:04:32.500> so

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
you'd barely have to even curl them so

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.589 
you'd barely have to even curl them so
let's<00:04:34.400> check<00:04:34.639> on<00:04:34.819> this<00:04:35.000> side<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.419> have<00:04:35.569> a

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
let's check on this side of have a

let's check on this side of have a
couple<00:04:36.050> more<00:04:36.169> pieces<00:04:36.520> how<00:04:37.520> long<00:04:37.759> a<00:04:37.789> curl<00:04:38.680> yeah

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
couple more pieces how long a curl yeah

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.219 
couple more pieces how long a curl yeah
like<00:04:39.889> this<00:04:40.069> one<00:04:40.360> it's<00:04:41.360> gonna<00:04:41.479> curl<00:04:41.810> as<00:04:41.960> you<00:04:41.990> say

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229
