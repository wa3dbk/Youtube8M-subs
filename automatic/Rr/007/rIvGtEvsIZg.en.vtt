00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.630
 hello dear minecraft and sincerely 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.200
 Welcome to a new video of 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.930
 2007 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.280
 today it's about something completely 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 special and indeed a great offer 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.630
 from the side atheros point de or 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 I can not do it yet 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.800
 pronounce it very well but let's see that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.059
 will be on this page 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.250
 you are completely free 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.590
 privately now I say private in the sense 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 he was an offer on the spot friend 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.670
 where you are with a whitelist really 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 a server could host this server 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.320
 is then always online when someone is up 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.970
 the server is on it and that's it 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 already the entire offer of the server 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.520
 is really tasted that is you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 have nothing left on your computer 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.130
 to run 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.869
 it has nothing to do with me either 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.869
 do not need hamachi you can just 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.310
 so over an ip clear the entire page 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.500
 is still in one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.570
 alpha or beta phase that is it 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.160
 but we still catch bugs 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 first with the registered process 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.090
 the link to otto.de is the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.070
 of course in the video description 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.670
 we here once on a 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.820
 80 act on a curl but on 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 to register 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.000
 then we can talk to our e 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 mail address register one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.930
 user name then select one more 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 choose password and this password 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.500
 of course, can repeat cultivates 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 to register and e-mail 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.100
 he gets in small confirmation link 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.049
 There you just click on and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.330
 you're already registered that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.159
 really are few private data the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.960
 athen from punkt.de because of you required 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.369
 that means you do not give anything over there 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.170
 you do not pay for what you do not everywhere 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.270
 wanted to reveal and I really think so 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.820
 good that the page is there too 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.619
 not so much we ask now 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.320
 Log in and lure us with the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.060
 log in selected user data 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.150
 and then we wait a very small one 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.920
 moment and fair home 107 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.509
 you are logged in now that's it 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.310
 ever wonderful and here are 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.290
 we are also in a small one 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.390
 Survey as I said said is still one 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.680
 a bit packed so now depends 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.180
 Download this font and then you can 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.130
 you just click here a bug 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840
 report and then you can do a double 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.579
 You can just say if you have one 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.530
 you found bug here 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.299
 say that it exists and it will 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.860
 Definitely resolved quickly and that 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.269
 I still find it very convenient there 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.430
 page as I said really still in the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.170
 construction phase 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.299
 Now it's getting really interesting 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 we had a server there 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.890
 really to put on this little blog 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.420
 It's very easy to do that and then 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.549
 let's wait again for a very short time 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.379
 Here you can see the status that means 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.569
 if this should be full then there are 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.040
 really just forgave all servers and 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.480
 you can not find any new ones right now 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.150
 get server then you really have to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.069
 wait a little 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.109
 up here we have some information 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.129
 for example the servers ip can 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.989
 we are already in minecraft 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.180
 We'll add that later 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.129
 fences on the server so we copy 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.549
 us this time and go here in minecraft 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.430
 and just add the server here 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.109
 via ad server 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.790
 Okay and then we have the goal for you 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.709
 ever filed but currently he can 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.260
 not yet reached because he just 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.969
 not yet created okay we start 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.739
 At first we can spot 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.599
 There are already some things to choose from 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.909
 just say so much that loks 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.169
 we really need to choose it 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.219
 gives a system with these 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.919
 caution sign 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.959
 that means exactly when you get points 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.299
 really should only have just as many slots 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.310
 choose as he really needs 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.829
 the service for private purposes that is 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.930
 So you can not do a big public here 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.090
 giant server with giant games and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.440
 set up plugins no that works so far 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.239
 not yet I do not know if that still 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.859
 No idea is planned but you 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.269
 should really set as much as 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.949
 you need in the case I just need 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.510
 now only one player for it 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.479
 theoretically no server but needs 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.760
 well, otherwise if you are more 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.739
 player hooked here as you 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.259
 you need all at all 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.180
 five minutes a delusional point or so 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:07.549
 many points like her too many slots 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.489
 set if you are within 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.109
 Have 30 minutes more than ten of queens 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.030
 then shut down with your server 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.070
 and only after 30 minutes could him 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.079
 restart it so it is very important 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.519
 here only so much resources too 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.229
 Consume as you really do 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.090
 but little is needed 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.949
 that's the way it would be otherwise 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.599
 other people take the chance to take away 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.490
 to get a server here 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:31.220
 Now you can still set here 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.310
 only premium that means online 02 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.990
 or online 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.120
 if so, you can do that 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.880
 set standardized game mode 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.690
 survival creative or venture pvp yes 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.010
 or no 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.840
 but everything should go by itself 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.030
 everything is translated very nicely 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.890
 Difficulty is also clear and the 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.090
 command blog will be easy to activate 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.210
 and then you see here in the 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.650
 server properties became a property 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.390
 changed here we can become the 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.000
 server is running a command like 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.410
 eg or whatever that will be then 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.010
 right in the console probably 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.810
 given 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.300
 and here we can see our version 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.220
 Vienna currently supports athen ost.de 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.050
 no wobbling that means you can 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.180
 do not install any plugins but that is 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.100
 I still think planned and first time 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.690
 you have to deal with the vanilla version 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.330
 be content and you can each here 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.480
 any game version from 1.1.0 to 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.940
 currently install 1.552 or the 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.740
 latest snapshot here at 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.110
 install yourself 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.300
 Now it is still very important here 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.310
 opis and further are already at the 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.290
 names in there with those you really too 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.570
 logged in I am with mine 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.520
 music with the case logged in now 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.350
 let's fly somebody on the writers 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.510
 in addition to that is standard 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.280
 really on and this whitelist gets 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.140
 yes, not so easy out of that 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.090
 not a public server but rather a 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.430
 play server for private with friends 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.900
 Now let's add ours 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.930
 Players have the whitelist here 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.380
 added in the rent in the hugo 30 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.900
 10 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.970
 then we click enter and then 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.620
 we will inflict wounds on them 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.390
 We can do that every time 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.020
 there are already any changes 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.240
 should 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.080
 We also carry under the op s 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.730
 list a 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.290
 so that we all by missions 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.030
 on the server and now I have 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.409
 sees me misspelled microphone 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.619
 you 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.689
 not so and at 130 10 is the op s 

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:16.069
 list added much more we can 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:18.019
 not first make 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.879
 the page is as I said in the 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:21.979
 building phase and now it still remains 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:24.019
 action to start the server 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.089
 the server is now started that 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:28.999
 takes a very little moment and here 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.439
 As I said, we see the ip and now 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.539
 we see we can actions 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:34.969
 stop or restart or completely new 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.949
 install but the status is the 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.259
 server is online and it has already 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.269
 everything works great and tata tata 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:44.179
 we push minecraft on this one 

00:06:41.269 --> 00:06:45.919
 side and under our pmc atheros 

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:48.079
 broadcom and then yours accordingly 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.179
 board is our server now with one 

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:52.249
 slot wonderful reachable we can 

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:53.539
 log in and there we are already 

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:55.219
 in the middle of a dream here in the 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.459
 beautiful minecraft world you can 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:01.849
 command like flash game mode and more 

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:03.319
 all run game mode 1 times and times 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:05.179
 already we are here in the creative 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.279
 mode rather you can, however, 

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:08.539
 first do not do it yet you can do one 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:10.519
 just a few things as I said 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:12.709
 really here in these settings 

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:15.110
 but the page is located 

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:16.039
 still in the beta-phase up here 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.319
 really take care of her 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:20.329
 you would have set two slots now 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.829
 and for example you use this 

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:23.749
 two slots over the next five 

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:25.490
 not minutes then you get one 

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:27.289
 pen pal that it's not that bad 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.229
 but you should not boning over ten 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:32.599
 have points in half an hour 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.069
 Here you have a little live 

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:36.499
 You can just click on reporters 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:38.749
 Enter your name here and start 

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:42.019
 then click an operator 

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:43.969
 Welcome quickly and you can have yours here 

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:47.119
 ask the appropriate question and there 

00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:47.569
 the operator is okay that's it 

00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:49.339
 already 

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:51.439

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:55.509

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:55.509
