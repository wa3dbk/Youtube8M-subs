00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 for this recipe we are going to need 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.170
 Aubergines cut into slices is not going 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.150
 to say how many aubergines are needed 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.070
 because that depends on the amount that 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.679
 are going to do so they are seeing the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.130
 recipe more or less calculates we're also going 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.380
 to need sliced â€‹â€‹tomato and remember 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.230
 that if you are consuming a tomato that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.779
 not be organic then remove from the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.199
 shell we also need pasta 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.210
 tomato and I'm going to make it homemade if you 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.309
 you do not know how to make your tomato paste 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.410
 in the house then in the box 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.690
 information I'll leave the link in the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.960
 of the blog where I explain how 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.180
 prepare 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.420
 we also need some onions that already 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.050
 we have gone through a little fire for 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.079
 to be cooked and we need cheese from 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.480
 this cheese that comes in slices we are going to 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.329
 need the aubergines one hour before 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.329
 to prepare the lasagna let's cut it 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.140
 in sheets so that inside where 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.930
 you are one centimeter to one centimeter and 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.390
 half of the thickness more or less you decide 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.410
 How thick do you want them? 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.720
 so thick bars in a container 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.720
 salt water and put more or less about two 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.390
 tablespoons of salt pays for the amount 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.350
 of aubergines that we are going to put that are 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.509
 enough and we're going to put now if 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.980
 our slices of eggplant in the water 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:32.400
 for an hour 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.050
 after having left in water the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.650
 eggplants then what we 're going to do 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.500
 is to put them already dry in a pan with a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.090
 little oil to make them brown 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.300
 you do not need much 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.300
 time now in a container that you go 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.170
 to take to the oven you are going to put a layer 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.860
 of the tomato paste sauce then you're going to 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.760
 add a new layer eggplants 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.270
 we put tomato paste now we put 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.280
 a capital of onions if you do not like 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.869
 the onion then you can skip this 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.150
 ingredient you put then some tomatoes 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.160
 now let's put the cheese and if 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.100
 you want you can finish again with 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.560
 another layer of aubergines then cover the 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.330
 mold with aluminum foil and you take it to 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.780
 oven remembers that the oven should be 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.620
 preheated to 180 degrees and you leave the 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.850
 refractory in the oven for 30 minutes 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.830
