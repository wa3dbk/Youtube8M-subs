00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.240

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.439
 the practical are all warmly welcome 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.759
 more on video 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.789
 I'm here today with an infinite 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.590
 Set the beauty there and the video 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.130
 I was at the bottom of the infinite world 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.710
 playing a server of 10 fiddle moves me 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.880
 I think it's his turn to make me 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.270
 kings 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.640
 I on a map are all edited in MT 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.600
 I ascend I believe I do not believe 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.609
 Nothing is enough to make you all these 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.730
 slides there as I'm walking there have to 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:49.879
 use a tube box that you can see all 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.269
 the objects that have nuno gta and daito 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.890
 choose the best you liked and use 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.210
 creativity also make everything has 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.120
 thousands of Martian 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.140
 I already played more than 10,000 maps we 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.540
 why play three years so can tapas 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.310
 and this map and playing was what made or 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.250
 no talking this map was not 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.930
 official but the goal seems deadly 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.270
 crazy I've played once again a 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:20.060
 number to be nice so have to have 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.770
 practice and you have to go to the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.350
 start that does not know how to play more or less 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.439
 have to kick understood 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.110
 one asks tips for who knows so by 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.840
 example this side where I will come now 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.450
 have only to use the space and hate that of 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.909
 how everything turns the car there in the evaluation 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:44.149
 of immortal and mortal and students have to 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.070
 use littleinha know if each type I 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.630
 video wanted to see you so put 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.789
 Always a personal song and try 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.439
 complete one step the types of all 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.869
 I did not have any new singing attempts. 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.960
 type phase always stopped in half and 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.270
 I died to the I know so decor 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.390
 but I already played like I said 10 more 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.200
 thousand maps but I know by heart 1 6 thousand 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.119
 around 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.009
 little if I play I remember the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.860
 most maps the guy goes playing goes 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.289
 remembering the parts 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.610
 do not remember fully well why 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.080
 it's that easy 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.780
 when the guy already has experience of 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.310
 play and knows the whole map and not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.410
 you can record a video and a map that 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.760
 want at any time without a goalkeeper 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.070
 that this moment begins at the end of 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.780
 trade does not happen, it is easier to 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.310
 How can you make these videos? 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.920
 Think I said I 'm just going too strong. 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.020
 It has so much time to the guy 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.870
 distant and train a lot 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.500
 several bags because all of the maps 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.820
 so it has a different place, right? 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.980
 the work of rec in value is easy to do 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.100
 just right to leave down 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.140
 have multiple maps then choose the map and 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.500
 a place where you do not want to train 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.110
 and depending on the map everything already uses that 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.570
 training location on other maps for you 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.820
 already improving to understand if it is more 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.290
 easy to say have to develop in the game 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.530
 but then how can you be seeing? 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.590
 here mt a is not do not send beyond the chip 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.209
 it's not michael they are not better it's tense 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.190
 but that there is some difference also the 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.459
 heavier car making maneuver of the ideal 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 it's less heavy than not always there myself 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.370
 I always thought I was a little bit 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.130
 fernandinho 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.489
 Like that, nobody seems to think everything is 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.650
 lighter and it is better but in blood it 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.510
 let's say the screen looks like it's a 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.470
 bit slower but the gameplay is the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.420
 same as the screen owners anp 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.299
 she seems to be holding up a little at 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.549
 times and do not send it to me it's very free 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.320
 Let's not play without locking it seems 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.360
 everything is perfect so they will have it for me 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.760
 I'd rather play mt than the graphics are everything 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.260
 better optimized that not everyone 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.810
 says that mta is a perfection of gta nÃ© 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.060
 very good if you what if you play right? 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.780
 dm racing you will see several maps with 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.660
 a colored lights bands like this 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.070
 warning with target and what in the blood 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.350
 it is not possible to have because of 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.010
 gameplay even does not support 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.320
 understood 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.970
 so it 's better to play mt with me 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.010
 I prefer not to hairstyle that does not know or 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.959
 always play also wants the well - known 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.539
 in the brain 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.180
 Game well, that's why I always 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:28.009
 I prefer to play and I think it's cool and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.340
 woods and I think that not all staff are 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.410
 finishing here already map 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.680
 if they liked the video, they would not get in 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.080
 favorite where she was also on the channel 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.419
 the video of the Vietnam canada one 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.360
 transcript of the video there the bug is that 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.840
 it also speaks different humor nÃ© 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.360
 there was no channel there, the staff are not sorry 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.599
 of registration and package car so I go 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.900
 I'll talk to the deadline so I can 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:05:01.280
 link there in the description so my channel is 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.500
 foxy stats f or xy status but me 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.970
 I'll think I'll create a channel 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.030
 because this channel is using more to 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.270
 back videos of abuse of the brain 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.560
 You know then I 'll create the channel and I 'll wait 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.419
 that you also help me because I 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.750
 I need skiing to grow the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.139
 Channel too I'll post every week 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.229
 so two to five videos every week 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.349
 I'll post promises beauty then so much 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.630
 the new channel coming out 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.659
 promises to have different content right? 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.490
 I 'm going to work hard as well. 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.690
 the small one is a dream of mine envy 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.469
 Previous vegas blood was with 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.719
 problem 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.039
 I got low and mean again then 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.620
 all the videos I'm perfecting 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:46.940
