record<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:08.059> think<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.570> once<00:00:09.870> people<00:00:09.960> hear

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
record and I think that once people hear

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.940 
record and I think that once people hear
the<00:00:10.620> song<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.599> hear<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> whole<00:00:12.929> record<00:00:13.230> the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the song and hear the whole record the

the song and hear the whole record the
whole<00:00:14.099> album<00:00:14.250> I<00:00:14.460> feel<00:00:14.639> like<00:00:14.820> it'll<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.210> sort<00:00:16.080> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
whole album I feel like it'll be sort of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
whole album I feel like it'll be sort of
self-explanatory<00:00:16.500> why<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.660> decided<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> go

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
self-explanatory why I decided to go

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.750

with<00:00:18.960> run<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.010> wouldn't<00:00:20.369> want<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.609> give

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
with run but I wouldn't want to give

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.640 
with run but I wouldn't want to give
that<00:00:20.910> away<00:00:21.090> yet<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.930> he's

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650

sort of he's one of my best friends but
kind<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.180> ties<00:00:27.390> together<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:29.269> human<00:00:30.439> element

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
kind of ties together this human element

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.670 
kind of ties together this human element
of<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.279> record<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.840> consistent<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
of the record that that is consistent in

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100 
of the record that that is consistent in
he's<00:00:35.309> sort<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> Eeyore<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.690> my<00:00:36.899> life

finishing up that song he left me that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.940 
finishing up that song he left me that
message<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:49.230> didn't<00:00:49.410> really<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.620> what

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
message and I didn't really know what

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.690 
message and I didn't really know what
else<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.250> do

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
else to do

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.689 
else to do
to<00:00:51.449> transition<00:00:51.989> into<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> next<00:00:52.559> song<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
to transition into the next song and it

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
to transition into the next song and it
just<00:00:53.910> sort<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> happy<00:00:54.899> accident<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.620> me

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
just sort of was a happy accident for me

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
just sort of was a happy accident for me
and<00:00:56.149> you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.480> think<00:00:57.660> it's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
and you know I don't think it's

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.029 
and you know I don't think it's
something<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.440> people<00:00:58.620> are<00:00:58.739> gonna<00:00:58.859> listen

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
something that people are gonna listen

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.860 
something that people are gonna listen
to<00:00:59.190> over<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.780> know

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to over and over that little you know

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
to over and over that little you know
whatever<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.469> twelve<00:01:01.949> seconds<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.579> 15

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
whatever it is twelve seconds or 15

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.560 
whatever it is twelve seconds or 15
seconds<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.559> maybe<00:01:04.739> subtly

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
seconds but I think that maybe subtly

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.380 
seconds but I think that maybe subtly
it'll<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:07.640> something<00:01:08.640> people<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.090> relate<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it'll be something people can relate to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000 
it'll be something people can relate to
everybody's<00:01:09.990> got<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> friend<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.680> sometimes

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
everybody's got that friend or sometimes

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.440 
everybody's got that friend or sometimes
we<00:01:11.159> feel<00:01:11.430> sort<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:13.549> discouraged<00:01:14.549> maybe<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
we feel sort of discouraged maybe and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.249 
we feel sort of discouraged maybe and
he's<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.439> kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.799> guy<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
he's just kind of that guy that that

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.030 
he's just kind of that guy that that
it's<00:01:19.259> always<00:01:21.110> extremely<00:01:22.110> positive<00:01:22.770> although

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's always extremely positive although

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.350 
it's always extremely positive although
it<00:01:23.250> seems<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:23.820> always<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.119> end<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it seems like it's always the end of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.640 
it seems like it's always the end of the
world<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.750> him<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.110> thought<00:01:25.470> there's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
world to him and I thought there's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
world to him and I thought there's
something<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:26.070> beautiful<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.580> endearing

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
something really beautiful and endearing

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.179

just<00:03:45.409> came<00:03:46.129> out<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.940> was<00:03:47.150> exciting<00:03:47.629> to<00:03:47.840> write

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
just came out and was exciting to write

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.170 
just came out and was exciting to write
as<00:03:48.139> well<00:03:48.250> because<00:03:49.250> at<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.579> point<00:03:49.819> I<00:03:49.970> didn't

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
as well because at that point I didn't

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.030 
as well because at that point I didn't
know<00:03:50.209> I'm<00:03:50.479> not<00:03:50.690> exactly<00:03:50.989> sure<00:03:51.139> where<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.500> was<00:03:51.739> in

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
know I'm not exactly sure where I was in

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.770 
know I'm not exactly sure where I was in
the<00:03:52.129> process<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.639> the<00:03:52.790> record<00:03:53.090> but<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.329> remember

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the process of the record but I remember

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.300 
the process of the record but I remember
thinking<00:03:53.959> oh<00:03:54.290> this<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.709> right<00:03:54.889> when<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.069> wrote

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
thinking oh this is right when I wrote

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.550 
thinking oh this is right when I wrote
the<00:03:55.459> opening<00:03:55.849> riff<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.180> thought<00:03:56.389> this<00:03:57.290> is<00:03:57.440> how<00:03:57.470> I

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
the opening riff I thought this is how I

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.839 
the opening riff I thought this is how I
want<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:57.859> record<00:03:58.159> to<00:03:58.190> start<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.639> is<00:03:58.729> how<00:03:58.819> I

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
want the record to start this is how I

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.000 
want the record to start this is how I
want<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.120> show<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.299> start

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
want the show to start

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.000 
want the show to start
this<00:04:01.010> will<00:04:01.159> be<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.930> heartbeat<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
this will be the the heartbeat and the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.629 
this will be the the heartbeat and the
pulse<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.599> the<00:04:05.599> whole<00:04:05.750> album<00:04:06.010> so<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.069> guess<00:04:07.489> it

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
pulse of the whole album so I guess it

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.490 
pulse of the whole album so I guess it
would<00:04:07.729> be<00:04:07.790> run<00:04:08.120> because<00:04:08.690> because<00:04:09.169> of<00:04:09.319> the

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
would be run because because of the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.270 
would be run because because of the
exciting

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
exciting

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.819
