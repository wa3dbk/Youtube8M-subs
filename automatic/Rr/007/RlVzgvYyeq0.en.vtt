00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.910 

and<00:02:13.000> you'll<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.840> a<00:02:13.870> couple<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.380> folders<00:02:14.710> from

and you'll see a couple of folders from

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.380

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
within there as well but what we're

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.810 
within there as well but what we're
looking<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:17.080> roms<00:02:17.440> because<00:02:18.340> that's<00:02:18.610> where

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
looking for is roms because that's where

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.870 
looking for is roms because that's where
we're<00:02:18.940> going<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.240> drag<00:02:19.510> and<00:02:19.690> drop<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.140> wrong

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
we're going to drag and drop all wrong

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
we're going to drag and drop all wrong
so<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:21.970> can<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.360> select<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.020> expand<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.590> a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
so you can just select it to expand it a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.700 
so you can just select it to expand it a
little<00:02:23.680> bit<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:25.140> find<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> ROM<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
little bit and then find the ROM that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.300 
little bit and then find the ROM that
you<00:02:26.860> want<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.160> add<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.790> download<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you want to add that you download it and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.100 
you want to add that you download it and
simply<00:02:30.310> place<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.970> there<00:02:31.240> but<00:02:31.840> I'm<00:02:31.960> not

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
simply place it in there but I'm not

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.360 
simply place it in there but I'm not
going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.410> play<00:02:32.620> smiles<00:02:32.980> because<00:02:33.130> it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
going to play smiles because it's

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.850 
going to play smiles because it's
already<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.910> there<00:02:34.240> but<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.050> get<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.260> idea<00:02:35.410> of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
already in there but you get the idea of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.280 
already in there but you get the idea of
how<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.160> works<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.570> pretty<00:02:37.810> much<00:02:38.020> sums

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
how it works but that pretty much sums

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.500 
how it works but that pretty much sums
