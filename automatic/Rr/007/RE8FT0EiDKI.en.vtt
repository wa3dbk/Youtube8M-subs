00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
way you very quickly recuperate the cost

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.890 
way you very quickly recuperate the cost
of<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.920> box<00:04:32.130> so<00:04:32.790> for<00:04:33.150> example<00:04:33.210> with<00:04:33.690> that

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
that's already $22 and then adding any

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.950 
that's already $22 and then adding any
one<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.040> other<00:04:41.310> six<00:04:41.850> full-size<00:04:42.300> products

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
tried I mean I like a lot of them but

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.860 
tried I mean I like a lot of them but
wantable<00:05:01.230> seems<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:02.100> be<00:05:02.610> the<00:05:03.180> most<00:05:03.360> consistent

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
wantable seems to be the most consistent

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.800 
wantable seems to be the most consistent
in<00:05:04.350> terms<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:05.280> high<00:05:05.490> quality<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:06.240> don't<00:05:06.750> think

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
in terms of high quality I don't think

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.780 
in terms of high quality I don't think
I've<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.230> mean<00:05:07.290> I've<00:05:07.500> only<00:05:07.650> try<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.130> think<00:05:08.400> three

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
I've I mean I've only try to think three

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.630 
I've I mean I've only try to think three
multiple<00:05:09.600> boxes<00:05:09.780> so<00:05:10.260> far<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:11.040> is<00:05:11.430> a

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
multiple boxes so far so it is a

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.760 
multiple boxes so far so it is a
comparatively<00:05:12.510> small<00:05:13.020> sample<00:05:13.350> size<00:05:13.500> that<00:05:13.740> I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
comparatively small sample size that I

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.020 
comparatively small sample size that I
am<00:05:14.270> concluding<00:05:15.270> from<00:05:15.870> but<00:05:16.440> even<00:05:17.190> with<00:05:17.370> those

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
am concluding from but even with those

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.630 
am concluding from but even with those
three<00:05:18.360> boxes<00:05:18.630> that's<00:05:19.140> three<00:05:19.920> times<00:05:19.950> six

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
three boxes that's three times six

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.420 
three boxes that's three times six
that's<00:05:20.850> 18<00:05:21.330> products<00:05:22.230> I've<00:05:22.680> never<00:05:22.950> really

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
that's 18 products I've never really

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.220 
that's 18 products I've never really
come<00:05:23.610> across<00:05:23.700> one<00:05:24.150> where<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.390> think<00:05:24.630> oh<00:05:24.750> this<00:05:25.020> is

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
come across one where I think oh this is

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.950 
come across one where I think oh this is
just<00:05:25.560> okay<00:05:26.070> or<00:05:26.310> this<00:05:27.120> is<00:05:27.360> really<00:05:27.690> something

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
just okay or this is really something

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.720 
just okay or this is really something
that<00:05:28.170> i<00:05:28.230> wouldn't<00:05:28.590> use<00:05:28.800> or<00:05:29.100> i<00:05:29.130> think<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.490> poor

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
that i wouldn't use or i think is poor

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.370 
that i wouldn't use or i think is poor
quality<00:05:30.060> so<00:05:30.630> i<00:05:30.660> think<00:05:30.750> that<00:05:30.990> says<00:05:31.350> something

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
quality so i think that says something

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.860 
quality so i think that says something
about<00:05:31.890> it<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.790> the<00:05:33.210> other<00:05:33.450> thing<00:05:33.480> that<00:05:33.660> i

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
about it and the other thing that i

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.020 
about it and the other thing that i
guess<00:05:34.170> i'll<00:05:34.320> mention<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:35.010> reason<00:05:35.340> why<00:05:35.460> sort

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
guess i'll mention the reason why sort

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.110 
guess i'll mention the reason why sort
of<00:05:36.120> have<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.840> soft<00:05:37.080> spot<00:05:37.320> for<00:05:37.800> these<00:05:38.100> boxes<00:05:38.970> is

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
of have a soft spot for these boxes is

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.840 
of have a soft spot for these boxes is
because<00:05:39.570> they<00:05:40.050> expose<00:05:40.440> me<00:05:40.680> to<00:05:40.710> brands<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:41.550> i

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
because they expose me to brands that i

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.410 
because they expose me to brands that i
don't<00:05:42.090> typically<00:05:42.480> use<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.590> they<00:05:44.100> are<00:05:44.670> good

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
don't typically use so they are good

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.670 
don't typically use so they are good
quality<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.110> they<00:05:46.890> are<00:05:47.160> brands<00:05:47.790> that<00:05:48.560> let<00:05:49.560> me
