00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:09.110
 always tan today need to do 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.610
 I'll start a little guide 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.000
 one, even the guides we have here is not 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.000
 have 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:24.240
 so to say a rough copy of it I want you 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.609
 deer look for the passage appellate I 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.430
 I will perform not only a beginner 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:36.649
 so there may be some errors 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:40.379
 someone can better head means I already 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:44.899
 I will do the workpiece 2 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.170
 installations for the first time so to speak drawing 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.610
 Rough, that is, I make a contour detail 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 I grind undermines the thread 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.750
 a little governing and internal 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.449
 holes dawn then I cut all this 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 clamp and make clean that is when 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.760
 I process for the first time yes yes segments 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.600
 surface thread and guide 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.930
 this upstart 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.600
 and how to do with the tolerance of the real 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.150
 processing then we clamp and for one of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.729
 tom process the inner surface 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.100
 since the channel us is working and here 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.750
 These are the leaves, that is, they are here. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.270
 geometric axis of rotation of them 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.170
 turn out the same all this is one of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:40.710
 the most very precisely these are my thoughts 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 cook well then everything will be 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.100
 say cut it all the point grind 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.770
 sandpaper as possible if you see 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.369
 tolerances no longer surface anymore 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 ten 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.930
 not very accurate detail 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 now the balance stripped the center pressed on 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.560
 just in case everything means gonna be rough 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.560
 do you periodically show 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.420
 here 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.540
 so preparing all the blanks 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:19.489
 process in size are you ready to skin 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:21.919
 put that is, let's see that is 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.860
 internal surface size 30 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:30.440
 diameter and us that they were very solos 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:32.600
 this collar is rightfully not in 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.760
 the mandrel in the body need to be 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.190
 solos we will go to them guides 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:43.639
 this year is big enough difficult 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:46.600
 try to do everything for the best of what else 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.880
 I wanted to say take a little tuck 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.570
 to sit down at the best touched 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.490
 do not strengthen and will do with 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:59.180
 sat down everything set up already left only 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.050
 bring and how to do this deepening 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.050
 let's try 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.190
 further in order 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.950
 most of the work done hole 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.240
 sprout 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:30.600
 for cutting all pores will be systematic 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.960
 the size is still from this side with 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.720
 they worked to cut the chamfer judging by 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:41.850
 drawing 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:45.360
 chamfers on solid flower 5 millimeters well 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.930
 turn on what will give clamped outer and front 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.930
 glasses to remove 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:42.340
 that's how everything is completely 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.710
 sleeve 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.860
 managers according to the drawing 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.729
 all the best
