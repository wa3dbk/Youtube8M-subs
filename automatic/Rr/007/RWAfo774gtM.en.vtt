stand of flowering brassicas and you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.170 
stand of flowering brassicas and you
know<00:00:47.039> but<00:00:47.190> just<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.640> two<00:00:47.670> percent<00:00:48.120> of

these radishes out here that are doing

these radishes out here that are doing
this<00:00:50.120> isn't<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> problem<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
this isn't going to be a problem the

this isn't going to be a problem the
other<00:00:52.350> thing<00:00:52.530> you'll<00:00:52.680> notice<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.520> need

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
other thing you'll notice is you need

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.209 
other thing you'll notice is you need
the<00:00:53.789> radishes<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.360> flower<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.620> tend<00:00:56.070> not

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the radishes that flower they tend not

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.849 
the radishes that flower they tend not
to<00:00:56.460> go<00:00:56.789> quite<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.300> deep<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.410> don't<00:00:58.590> know<00:00:58.739> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
to go quite as deep and I don't know it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.439 
to go quite as deep and I don't know it
seems<00:00:59.070> like<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> roots<00:00:59.550> tend<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> branch<00:01:00.239> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
seems like the roots tend to branch a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.630 
seems like the roots tend to branch a
little<00:01:00.690> more<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.739> any<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> flower<00:01:02.309> don't

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
little more so any of the flower don't

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.670 
little more so any of the flower don't
do<00:01:02.789> quite<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.180> good<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> job<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.199> up<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.470> South

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
do quite as good a job I was up in South

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.940 
do quite as good a job I was up in South
Dakota<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.780> cover<00:01:06.780> crop<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.590> her<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> other

day and the whole field was flowered
they<00:01:13.170> had<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.530> plots<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.159> different

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
they had different plots of different

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.420 
they had different plots of different
brassicas<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.799> radishes<00:01:17.130> were

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
brassicas there and the radishes were

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.670 
brassicas there and the radishes were
all<00:01:17.610> flowered<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:18.750> had<00:01:19.110> some<00:01:19.140> spines

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
all flowered they also had some spines

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.700 
all flowered they also had some spines
on<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> leaves<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:21.780> had<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> similar<00:01:22.320> root

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
on the leaves it had a similar root

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.980 
on the leaves it had a similar root
system<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.820> similar<00:01:24.090> rut<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> ones

system you know similar rut to the ones

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.870 
system you know similar rut to the ones
we<00:01:25.170> looked<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.530> earlier<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.369> most<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.729> them

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
we looked at earlier but most of them

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.630 
we looked at earlier but most of them
looked<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:29.930> that<00:01:30.930> particular

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
looked about like this that particular

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
looked about like this that particular
variety<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> seed<00:01:33.270> supplier<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
variety the the seed supplier that it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.060 
variety the the seed supplier that it
came<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:36.290> which<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> competing<00:01:37.829> seed

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
came from which was a competing seed

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
came from which was a competing seed
company<00:01:38.400> mind<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:39.119> said<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> was<00:01:39.659> sold

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
company mind they they said it was sold

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
company mind they they said it was sold
with<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> daikon<00:01:41.009> radish<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.970> was

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
with them as a daikon radish and it was

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.770 
with them as a daikon radish and it was
North<00:01:42.299> Dakota<00:01:42.659> production<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.060> they

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
North Dakota production and so they

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.910 
North Dakota production and so they
weren't<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> use<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.409> seed<00:01:46.649> source

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
weren't going to use that seed source

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
weren't going to use that seed source
next<00:01:47.189> year<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:48.000> had<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> huge<00:01:48.390> problems

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
next year but they had a huge problems

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.130 
next year but they had a huge problems
with<00:01:48.840> flowering<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.930> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.049> know

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
with flowering on it and if you know

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
with flowering on it and if you know
it's<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> good<00:01:52.680> situation<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.520> some<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's not a good situation that some of

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
it's not a good situation that some of
that<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.869> seed<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.439> probably<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> me

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that the seed was probably going to me

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.859 
that the seed was probably going to me
if<00:01:56.579> we've<00:01:56.880> been<00:01:56.909> strictly<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.479> cover<00:01:57.689> crop

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
if we've been strictly a cover crop

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.170 
if we've been strictly a cover crop
situation<00:01:58.619> would<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.159> made<00:01:59.430> viable<00:01:59.939> seed

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
situation would have made viable seed

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
situation would have made viable seed
they<00:02:00.869> were<00:02:00.990> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> graze<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.469> field<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
they were going to graze that field and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.970 
they were going to graze that field and
they'll<00:02:02.430> probably<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> graze<00:02:03.240> before

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
they'll probably get a graze before

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.609 
they'll probably get a graze before
you<00:02:05.980> know<00:02:06.270> viable<00:02:07.270> seed<00:02:07.420> production<00:02:07.720> happened

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
you know viable seed production happened

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.230 
you know viable seed production happened
the<00:02:09.460> other<00:02:09.610> thing<00:02:09.760> was<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.060> were<00:02:10.119> gonna

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
the other thing was they were gonna

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.780 
the other thing was they were gonna
graze<00:02:10.510> that<00:02:10.540> field<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.320> you<00:02:11.740> know<00:02:11.860> if<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
graze that field and I you know if the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470 
graze that field and I you know if the
radishes<00:02:13.180> were<00:02:13.480> in<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.720> mix<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:15.330> two<00:02:16.330> or<00:02:16.450> three

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
radishes were in a mix with two or three

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.190 
radishes were in a mix with two or three
other<00:02:16.720> brassicas<00:02:17.910> oats<00:02:18.910> I<00:02:19.450> believe<00:02:19.840> was<00:02:20.080> out

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
other brassicas oats I believe was out

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.510 
other brassicas oats I believe was out
there<00:02:20.440> there<00:02:20.650> were<00:02:20.740> some<00:02:20.950> lentils<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.460> some

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
there there were some lentils and some

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.460 
there there were some lentils and some
batch<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.120> some<00:02:22.300> peas<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.840> was<00:02:22.960> a<00:02:22.990> mixture<00:02:23.350> of

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
batch and some peas it was a mixture of

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.330 
batch and some peas it was a mixture of
things<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.400> as<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:25.560> percentage<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.160> total

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
things so as a percentage of the total

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.700 
things so as a percentage of the total
for<00:02:27.910> age<00:02:28.090> out<00:02:28.330> there<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.870> wasn't<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.470> huge

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
for age out there it wasn't a huge

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.570 
for age out there it wasn't a huge
percentage<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.400> 4-h<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:32.430> taken<00:02:33.430> into

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
percentage of the 4-h and taken into

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.100 
percentage of the 4-h and taken into
consideration<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.300> animals<00:02:34.660> aren't<00:02:34.870> going

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
consideration the animals aren't going

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.440 
consideration the animals aren't going
to<00:02:35.230> prefer<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.920> flowered<00:02:36.400> Brassica<00:02:37.120> anyway

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
to prefer this flowered Brassica anyway

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.790 
to prefer this flowered Brassica anyway
I<00:02:37.690> don't<00:02:37.900> think<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.380> was<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.590> to<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.770> a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
I don't think it was going to be a

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.440 
I don't think it was going to be a
problem<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.460> that<00:02:39.580> situation<00:02:40.210> from<00:02:40.330> the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
problem in that situation from the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.380 
problem in that situation from the
toxicities<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.950> if<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.160> had<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> pure<00:02:43.030> stand

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
toxicities but if you had a pure stand

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.510 
toxicities but if you had a pure stand
of<00:02:43.630> radishes<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.590> flowered<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.370> you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
of radishes and flowered on it you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520 
of radishes and flowered on it you
probably<00:02:46.060> wouldn't<00:02:46.390> want<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.570> graze<00:02:46.810> it<00:02:47.020> or<00:02:47.440> if

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
probably wouldn't want to graze it or if

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.260 
probably wouldn't want to graze it or if
you<00:02:47.650> did<00:02:47.860> you'd<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.460> really<00:02:48.790> strictly

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
you did you'd have to really strictly

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.050 
you did you'd have to really strictly
limit<00:02:49.630> their<00:02:49.780> access<00:02:50.490> so<00:02:51.490> we<00:02:51.580> didn't<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:51.910> too

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
limit their access so we didn't get too

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.510 
limit their access so we didn't get too
much<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.240> it
