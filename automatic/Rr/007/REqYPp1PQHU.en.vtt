okay<00:00:00.659> in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.900> video<00:00:01.079> I'm<00:00:01.350> going<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.560> talk

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
okay in this video I'm going to talk

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.499 
okay in this video I'm going to talk
about<00:00:01.909> CPU<00:00:03.020> benchmarking<00:00:04.160> that's<00:00:05.509> your

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
about CPU benchmarking that's your

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.370 
about CPU benchmarking that's your
central<00:00:06.990> processing<00:00:07.470> unit<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:09.380> what

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
central processing unit and what

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.180 
central processing unit and what
benchmarking<00:00:11.040> does<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:12.410> sets<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.620> uniform

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
benchmarking does is it sets a uniform

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.670 
benchmarking does is it sets a uniform
test<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:15.120> compare<00:00:15.480> how<00:00:15.990> your<00:00:16.260> CPU<00:00:18.680> performs

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
test to compare how your CPU performs

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.259 
test to compare how your CPU performs
relative<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:21.619> similar<00:00:22.619> CPUs<00:00:23.220> across<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
relative to similar CPUs across the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.580 
relative to similar CPUs across the
world<00:00:26.180> using<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.269> standard<00:00:27.750> set<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> software

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
world using a standard set of software

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.939 
world using a standard set of software
so<00:00:29.429> one<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.300> my<00:00:30.420> favorite<00:00:30.929> ways<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> CPU

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
so one of my favorite ways to CPU

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.080 
so one of my favorite ways to CPU

know what that is I recommend you check
out<00:01:06.299> Merce<00:01:06.869> an<00:01:07.080> org<00:01:08.510> but<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
out Merce an org but I'm just going to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.420

be<00:01:10.170> using<00:01:10.409> prime95

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
be using prime95

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.000 
be using prime95
for<00:01:11.909> benchmarking<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.810> CPU

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
for benchmarking this CPU

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.660 
for benchmarking this CPU
so<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.670> download<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.420> program

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.179 

and<00:01:22.970> I'm<00:01:23.360> going<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:23.630> extract<00:01:24.140> it

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.560 

the<00:01:31.189> program<00:01:31.610> I'm<00:01:31.790> interested<00:01:32.689> in<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:33.049> prime95

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.050 

we'll<00:01:38.140> run<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:39.580> gives<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:39.940> the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
we'll run it it gives you the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.790 
we'll run it it gives you the
opportunity<00:01:40.300> when<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.080> first<00:01:41.290> run<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.650> to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
opportunity when you first run it to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.100 
opportunity when you first run it to
join<00:01:42.130> giimpse<00:01:42.640> or<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.390> say<00:01:43.570> just<00:01:43.870> stress

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
join giimpse or to say just stress

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.860 
join giimpse or to say just stress
testing<00:01:44.590> I'm<00:01:45.370> doing<00:01:45.760> I'm<00:01:46.030> just<00:01:46.300> stress

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
testing I'm doing I'm just stress

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.490 
testing I'm doing I'm just stress
testing<00:01:47.290> right<00:01:47.470> now

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
testing right now

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.140 
testing right now
so<00:01:50.500> it<00:01:50.620> brings<00:01:50.800> up<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.280> window<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.820> run<00:01:52.120> a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
so it brings up this window to run a

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.080 
so it brings up this window to run a
torture<00:01:52.540> test<00:01:53.400> that<00:01:54.400> will<00:01:54.580> just<00:01:54.790> basically

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
torture test that will just basically

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.220 
torture test that will just basically
run<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.750> benchmark<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:57.180> forever<00:01:58.180> until<00:01:59.170> you

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
run the benchmark for forever until you

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.430 
run the benchmark for forever until you
tell<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.590> stop<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:01.000> don't<00:02:01.960> want<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> do<00:02:02.290> that

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
tell it to stop I don't want to do that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.730 
tell it to stop I don't want to do that
I<00:02:02.740> want<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.550> benchmark<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:04.720> some<00:02:05.590> results

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I want to benchmark and get some results

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.990 
I want to benchmark and get some results
here<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.890> go<00:02:09.790> to<00:02:10.950> options<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.310> then

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
here so I go to options and then

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.260 
here so I go to options and then
benchmark<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.430> once<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.550> click<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
benchmark and once I click that the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.890 
benchmark and once I click that the
benchmark<00:02:16.570> is<00:02:16.930> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.200> start<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:19.030> you'll

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
benchmark is going to start so you'll

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.250 
benchmark is going to start so you'll
see<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> basically<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.240> does<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.810> run

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
see and basically what this does is run

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.100 
see and basically what this does is run
some<00:02:23.710> very<00:02:24.400> complex<00:02:25.110> mathematical

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
some very complex mathematical

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.840 
some very complex mathematical
calculations<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:28.050> tests<00:02:29.400> records<00:02:30.400> how<00:02:30.610> long

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
calculations and tests records how long

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.330 
calculations and tests records how long
it<00:02:31.360> takes<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.900> run<00:02:32.050> those<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.070> don't

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
it takes to run those and so you don't

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.830 
it takes to run those and so you don't
really<00:02:36.520> want<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.820> do<00:02:36.970> anything<00:02:37.209> while<00:02:37.570> this<00:02:37.720> is

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
really want to do anything while this is

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.090 
really want to do anything while this is
running<00:02:38.020> because<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.590> could<00:02:38.709> affect<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
running because it could affect the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.970 
running because it could affect the
results<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.590> want<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:43.260> keep<00:02:44.260> as<00:02:44.500> little

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
results and you want to keep as little

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.199 
results and you want to keep as little
variables<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.910> possible<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.820> can<00:02:49.000> see

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
variables as possible so you can see

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.229 
variables as possible so you can see
that<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:51.010> results<00:02:51.430> will<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.730> written<00:02:51.910> to

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
that the results will be written to

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.340 
that the results will be written to
results<00:02:52.690> dot<00:02:52.930> txt<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.650> I'll<00:02:54.580> show<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:54.850> how<00:02:55.269> to

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
results dot txt and I'll show you how to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.890 
results dot txt and I'll show you how to
analyze<00:02:56.350> your<00:02:56.380> results<00:02:57.360> once<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.570> benchmark

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
analyze your results once this benchmark

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.660 
analyze your results once this benchmark
has<00:02:59.230> completed

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.260 

so<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.540> can

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
so we can

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.300 
so we can
watch<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.260> benchmark<00:03:06.800> run<00:03:08.950> actually<00:03:09.950> I<00:03:09.980> am

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
watch the benchmark run actually I am

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.470 
watch the benchmark run actually I am
going<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:11.890> slightly<00:03:12.890> skew<00:03:13.580> my<00:03:13.790> results<00:03:14.300> by

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
going to slightly skew my results by

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.480 
going to slightly skew my results by
opening<00:03:15.110> up<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.350> task<00:03:15.560> manager<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.250> show<00:03:16.430> you

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
opening up the task manager and show you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.110 
opening up the task manager and show you
what's<00:03:16.760> happening<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.920> CPU<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.610> completely

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
what's happening the CPU is completely

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:28.589 
what's happening the CPU is completely
pegged<00:03:20.360> at<00:03:20.540> 100%

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.620 

and<00:03:29.049> we'll<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.319> let<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:29.859> run

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.070 

this<00:03:35.230> actually<00:03:35.500> might<00:03:35.800> take<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> while<00:03:36.280> so<00:03:36.670> I'm

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
this actually might take a while so I'm

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.240 
this actually might take a while so I'm
going<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.140> pause<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.530> video<00:03:38.770> while<00:03:39.010> this

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
going to pause the video while this

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.370 
going to pause the video while this
completes<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.300> then<00:03:40.900> show<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:41.110> how<00:03:41.230> to

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
completes and then show you how to

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.760 
completes and then show you how to
analyze<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.980> results<00:03:43.440> okay<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:44.500> the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
analyze the results okay so the

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.520 
analyze the results okay so the
benchmarking<00:03:45.370> has<00:03:45.670> completed<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.420> as<00:03:47.350> it

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
benchmarking has completed and as it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.570 
benchmarking has completed and as it
said<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:48.420> timings<00:03:49.420> were<00:03:49.690> written<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.580> results

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
said the timings were written to results

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.410 
said the timings were written to results

other processors and you should note
that<00:04:20.110> the<00:04:20.799> lower<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.310> number<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.880> better<00:04:22.230> so

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
that the lower the number the better so

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:37.140

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.510 

let's<00:04:37.630> get<00:04:37.750> this

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.709 

okay<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.419> have<00:04:41.629> to<00:04:41.750> compare<00:04:41.960> each

the<00:04:54.439> very<00:04:54.469> best<00:04:54.889> processor<00:04:55.489> tested<00:04:55.969> did<00:04:56.959> it<00:04:57.110> in

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
the very best processor tested did it in

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.379 
the very best processor tested did it in
sixteen<00:04:57.949> point<00:04:58.369> one<00:04:58.639> seconds

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
sixteen point one seconds

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:05.729 
sixteen point one seconds
I<00:04:59.619> managed<00:05:00.819> 33<00:05:01.819> point<00:05:02.089> 1<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.569> 6<00:05:03.009> or<00:05:04.119> 16<00:05:05.119> point<00:05:05.509> 1

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:05.739 
I managed 33 point 1 to 6 or 16 point 1

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:12.309 
I managed 33 point 1 to 6 or 16 point 1
milliseconds<00:05:06.739> I<00:05:06.860> managed<00:05:07.419> 33<00:05:09.489> if<00:05:10.489> you<00:05:10.639> go<00:05:11.319> down

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
milliseconds I managed 33 if you go down

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.839 
milliseconds I managed 33 if you go down
to<00:05:12.349> the<00:05:12.739> largest<00:05:13.429> the<00:05:13.669> 409<00:05:14.269> 6<00:05:14.569> K<00:05:15.309> it<00:05:16.309> did<00:05:16.610> it<00:05:16.729> in

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
to the largest the 409 6 K it did it in

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:22.859 
to the largest the 409 6 K it did it in
71<00:05:17.599> and<00:05:18.339> I<00:05:19.360> managed<00:05:20.360> a<00:05:20.569> 172<00:05:21.469> so<00:05:22.069> as<00:05:22.159> you<00:05:22.309> can<00:05:22.399> see

00:05:22.859 --> 00:05:22.869 
71 and I managed a 172 so as you can see

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:26.699 
71 and I managed a 172 so as you can see
my<00:05:23.869> results<00:05:24.019> are<00:05:24.439> much<00:05:24.919> much<00:05:25.249> slower<00:05:25.489> than

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:26.709 
my results are much much slower than

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:31.899 
my results are much much slower than
this<00:05:27.709> very<00:05:28.189> fast<00:05:28.610> processor<00:05:30.399> so<00:05:31.399> let's<00:05:31.729> go

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:31.909 
this very fast processor so let's go

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.119 
this very fast processor so let's go
down<00:05:32.149> and<00:05:32.509> see<00:05:33.610> about<00:05:34.610> where<00:05:34.879> I<00:05:34.909> rank<00:05:36.129> keep

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
down and see about where I rank keep

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.459 
down and see about where I rank keep
going<00:05:37.639> we'll<00:05:38.329> go<00:05:38.509> until<00:05:38.929> we<00:05:39.050> hit<00:05:39.229> 33<00:05:41.139> so<00:05:42.139> I'm

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
going we'll go until we hit 33 so I'm

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.319 
going we'll go until we hit 33 so I'm
right<00:05:42.709> around<00:05:44.979> this<00:05:45.979> Pentium<00:05:46.459> 4<00:05:46.759> here<00:05:46.999> which

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:47.329 
right around this Pentium 4 here which

00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:51.100 
right around this Pentium 4 here which
is<00:05:47.659> actually<00:05:48.589> exactly<00:05:49.339> what<00:05:49.849> this<00:05:50.479> processor

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
is actually exactly what this processor

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.219 
is actually exactly what this processor
is<00:05:52.599> so<00:05:53.599> I<00:05:53.629> got<00:05:53.839> 33<00:05:54.499> and<00:05:54.829> then<00:05:55.069> 43<00:05:55.849> and<00:05:56.229> then

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
is so I got 33 and then 43 and then

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.359 
is so I got 33 and then 43 and then
around<00:05:57.439> 54<00:05:58.539> and<00:05:59.539> then<00:05:59.929> around<00:06:00.139> 60<00:06:00.829> something

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:01.369 
around 54 and then around 60 something

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:04.600 
around 54 and then around 60 something
and<00:06:01.809> so<00:06:02.809> these<00:06:03.019> are<00:06:03.079> very<00:06:03.259> close<00:06:03.769> to<00:06:04.069> what<00:06:04.459> I'm

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
and so these are very close to what I'm

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.449 
and so these are very close to what I'm
actually<00:06:04.879> getting<00:06:05.239> on<00:06:05.569> mine<00:06:06.009> mine's<00:06:07.009> slightly

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:07.459 
actually getting on mine mine's slightly

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:09.040 
actually getting on mine mine's slightly
slower<00:06:07.729> since<00:06:08.059> it's<00:06:08.209> running<00:06:08.509> in<00:06:08.599> a<00:06:08.689> virtual

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
slower since it's running in a virtual

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.040 
slower since it's running in a virtual
machine<00:06:11.019> but<00:06:12.019> it's<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:13.039> very<00:06:13.249> good

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
machine but it's a very good

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.739 
machine but it's a very good
representation<00:06:15.050> of<00:06:15.199> how<00:06:15.829> well<00:06:16.099> your<00:06:16.539> CPU<00:06:17.539> is

00:06:17.739 --> 00:06:17.749 
representation of how well your CPU is

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:20.090 
representation of how well your CPU is
running

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
running

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.800 
running
and<00:06:22.040> there<00:06:23.040> are<00:06:23.250> other<00:06:23.480> benchmarking<00:06:24.480> tools

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
and there are other benchmarking tools
