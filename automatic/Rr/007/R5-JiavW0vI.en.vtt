there's absolutely no need to eat out
every<00:02:34.810> single<00:02:34.959> meal<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:36.430> that's<00:02:36.610> my<00:02:36.880> answer

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
every single meal so that's my answer

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.509 
every single meal so that's my answer
and<00:02:37.450> it's<00:02:38.380> not<00:02:38.620> going<00:02:38.799> to<00:02:38.890> work<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.220> hundred

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
and it's not going to work a hundred

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.740 
and it's not going to work a hundred
percent<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.030> there<00:02:40.180> are<00:02:40.330> going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.540> times

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
percent and there are going to be times

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.720 
percent and there are going to be times
when<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.080> just<00:02:41.110> want<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.500> go<00:02:41.650> out<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.160> that's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
when you just want to go out and that's

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.570 
when you just want to go out and that's
the<00:02:43.000> way<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:43.299> but<00:02:43.660> if<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:45.100> watch<00:02:45.310> my<00:02:45.340> videos
