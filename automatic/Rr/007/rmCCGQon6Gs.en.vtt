for us i can't imagine sitting there
watching<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.750> thought<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> guys<00:00:55.469> as<00:00:55.890> they<00:00:56.399> have

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
watching i thought the guys as they have

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.709 
watching i thought the guys as they have
all<00:00:56.699> year<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:56.969> did<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> nice<00:00:57.480> job<00:00:57.510> staying

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
all year just did a nice job staying

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.680 
all year just did a nice job staying
composed<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:59.059> came<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.180> with<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.390> poise

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
composed and came out with some poise

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.389 
composed and came out with some poise
and<00:01:00.989> then<00:01:01.140> i<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.710> few<00:01:01.859> things<00:01:02.039> went<00:01:02.309> our

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and then i think a few things went our

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
and then i think a few things went our
way<00:01:02.520> early<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.030> set<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
way early in the set and the kind of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
way early in the set and the kind of
switch<00:01:05.129> flipped<00:01:05.489> again<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.000> oh<00:01:06.180> yeah

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
switch flipped again and they oh yeah

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
switch flipped again and they oh yeah
this<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.200> how<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.619> play<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.430> got<00:01:08.580> out

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this is how we can play and we got out

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.920 
this is how we can play and we got out
to<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.330> lead<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> fourth

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to a little bit of a lead in the fourth

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
to a little bit of a lead in the fourth
and<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.979> gave<00:01:11.070> us<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:11.340> confidence

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
and I think it gave us some confidence

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
and I think it gave us some confidence
and<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.390> went<00:01:12.570> from<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> feeling<00:01:13.380> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and we went from kind of feeling a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
and we went from kind of feeling a
little<00:01:13.650> bit<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.790> about<00:01:14.820> ourselves

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
little bit kind of down about ourselves

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.630 
little bit kind of down about ourselves
from<00:01:15.570> two<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.960> three<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.520> right

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
from two and three into this all right

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.780 
from two and three into this all right
now<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.939> now<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.720> play<00:01:18.840> mode<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.640> hate

now we now we can play mode and you hate

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.789

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to have to play five ever with anyone

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310

points<00:01:47.000> where<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.180> kind<00:01:47.300> of<00:01:47.420> played<00:01:47.630> in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
points where we kind of played in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.930 
points where we kind of played in
anxious<00:01:48.229> mood<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:48.800> were<00:01:48.920> kind<00:01:49.160> of<00:01:49.220> film

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
anxious mood and we were kind of film

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.270 
anxious mood and we were kind of film
nervous<00:01:50.870> and<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.290> think<00:01:51.740> that's<00:01:51.890> where<00:01:52.010> we<00:01:52.130> got

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
nervous and I think that's where we got

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.960 
nervous and I think that's where we got
down<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.910> rut<00:01:53.150> and<00:01:53.330> uh<00:01:54.550> you<00:01:55.550> know<00:01:55.640> later<00:01:55.880> on

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
down that rut and uh you know later on

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.550 
down that rut and uh you know later on
the<00:01:56.090> fourth<00:01:56.330> pits<00:01:56.600> that<00:01:56.810> we<00:01:56.990> kind<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.260> pulled

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
the fourth pits that we kind of pulled

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.490 
the fourth pits that we kind of pulled
together<00:01:57.760> found<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.850> rhythm<00:01:59.030> as<00:01:59.300> one<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.140> its

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
together found a rhythm as one and its

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.859 
together found a rhythm as one and its
really<00:02:00.710> did<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.100> for<00:02:01.250> us<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.790> homework<00:02:02.330> how

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
really did it for us to homework how

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.440 
really did it for us to homework how
much<00:02:03.080> once<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.190> crosses<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:05.030> plane<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
much once it crosses the plane of the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.420 
much once it crosses the plane of the
net<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:05.810> anyone's<00:02:06.140> ball<00:02:06.380> once<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.010> gets<00:02:07.190> over

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
net it's anyone's ball once it gets over

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.150 
net it's anyone's ball once it gets over
there<00:02:07.750> if<00:02:08.750> our<00:02:08.990> player<00:02:09.259> makes<00:02:09.590> contact<00:02:10.009> with

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
there if our player makes contact with

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.770 
there if our player makes contact with
the<00:02:10.310> ball<00:02:10.459> while<00:02:10.729> they're<00:02:10.970> shedder<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.570> in<00:02:11.720> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the ball while they're shedder is in the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.620 
the ball while they're shedder is in the
process<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.320> sending<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.770> from<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.040> back<00:02:13.220> row

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
process of sending it from the back row

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.240 
process of sending it from the back row
he's<00:02:14.630> considered<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.230> back<00:02:15.410> row<00:02:15.620> attacker<00:02:15.980> at

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
he's considered a back row attacker at

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.790 
he's considered a back row attacker at
that<00:02:16.400> point<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:16.970> that's<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.300> call<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
that point and so that's the call and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.170 
that point and so that's the call and
and<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.950> thought<00:02:19.100> it<00:02:19.220> was<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.400> right<00:02:19.430> call<00:02:19.850> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
and I thought it was the right call you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.970 
and I thought it was the right call you
know<00:02:20.270> as<00:02:20.390> they<00:02:20.540> look<00:02:20.720> at<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> replay<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.440> I'll

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
know as they look at the replay and I'll

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.650 
know as they look at the replay and I'll
get<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> better<00:02:22.310> look<00:02:22.430> at<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.300> thought<00:02:23.570> it

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
get a better look at it but I thought it

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:36.280 
get a better look at it but I thought it
was<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.900> right<00:02:23.930> call<00:02:24.260> just<00:02:24.560> from<00:02:24.860> what<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.010> saw

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.349
