00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.390
 32 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.270
 good to everyone here to exhibit in your 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 revisions and I bring you the analysis of the 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.270
 Y 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.840
 as today I have it equipped with a with the 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 look at a laser and a silencer and with that I 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.890
 I think he spent more or less 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.600
 here we have here I am going to leave you the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.120
 gameplay of how this weapon works 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.000
 special of a huge cadence and if you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.980
 you put the bullet to put a little more 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.559
 of damage is put on almost everyone played 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.150
 at least some with the long barrel and the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.400
 truth is that quite but enough 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.350
 bestial has a pretty precision 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.780
 good the bad thing is that it sounds a lot 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.030
 the cadence as many of you will know since 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.790
 having so much cadence is very 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.220
 good more than it was then it is a very 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.470
 good he has but he usually goes 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.440
 enough with which if you start to 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.440
 point and you see that they kill you too much is 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.810
 because simply by shooting so much not 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.280
 give it to him even if you think that if you can 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.560
 believe that yes you are giving him but 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 better not dare to try always not to point 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.759
 to the head but always to the chest more 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.400
 that nothing because as there are more bodies more 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.110
 there is more possibility of giving 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.720
 I'm going to leave you a game here 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.450
 too long the truth is killing me three 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.950
 times or four I become a part of here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.950
 pretty good I usually get him out 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.980
 the plane is the one that passes that surpassed a 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.500
 couple of times and I'll put it in another 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:39.490
 video with him then what am I going to do 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.930
 but good the truth is when it is so 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.210
 far 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.180
 it's not that I do not have precision because if 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.570
 you shoot in small bursts is very very 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.160
 very good is that for me this weapon is 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.650
 che is also pretty but a 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.750
 montonazo 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.930
 not as much as others that I'm going to take 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.110
 but the truth is sitting there 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.880
 I stay still and you see should have 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 thrown in by them but I know why I 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.080
 I stayed there do not do that and more with that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.479
 Weapon to listen to me even if it is very close 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.300
 is that they are going to fall 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.580
 that are going to fall because this is bestial 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.500
 weapon 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.590
 great strengths weapon 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.410
 cadence as I said before the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.230
 stability if you put stability on me 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.050
 I would recommend the truth as it is 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.340
 pretty good but in the slow as I have 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.590
 said before it goes quite to itself 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.180
 you're going to need some stability 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.930
 at least when aiming so I 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.490
 I recommend laser sight and hilt 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.650
 for children as it has put me 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.030
 I usually put three accessories and bring 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.880
 look laser the hilt and the and the bullet 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.290
 to remove more that the dark hat 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.160
 it's like that 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.830
 It's great it 's like a bazooka 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.870
 except that 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.000
 you can take it instead of the pomegranates 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.950
 of light or things like that you can 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.510
 put there is bestial to land 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.880
 helicopter is the same as the bazooka happens 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.340
 to need only two with give it twice 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.070
 to compose the two already or for galley and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.660
 well I will not leave anything more or less 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.040
 it is a quick analysis of the gun 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.390
 but not very well rolled up that the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.760
 other videos may be too 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.860
 heavy and I hope you liked it and 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.860
