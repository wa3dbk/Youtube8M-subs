00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
digital zoom up to 72 times but I turned

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.680 
digital zoom up to 72 times but I turned
off<00:00:48.390> because<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.160> best

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
and I've got to save the audio is really

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.730 
and I've got to save the audio is really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
mode I can go over a program which is a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.050 
mode I can go over a program which is a
auto<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.430> aperture<00:01:23.880> priority

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
auto really I can do aperture priority

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.990 
auto really I can do aperture priority
shutter<00:01:24.570> priority<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.619> manual<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> get

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
shutter priority and manual so you get

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.399 
shutter priority and manual so you get
very<00:01:27.420> very<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.189> that's<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> say

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
very very lot of and that's going to say

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.170 
very very lot of and that's going to say
creativity<00:01:31.409> with<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.040> can<00:01:32.369> change<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
creativity with this you can change a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.700 
creativity with this you can change a
lot<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> things<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.810> recording<00:01:34.259> modes<00:01:34.470> it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
lot of things the recording modes it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.789 
lot of things the recording modes it's
got<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> said<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.430> PhD<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> motion<00:01:36.570> JPEG<00:01:36.900> quality

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
got I said a PhD a motion JPEG quality

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.969 
got I said a PhD a motion JPEG quality
you<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.240> exposure<00:01:39.780> mode<00:01:40.110> manual

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you can see that exposure mode manual

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.530 
you can see that exposure mode manual
aperture<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:42.000> change<00:01:42.240> ISO<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.549> have

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
aperture can change ISO and you can have

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.560 
aperture can change ISO and you can have
it<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.890> 400<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.060> lock<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> hour

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it on 400 you can you can lock the hour

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.440 
it on 400 you can you can lock the hour
so<00:01:49.020> limit<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.619> put<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.979> auto

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.870 

but<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.570> also<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.170> can<00:01:54.410> lock<00:01:54.860> it<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:55.430> not<00:01:55.670> go

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
but that also you can lock it to not go

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.580 
but that also you can lock it to not go
above<00:01:56.090> a<00:01:56.150> certain<00:01:56.420> ISO<00:01:56.930> which<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> really

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
above a certain ISO which is a really

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.020 
above a certain ISO which is a really
good<00:01:57.710> feature<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.520> don't<00:01:58.670> get<00:01:58.790> a<00:01:58.850> lot

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
good feature so you don't get a lot

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.460 
good feature so you don't get a lot
grade<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.810> can<00:01:59.930> change<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.260> white<00:02:00.440> balance

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470

digital<00:02:04.220> zoom<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.940> you<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.240> color<00:02:05.540> effects

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
digital zoom and you have color effects

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.530 
digital zoom and you have color effects
so<00:02:07.160> there's<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.610> lot<00:02:07.760> of<00:02:07.790> things<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.300> can<00:02:08.420> do

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
so there's a lot of things you can do

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.419 
so there's a lot of things you can do
with<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.750> thing<00:02:08.899> movie<00:02:09.200> Modi<00:02:09.410> sir<00:02:09.800> did<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
with this thing movie Modi sir did you

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.280 
with this thing movie Modi sir did you
lot<00:02:10.550> of<00:02:10.670> scope<00:02:10.820> to<00:02:10.970> be<00:02:11.090> creative<00:02:11.540> instead<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
lot of scope to be creative instead of

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.580 
lot of scope to be creative instead of
the<00:02:12.530> normal<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.280> filming<00:02:13.880> really<00:02:14.000> and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
the normal just filming really and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.380 
the normal just filming really and
another<00:02:15.590> thing<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.070> is<00:02:16.340> little<00:02:17.240> to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
another thing I like is little to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.740 
another thing I like is little to
aperture<00:02:17.660> priority<00:02:17.780> well<00:02:18.620> any<00:02:18.890> picture<00:02:19.280> mode

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
aperture priority well any picture mode

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.600 
aperture priority well any picture mode
the<00:02:20.750> aspect<00:02:21.200> ratio<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:22.100> choose<00:02:22.250> four<00:02:22.490> by

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
the aspect ratio you can choose four by

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.340 
the aspect ratio you can choose four by
three<00:02:22.640> which<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.450> aspect<00:02:23.600> ratio<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.140> most

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
three which is the aspect ratio of most

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.750 
three which is the aspect ratio of most
them<00:02:25.000> well<00:02:26.000> let's<00:02:26.209> say<00:02:27.250> pilot<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.370> shoe<00:02:28.550> or

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
them well let's say pilot and shoe or

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
them well let's say pilot and shoe or
bridge<00:02:29.030> cameras<00:02:29.420> or<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:30.020> can<00:02:30.140> choose<00:02:30.320> 3<00:02:30.620> by<00:02:30.770> 2

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
bridge cameras or you can choose 3 by 2

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.220 
bridge cameras or you can choose 3 by 2
which<00:02:31.550> is<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> aspect<00:02:32.180> ratio<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.810> digital

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
which is the aspect ratio of digital

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.949 
which is the aspect ratio of digital
SLRs<00:02:33.860> an<00:02:34.010> awful<00:02:34.910> also<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.270> can<00:02:35.390> choose<00:02:35.510> 60<00:02:35.840> by

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
SLRs an awful also you can choose 60 by

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.470 
SLRs an awful also you can choose 60 by
9<00:02:36.230> which<00:02:36.440> is<00:02:36.590> like<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.739> HD<00:02:37.280> resolution<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.120> choose

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
9 which is like a HD resolution I choose

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.300 
9 which is like a HD resolution I choose
to<00:02:38.630> do<00:02:38.750> 3<00:02:39.260> by<00:02:39.410> 2<00:02:39.470> because<00:02:39.860> I'm<00:02:39.950> used<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> working

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
to do 3 by 2 because I'm used to working

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.150 
to do 3 by 2 because I'm used to working
with<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.610> DSLRs<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.770> can<00:02:42.920> change

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
with the DSLRs and that you can change

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.900 
with the DSLRs and that you can change
so<00:02:43.400> much<00:02:43.459> thing<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.880> quality<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:45.080> quality<00:02:45.110> is

JPEG preview you can actually shooting

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.180 
JPEG preview you can actually shooting

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
recognition you can have a memory mode

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.590 
recognition you can have a memory mode
which<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.410> can<00:03:06.590> put<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.799> people's<00:03:07.600> people's

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
only thing I don't like about the camera

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.150 
only thing I don't like about the camera
now<00:03:27.230> I'm<00:03:27.380> being<00:03:27.560> very<00:03:27.799> very<00:03:28.100> critically<00:03:28.760> and

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
now I'm being very very critically and

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.440 
now I'm being very very critically and
there's<00:03:31.160> not<00:03:31.310> much<00:03:31.459> I<00:03:31.580> couldn't<00:03:31.760> find<00:03:32.030> but<00:03:32.390> I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
there's not much I couldn't find but I

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.660 
there's not much I couldn't find but I
don't<00:03:32.630> like<00:03:32.780> about<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.430> only

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
don't like about it but this is the only

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.470 
don't like about it but this is the only
thing<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.360> tripod<00:03:35.900> hole<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:37.360> when<00:03:38.360> you've

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
thing the tripod hole and when you've

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.000 
thing the tripod hole and when you've
got<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.660> tripod<00:03:38.840> mount<00:03:39.320> on<00:03:39.470> which<00:03:39.650> I<00:03:39.769> always

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
got the tripod mount on which I always

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.410 
got the tripod mount on which I always
like<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.280> leave<00:03:40.519> on<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:40.730> don't<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:41.120> removing

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
like to leave on I don't like removing

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.870 
like to leave on I don't like removing
and<00:03:41.660> reattaching<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.470> you<00:03:43.070> have<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.430> remove<00:03:43.700> it

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
and reattaching it you have to remove it

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
and reattaching it you have to remove it
to<00:03:44.540> get<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.680> battery<00:03:46.090> which<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.450> only

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
to get to the battery which is the only

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.840 
to get to the battery which is the only
downside<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> found<00:03:49.160> of<00:03:49.280> this<00:03:49.400> cover<00:03:49.610> really

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.630 
downside I found of this cover really
and<00:03:50.170> well<00:03:51.170> charge<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.709> battery<00:03:51.829> after<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.489> move

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
and well charge a battery after the move

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.020 
and well charge a battery after the move
the<00:03:52.760> tripod

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
the tripod

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.670 
the tripod
it's<00:03:54.210> about<00:03:54.330> 40<00:03:54.750> megabytes<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.290> internal

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
it's about 40 megabytes of internal

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.470 
it's about 40 megabytes of internal
memory<00:03:55.800> which<00:03:55.980> gets<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:56.520> nowhere<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.330> you're

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
memory which gets you nowhere so you're

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.380 
memory which gets you nowhere so you're
gonna<00:03:57.600> need<00:03:57.750> either<00:03:57.960> a<00:03:58.380> SD<00:03:59.370> or<00:03:59.550> SDHC<00:03:59.760> card

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
gonna need either a SD or SDHC card

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.440 
gonna need either a SD or SDHC card
which<00:04:00.540> fits<00:04:00.780> in<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.070> it<00:04:02.070> takes<00:04:02.430> up<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.820> about<00:04:02.970> 50

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
which fits in it it takes up to about 50

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.100 
which fits in it it takes up to about 50
megabytes<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.960> SDHC<00:04:04.710> I<00:04:04.740> believe<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.760> know

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
megabytes of SDHC I believe so you know

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.110 
megabytes of SDHC I believe so you know
there's<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.230> lot<00:04:07.470> of<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.760> know<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.880> lot<00:04:09.060> of

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
there's a lot of you know a lot of

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.910 
there's a lot of you know a lot of
memory<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:09.480> stick<00:04:09.690> in<00:04:09.840> there<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.650> come

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
memory you can stick in there and come

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.770 
memory you can stick in there and come
to<00:04:11.070> think<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.340> actually<00:04:11.490> put<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.330> movie<00:04:12.600> mode

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
to think it actually put on movie mode

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.920 
to think it actually put on movie mode
again<00:04:13.490> this<00:04:14.490> is<00:04:14.670> another<00:04:14.850> downfall<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
again this is another downfall of it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.060 
again this is another downfall of it
which<00:04:16.049> doesn't<00:04:16.290> affect<00:04:16.440> me<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.859> never

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
which doesn't affect me because I never

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.849 
which doesn't affect me because I never
record<00:04:17.549> more<00:04:17.790> than<00:04:17.820> 30<00:04:18.209> minutes<00:04:18.739> when<00:04:19.739> you're

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
record more than 30 minutes when you're

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.680 
record more than 30 minutes when you're
recording<00:04:20.160> movie<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.340> only<00:04:23.460> record<00:04:23.820> 29

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
recording movie you can only record 29

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.810 
recording movie you can only record 29
minutes<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.230> 59<00:04:25.830> seconds<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.460> believe<00:04:26.490> it's

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
minutes of 59 seconds I believe it's

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.140 
minutes of 59 seconds I believe it's
some<00:04:26.940> EU<00:04:27.210> law<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.990> link<00:04:28.620> that<00:04:28.740> erm<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.400> in<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
some EU law you link that erm and in the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.880 
some EU law you link that erm and in the
record<00:04:30.510> more<00:04:30.780> than<00:04:30.810> half<00:04:31.140> an<00:04:31.320> hour<00:04:31.410> it's

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
record more than half an hour it's

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.860 
record more than half an hour it's
actually<00:04:32.220> record<00:04:32.550> with<00:04:32.880> classes<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> camcorder

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
actually record with classes a camcorder

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.100 
actually record with classes a camcorder
and<00:04:34.470> there's<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.740> higher<00:04:34.890> tax<00:04:35.220> on<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:36.450> if<00:04:36.960> you

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
and there's a higher tax on it so if you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
and there's a higher tax on it so if you
shoot<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.710> be<00:04:38.040> aware<00:04:38.250> if<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.610> are<00:04:38.790> buying

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
shoot it just be aware if you are buying

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.190 
shoot it just be aware if you are buying
one<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.180> these<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.690> wanna<00:04:39.840> shoot<00:04:40.020> more

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
one of these and you wanna shoot more

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.080 
one of these and you wanna shoot more
than<00:04:40.230> half<00:04:40.500> an<00:04:40.650> hour<00:04:40.740> at<00:04:40.890> a<00:04:40.950> time<00:04:40.980> you<00:04:41.820> can't

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
than half an hour at a time you can't

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.690 
than half an hour at a time you can't
and<00:04:42.390> I<00:04:43.140> was<00:04:43.260> thinking<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:43.950> could<00:04:44.220> flash

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
and I was thinking if you could flash

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.110 
and I was thinking if you could flash
the<00:04:44.970> eff<00:04:45.210> set<00:04:45.600> 35<00:04:46.669> software<00:04:47.669> onto<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.030> because

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
the eff set 35 software onto it because

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.870 
the eff set 35 software onto it because
the<00:04:48.570> S<00:04:48.720> at<00:04:48.870> 35<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.650> episode<00:04:49.980> 38<00:04:50.580> are

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
the S at 35 and the episode 38 are

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.690 
the S at 35 and the episode 38 are
basically<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.330> same<00:04:51.390> camera<00:04:51.900> but<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.919> 38<00:04:53.430> bit

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
basically the same camera but the 38 bit

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.260 
basically the same camera but the 38 bit
European<00:04:54.270> model<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.470> 35<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.700> everywhere

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
European model and the 35 is everywhere

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.440 
European model and the 35 is everywhere
else<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:58.500> 35<00:04:59.010> doesn't<00:04:59.340> have<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.729> 30<00:05:00.120> minute

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
else the 35 doesn't have the 30 minute

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.990 
else the 35 doesn't have the 30 minute
restriction<00:05:00.950> so<00:05:01.950> I<00:05:01.979> was<00:05:02.100> looking<00:05:02.220> if<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.729> could

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
restriction so I was looking if I could

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000 
restriction so I was looking if I could
flash<00:05:03.960> memory<00:05:04.350> but<00:05:04.560> if<00:05:04.650> anyone<00:05:04.890> knows

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
flash memory but if anyone knows

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.590 
flash memory but if anyone knows
anything<00:05:05.130> about<00:05:05.520> this<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:05.910> know<00:05:06.000> drop<00:05:06.479> me<00:05:06.570> a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
anything about this you know drop me a

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.159 
anything about this you know drop me a
line<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:07.020> am<00:05:07.110> very<00:05:07.560> interested<00:05:08.870> so<00:05:09.870> basically

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
line I am very interested so basically

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.400 
line I am very interested so basically
that's<00:05:10.380> a<00:05:10.590> lot<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.640> know
