00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.730 

the<00:02:46.700> steering<00:02:47.150> wheel<00:02:47.300> on<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.540> 2015<00:02:48.230> Mustang

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
the steering wheel on the 2015 Mustang

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.520 
the steering wheel on the 2015 Mustang
is<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> bit<00:02:49.190> smaller<00:02:49.520> than<00:02:49.640> before<00:02:50.110> not<00:02:51.110> by<00:02:51.260> much

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
is a bit smaller than before not by much

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.980 
is a bit smaller than before not by much
but<00:02:51.830> with<00:02:52.580> hand<00:02:52.850> position<00:02:53.270> little<00:02:53.720> things

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
but with hand position little things

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.620 
but with hand position little things
mean<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> lot<00:02:54.700> what's<00:02:55.700> a<00:02:55.760> lot<00:02:55.940> more<00:02:56.120> important

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
mean a lot what's a lot more important

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.530 
mean a lot what's a lot more important
is<00:02:56.780> if<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.410> revised<00:02:57.710> front<00:02:58.190> suspension<00:02:58.820> tells

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
is if the revised front suspension tells

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.030 
is if the revised front suspension tells
me<00:02:59.630> more<00:02:59.780> about<00:02:59.840> where<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.230> front<00:03:00.530> wheels<00:03:00.740> are

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
me more about where the front wheels are

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.370 
me more about where the front wheels are
when<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> turn<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.420> steering<00:03:02.630> wheel<00:03:02.750> I<00:03:03.140> know

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
when I turn the steering wheel I know

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.200 
when I turn the steering wheel I know

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
realized that the front suspension

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.220 
realized that the front suspension
wouldn't<00:03:28.730> cut<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.660> they<00:03:29.780> changed<00:03:30.080> them

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
wouldn't cut it so they changed them

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.290 
wouldn't cut it so they changed them
both<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:31.430> result<00:03:31.880> is<00:03:32.420> confidence

piston units double the power of before

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.550 
piston units double the power of before
mean<00:03:42.940> I<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.270> break<00:03:43.510> late<00:03:43.810> into<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> corner<00:03:44.530> and
