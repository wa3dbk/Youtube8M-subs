readers both had to have a table that

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.970 
readers both had to have a table that
you<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> build<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> buildable<00:00:46.050> but

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you had to build it was a buildable but

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
you had to build it was a buildable but
in<00:00:47.160> mob<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.520> dead<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.850> didn't<00:00:48.090> see

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
in mob of the dead we didn't see

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.700 
in mob of the dead we didn't see
anything<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> do<00:00:49.140> with<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.500> nav

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
anything that had to do with the nav

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.639 
anything that had to do with the nav
cards<00:00:50.129> maybe<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.750> wasn't<00:00:52.230> made<00:00:52.379> yet

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
cards maybe because it wasn't made yet

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.819 
cards maybe because it wasn't made yet
it<00:00:52.860> wasn't<00:00:53.039> invented<00:00:53.399> by<00:00:53.610> 11<00:00:54.210> fernet<00:00:54.960> 935

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
it wasn't invented by 11 fernet 935

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.819 
it wasn't invented by 11 fernet 935
group<00:00:56.160> or<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:57.480> even<00:00:57.510> made<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.410> wasn't

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
group or if they even made it it wasn't

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.860 
group or if they even made it it wasn't
invented<00:00:59.100> yet<00:00:59.309> because<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.539> didn't<00:01:00.719> know

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
invented yet because if you didn't know

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.290 
invented yet because if you didn't know
it<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> 1930s<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.520> mob<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.239> dead

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it was in the 1930s of mob of the dead

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.990 
it was in the 1930s of mob of the dead
that's<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.989> period<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.010> took<00:01:05.159> place<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that's the period it took place in so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
that's the period it took place in so
maybe<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.080> wasn't<00:01:07.320> invented<00:01:07.770> yet<00:01:07.950> that's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
maybe it just wasn't invented yet that's

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.340 
maybe it just wasn't invented yet that's
why<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:08.640> didn't<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:08.970> introduce<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.630> but

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
why they didn't really introduce it but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.410 
why they didn't really introduce it but
if<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> play<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.860> multiplayer<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.880> mob<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
if you play on multiplayer on mob of the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.539 
if you play on multiplayer on mob of the
dead<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.229> could<00:01:13.409> clearly<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
dead you could clearly see you have the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.980 
dead you could clearly see you have the
nav<00:01:14.729> card<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.299> want<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> realize

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
nav card so they want you to realize

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.039 
nav card so they want you to realize
that<00:01:16.430> it's<00:01:17.430> still<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.240> still<00:01:18.540> present

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
that it's still there it's still present

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.820 
that it's still there it's still present
you<00:01:19.259> don't<00:01:19.740> forget<00:01:20.070> about<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> navcard<00:01:20.939> but

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
you don't forget about the navcard but

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.780 
you don't forget about the navcard but
we<00:01:22.830> haven't<00:01:23.009> seen<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.640> nap<00:01:23.939> card<00:01:24.210> table<00:01:24.630> reader
