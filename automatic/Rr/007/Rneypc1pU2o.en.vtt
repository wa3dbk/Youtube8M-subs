00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:04.210
 Hitachi Displays 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.569
 Developed independently by Pixtronix in the United States 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.340
 MEMS shutter type display 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.080
 Mass production prototypes using technology 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.550
 Reference exhibit at CEATEC JAPAN 2010 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.369
 This display is one by one 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.900
 MEMS shutter provided for each pixel 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.330
 Open and close at high speed and control the amount of light 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.490
 Adjust the brightness and darkness of the image 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.250
 The light from each LED backlight of red, green and blue 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.500
 Displayed by switching sequentially 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.080
 The main feature of this is low power consumption 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.900
 It can be realized 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.300
 The reason for that is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.100
 It is the present liquid crystal display 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.300
 The percentage of using light is 6% of light 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 The usage rate is around 8%, but if you use this method 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.550
 When 60% to 80% of light can be used 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.809
 It is a feature to say 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.649
 Smartphone and so on 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.630
 Mobile phone Mobile system low power consumption 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.709
 For products with very high needs 

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.660
 I want to apply 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.470
 This system is used for liquid crystal display 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.720
 No need for polarizing film or color filters 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.880
 The prototype we developed this time 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.770
 In comparison with liquid crystal display 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 While achieving low power consumption of less than half 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 Than liquid crystal display 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.149
 We reproduce vivid color 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.110
 The product being displayed this time is 2.5 inches 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.989
 QVGA size product 

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:40.020
 As a feature of this display 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.450
 Simultaneously with the display of high-speed color video 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 Image of ultra-low power consumption of monochrome 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.090
 There is a feature that can be done with the same display 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.489
 With fast color video demo 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.369
 Monochrome ultra low power consumption 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670
 I have two demos 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.000
 Color display such as newspaper 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.920
 When reading something you don't need 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.440
 Outside light inside the display without back light 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.810
 It is reflected and displayed in black and white 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.720
 Power consumption in this case is equivalent to electronic paper 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.500
 Also from the liquid crystal display 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 Because the response speed can be increased 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.760
 Works with excellent video display performance 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.800
 This performance is minus 20 degrees 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.080
 Maintained even in low temperature environment 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.350
 The mass-production technology developed this time is 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.550
 With existing liquid crystal display manufacturing process 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.340
 Highly compatible and can be manufactured on existing lines 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.440
 We want to aim for early mass production start
