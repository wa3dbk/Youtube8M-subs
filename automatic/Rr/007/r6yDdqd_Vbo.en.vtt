so<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:08.939> you're<00:01:09.060> shooting<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:09.990> go

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so when you're shooting you can go

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.010 
so when you're shooting you can go
quickly<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:11.010> horizontal<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.880> vertical<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
quickly from horizontal to vertical and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.770 
quickly from horizontal to vertical and
it's<00:01:13.799> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> fall<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:15.060> into<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.360> hand

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it's going to fall right into your hand

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.630 
it's going to fall right into your hand
and<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.799> great<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
and it's going to be great now one of

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.160 
and it's going to be great now one of
the<00:01:17.790> things<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> great<00:01:18.479> battery<00:01:18.840> grip<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
the things that a great battery grip is

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.420 
the things that a great battery grip is
always<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> have

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
always going to have it's going to have

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.520 
always going to have it's going to have
this<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.150> switch<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> reason<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
this on or off switch and the reason for

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.140 
this on or off switch and the reason for
that<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.490> leave<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that is if you leave that on all the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
that is if you leave that on all the
time<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.750> shooting<00:01:25.020> Vertica<00:01:25.830> are

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
time in your shooting Vertica are

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.590 
time in your shooting Vertica are
horizontally<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.700> sometimes<00:01:27.270> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
horizontally like this sometimes it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.780 
horizontally like this sometimes it's
easy<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.049> bump<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.590> switch<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> you'll<00:01:29.700> be

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
easy to bump that switch and you'll be

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.310 
easy to bump that switch and you'll be
taking<00:01:30.119> pictures<00:01:30.450> against<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:30.960> leg<00:01:31.140> or

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
taking pictures against your leg or

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
taking pictures against your leg or
something<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.640> can

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
something you don't want that so you can

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.700 
something you don't want that so you can
actually<00:01:32.970> turn<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.540> off<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.259> switches

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
actually turn this off so these switches

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
actually turn this off so these switches
aren't<00:01:35.100> functioning<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:36.150> you'll<00:01:36.479> be<00:01:36.570> able<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
aren't functioning or you'll be able to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.910 
aren't functioning or you'll be able to
turn<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> back<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> it'll<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.890> just

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
turn this back on and it'll be just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
turn this back on and it'll be just
great<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.450> both<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.020> these

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
great so that's what both of these

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
great so that's what both of these
flashpoint<00:01:40.650> battery<00:01:40.950> groups<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
flashpoint battery groups have the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.310 
flashpoint battery groups have the
ability<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.119> quickly<00:01:42.720> switch<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.290> camera

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
ability to quickly switch your camera

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
ability to quickly switch your camera
from<00:01:43.860> horizontal<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.000> vertical<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
from horizontal to vertical but the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.359 
from horizontal to vertical but the
other<00:01:46.079> thing<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.159> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
other thing that you can do with this is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.280 
other thing that you can do with this is
you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.820> really<00:01:48.119> extend<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.780> battery<00:01:48.930> life

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
you can really extend the battery life

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
you can really extend the battery life
of<00:01:49.439> your<00:01:49.470> camera<00:01:50.040> by<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.509> instead<00:01:51.840> of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
of your camera by actually instead of

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
of your camera by actually instead of
having<00:01:52.079> just<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.380> battery<00:01:52.799> well<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.520> can

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
having just one battery well you can

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700 
having just one battery well you can
actually<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:54.210> two<00:01:54.360> batteries<00:01:54.869> inside<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
actually put two batteries inside of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.380 
actually put two batteries inside of
your<00:01:55.920> battery<00:01:56.250> grip<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.030> you've<00:01:57.180> got

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
your battery grip and so you've got

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
your battery grip and so you've got
double<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.960> battery<00:01:58.259> life<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> other

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
double the battery life now the other

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.520 
double the battery life now the other
thing<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.880> backup<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.780> all<00:02:00.990> else<00:02:01.200> fails

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
thing just as a backup if all else fails

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.709 
thing just as a backup if all else fails
and<00:02:01.740> these<00:02:01.829> batteries<00:02:02.250> run<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.820> all<00:02:03.570> these

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
and these batteries run out all these

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
and these batteries run out all these
battery<00:02:04.049> grips<00:02:04.320> come<00:02:04.590> with<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> double<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
battery grips come with a double a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600 
battery grips come with a double a
battery<00:02:06.299> tray<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.459> will

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
battery tray like this and so that will

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.460 
battery tray like this and so that will
pop<00:02:08.819> right<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.569> so<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.289> these

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
pop right in there and so that if these

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.050 
pop right in there and so that if these
batteries<00:02:10.979> run<00:02:11.160> out<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.550> have<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
batteries run out and you just have to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.820 
batteries run out and you just have to
have

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
have

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.890 
have
you<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.580> use<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> double-a<00:02:14.180> battery<00:02:14.540> rack<00:02:14.720> like

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
you can use a double-a battery rack like

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.600 
you can use a double-a battery rack like
that<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.070> throw<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.430> in

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
that and then you can just throw this in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.520 
that and then you can just throw this in
there<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.820> you'll<00:02:17.660> be<00:02:17.780> off<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.110> running<00:02:18.170> in

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
there and you'll be off and running in

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.350 
there and you'll be off and running in
no<00:02:18.560> time<00:02:19.040> so<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.370> just<00:02:19.580> pops<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.240> there

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
no time so that just pops right in there

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.720 
no time so that just pops right in there
like<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:21.100> so<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.670> this

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
like that so you have that and this

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.150 
like that so you have that and this
locks<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:24.410> let<00:02:24.560> me<00:02:24.590> show<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.830> on<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
locks in and let me show you on the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.340 
locks in and let me show you on the
Nikon<00:02:25.550> how<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.790> can<00:02:26.090> put<00:02:26.360> this<00:02:26.450> together<00:02:26.660> it's

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
Nikon how you can put this together it's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.040 
Nikon how you can put this together it's
really<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.220> simple<00:02:28.630> so<00:02:29.630> let<00:02:29.750> me<00:02:29.840> show<00:02:30.020> you

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
really really simple so let me show you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.020 
really really simple so let me show you
so<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.620> battery<00:02:30.920> grip<00:02:31.100> itself<00:02:31.400> looks<00:02:31.700> or<00:02:31.850> like

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
so the battery grip itself looks or like

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.030 
so the battery grip itself looks or like
this<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.020> grip<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.650> then<00:02:33.800> there's<00:02:33.950> this

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
this it's the grip and then there's this

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.380 
this it's the grip and then there's this
little<00:02:34.190> tower<00:02:34.490> here<00:02:34.940> with<00:02:35.090> all<00:02:35.240> these

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
little tower here with all these

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.180 
little tower here with all these
connectors<00:02:35.990> on<00:02:36.200> it<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.500> that's<00:02:36.950> where<00:02:37.160> all

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
connectors on it and that's where all

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.970 
connectors on it and that's where all
the<00:02:37.370> controls<00:02:37.820> plug<00:02:38.660> into<00:02:38.840> your<00:02:39.080> camera<00:02:39.410> and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the controls plug into your camera and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.320 
the controls plug into your camera and
this<00:02:40.070> takes<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.460> place<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.730> where<00:02:41.210> the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
this takes the place of where the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.240 
this takes the place of where the
battery<00:02:41.660> would<00:02:41.870> normally<00:02:42.230> go<00:02:42.470> then<00:02:43.010> there's

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
battery would normally go then there's

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.010 
battery would normally go then there's
this<00:02:43.430> thread<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.060> mounts<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.600> tripod

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
this thread that mounts to the tripod

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.020 
this thread that mounts to the tripod
thread<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.770> that's<00:02:45.830> how<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.190> locks<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.790> to

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
thread and that's how it locks on to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.390 
thread and that's how it locks on to
your<00:02:47.180> camera<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.960> there's<00:02:48.470> still<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.770> tripod

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
your camera and there's still a tripod

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.490 
your camera and there's still a tripod
thread<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.940> bottom<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.230> can

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
thread on the bottom so that you can

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.410 
thread on the bottom so that you can
still<00:02:51.830> mount<00:02:51.980> your<00:02:52.160> camera<00:02:52.190> to<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> tripod<00:02:52.760> if

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
still mount your camera to a tripod if

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.750 
still mount your camera to a tripod if
you<00:02:53.540> need<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.930> so<00:02:54.590> it's<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.100> this<00:02:55.400> all<00:02:55.640> you

right<00:03:10.190> off<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.430> like<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:11.240> not<00:03:11.510> going

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
right off just like that it's not going

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.690 
right off just like that it's not going
to<00:03:11.810> break<00:03:12.050> it<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.740> just<00:03:12.920> allows<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.400> pop

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
to break it it just allows you to pop

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.730 
to break it it just allows you to pop
that<00:03:13.940> right<00:03:14.000> off<00:03:14.360> see<00:03:14.930> your<00:03:15.110> instruction

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
that right off see your instruction

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.380 
that right off see your instruction
manual<00:03:16.160> to<00:03:16.310> make<00:03:16.430> sure<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.760> know<00:03:16.850> how<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.090> do

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
manual to make sure you know how to do

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.480 
manual to make sure you know how to do
that<00:03:17.570> on<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.200> D<00:03:18.350> 90<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.010> sort<00:03:19.160> of<00:03:19.220> pull

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
that on the D 90 you just sort of pull

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.480 
that on the D 90 you just sort of pull
it<00:03:19.640> off<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:19.940> clips<00:03:20.660> once<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.890> then

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
it off and clips once you have that then

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.160 
it off and clips once you have that then
you<00:03:22.640> take<00:03:22.820> your<00:03:22.850> battery<00:03:23.209> grip<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.930> just

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
you take your battery grip and it just

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.810 
you take your battery grip and it just
slides<00:03:24.410> right<00:03:24.680> into<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.400> battery

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
slides right into that battery

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.730 
slides right into that battery
compartment<00:03:26.360> and<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:27.050> there's<00:03:27.290> this<00:03:27.410> big

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
compartment and then there's this big

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.980 
compartment and then there's this big
dial<00:03:28.100> right<00:03:28.340> here<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:29.209> allows<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.780> to

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
dial right here and that allows you to

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.250 
dial right here and that allows you to
screw<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:31.120> thread<00:03:32.120> right<00:03:32.420> into<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:32.959> bottom

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
screw that thread right into the bottom

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.490 
screw that thread right into the bottom
of<00:03:33.380> your<00:03:33.410> camera<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.190> now<00:03:34.670> these<00:03:34.850> are

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
of your camera and now these are

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.900 
of your camera and now these are
actually<00:03:36.500> screwed<00:03:37.010> together<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.670> there's<00:03:37.850> a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
actually screwed together so there's a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.510 
actually screwed together so there's a
really<00:03:38.300> really<00:03:38.330> tight<00:03:38.870> bond<00:03:39.440> there<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.010> then

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
really really tight bond there and then

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.580 
really really tight bond there and then
again<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:40.970> have<00:03:41.180> your<00:03:41.380> control<00:03:42.380> right<00:03:42.530> here

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
again you have your control right here

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.680 
again you have your control right here
control<00:03:43.280> right<00:03:43.400> here<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:44.270> when<00:03:44.360> you<00:03:44.450> flip

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
control right here and when you flip

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.330 
control right here and when you flip
again<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.170> have<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:45.350> right<00:03:45.709> there<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.130> same

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
again you have it right there the same

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.820 
again you have it right there the same
exact<00:03:46.700> thing<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.330> can<00:03:47.510> lock<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.650> you<00:03:48.709> can

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
exact thing you can lock this so you can

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.110 
exact thing you can lock this so you can
turn<00:03:48.950> these<00:03:49.100> on<00:03:49.580> and<00:03:49.730> off<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.060> is

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
turn these on and off and this is

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.670 
turn these on and off and this is
actually<00:03:50.540> recessed<00:03:51.020> which<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.320> really<00:03:51.560> nice

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
actually recessed which is really nice

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
actually recessed which is really nice
it's<00:03:51.890> going<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.070> make<00:03:52.190> sure<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.580> don't

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
it's going to make sure that you don't

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.970 
it's going to make sure that you don't
accidentally<00:03:53.600> fire<00:03:53.840> anything<00:03:54.290> and<00:03:54.500> then

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
accidentally fire anything and then

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.980 
accidentally fire anything and then
you've<00:03:55.100> got<00:03:55.280> your<00:03:55.459> controls<00:03:56.060> just<00:03:56.390> like<00:03:56.810> you

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
you've got your controls just like you

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.170 
you've got your controls just like you
do<00:03:57.140> on<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.560> horizontal<00:03:58.130> grip<00:03:58.310> right<00:03:58.790> there<00:03:59.030> on

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
do on the horizontal grip right there on

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.990 
do on the horizontal grip right there on
the<00:03:59.300> back<00:03:59.500> now<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.800> this<00:04:01.040> let<00:04:01.550> me<00:04:01.610> show<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.850> one

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
the back now on this let me show you one

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.490 
the back now on this let me show you one
more<00:04:02.030> time<00:04:02.270> what<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:02.810> have<00:04:02.990> here<00:04:03.200> is<00:04:03.320> you<00:04:03.470> have

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
more time what you have here is you have

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.350 
more time what you have here is you have
your<00:04:03.950> double-a<00:04:04.459> batteries<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.180> can

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
your double-a batteries that you can

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.050 
your double-a batteries that you can
throw<00:04:05.630> right<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:05.959> there<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.800> some<00:04:07.610> extended

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
throw right in there for some extended

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.610 
throw right in there for some extended
battery<00:04:08.420> life<00:04:08.450> so<00:04:09.080> you<00:04:09.140> can<00:04:09.230> either<00:04:09.350> throw

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
battery life so you can either throw

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.590 
battery life so you can either throw
that<00:04:09.800> in<00:04:09.980> there<00:04:10.190> or<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:11.000> can<00:04:11.120> put<00:04:11.300> in<00:04:11.450> a

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
that in there or you can put in a

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.240 
that in there or you can put in a
battery<00:04:11.750> now<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.200> cool<00:04:12.470> thing<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.860> if<00:04:13.130> you

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
battery now the cool thing is if you

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.790 
battery now the cool thing is if you
don't<00:04:13.430> have<00:04:13.550> two<00:04:14.150> batteries<00:04:14.420> this<00:04:15.170> will<00:04:15.500> work

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
don't have two batteries this will work

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.670 
don't have two batteries this will work
on<00:04:16.100> just<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.880> single<00:04:17.090> battery<00:04:17.630> as<00:04:17.810> long<00:04:18.320> as<00:04:18.500> you

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
on just a single battery as long as you

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.260 
on just a single battery as long as you
put<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.220> in<00:04:19.310> there<00:04:19.400> right<00:04:19.489> there<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.790> goes<00:04:19.820> just

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
put it in there right there it goes just

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.820 
put it in there right there it goes just
like<00:04:20.690> that<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:21.169> don't<00:04:21.200> have<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.530> have<00:04:21.620> two

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
like that so you don't have to have two

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.860 
like that so you don't have to have two
batteries<00:04:22.250> right<00:04:22.400> off<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:22.700> bat<00:04:22.910> you<00:04:23.419> can<00:04:23.450> run

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
batteries right off the bat you can run

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.180 
batteries right off the bat you can run
on<00:04:24.020> one<00:04:24.229> battery<00:04:24.590> you're<00:04:24.710> going<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.890> get<00:04:24.979> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
on one battery you're going to get the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.490 
on one battery you're going to get the
exact<00:04:25.370> same<00:04:25.640> battery<00:04:26.000> life<00:04:26.180> as<00:04:26.390> normal<00:04:27.020> with

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
exact same battery life as normal with

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.040 
exact same battery life as normal with
the<00:04:27.710> added<00:04:28.130> benefit<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.820> having<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.630> control

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
the added benefit of having the control

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.480 
the added benefit of having the control
surfaces<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.770> allow<00:04:30.980> you<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.190> go<00:04:31.340> from

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
surfaces that allow you to go from

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.970 
surfaces that allow you to go from
horizontal<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.390> vertical<00:04:32.420> and<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.680> can

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
horizontal to vertical and so you can

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.670 
horizontal to vertical and so you can
add<00:04:34.190> batteries<00:04:34.790> as<00:04:35.390> time<00:04:35.810> allows<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.350> as<00:04:36.440> your

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
add batteries as time allows and as your

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.710 
add batteries as time allows and as your
budget<00:04:36.860> allows<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.090> that's<00:04:38.360> what<00:04:38.690> a

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
budget allows and so that's what a

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.480 
budget allows and so that's what a
battery<00:04:39.140> grip<00:04:39.230> is<00:04:39.500> going<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.710> allow<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.220> do

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
battery grip is going to allow you to do

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.260
