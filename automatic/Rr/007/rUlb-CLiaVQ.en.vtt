 hereof Dortmund next to me by borussia 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.030
 david wagner our head coach stefan 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.700
 Citizen how to get the first word 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.620
 Gast as you can see after the 1 1 in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 dresden from well that I'm happy 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.440
 about the circumstance of the then in the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.940
 it is clear I passed 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.850
 But I am also satisfied with the performance 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.750
 from our boys at least 25 min 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.489
 we are very bad in the game 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.519
 come 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.250
 dresden had a lot of field advantages 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.840
 had also exerted pressure against this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.180
 phase also earns in leadership even though 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.659
 It's a standard as a clear one 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.700
 neglected allocation 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.110
 after these 25 minutes or 30 minutes 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 I do not know exactly how long it was 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 I think we are relatively good in too 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.600
 had gotten this game on 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:28.650
 today throughout the game 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.910
 many chances from 14 15 16 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.500
 where we always have one 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.290
 Kirsten has held 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.850
 So the ball versprungen since we were 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.280
 just not good 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 And in the end it is definitely one 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.050
 of course, because of the time 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.550
 happy point we bring but that 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.290
 match course according to mine 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.640
 eyes deserved to the first halftime 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 dresden the second to us and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.710
 accordingly you share here the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.800
 Points 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.650
 I am stressful and do everything well 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.690
 for the remaining season without end 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.720
 These fall this city has earned it 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.130
 rise 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.690
 a play back of the round then without 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.940
 but otherwise he should collect points 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.619
 what you can thank you 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 Many thanks for your words has trainer 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:21.210
 how does your conclusion after 1 1 in from 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.320
 The cabin would now be minutes long 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.680
 a pin falls to the ground 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.540
 It was so quiet and rightly so 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.550
 The disappointment is huge with us 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.200
 all 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:39.660
 about the renewed stroke of the neck we 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.460
 but had to plug one here 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.430
 Team seen around a team 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.910
 who played much better 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.390
 all the time those with passion 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.960
 has fought who has purely popped 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.940
 David said defensively well 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.470
 We have the rooms from the beginning 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.450
 to get well against lively 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.770
 dortmunder player that's not quite so 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.690
 easy but we got along well 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.450
 have you been the kid away from the gate 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.440
 kept and have our part but 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.180
 also one or the other possibility 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.300
 there was still going on 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.720
 and the end is known what the 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.170
 Total power I can only 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.180
 state that we said each other 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.100
 last clear and also right 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.690
 have picked up criticism for this game 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.400
 today no criticism deserves because the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.570
 player everything went out and yes 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.820
 unfortunately only one point is rewarded 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.260
 Thank you 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.630
 thank you very much for your statement 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.250
 Now how is time for your questions 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.519
 with the request for a short hand sign 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.239
 then the microphone comes to you who 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.239
 makes the beginning 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.050

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.370
