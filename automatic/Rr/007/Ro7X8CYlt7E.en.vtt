00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 uu 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.070
 and I'm going to show you a way to do 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.139
 movies very quickly and easily 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.500
 imagine that we want to include good 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 all these pictures the videos I think 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 that are a bit long we are going to see 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.660
 if this video is too long and not 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.660
 counts too much 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.510
 so we do right click remove and 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.510
 we have left 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.780
 with this last video 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.730
 imagine that we want only this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.410
 good part we right click 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.170
 divide 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.480
 then automatically that video will 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.850
 split in two at that position where 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.960
 we were then this second part 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 I also remove 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.690
 and a little bit of that video up there 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.410
 Right click to divide 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.300
 we select this remove well then 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.090
 we already have all the material we want 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.980
 that is part of our movie if 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.070
 they want what we can do is this 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.560
 video use it at the beginning then I do 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 click and I bring it up here then 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.800
 we have a video at the beginning all the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 photos in the middle and another video at the end 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.950
 now here you can see that it says 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.810
 car 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.530
 These are options to be able to do 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.960
 movies automatically and there are 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.760
 different themes to choose that is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 good to be tested also and 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.310
 choose which one you like best 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.130
 I'm going to choose this last one that that foot 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 I click and he says he has not yet 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.220
 added music you want to add music 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.909
 now good then we choose the song 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.180
 that I already had in the Cuba folder 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.060
 open we have the music the videos with 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.790
 this these triangles that indicate us 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.090
 that there are transitions from a photo or a 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.129
 video to the other and here the titles are going to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.280
 give play to see it with the bar 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.280
 spacer 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.850
 automatically applies certain 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.650
 features to this video that 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.830
 we can then modify by 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.580
 example here says Cuba if we double 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.680
 click we can modify this text 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.680
 then let's give it a larger size 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.870
 and we will choose 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.170
 another typography there we are and then at 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.930
 background 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.819
 we can add this data that does 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.819
 much more fun I put my name 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.950
 the interpreters 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.350
 if we do not want to put interpreters too 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.480
 right click remove and we pass 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.480
 directly to filmed in 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.560
 'cuba 2011 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.500
 then once we have already 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.790
 modified to check what we reproduce 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.790
 from here directly 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.420
 then we have a movie made 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:05.210
 in a super simple way we can go 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.210
 then here save movie 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.550
 and we have several options to export 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.930
 the first one is recommended for this 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:21.160
 project that keeps look keep 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.710
 640 by 480 which is the original size of 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.840
 the video files then that would be 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.270
 the ideal way to export it without losing 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.000
 quality then we could choose to make a 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.860
 high definition screen but as 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.720
 the original videos are not high 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.890
 definition is not worth being 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.920
 enlarging both the file to 1440 x 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.010
 1080 pixels if in fact the 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.980
 information does not exist in case 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.020
 we can record a dvd see from the 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.990
 windows live movie maker that this 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.300
 let's see in the last lesson 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.790
 and then for the team is the same as 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.280
 recommended for this project and for 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.930
 email is a small file 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.270
 320 x 240 pixels we will choose the 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.670
 in case you need to make a file 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.710
 very light good after we have more 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.870
 options not for phones and 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.410
 mobile devices in this case we're going 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.530
 to choose recommended for this project 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:23.860
 and we're going to save it right here in the 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.380
 desk in the cuba folder and the 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:30.120
 file is going to be called cuba windows 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.120
 half video we do save 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.780
 and start to save the movie well 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.720
 keep in mind that always keep a 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.330
 video file takes a while then 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.750
 in this case not because it is a short video 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.880
 of 1 minute 15 seconds but if they make a 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.740
 video a little bit longer good know 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.590
 that they will have a little time 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.780
 computer saving the file 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.760
 is over you can play the 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.550
 movie now or open the folder in the 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.660
 that we are going to open the folder and 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.660
 we double click 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.190
 they see that the video opens in the 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.560
 windows media player or 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.550
 we are playing the file of 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.600
 cuba video that we have generated 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.180
 independently of the de facto project 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.539
 I can close the project I keep the 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.539
 changes 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.860
 and keep watching the video 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:38.120
 then here in Cuba 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.230
 we can see all the material with which 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.140
 we made the movie 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.600
 the project and the windows media file 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:47.880
 video that is independent and that we can 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.670
 save in a pendrive or share to 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:54.230
 through internet photography courses 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:59.000
 and face-to-face and distance video 

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:59.000
