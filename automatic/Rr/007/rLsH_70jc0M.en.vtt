00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
controller I'm going to be using for

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.880

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
future gameplay I also did the liberty

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:14.830 
future gameplay I also did the liberty
of<00:00:58.920> switching<00:00:59.309> out<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.460> start<00:01:00.059> end<00:01:08.509> take<00:01:09.509> out

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.030 

looks<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.020> short<00:01:16.229> took<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.680> liberty<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
looks very short took out the liberty of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.910 
looks very short took out the liberty of
taking<00:01:17.399> out<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.940> screws<00:01:18.300> have<00:01:18.570> something<00:01:19.070> so

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
taking out the screws have something so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.650 
taking out the screws have something so

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.750 

yes<00:01:33.660> only<00:01:34.320> downside<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.100> putting<00:01:35.370> this<00:01:35.460> back

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
yes only downside of putting this back

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.370 
yes only downside of putting this back
on<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.480> going<00:01:36.660> to<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.870> little<00:01:37.200> bit

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
on this is going to be a little bit

00:01:37.380 --> 00:02:12.729 
on this is going to be a little bit
tricky<00:01:38.090> first<00:01:40.970> so

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:22.250 

so<00:02:14.989> need<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.019> put<00:02:16.349> that<00:02:16.560> on<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:21.140> little<00:02:22.140> bit

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so need to put that on a little bit

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.840

tricky<00:02:22.819> tricky

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:40.830 

nope<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:35.240> basically<00:02:35.450> just<00:02:37.090> tighten<00:02:39.610> these

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
nope you basically just tighten these

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:54.080 
nope you basically just tighten these
disgusting<00:02:41.840> looking<00:02:45.550> screws

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.180 

into<00:02:56.040> place<00:02:58.140> though<00:02:59.140> something<00:02:59.740> does<00:02:59.920> not

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
into place though something does not

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:25.289 
into place though something does not
seem<00:03:00.640> right<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:05.820> so

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
printing it out with like a stick like

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.130 
printing it out with like a stick like
I'm<00:05:58.780> sort<00:05:59.020> of<00:05:59.050> sticker<00:05:59.350> package<00:05:59.950> and

so<00:06:20.270> it<00:06:20.390> basically<00:06:20.570> fits<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.110> mold

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.140
