00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.099
 welcome back we are with this new video 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 today we are here as you can see on 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 black ops 2 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.510
 finally after a month or christ 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 even more about the role series are not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.820
 the live because why this gameplay 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 absurd I recorded it ten minutes ago 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 just got back to school and it really is e 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 then he is beautiful he is killed I do not have it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.579
 believed for me guys this is being 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 I made you 30 0 on small black 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 ops 2 which is a game of type I'm there 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 understanding recently is really I made a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.739
 30 0 and for me it counts a lot 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.920
 because I never made a score of 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.010
 usually am I going to do so 32 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 a few dead, but of 30 08 a 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.199
 botta microphone oh well 30 0 I never have 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.870
 stirred up because it is never absurd 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.640
 done anyway 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 rape breakfast that many like 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.840
 many people still care about this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.060
 series because in any case I noticed that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.780
 there are a lot of people asking me 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.759
 bobbettes also make uncut matches 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.909
 so I invented this series 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.159
 an excuse to do let's say non matches 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.770
