00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.900 

the<00:00:07.230> cylinder<00:00:07.620> has<00:00:07.740> been<00:00:08.420> or<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.590> crank<00:00:10.590> case

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
the cylinder has been or the crank case

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.200 
the cylinder has been or the crank case
has<00:00:11.910> been<00:00:14.210> reamed<00:00:15.210> out<00:00:15.389> here<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:15.990> here<00:00:17.119> and<00:00:18.119> it

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
has been reamed out here and here and it

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.150 
has been reamed out here and here and it
has<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.570> piston<00:00:18.930> on<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:22.560> also<00:00:22.830> been

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
has the piston on it it's also been

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.060 
has the piston on it it's also been
reamed<00:00:23.400> out<00:00:23.930> here<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:26.310> down<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:28.880> here<00:00:31.070> now

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
reamed out here and down in here now

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.290 
reamed out here and down in here now
I've<00:00:32.189> checked<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> piston<00:00:32.880> clearance<00:00:35.300> by

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
I've checked the piston clearance by

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.510 
I've checked the piston clearance by
moving<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:40.020> crankshaft<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
moving the crankshaft up and down in the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.470 
moving the crankshaft up and down in the
bore<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:44.250> piston<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> down<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
bore and the piston up and down in the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.100 
bore and the piston up and down in the
bore<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:46.520> have<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.450> clearance<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:51.110> so

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
bore I have very good clearance on it so

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.720 
bore I have very good clearance on it so
I<00:00:52.500> know<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.100> okay<00:00:53.399> there<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> crankshaft<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
I know I'm okay there the crankshaft and

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
I know I'm okay there the crankshaft and
the<00:00:56.730> crank<00:00:56.969> galleys<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.230> widened<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the crank galleys are all widened and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
the crank galleys are all widened and
they<00:00:59.940> work<00:01:00.149> perfect<00:01:00.660> for<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.910> this<00:01:02.910> fifty

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
they work perfect for this so this fifty

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.469 
they work perfect for this so this fifty
two<00:01:03.449> point<00:01:03.719> five<00:01:03.899> millimeter<00:01:04.439> crank<00:01:05.390> now<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
two point five millimeter crank now the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.410 
two point five millimeter crank now the
next<00:01:06.869> step<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.390> will

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
next step is what I will do is I will

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.880 
next step is what I will do is I will
put<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.990> cylinder<00:01:11.180> on<00:01:15.229> with<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> piston<00:01:16.740> in

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
put the cylinder on with the piston in

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.270 
put the cylinder on with the piston in
it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
it
the<00:01:18.210> Pistons<00:01:18.689> not<00:01:18.869> connected<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.439> it's<00:01:19.590> no<00:01:19.680> big

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the Pistons not connected so it's no big

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.399 
the Pistons not connected so it's no big
deal<00:01:22.369> then<00:01:23.369> I'll<00:01:23.460> check<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> deck<00:01:24.030> height

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
deal then I'll check the deck height

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.410 
deal then I'll check the deck height
this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> deck<00:01:25.979> height<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.119> deck

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this is a deck height this is the deck

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.859 
this is a deck height this is the deck
right<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.210> height<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> we

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
right here and it's this height that we

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.770 
right here and it's this height that we
measure<00:01:31.220> against<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.880> top<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> piston

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
measure against the top of the piston

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
measure against the top of the piston
and<00:01:33.960> I'll<00:01:34.380> tell<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.650> why<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.950> important

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and I'll tell you why that's important

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.730 
and I'll tell you why that's important
when<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> very<00:01:37.079> important<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
when I do it but it's very important the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.340 
when I do it but it's very important the
deck<00:01:38.040> height<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:39.290> the<00:01:40.290> right<00:01:41.180> depth<00:01:42.200> for<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
deck height be the right depth for the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
deck height be the right depth for the
squish<00:01:43.560> pad<00:01:43.799> area<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.119> cylinder<00:01:45.479> head

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
squish pad area on the cylinder head

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.639 
squish pad area on the cylinder head
that<00:01:45.990> goes<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.320> top<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.649> here<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that goes on top of here so that it is

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.020 
that goes on top of here so that it is
our<00:01:50.840> next<00:01:51.840> step<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.290> building<00:01:53.720> 120<00:01:54.720> CC<00:01:56.030> do
