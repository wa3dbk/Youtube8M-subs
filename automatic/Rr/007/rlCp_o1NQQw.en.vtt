00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
probably watch the game play really

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.640 
probably watch the game play really
carefully<00:04:55.300> because<00:04:55.480> I'm<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.380> sitting<00:04:56.590> in

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
carefully because I'm just sitting in

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.260 
carefully because I'm just sitting in
the<00:04:56.740> corner<00:04:56.919> and<00:04:57.010> boosting<00:04:57.400> off<00:04:57.490> of<00:04:57.640> him<00:04:57.760> so

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
the corner and boosting off of him so

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.970 
the corner and boosting off of him so
it's<00:04:58.570> kind<00:04:58.840> of<00:04:58.900> it's<00:04:59.050> good<00:04:59.290> what<00:04:59.740> I've<00:04:59.830> tried

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
it's kind of it's good what I've tried

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.430 
it's kind of it's good what I've tried
again<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.280> is<00:05:00.430> super<00:05:00.850> super<00:05:01.450> dumb<00:05:01.840> that<00:05:02.140> people

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
again it is super super dumb that people

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.810 
again it is super super dumb that people
actually<00:05:02.590> boost<00:05:03.010> for<00:05:03.220> nukes<00:05:03.460> in<00:05:03.580> my<00:05:03.669> eyes

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
actually boost for nukes in my eyes

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.730 
actually boost for nukes in my eyes
because<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.630> what<00:05:04.810> if<00:05:04.990> you<00:05:05.080> get<00:05:05.260> like<00:05:05.320> if<00:05:05.650> you

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
because so what if you get like if you

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.100 
because so what if you get like if you
can't<00:05:06.010> get<00:05:06.280> them<00:05:06.520> yourself<00:05:06.910> then<00:05:07.510> what's<00:05:07.720> the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
can't get them yourself then what's the

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.200 
can't get them yourself then what's the
point<00:05:08.350> that<00:05:08.710> don't<00:05:08.919> really<00:05:09.100> see<00:05:09.400> what<00:05:10.000> you<00:05:10.120> get

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
point that don't really see what you get

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.000 
point that don't really see what you get
like<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.390> fancy<00:05:10.690> emblem<00:05:11.200> and<00:05:11.290> a<00:05:11.410> title<00:05:11.650> if<00:05:11.890> you

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
like a fancy emblem and a title if you

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.620 
like a fancy emblem and a title if you
call<00:05:12.220> in<00:05:12.430> like<00:05:12.669> 10<00:05:12.940> of<00:05:12.970> them<00:05:13.090> like<00:05:13.450> I<00:05:13.570> don't

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
call in like 10 of them like I don't

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.930 
call in like 10 of them like I don't
don't<00:05:14.470> really<00:05:14.740> see<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.010> appeal<00:05:15.190> but<00:05:15.430> hey<00:05:15.610> some

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940
