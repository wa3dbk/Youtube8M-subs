got kind of knows which string you on

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.040 
got kind of knows which string you on
based<00:01:45.850> on<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.090> frequency<00:01:46.480> of<00:01:46.900> this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
based on the frequency of this

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.230 
based on the frequency of this
resonating<00:01:47.710> app<00:01:47.860> it's<00:01:48.490> telling<00:01:48.820> me<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:48.940> this

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
resonating app it's telling me that this

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.030 
resonating app it's telling me that this
particular<00:01:49.600> string<00:01:50.020> should<00:01:50.200> be<00:01:50.260> an<00:01:50.470> e<00:01:50.560> but

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
particular string should be an e but

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.240 
particular string should be an e but
it's<00:01:51.190> D<00:01:51.430> sharp<00:01:52.320> C<00:01:53.320> it's<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.650> right<00:01:53.830> hand<00:01:54.040> side

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
it's D sharp C it's the right hand side

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.620 
it's D sharp C it's the right hand side
which<00:01:54.400> means<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:54.730> shop<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.270> need<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.510> keep

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
which means it's shop so I need to keep

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.960 
which means it's shop so I need to keep
going

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
going

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.620 
going
till<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.660> get<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.080> e<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> many<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.300> but<00:02:00.480> at<00:02:00.540> me

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
till I get to e so many now but at me

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.020 
till I get to e so many now but at me
it's<00:02:00.870> still<00:02:01.080> flat<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.680> there<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.280> are<00:02:02.310> when

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's still flat and there we are when

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.610 
it's still flat and there we are when
you<00:02:03.120> see<00:02:03.300> the<00:02:03.420> green<00:02:03.690> light<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.320> top<00:02:04.500> which

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
you see the green light that top which

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.160 
you see the green light that top which
means<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.040> in<00:02:05.220> tune<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.400> the<00:02:08.610> same<00:02:09.170> for

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
means you in tune and I do the same for

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.140 
means you in tune and I do the same for
all<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.650> strings<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.790> let's<00:02:11.940> have<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
all of the strings so let's have a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.730 
all of the strings so let's have a
listen<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.630> sounds<00:02:13.200> we'll<00:02:13.440> try<00:02:13.710> it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
listen to the sounds we'll try it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.470 
listen to the sounds we'll try it
acoustically<00:02:14.520> first<00:02:14.760> I'll<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.150> preamp

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
acoustically first I'll have the preamp

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.880 
acoustically first I'll have the preamp
all<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> way<00:02:15.810> off<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.170> we'll<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:16.590> have<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
all the way off and we'll just have the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:32.490 
all the way off and we'll just have the
sound<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.850> mic

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.360 

okay<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.590> this<00:02:33.709> time<00:02:33.860> we'll<00:02:34.010> do<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.190> same

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
okay and this time we'll do the same

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:50.240 
okay and this time we'll do the same
again<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:34.849> just<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.180> preamp

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.170 

so<00:02:51.250> let's<00:02:51.400> check<00:02:51.580> out<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> sound<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
so let's check out the sound of the

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.910 
so let's check out the sound of the
contour<00:02:52.660> button<00:02:52.990> then<00:02:53.140> if<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.590> have<00:02:53.740> the

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
contour button then if you have the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
contour button then if you have the
button<00:02:54.130> out<00:02:54.310> which<00:02:54.460> we<00:02:54.610> just<00:02:54.790> did<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.240> get<00:02:55.360> a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
button out which we just did you get a

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.170 
button out which we just did you get a
very<00:02:55.570> natural<00:02:56.050> sound<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:57.370> no<00:02:57.400> eq

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
very natural sound with no eq

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.150 
very natural sound with no eq
modification<00:02:59.140> if<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.500> buttons<00:02:59.830> all<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.040> way

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
modification if the buttons all the way

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.280 
modification if the buttons all the way
in<00:03:00.460> then<00:03:01.210> what<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.600> end<00:03:01.630> up<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:01.960> is<00:03:02.260> a

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
in then what you end up with is a

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.990 
in then what you end up with is a
scooped<00:03:02.800> midsection<00:03:03.490> which<00:03:03.640> gives<00:03:03.850> you

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
scooped midsection which gives you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.540 
scooped midsection which gives you
emphasis<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> bass<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.290> treble<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.400> let's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
emphasis on the bass and treble so let's

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.860 
emphasis on the bass and treble so let's
have<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.730> listen<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.210> with<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> contour

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
have a listen to that with a contour

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.410 
have a listen to that with a contour
engaged

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420

you

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.770 

and<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.670> other<00:03:19.790> thing<00:03:20.030> that's<00:03:20.120> got<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.570> a<00:03:20.600> look

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
and the other thing that's got is a look

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.450 
and the other thing that's got is a look
at<00:03:20.870> phase<00:03:21.140> button<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.770> phase<00:03:21.980> button<00:03:22.280> is

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
at phase button the phase button is

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.970 
at phase button the phase button is
there<00:03:22.580> to<00:03:22.790> kind<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.060> emphasize<00:03:23.300> some<00:03:24.290> bottom

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980

end<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.460> also<00:03:26.210> to<00:03:26.270> cut<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.990> chance<00:03:27.830> of

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
end and also to cut the chance of

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.160 
end and also to cut the chance of
feedback<00:03:28.490> at<00:03:28.640> high<00:03:28.790> volume<00:03:29.210> so<00:03:29.510> let's<00:03:30.020> have<00:03:30.140> a

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
feedback at high volume so let's have a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:43.050 
feedback at high volume so let's have a
listen<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.860> it<00:03:30.980> engaged
