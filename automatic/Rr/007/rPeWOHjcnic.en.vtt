00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.710 

so<00:00:05.319> now<00:00:05.470> we<00:00:05.529> have<00:00:05.710> the<00:00:06.490> cross<00:00:06.759> with<00:00:07.599> the

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
so now we have the cross with the

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.470 
so now we have the cross with the
corresponding<00:00:07.960> edges<00:00:08.440> or<00:00:08.920> in<00:00:09.280> position<00:00:09.790> the

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
corresponding edges or in position the

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.690 
corresponding edges or in position the
next<00:00:10.750> part<00:00:10.959> is<00:00:11.200> to<00:00:11.650> fill<00:00:11.920> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.690> top<00:00:14.700> corners

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
next part is to fill in the top corners

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.659 
next part is to fill in the top corners
of<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.480> white<00:00:16.689> piece<00:00:17.099> for<00:00:18.099> example<00:00:18.460> let<00:00:18.580> me

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:18.669 
of the white piece for example let me

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.599 
of the white piece for example let me
just<00:00:18.820> phone<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.000> you<00:00:19.480> can<00:00:19.660> see<00:00:19.810> what<00:00:19.930> I<00:00:19.990> mean

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
just phone and you can see what I mean

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.660 
just phone and you can see what I mean
so<00:00:21.609> that<00:00:21.789> we<00:00:21.880> have<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.330> pink<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.949> pink<00:00:24.189> green

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
so that we have the pink to pink green

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.470 
so that we have the pink to pink green
to<00:00:24.820> green<00:00:24.939> with<00:00:25.330> a<00:00:25.359> white<00:00:25.570> piece<00:00:25.750> on<00:00:25.900> top<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
to green with a white piece on top the

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.049 
to green with a white piece on top the
last<00:00:28.720> one<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.199> didn't<00:00:30.099> really<00:00:30.220> talk<00:00:30.550> about

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.390 

algorithms<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:35.110> which<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.440> basically<00:00:36.100> like

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
algorithms much which is basically like

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.049 
algorithms much which is basically like
the<00:00:37.090> Rubik's<00:00:37.600> Cube<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.219> like<00:00:42.399> language

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
the Rubik's Cube kind of like language

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.250 
the Rubik's Cube kind of like language
for<00:00:43.930> turning<00:00:44.469> different<00:00:44.860> phases<00:00:45.399> so<00:00:46.260> quick

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
for turning different phases so quick

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.900 
for turning different phases so quick
example<00:00:47.770> this<00:00:48.239> upper<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.550> if<00:00:51.670> it's<00:00:51.820> a

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
example this upper is you so if it's a

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.020 
example this upper is you so if it's a
you<00:00:52.180> then<00:00:52.690> you<00:00:52.809> turn<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.079> upper<00:00:53.379> face

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you then you turn the upper face

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.360 
you then you turn the upper face
pretending<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.210> like<00:00:55.300> a<00:00:55.329> clock<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.920> 12v

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
pretending it's like a clock this is 12v

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.610 
pretending it's like a clock this is 12v
and<00:00:57.609> one<00:00:57.820> two<00:00:58.090> three<00:00:58.359> so<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:58.870> turn<00:00:59.140> it<00:00:59.289> 90

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
and one two three so you turn it 90

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.639 
and one two three so you turn it 90
degrees<00:00:59.649> clockwise<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:01.149> way<00:01:01.359> if<00:01:02.230> it's<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.620> I

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
degrees clockwise this way if it's you I

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.310 
degrees clockwise this way if it's you I
you<00:01:03.489> turn<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.760> any<00:01:03.910> clockwise<00:01:04.360> 90<00:01:04.629> degrees<00:01:04.960> so

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
you turn the any clockwise 90 degrees so

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.249 
you turn the any clockwise 90 degrees so
here<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.800> you<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.479> our<00:01:10.750> for

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
here so that's you you I this is our for

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.949 
here so that's you you I this is our for
the<00:01:11.349> right<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.090> imagine<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.569> like<00:01:13.690> a<00:01:13.720> clock

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:13.959 
the right so imagine you like a clock

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:16.230 
the right so imagine you like a clock
again<00:01:14.259> our<00:01:14.560> would<00:01:14.979> be<00:01:15.160> following<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.060> clock

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
again our would be following the clock

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.919 
again our would be following the clock
round<00:01:16.390> up<00:01:16.800> 90<00:01:17.800> degrees<00:01:18.099> clockwise<00:01:18.399> and<00:01:19.149> then

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
round up 90 degrees clockwise and then

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.230 
round up 90 degrees clockwise and then
our<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.349> would<00:01:21.009> be<00:01:21.190> anti-clockwise<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.700> then

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
our I would be anti-clockwise so then

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.830 
our I would be anti-clockwise so then
this<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.569> F<00:01:25.810> for<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.740> front<00:01:27.039> face<00:01:27.660> again<00:01:28.660> like

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
this is F for the front face again like

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.690 
this is F for the front face again like
a<00:01:28.899> clock<00:01:29.759> clockwise<00:01:31.110> fi<00:01:32.110> money<00:01:32.709> clockwise<00:01:33.130> so

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
a clock clockwise fi money clockwise so

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.059 
a clock clockwise fi money clockwise so
f<00:01:34.000> fi<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:37.050> basically<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.349> same<00:01:38.619> for<00:01:38.860> all<00:01:38.920> of

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
f fi and basically the same for all of

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:41.790 
f fi and basically the same for all of
them<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.459> down<00:01:40.200> imagine<00:01:41.200> turned<00:01:41.380> up<00:01:41.560> like<00:01:41.649> this

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
them so down imagine turned up like this

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.010 
them so down imagine turned up like this
and<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:42.130> was<00:01:42.310> down<00:01:42.599> clockwise<00:01:43.599> will<00:01:43.780> be<00:01:43.869> this

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
and this was down clockwise will be this

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.440 
and this was down clockwise will be this
way<00:01:44.229> honey<00:01:44.500> clockwise<00:01:44.979> would<00:01:45.190> be<00:01:45.310> this<00:01:45.429> way<00:01:45.640> so

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
way honey clockwise would be this way so

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.820 
way honey clockwise would be this way so
f<00:01:46.890> mean<00:01:47.890> down<00:01:48.989> di

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.070 

and<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.090> whale<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.870> it<00:01:55.050> was<00:01:55.830> with<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
and so the whale and to do it was with a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.900 
and so the whale and to do it was with a
short<00:01:59.000> algorithm<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> move<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.700> top

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
short algorithm just to move the top

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.770 
short algorithm just to move the top
corner<00:02:03.090> around<00:02:03.710> so<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.150> we<00:02:06.150> find<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
corner around so what we do is we find a

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.350 
corner around so what we do is we find a
piece<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.440> bottom<00:02:07.740> rule<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> white

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
piece in the bottom rule that is a white

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
piece in the bottom rule that is a white
piece<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.869> needs<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.260> top<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.649> here<00:02:10.830> we

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
piece that needs to be on top so here we

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.560 
piece that needs to be on top so here we
have<00:02:10.950> white<00:02:11.930> blue<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.140> red<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:15.300> have<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
have white blue and red so we have to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.570 
have white blue and red so we have to
find<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.080> blue<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.470> red<00:02:16.650> corner<00:02:17.190> which<00:02:17.370> is

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
find the blue and red corner which is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.860 
find the blue and red corner which is
blue<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.390> red<00:02:19.200> yeah<00:02:20.100> blue<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:20.970> red<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.720> we

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
blue and red yeah blue and red so we

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.560 
blue and red yeah blue and red so we
turn<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.380> piece<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> bottom<00:02:23.340> layer<00:02:23.570> till

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
turn that piece in the bottom layer till

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.670 
turn that piece in the bottom layer till
it's<00:02:24.750> under<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.560> blue<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.400> red<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:28.200> do

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
it's under the blue and red and we do

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:38.170 
it's under the blue and red and we do

ri di D and the pieces in I know it
seems<00:03:06.040> long<00:03:06.370> winded<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.840> gets<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.110> piece

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
seems long winded but it gets the piece

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.510 
seems long winded but it gets the piece
in<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.890> once<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.000> get<00:03:10.210> more<00:03:11.400> once<00:03:12.400> you

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
in there and once you get more once you

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.340 
in there and once you get more once you
do<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.880> more<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.150> more<00:03:13.420> you'll<00:03:13.780> notice<00:03:14.020> the

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
do it more and more you'll notice the

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.460 
do it more and more you'll notice the
patterns<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:15.040> where<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.310> piece<00:03:15.490> needs<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.000> be

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
patterns and where the piece needs to be

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.400 
patterns and where the piece needs to be
to<00:03:17.470> be<00:03:17.830> next<00:03:18.490> in<00:03:18.610> line<00:03:18.640> for<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.960> go<00:03:20.110> into

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
to be next in line for the to go into

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.560 
to be next in line for the to go into
that<00:03:20.560> So<00:03:20.860> You<00:03:20.920> Sean<00:03:21.550> it<00:03:21.730> down<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.410> next<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.570> this

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
that So You Sean it down so next is this

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.300 
that So You Sean it down so next is this
piece<00:03:25.810> now<00:03:26.230> it's<00:03:26.410> already<00:03:26.710> in<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.920> top<00:03:27.100> corner

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
piece now it's already in the top corner

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.700 
piece now it's already in the top corner
but<00:03:27.730> it's<00:03:27.850> in<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.060> wrong<00:03:28.210> way<00:03:28.360> around<00:03:28.620> see<00:03:29.620> it

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
but it's in the wrong way around see it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.950 
but it's in the wrong way around see it
needs<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.920> be<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.220> flip<00:03:30.520> around<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.720> we<00:03:31.840> do

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
needs to be like flip around so we do

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.930 
needs to be like flip around so we do
the<00:03:32.080> same<00:03:32.260> thing<00:03:32.500> all<00:03:33.100> right<00:03:33.430> di<00:03:34.330> r<00:03:35.190> d<00:03:36.190> RI<00:03:37.050> da<00:03:38.050> r

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
the same thing all right di r d RI da r

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.000 
the same thing all right di r d RI da r
d<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.240> there's<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.140> next<00:03:41.380> corner<00:03:41.590> piece<00:03:41.800> in

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
d and there's the next corner piece in

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.600 
d and there's the next corner piece in
position<00:03:42.960> so<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.590> next<00:03:44.770> one<00:03:44.890> is<00:03:45.160> one<00:03:45.460> we've

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
position so the next one is one we've

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.310 
position so the next one is one we've
got<00:03:45.700> left<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.210> blue<00:03:47.250> white<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.430> pink<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.360> we

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
got left this blue white and pink so we

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.520 
got left this blue white and pink so we
find<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.710> blue<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.130> pink<00:03:51.310> corner<00:03:52.320> turn<00:03:53.320> the

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
find the blue and pink corner turn the

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.320 
find the blue and pink corner turn the
piece<00:03:53.740> round<00:03:54.070> this<00:03:54.430> way<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:54.970> then<00:03:55.780> form<00:03:56.080> ri<00:03:56.380> di

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
piece round this way and then form ri di

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.990 
piece round this way and then form ri di
r<00:03:58.800> d<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.100> then<00:04:00.790> we've<00:04:00.970> got<00:04:01.000> our<00:04:01.240> top<00:04:01.830> layer

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
r d and then we've got our top layer

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000 
r d and then we've got our top layer
solved
