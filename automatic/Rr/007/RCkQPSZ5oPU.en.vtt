00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.539
 the balcony or the terrace of a 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.520
 apartment can constitute a 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.800
 excellent alternative space to 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.529
 garden where you can express the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.539
 own passion for gardening for 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.730
 the cultivation of plants on the terrace 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.250
 we must however take into account the 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.420
 structural and environmental characteristics 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.420
 of the available space 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.720
 first of all we must evaluate 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.180
 good sun exposure 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.730
 lighting is essential because the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.530
 plants develop best in species 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.030
 an entirely artificial eco system 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.030
 like a terrace 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.940
 therefore the ideal guidelines are ad 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.540
 east and south east to enjoy the sun 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.520
 morning and west and south west for 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.590
 that of the afternoon 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.660
 in both cases the sun is avoided 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.940
 violent at noon at which 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.850
 however it can be remedied with pergolas or 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.410
 curtains also pay attention to 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.410
 shadows brought from other buildings 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.040
 another factor to take into account is the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.950
 wind that can cause the bend or the wind 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.030
 uprooting of plants and stems for 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.760
 avoid the problem 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.640
 you can use artificial screens 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.580
 such as glass walls or natural shelters 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.100
 as the hedges also pay attention 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.800
 within reach of the balcony or terrace 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.560
 taking care to place the vases more 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.960
 heavy on load-bearing structures e 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.119
 using containers and material for 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.119
 soil as light as possible 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.869
 finally check the waterproofing 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.750
 of the floor 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.170
 if carried out in a workmanlike manner should 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 be made up of overlapping layers 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.370
 composed of a plastic material 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.739
 waterproof polystyrene on which one is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.540
 will then cement the lay the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.540
 flooring is real 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.020
 as for the choice of plants you must 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.330
 take into account a number of factors i 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.760
 trees focal points of your garden 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.460
 on the terrace they will need 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.830
 large containers for it 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.670
 development of the root system i 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.380
 evergreens such as olive trees and conifers 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.710
 they are a safe choice for them 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.410
 at least apparent immutability 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.570
 deciduous instead like torn or 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.790
 ornamental cherry will change 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.900
 pleasantly the appearance of the terrace 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.900
 month after month 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.470
 on the terrace you can also place 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.360
 dwarf varieties of fruit trees that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.239
 they reach a maximum of two meters of 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.760
 height needing only one 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.110
 good exposure and a generous one 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.880
 fertilizing by choosing a shrub 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.430
 enhance the leaf component and the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.410
 blooms with which to calculate i 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.790
 different times will be excellent 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.790
 decorative effects 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.980
 on the terrace they can be cultivated 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.540
 even the roses of the smaller varieties 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.459
 between 20 and 70 cm of development but le 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.219
 the most suitable plants are climbing plants 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.799
 for their ability to develop 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.750
 upwards and also decorate the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.049
 structures around which one 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.599
 they wrap used in this too 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.120
 case variety from content development 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:03.420
 for not having to perform repottings or 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.319
 drastic pruning a final hint 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.819
 bulbous plants deserve the herbaceous plants 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.189
 very suitable for their size and the 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.739
 ornamental qualities to refine the details 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.739
 of our terrace garden
