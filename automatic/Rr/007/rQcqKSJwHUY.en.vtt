even planning on playing that one I have
to<00:00:30.240> admit<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:30.900> expecting<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.619> find

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to admit what it was expecting to find

to admit what it was expecting to find
with<00:00:32.099> cities<00:00:32.340> XXL<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.180> something<00:00:33.570> analogous

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
with cities XXL is something analogous

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.010 
with cities XXL is something analogous
to<00:00:34.200> simcity<00:00:34.950> back<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> day<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.540> found

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to simcity back in the day what I found

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
to simcity back in the day what I found
was<00:00:37.320> something<00:00:37.800> I'd<00:00:38.129> probably<00:00:38.489> rather<00:00:38.940> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
was something I'd probably rather be

was something I'd probably rather be
playing<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:39.750> phone<00:00:39.989> when<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.800> start<00:00:41.129> it

what your first confronted with is the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200 
what your first confronted with is the
fact<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.070> game<00:00:44.250> doesn't<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> step

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
fact that the game doesn't have a step

fact that the game doesn't have a step
by<00:00:45.360> step<00:00:45.629> as<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.260> tutorial<00:00:46.920> explaining

things as you come across them instead

things as you come across them instead
what<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> has<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> game<00:00:52.920> text

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
tutorial that explains things to you

tutorial that explains things to you
pretty<00:00:56.250> well<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:56.760> none<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.960> voiced<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
pretty well but none of it is voiced the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.770 
pretty well but none of it is voiced the
banter<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> between<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.030> characters<00:01:00.210> just

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
banter in between the characters just

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
banter in between the characters just
gets<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.309> tutorial<00:01:02.910> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
gets in the way because the tutorial is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
gets in the way because the tutorial is
pretty<00:01:03.239> lengthy<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.899> none<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.470> do

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pretty lengthy and none of what you do

pretty lengthy and none of what you do

through<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> actual<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:07.640> however<00:01:08.640> it

through to the actual game however it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you ever stuck on something and once

you ever stuck on something and once
you're<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> game<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.010> intuitive

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you're actually in the game is intuitive

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.760 
you're actually in the game is intuitive
enough<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.509> most<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
enough that you can most of the time to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.899 
enough that you can most of the time to
figure<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.159> what<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.460> doing<00:01:17.490> just<00:01:17.759> by

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
figure out what you're doing just by

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.760 
figure out what you're doing just by
screwing<00:01:18.240> around<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> while<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.500> actual

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
screwing around for a while the actual

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
screwing around for a while the actual
mechanics<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.580> pretty<00:01:20.909> simple<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.450> most<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
mechanics are pretty simple as most of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
mechanics are pretty simple as most of
it<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> balancing<00:01:22.560> act<00:01:22.710> between<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.430> thing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it as a balancing act between one thing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.789 
it as a balancing act between one thing
or<00:01:23.790> another<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.140> put<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.470> retail

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
or another like if you put in a retail

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
or another like if you put in a retail
store<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:26.970> suffer<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.720> doesn't

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
store here it will suffer if it doesn't

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.510 
store here it will suffer if it doesn't
have<00:01:28.080> enough<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.799> shop<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
have enough people to come shop at it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340 
have enough people to come shop at it
and<00:01:29.670> it'll<00:01:30.000> also<00:01:30.240> suffer<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> doesn't<00:01:31.259> have

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and it'll also suffer if it doesn't have

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
and it'll also suffer if it doesn't have
enough<00:01:31.619> people<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> work<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
enough people to work at it and the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.230 
enough people to work at it and the
types<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> people<00:01:34.650> available<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> work<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.060> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
types of people available to work at it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.850 
types of people available to work at it
also<00:01:36.689> makes<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.990> difference<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> brings

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
also makes a difference and that brings

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.440 
also makes a difference and that brings
me<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.189> something<00:01:38.220> else<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
me to something else I don't like is the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
me to something else I don't like is the
fact<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> game<00:01:40.290> has<00:01:40.530> classes<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.369> people

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
fact that the game has classes of people

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840 
fact that the game has classes of people
in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.210> game<00:01:42.439> like<00:01:43.439> there's<00:01:44.070> unskilled

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
in the game like there's unskilled

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.840 
in the game like there's unskilled
skilled<00:01:45.500> executives<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.710> delete<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.430> don't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
skilled executives and delete I don't

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.460 
skilled executives and delete I don't
know<00:01:47.909> why<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> bothers<00:01:48.570> me<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> does<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
know why the bothers me but it does and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
know why the bothers me but it does and
when<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> zone<00:01:50.369> housing<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.240> these

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
when you zone housing for these

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.969 
when you zone housing for these
different<00:01:51.869> types<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.229> people<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.770> really

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
different types of people you can really

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
different types of people you can really
see<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> difference<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> houses<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.409> are

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
see a difference in the houses that are

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.230 
see a difference in the houses that are
available<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:56.159> them<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:56.969> neither

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
available for them but that's neither

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.789 
available for them but that's neither
here<00:01:57.360> nor<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.049> mentioned<00:01:58.469> before<00:01:58.530> that

this<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> game<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.759> could<00:02:00.000> probably<00:02:00.329> see

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
this is a game that I could probably see

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.149 
this is a game that I could probably see
myself<00:02:00.840> playing<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.409> phone<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.920> that's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
myself playing on my phone and that's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
myself playing on my phone and that's
actually<00:02:02.399> for<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> couple<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.119> reasons<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
actually for a couple of reasons the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.359 
actually for a couple of reasons the
first<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.259> being<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> graphics<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
what it looks like it's always done

off it's um well this is it this is
about<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.120> good<00:02:18.239> as<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.900> I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
about as good as it's going to get I

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.869 
about as good as it's going to get I
mean<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:19.650> phone<00:02:19.920> could<00:02:20.160> probably<00:02:20.340> handle<00:02:20.610> this

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
mean my phone could probably handle this

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.420

actually do anything you have to click

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.350 
actually do anything you have to click
on<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.769> game<00:02:34.950> icon<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.549> upper<00:02:35.640> left<00:02:36.120> and

on the game icon on the upper left and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.809 
on the game icon on the upper left and
then<00:02:36.599> choose<00:02:36.959> quit<00:02:37.440> from<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.099> drop-down<00:02:38.340> menu

then choose quit from the drop-down menu
and<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.720> weird<00:02:40.019> for<00:02:40.110> pc<00:02:40.590> games<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:41.069> but

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
and that is weird for pc games to do but

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.789 
and that is weird for pc games to do but
it's<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:41.819> too<00:02:42.030> off-putting<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.470> do<00:02:43.650> get

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
it's not too off-putting and you do get

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.680 
it's not too off-putting and you do get
to<00:02:43.920> hang<00:02:44.040> over<00:02:44.220> pretty<00:02:44.430> quick<00:02:44.700> for<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.420> actual

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
to hang over pretty quick for the actual

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.539 
to hang over pretty quick for the actual
meat<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> game<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.739> mainly<00:02:47.190> that

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
meat of the game it's mainly that

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.670 
meat of the game it's mainly that
balance<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.150> talked<00:02:48.390> about<00:02:48.660> before<00:02:48.840> making

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
balance I talked about before making

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
equilibrium is pretty easy to keep and

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.350 
equilibrium is pretty easy to keep and
it<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.410> enough<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.769> be<00:03:07.860> engaging<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.849> just

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
it is enough to be engaging but just

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.660 
it is enough to be engaging but just
enough<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:10.530> after<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.950> while<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.220> playing

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
enough like after a while of playing

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.059 
enough like after a while of playing
this<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.269> start<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.110> wonder<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.860> all

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
this you start to wonder is this all

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.000

there<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.510> I've<00:03:15.510> done<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.049> before<00:03:16.470> do<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.890> just

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
there is I've done this before do I just
