Polaroid<00:00:10.950> makes<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.580> looks<00:00:11.730> just<00:00:12.030> like

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
Polaroid makes one that looks just like

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.509 
Polaroid makes one that looks just like
this<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.840> it's<00:00:13.290> more<00:00:13.530> expensive<00:00:14.130> so<00:00:14.309> I'm

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
this and it's more expensive so I'm

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.829 
this and it's more expensive so I'm
pretty<00:00:14.700> sure<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.059> same<00:00:15.269> thing<00:00:15.599> but

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
pretty sure it's the same thing but

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
pretty sure it's the same thing but
that's<00:00:16.590> something<00:00:16.920> you're<00:00:17.010> gonna<00:00:17.130> have<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
that's something you're gonna have to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880 
that's something you're gonna have to
find<00:00:17.670> out<00:00:17.850> yourself<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.590> take

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
find out yourself so that you can take

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.820 
find out yourself so that you can take
this<00:00:20.100> off<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:21.300> you're<00:00:22.109> filming<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:22.710> an

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this off if you're filming like an

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.890 
this off if you're filming like an
interview<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.670> would<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:24.180> recommend<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
interview I would not recommend this

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.179 
interview I would not recommend this
because<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.320> does<00:00:25.439> make<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> crackling<00:00:25.980> noise

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
because it does make a crackling noise

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.759 
because it does make a crackling noise
but<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.180> you're<00:00:27.330> filming<00:00:27.630> something<00:00:28.470> like

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
but if you're filming something like

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.620 
but if you're filming something like
outdoors<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:30.000> might<00:00:30.210> not<00:00:30.390> hear<00:00:30.570> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
outdoors you might not hear that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
outdoors you might not hear that
crackling<00:00:30.960> noise<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.470> there's<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.769> lot<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.130> like

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
crackling noise if there's a lot of like

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.030 
crackling noise if there's a lot of like
background<00:00:32.880> noise<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.450> lot<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.200> stuff<00:00:34.530> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
background noise a lot of that stuff so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250 
background noise a lot of that stuff so
it<00:00:35.160> comes<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> nice<00:00:35.760> case<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.450> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it comes with this nice case and this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
it comes with this nice case and this
3.5<00:00:38.010> wire<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.760> plug<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.149> straight<00:00:39.420> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
3.5 wire you can plug in straight to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.240 
3.5 wire you can plug in straight to
your<00:00:39.629> camera<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> microphone<00:00:43.250> plug

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
your camera if it has a microphone plug

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.729 
your camera if it has a microphone plug
if<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.969> doesn't<00:00:45.329> then<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.170> can't<00:00:46.410> put<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
if it doesn't then you can't put it in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.720 
if it doesn't then you can't put it in
the<00:00:46.800> microphone<00:00:47.629> as<00:00:48.629> far<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.320> but<00:00:49.730> yeah

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the microphone as far as I know but yeah

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
the microphone as far as I know but yeah
that's<00:00:50.940> basically<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.780> only<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
that's basically the only way so I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.830 
that's basically the only way so I
wouldn't<00:00:53.460> really<00:00:53.699> recommend<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.600> because

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
wouldn't really recommend this because

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.930 
wouldn't really recommend this because
it<00:00:55.079> does<00:00:55.260> make<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.530> creaking<00:00:55.800> noise<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.789> for

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it does make a creaking noise but for

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
it does make a creaking noise but for
the<00:00:57.030> money<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:57.840> good<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.829> have

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the money it's pretty good if you have

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069 
the money it's pretty good if you have
the<00:00:59.250> money<00:00:59.399> definitely<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> rode<00:01:00.449> videomic

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the money definitely get a rode videomic

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
the money definitely get a rode videomic
or<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> rode<00:01:01.559> videomic<00:01:02.129> pro<00:01:02.160> they're<00:01:03.000> much

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
or a rode videomic pro they're much

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
or a rode videomic pro they're much
worth<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> money<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.860> gonna<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
worth the money I'm gonna get one in the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
worth the money I'm gonna get one in the
next<00:01:05.909> couple<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.360> weeks<00:01:06.630> I've<00:01:07.200> been<00:01:07.439> saving<00:01:07.740> up

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
next couple of weeks I've been saving up

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.649 
next couple of weeks I've been saving up
for<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.100> little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.270> actually<00:01:09.420> go

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
for a little bit so you can actually go

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.070 
for a little bit so you can actually go
to<00:01:09.689> E<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:10.920> 120<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.760> usually<00:01:12.750> shoot<00:01:12.900> out

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
to E and then 120 I usually shoot out

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.649 
to E and then 120 I usually shoot out
120<00:01:13.490> most<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> time<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.210> takes<00:01:15.240> up

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
120 most of the time but it takes up

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.840 
120 most of the time but it takes up
more<00:01:15.840> bat<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.290> lot<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.590> battery<00:01:16.890> another

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
more bat a lot of battery another

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.170 
more bat a lot of battery another
downside<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:19.640> look<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> battery

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
downside to this is look at the battery

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.630 
downside to this is look at the battery
in<00:01:21.299> there<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.689> Chinese<00:01:22.259> battery<00:01:22.860> where<00:01:23.430> are<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
in there a Chinese battery where are you

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
in there a Chinese battery where are you
gonna<00:01:23.700> find<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.180> if<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.200> you
