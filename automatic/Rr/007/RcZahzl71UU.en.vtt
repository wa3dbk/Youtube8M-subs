00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the last box we will see that we'll

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.440 
the last box we will see that we'll
multiply<00:02:05.840> these<00:02:06.350> two<00:02:06.560> numbers<00:02:06.790> now<00:02:07.790> see<00:02:08.119> how

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
multiply these two numbers now see how

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.300 
multiply these two numbers now see how
we<00:02:08.510> do<00:02:08.660> it<00:02:08.959> we<00:02:09.649> multiply<00:02:10.130> 5<00:02:10.490> with<00:02:10.760> 1<00:02:10.790> which<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.510> 5

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
we do it we multiply 5 with 1 which is 5

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.170 
we do it we multiply 5 with 1 which is 5
then<00:02:13.310> we<00:02:13.430> must<00:02:13.670> back<00:02:13.959> 71<00:02:14.959> 7<00:02:15.440> plus<00:02:16.010> 5<00:02:16.370> into<00:02:16.580> 6<00:02:16.940> is

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
then we must back 71 7 plus 5 into 6 is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.220 
then we must back 71 7 plus 5 into 6 is
30<00:02:17.480> which<00:02:17.780> makes<00:02:18.050> 37<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.730> put<00:02:19.970> 7<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.959> she

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
30 which makes 37 we put 7 your and she

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.760 
30 which makes 37 we put 7 your and she
has<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> carry<00:02:21.890> over<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.660> multiply<00:02:23.660> 2<00:02:24.020> with<00:02:24.290> 1<00:02:24.560> is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
has a carry over to multiply 2 with 1 is

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:33.360 
has a carry over to multiply 2 with 1 is
2<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.920> we<00:02:28.040> must<00:02:28.280> play<00:02:28.550> 5<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.270> 2<00:02:29.630> 3<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:30.140> 15<00:02:31.840> and

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
2 then we must play 5 in 2 3 is 15 and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.710 
2 then we must play 5 in 2 3 is 15 and
then<00:02:34.370> we'll<00:02:34.489> multiply<00:02:34.670> 17<00:02:35.570> with<00:02:35.750> six<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.380> 42

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
then we'll multiply 17 with six is 42
