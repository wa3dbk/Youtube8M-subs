hi<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.989> Jen<00:00:01.350> with<00:00:01.500> new-wave<00:00:01.829> aquaria<00:00:02.370> and

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi this is Jen with new-wave aquaria and

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.340 
hi this is Jen with new-wave aquaria and
today<00:00:03.240> we<00:00:03.449> are<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.929> learn<00:00:04.080> how<00:00:04.319> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
today we are going to learn how to

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.740 
today we are going to learn how to
properly<00:00:04.650> test<00:00:05.100> alkalinity<00:00:05.759> using<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.569> Hamma

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
properly test alkalinity using the Hamma

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.940 
properly test alkalinity using the Hamma
tester<00:00:07.200> so<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.220> begin<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:09.120> often<00:00:10.050> learn<00:00:10.290> from

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
tester so to begin I often learn from

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
tester so to begin I often learn from
actually<00:00:11.519> doing<00:00:11.820> it<00:00:11.940> instead<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.540> reading<00:00:12.809> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
actually doing it instead of reading the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.839 
actually doing it instead of reading the
instructions<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.799> do<00:00:13.889> have<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> instructions

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
instructions I do have the instructions

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.269 
instructions I do have the instructions
that<00:00:14.969> came<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.540> kit<00:00:15.719> so<00:00:16.410> we<00:00:16.740> will<00:00:17.190> be

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
that came with the kit so we will be

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.429 
that came with the kit so we will be
following<00:00:17.460> along<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.180> can<00:00:18.449> also<00:00:18.570> view<00:00:19.199> me

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
following along but you can also view me

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.220 
following along but you can also view me
doing<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.460> at<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> same<00:00:20.910> time<00:00:21.020> so<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.199> I

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
doing it at the same time so what I

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 
doing it at the same time so what I
always<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.760> take<00:00:24.000> everything<00:00:24.359> out

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
always do first if I take everything out

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.220 
always do first if I take everything out
of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.289> actual<00:00:25.710> kit<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> have<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.930> meter

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
of the actual kit so I have my my meter

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.950 
of the actual kit so I have my my meter
my<00:00:29.189> vial<00:00:29.519> my<00:00:30.330> reagent<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:32.630> syringe

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
my vial my reagent and my syringe

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.780 
my vial my reagent and my syringe
now<00:00:34.290> when<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> syringe<00:00:34.980> does<00:00:35.219> come<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
now when the syringe does come in the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
now when the syringe does come in the
kit<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.300> comes<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.750> two<00:00:36.930> separate<00:00:37.380> pieces

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
kit it comes in two separate pieces

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.220 
kit it comes in two separate pieces
sometimes<00:00:38.370> people<00:00:38.910> don't<00:00:39.210> use<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.809> one<00:00:40.020> I'd

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
sometimes people don't use this one I'd

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
sometimes people don't use this one I'd
highly<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.129> not<00:00:41.489> recommend<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.600> highly

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
highly I do not recommend that I highly

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
highly I do not recommend that I highly
recommend<00:00:43.770> using<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:44.969> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
recommend using it like that so you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
recommend using it like that so you
place<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> end<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> syringe<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
place it on the end of the syringe and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.549 
place it on the end of the syringe and
then<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.700> ready<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> begin<00:00:48.300> testing<00:00:48.930> now

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
then you are ready to begin testing now

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.720 
then you are ready to begin testing now
before<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.100> begin<00:00:50.570> according<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
before you can begin according to the

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.279 
before you can begin according to the
instructions<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.940> need<00:00:54.090> 10<00:00:54.539> milliliters<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
instructions you need 10 milliliters of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.400 
instructions you need 10 milliliters of
water<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.579> fill<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> line<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.140> don't

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
water to fill it up to the line I don't

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.020 
water to fill it up to the line I don't
know<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:58.859> see<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> line

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
know if you can see that but the line

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.950 
know if you can see that but the line
that<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:01.070> clearly<00:01:02.070> labeled<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.059> vaio<00:01:03.300> now

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that is clearly labeled on your vaio now

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.179 
that is clearly labeled on your vaio now
you<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.409> sure<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> bottom

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you want to make sure that the bottom

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
you want to make sure that the bottom
actually<00:01:05.400> when<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.479> place<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> water<00:01:07.049> in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
actually when your we place the water in

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.820 
actually when your we place the water in
the<00:01:07.380> bottom<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.100> bubble<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:10.020> reaches

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the bottom of the bubble if that reaches

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.420 
the bottom of the bubble if that reaches
this<00:01:11.310> level<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.930> level<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> line<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
this level this level of the line so

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.420 
this level this level of the line so
what<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.479> done<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.350> already<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.250> 10

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
what I have done is I already have my 10

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.850 
what I have done is I already have my 10
milliliters<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> water<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.590> here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
milliliters of water as you can see here

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
milliliters of water as you can see here
and<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:22.549> before<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> add<00:01:23.790> anything<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
and so before I add anything to it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
and so before I add anything to it
I<00:01:24.840> press<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.590> black<00:01:26.280> button<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.030> hand

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I press the black button on the hand

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.440 
I press the black button on the hand
tester<00:01:27.630> once<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.390> you'll<00:01:31.290> see<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> says<00:01:31.920> add

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
tester once and you'll see it says add

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.260 
tester once and you'll see it says add
c1<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.979> make<00:01:35.579> sure<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.060> my

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
c1 so from there I make sure that my

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.770 
c1 so from there I make sure that my
vial<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.840> clear<00:01:37.439> fingerprints<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.400> any<00:01:39.299> other

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
vial is clear fingerprints or any other

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.499 
vial is clear fingerprints or any other
liquid<00:01:40.290> what<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.310> wet<00:01:41.520> from<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.970> fish

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
liquid what it's not wet from your fish

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.719 
liquid what it's not wet from your fish
tank<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.890> skew<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.340> tests

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
tank because that can skew your tests

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.270 
tank because that can skew your tests
and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.780> open<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> up<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.829> just<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.100> little

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
see that it starts flashing three little
dashed<00:02:00.570> lines<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.469> perfectly<00:02:01.950> normal

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
dashed lines that's perfectly normal

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.780 
dashed lines that's perfectly normal
that's<00:02:02.549> it's<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.110> calibrating<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.610> when

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that's it's just calibrating and when

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.830 
that's it's just calibrating and when
it's<00:02:05.939> done<00:02:06.119> it'll<00:02:06.450> say<00:02:06.840> add<00:02:07.099> C<00:02:08.099> 2<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.539> then<00:02:09.720> that

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it's done it'll say add C 2 so then that

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.960 
it's done it'll say add C 2 so then that
you<00:02:09.959> open<00:02:10.319> up<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.560> test<00:02:10.800> kit<00:02:11.009> remove<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
you open up the test kit remove it I

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.370 
you open up the test kit remove it I
just<00:02:12.030> take<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.540> from<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.750> cap

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
just take it from the cap

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.330 
just take it from the cap
all<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.390> open<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.510> cap<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.160> set<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.190> over

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
all of that I open the cap I set it over

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.760 
all of that I open the cap I set it over
to<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> side<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.270> don't<00:02:18.410> drop<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
to the side so I don't drop it on the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.540 
to the side so I don't drop it on the
other<00:02:19.890> floor<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.460> do<00:02:21.440> open<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.650> reagent

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
other floor and I do open the reagent

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.650 
other floor and I do open the reagent
set<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.270> cap<00:02:24.450> over<00:02:24.630> there<00:02:25.220> take<00:02:26.220> your<00:02:26.660> syringe

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
set the cap over there take your syringe

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.760 
set the cap over there take your syringe
and<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.740> just<00:02:29.010> place<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.250> down<00:02:29.810> and<00:02:30.810> now<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.590> is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
and I just place it down and now this is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.240 
and I just place it down and now this is
where<00:02:31.920> people<00:02:32.070> get<00:02:32.310> confused<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:34.380> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
where people get confused you want the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.830 
where people get confused you want the
bottom<00:02:35.880> line<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:39.090> little<00:02:39.630> black<00:02:39.810> thing

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
bottom line of this little black thing

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.410 
bottom line of this little black thing
to<00:02:40.560> match<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.100> line<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:42.000> milliliter

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
to match the line of the one milliliter

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.110 
to match the line of the one milliliter
so<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.350> bottom<00:02:43.770> one<00:02:43.950> not<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.370> top<00:02:44.580> one<00:02:44.610> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so the bottom one not the top one the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.700 
so the bottom one not the top one the
bottom<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:45.990> where<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.440> this

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
bottom one and it's not where the this

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.200 
bottom one and it's not where the this
end<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.070> this<00:02:47.160> little<00:02:47.370> piston<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:48.060> don't

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
end of this little piston is you don't

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.420 
end of this little piston is you don't
want<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.480> it's<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.990> bottom<00:02:49.350> line<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.190> then<00:02:50.340> I

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
want that it's the bottom line so then I

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.510 
want that it's the bottom line so then I
take<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:52.530> want<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.800> make<00:02:53.010> sure<00:02:53.040> not

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
take this and you want to make sure not

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.670 
take this and you want to make sure not
to<00:02:53.580> spill<00:02:53.970> any<00:02:54.240> very<00:02:54.510> agent<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.440> put

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
to spill any very agent and you just put

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.610 
to spill any very agent and you just put
it<00:02:55.770> into<00:02:55.980> your<00:02:56.130> bile<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.760> set<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.900> aside<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.560> I

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it into your bile I set this aside and I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.010 
it into your bile I set this aside and I
always<00:02:58.860> close<00:02:59.040> my<00:02:59.100> reagent<00:02:59.760> because<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.780> don't

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
always close my reagent because I don't

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.430 
always close my reagent because I don't
want<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> spill<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:03.020> then<00:03:04.020> according<00:03:04.410> to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
want to spill it and then according to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.400 
want to spill it and then according to
the<00:03:04.590> instructions<00:03:05.070> it<00:03:05.280> says<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:06.110> shake<00:03:07.110> gently

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
the instructions it says to shake gently

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.690 
the instructions it says to shake gently
five<00:03:07.980> times<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:09.410> then<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.740> always<00:03:11.340> wipe<00:03:11.520> it<00:03:11.610> off

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
five times and then I always wipe it off

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.130 
five times and then I always wipe it off
make<00:03:11.910> sure<00:03:12.030> I've<00:03:12.150> no<00:03:12.270> fingerprints<00:03:12.900> or<00:03:12.990> any

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
make sure I've no fingerprints or any

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.980 
make sure I've no fingerprints or any
other<00:03:13.290> liquid<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.770> there<00:03:14.210> open<00:03:15.210> up<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.780> test

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
other liquid on there open up the test

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.030 
other liquid on there open up the test
kit<00:03:16.910> put<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.620> and<00:03:19.620> press<00:03:19.860> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
kit put it in there and press the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.730 
kit put it in there and press the
wetness<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.020> wait<00:03:22.170> for<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.410> reading

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
wetness and then you wait for a reading

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.320 
wetness and then you wait for a reading
and<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.400> should<00:03:23.640> give<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.970> number

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
and it should give you a number

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.500 
and it should give you a number
my<00:03:25.140> numbers<00:03:25.470> 146<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.820> then<00:03:26.940> what<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.210> do<00:03:27.390> is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
my numbers 146 so then what you do is

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.390 
my numbers 146 so then what you do is
you<00:03:27.630> take<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:27.990> number<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.620> multiply<00:03:29.100> it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
you take that number and you multiply it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.940 
you take that number and you multiply it
by<00:03:29.550> a<00:03:29.670> point<00:03:30.060> zero<00:03:30.360> five<00:03:30.630> six<00:03:31.020> which<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:33.950> 146

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
by a point zero five six which is 146

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.250 
by a point zero five six which is 146
times<00:03:35.220> point<00:03:35.490> zero<00:03:35.640> five<00:03:36.060> six<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:37.080> looks

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
times point zero five six and it looks

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.070 
times point zero five six and it looks
like<00:03:37.410> my<00:03:37.590> dkh<00:03:38.520> is<00:03:38.760> eight<00:03:39.060> point<00:03:39.390> one<00:03:39.510> seven<00:03:39.870> six

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
like my dkh is eight point one seven six

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.350 
like my dkh is eight point one seven six
which<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.530> writing<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.950> ideal<00:03:41.220> range<00:03:41.430> so

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
which is writing the ideal range so

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.910 
which is writing the ideal range so
after<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> have<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:42.870> reading<00:03:43.170> which<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.530> eight

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
after I have my reading which is eight

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.630 
after I have my reading which is eight
point<00:03:44.220> one<00:03:44.310> seven<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:46.070> want<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.190> shut<00:03:47.370> down<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
point one seven I want to shut down the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.190 
point one seven I want to shut down the
Hammett<00:03:47.940> tester<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.450> just<00:03:48.660> press<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.959> button

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
Hammett tester I just press the button

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.150 
Hammett tester I just press the button
one<00:03:49.290> more<00:03:49.440> time<00:03:49.590> you'll<00:03:49.740> see<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.010> it's

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
one more time you'll see that it's

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.830 
one more time you'll see that it's
there's<00:03:50.490> no<00:03:50.640> longer<00:03:50.880> any<00:03:51.000> numbers<00:03:51.450> displayed

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.510 
there's no longer any numbers displayed
it<00:03:52.080> will<00:03:52.260> shut<00:03:52.470> off<00:03:52.500> automatically<00:03:53.130> after<00:03:53.370> I

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
it will shut off automatically after I

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.280 
it will shut off automatically after I
think<00:03:53.760> five<00:03:53.880> minutes<00:03:53.910> but<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:54.840> shut<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.170> off

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
think five minutes but I shut it off
