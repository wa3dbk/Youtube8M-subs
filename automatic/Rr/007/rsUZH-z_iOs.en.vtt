00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi everyone squeezes sonics we get 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.730
 found today on a video a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.809
 little bit special about diablo iii 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.940
 ripples i'm going to show you a little 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.309
 technical 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.250
 I found that I found and that 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.689
 I experimented over and over again 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.970
 times and that works pretty well 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:25.279
 to make you win white items 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.840
 for your kraft ultra quickly and 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.170
 way 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.000
 ultra safe we will say go to 95% safe 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.740
 unless you're a bit of a penguin but 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 I will show you all that so in 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.690
 actually it's about getting in mode 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.460
 campaign in act 5 to choose the fields 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.489
 battle of eternity and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.530
 put on the streets of seats like kate 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.180
 of course we put ourselves in mind so simple 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 why not and I'm going 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.040
 show is extremely simple it is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 do white items fairly quickly and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.140
 it happens to us that can happen also from 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.670
 find some legendary items 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320
 maybe I'll have the chance to you 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.659
 to show 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:19.110
 if it wants to taste well and so in fact 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:22.700
 to be hurting all this little 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.700
 way backwards 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.420
 where we will recover banana naked to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.420
 items that we need 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.420
 so here's the thing not to do 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.310
 if we do not want to die 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.540
 it's coming here without having celebrated 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.030
 catapults and not to move 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.290
 does it hurt a lot we can 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.180
 die if you are a record I you 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.610
 advise to do it anyway 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.940
 attention even though normally one creates neither 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.940
 nothing 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.340
 the little path we continue our little 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.870
 path 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 it's sandstone so we do not care 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.119
 you say in these little cocks the week 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.510
 already arrived from the legendary hotel 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.730
 can be nice enough and we can have 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.730
 all types of all tics of 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.540
 of white objects of course the shield that 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.830
 will be in quotation marks rare since 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:34.910
 it's one of the most boring themes 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:38.190
 a goy tac and that's all we get back tac 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.110
 and there we leave and we start again etc etc 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.990
 until you have gotten ali 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.420
 topics that interest you in 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:51.660
 the occurrence and ah well here I did 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:54.780
 a run gbp 1 2 3 4 8 8 items white good 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.610
 yellow wine but do you hear that 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.250
 allow you to see all this is 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.640
 what I tasted during in the course of 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 kate 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.950
 if I have a shield while I was 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.820
 closing quietly but otherwise 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:13.709
 is that of the loot with this raid there and 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:16.890
 I had this item there in legendary as well 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.239
 what about you that I say no bullshit 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.080
 I think it was this art is going to be 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.510
 that I am successful added during this road 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.360
 so it's pretty interesting to 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.680
 to go away like that so I you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.790
 advise to do it if you want 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.269
 to make enough white items 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.269
 quickly 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.390
 because I find that the technique is 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.180
 relatively safe and that 's it 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.550
 will help you to do your kraft 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.580
 quite easily and especially I repeat it 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.760
 but it's really almost 100% safe 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.130
 so do not hesitate to abuse without even 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.140
 you too want it here it was a 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.490
 very little video anyway I hope that 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.500
 I hope you will have 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.850
 understood the principle it's really not 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.670
 complicated we can do that with 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.230
 any character of the moment 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.350
 that we have unlocked actor act 5 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.810
 in the difficulty mode that a pale 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.489
 difficulty mode but in the asu 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.019
 what interests us here 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.450
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.350
 and then I make you lots of kisses and 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.830
 see you soon 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.830
 ciao
