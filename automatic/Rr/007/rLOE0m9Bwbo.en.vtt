looks<00:02:52.220> like<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.500> see<00:02:58.010> why<00:02:58.280> people<00:02:58.310> say

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
looks like but I can see why people say

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.300 
looks like but I can see why people say
that<00:02:59.299> it's<00:02:59.600> kind<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.260> bit<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.650> struggle<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
that it's kind of a bit of a struggle to

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.800 
that it's kind of a bit of a struggle to
get<00:03:01.579> it<00:03:01.730> on<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:04.510> took<00:03:05.510> me<00:03:05.690> forever

not<00:04:15.310> breathing<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.769> gotta<00:04:17.979> learn<00:04:18.519> how<00:04:18.789> to

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
not breathing so you gotta learn how to

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.539 
not breathing so you gotta learn how to
breathe<00:04:19.500> differently<00:04:20.500> once<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.039> get<00:04:21.250> a

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
breathe differently once you get a

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.629 
breathe differently once you get a
really<00:04:21.910> tight<00:04:22.030> binder<00:04:22.539> like<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.900> but<00:04:23.800> let's

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
really tight binder like this but let's

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:32.350 
really tight binder like this but let's
test<00:04:24.970> out<00:04:25.210> that<00:04:25.240> swimsuit<00:04:25.660> bike

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.100 

I<00:04:32.419> must<00:04:33.169> say<00:04:33.379> removal<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.610> a<00:04:34.639> lot<00:04:34.909> easier<00:04:35.150> but<00:04:35.930> I

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I must say removal is a lot easier but I

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.249 
I must say removal is a lot easier but I
do<00:04:36.199> not<00:04:36.590> suggest<00:04:36.949> this<00:04:37.370> if<00:04:37.729> you<00:04:38.120> ever<00:04:38.360> expect<00:04:39.020> a

do not suggest this if you ever expect a

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.990 
do not suggest this if you ever expect a
passionate<00:04:39.680> moment<00:04:40.099> where<00:04:40.280> you<00:04:40.400> have<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.789> rip

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
passionate moment where you have to rip

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:54.280 
passionate moment where you have to rip
your<00:04:41.180> clothes<00:04:41.419> off

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
okay and this is the combination

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.360 
okay and this is the combination
compression<00:04:58.290> sway<00:04:58.590> sorts<00:04:59.070> short<00:05:00.290> and

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
compression sway sorts short and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:13.450 
compression sway sorts short and
compressions<00:05:08.510> just<00:05:09.510> fat<00:05:09.870> into<00:05:11.420> skinny<00:05:12.420> with

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
the only kind of thing I can't believe I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.470 
the only kind of thing I can't believe I
don't<00:05:16.830> know<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.190> could<00:05:17.340> probably<00:05:17.640> pull<00:05:18.360> off
