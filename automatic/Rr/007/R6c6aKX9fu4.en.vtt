00:00:01.231 --> 00:00:03.468
Good evening, Everybody.

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:07.313
Tonight our nation is in debt to the people of Boston

00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:09.488
and the people of Massachusetts

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:13.048
After a vicious attack on their city,

00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:17.195
Bostonians responded with resolve and determination.

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:21.843
They did their part as citizens and partners in this investigation.

00:00:21.843 --> 00:00:28.214
Boston police, and state police, and local police across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

00:00:28.214 --> 00:00:32.700
responded with professionalism and bravery over five long days.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.077
And tonight because of their determined efforts,

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:38.944
we've closed an important chapter in this tragedy.

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:43.345
I've been briefed earlier this evening by FBI Director Muller.

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:48.444
After the attacks on Monday, I directed the full resources of the federal government

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.746
to be made available to help state and local authorities

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:53.064
in the investigation,

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:55.546
and to increase security, as needed.

00:00:55.546 --> 00:01:01.438
Over the past week, close coordination among federal, state, and local officials--

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:05.743
sharing information, moving swiftly to track down leads--

00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:07.248
has been critical to this effort.

00:01:07.248 --> 00:01:10.934
They all worked as they should: as a team.

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:14.821
And we are extremely grateful for that.

00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:16.810
We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.048
to all our outstanding law enforcement professionals.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:22.208
These men and women get up everyday,

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.946
they put on that uniform,

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:25.931
they risk their lives to keep us safe, and

00:01:25.931 --> 00:01:29.437
as this week showed, they don't always know what to expect.

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:32.589
So our thoughts are with those who were wounded in

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:35.580
pursuit of the suspects and we pray for their full recovery.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.411
We also send our prayers to the Collier family,

00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.278
who grieve the loss of their son and brother, Sean.

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:47.931
He was born to be a police officer, said his chief at MIT.

00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:50.206
He was just twenty-six years old.

00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:52.574
And as his family has said,

00:01:52.574 --> 00:01:56.213
he died bravely, in the line of duty

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:59.542
doing what he committed his life to doing:

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.637
serving and protecting others.

00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:03.547
So, we're grateful to him.

00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:07.780
Obviously, tonight, there are still many unanswered questions.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.950
Among them, why did young men who grew up and studied here,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.244
as part of our communities and our country,

00:02:17.244 --> 00:02:20.244
resort to such violence?

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:23.311
How did they plan and carry out these attacks?

00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:25.308
And did they receive any help?

00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:29.439
The families of those killed so senselessly deserve answers.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.782
The wounded, some of whom now have to learn how to stand

00:02:34.782 --> 00:02:37.645
and walk and live again, deserve answers.

00:02:37.645 --> 00:02:43.346
So I've instructed the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and our intelligence community

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:48.752
to continue to deploy all the necessary resources to support the investigation,

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:52.864
to collect intelligence, and to protect our citizens.

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:55.176
We will determine what happened.

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:59.843
We will investigate any associations that these terrorists may have had.

00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:03.979
And we'll continue to do whatever we have to do to keep our people safe.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:08.377
One thing we do know is that whatever hateful agenda

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:13.445
drove these men to such heinous acts will not and cannot prevail.

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:16.328
Whatever they thought they could ultimately achieve,

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:17.769
they've already failed.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.989
They failed because the people of Boston refused to be intimidated.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.517
They failed because as Americans, we refuse to be terrorized.

00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:37.715
They failed because we will not waiver from the character, the compassion, and the values

00:03:37.715 --> 00:03:38.812
that define us as country.

00:03:38.812 --> 00:03:41.681
Nor will we break the bonds that hold us together as Americans.

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:50.248
That American spirit includes staying true to the unity and diversity that makes us strong,

00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:52.145
like no other nation in the world.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:04:01.983
In this age of instant reporting, tweets, blogs, there's a temptation to latch onto any bit of information

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:06.178
and sometimes to jump to conclusions;

00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:12.960
but when a tragedy like this happens, with public safety at risk

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.515
and the stakes so high,

00:04:14.515 --> 00:04:16.224
it's important that we do this right.

00:04:16.224 --> 00:04:19.967
That's why we have courts.

00:04:19.967 --> 00:04:27.644
That's why we take care not to rush to judgment,

00:04:27.644 --> 00:04:33.209
not about the motivations of these individuals,

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:37.212
certainly not about entire groups of people.

00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:41.187
After all, one of the things that makes America the greatest nation on the Earth

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:45.546
but also, one of the things that makes Boston such a great city,

00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:48.356
is that we welcome people from all around the world.

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:51.773
People of every faith, every ethnicity, from every corner of the world.

00:04:51.773 --> 00:04:57.244
So as we continue to learn more about why and how this tragedy happened,

00:04:57.244 --> 00:05:00.376
let's make sure that we sustain that spirit.

00:05:00.376 --> 00:05:03.104
Tonight, we think of all the wounded

00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:07.343
still struggling to recover.

00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:08.875
Certainly, we think of Crystal Campbell,

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:12.439
we think of Ling Zu Lu,

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:17.344
We think of little Martin Richard.

00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:22.772
Their lives reflected all the diversity and beauty of our country,

00:05:22.772 --> 00:05:26.463
and they were sharing a great American experience,

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:27.699
together.

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:33.578
Finally, let me say that, even as so much attention's

00:05:33.578 --> 00:05:37.346
been focused on the tragic events in Boston, understandably,

00:05:37.346 --> 00:05:41.607
we've also seen a tight-knit community in Texas

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.826
devastated by a terrible explosion,

00:05:44.826 --> 00:05:47.612
and I want them to know that they are not forgotten.

00:05:47.612 --> 00:05:51.882
Our thoughts, our prayers, are with the people of West Texas,

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:57.210
where so many good people lost their lives, some lost their homes,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.876
many were injured, many are still missing.

00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:07.941
I've talked to Governor Perry, and Mayor Buska, and I've pledged that the people of West will have the resources

00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:10.620
that they need to recover and rebuild.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.978
I want everybody in Texas to know that we will follow through with those commitments.

00:06:14.978 --> 00:06:18.745
All and all, this has been a tough week,

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:23.608
but we've seen the character of our country once more.

00:06:23.608 --> 00:06:27.834
And as President, I'm confident that we have the courage

00:06:27.834 --> 00:06:29.129
and resilience,

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.645
and the spirit to overcome these challenges

00:06:31.645 --> 00:06:33.676
and to go forward

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:35.657
as one nation under God,

00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:36.845
indivisible,

00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:39.076
with liberty and justice for all.

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:40.875
Thank you very much, everybody.
