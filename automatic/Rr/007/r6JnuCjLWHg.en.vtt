 what kind of profile of users to overcome it minister 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.460
 He recalled that the operator 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 can have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 only the privilege d April will be the program no more 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.649
 and I accepted alaska and it's not right that I but have access nothing else not even 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.710
 count the troops 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.510
 the users here seems the users 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.110
 and I'm in this country and not users, for example 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.620
 you want to eliminate by the gold workers jimena physical activity is done 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.200
 issa too 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.590
 to eliminate their 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.070
 configuration of them you can configure here the different destinations 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.080
 another one we use 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 the callsigns 0 9 0 7 0 5 10 thousand positions that are destined account 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.240
 why 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.740
 p on the site and configured with dialing 0 11 and 4 4 4 and a 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.070
 amount that only so 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.800
 he does directly vision of mandia the plan 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.829
 pass it straight in Beijing 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.540
 2 different cellular pressure was not fixed we have the operator judge 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.779
 national collected seven councils and what is 9 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:17.189
 movistar tigo 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.709
 and two destinations most used in his post 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.300
 we left this and here international customs 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.169
 here we have each country 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.829
 united states of a for example for a hundred malvinas 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.969
 balbina republic blanket each of the countries eg Spain and that 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.019
 the resigned take out cell part and fixed 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.750
 here we can confirm anything well 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.169
 in local number 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.249
 local one day and the cell phone when dialing with 0 3 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:46.869
 technical support so that our data our data show pajín showed 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.169
 emails our cell phone and landlines 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.229
 as an antechamber the system operates this system is configured as we 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.119
 present 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.129
 psp obviously as we said before it changes 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.759
 the person enters street number 1 you activate by clicking here 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.300
 the staff 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.590
 marked a number whatever for example as we have informed sources 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.599
 Spain 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.309
 this test is that it is a fixed 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.009
 the north and south mobile 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.819
 ofico 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.089
 depending on what it is 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.509
 but that turned to sea 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.809
 the moment you make investments that only brings inefficiency 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.760
 and the hiv-aids plant wayne the local line that some cases to the other and 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.669
 touched with vote not with a system that already my poland pressure 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.529
 the system starts 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.509
 athletic 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:31.009
 when the person counts 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.109
 system accumulating the year the flame 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.509
 when the alleged aggressor has been this issue 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.329
 it exists or not 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.559
 You can see it 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.379
 can not go neglect can go to 100 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.799
 we saved for the vacation plan with 0 7 we wanted national entere 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.329
 because two fuel oil are no longer used in hotels in cities as 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.169
 previously they were done with the mister he had bands and coti front is 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.169
 national operator 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:57.899
 peter lopez marked gerula 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.149
 You can dial to any destination 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.950
 that you know that I have been new technology since 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.929
 It will weigh if lines are encouraged a lot 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:10.119
 it was the issue of minutes that did not insist on any minutes that cc 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.909
 cs also technical support in insist until question others we also offer 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.389
 when the person sane 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.370
 returns accumulates 16 percent successively 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.180
 when for this question because when he decided when the person 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.819
 remove 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.139
 because the budget itself about 2 3 4 5 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.550
 virginia llamas 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.779
 the accumulated barí that also the viewer 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.680
 appear the same data that presents seems the tea the time 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 that is why the number 10 of the accumulated neighborhood of the year 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.050
 it seems the total of others 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.490
 the person decides to retire 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.279
 it is presumed but in the system berenice of the hand 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.059
 how I told my against 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.359
 when the person is already retired after the adjustment is fourth in the invoice and the 

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.699
 15% stopwatch are inserted 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.930
 disabled the bison this party is ready for the appointment 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.189
 for the next yamaha 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.719
 the system closes here 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.150
 and are our data 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.279
 this page is triple double out and tecka computations 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.279
 cell bust 3 13 or 70 97 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:13.990
 64 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.120
 and we are willing to collaborate thank you very much
