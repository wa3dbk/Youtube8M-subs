00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hi, people here, and today I am 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.080
 properly uniformed with my turn 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 Because today is a very long day. 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
 Special indeed yesterday was a day 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.860
 very special yesterday was the anniversary of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.710
 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.660
 That's why I chose to make this video that I 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.670
 I saw recently in Canada May I go 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.160
 leaving anyone down here is logical that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.660
 God has credits of those who created leave the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.529
 link below everything will be here 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 below in the description box then the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.570
 PT and harry potter tag and for some 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.090
 moe does not have a video yesterday but 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.840
 I'm posting today to celebrate what 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.610
 it was yesterday 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.860
 so come on then this tag 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.230
 basically selected some spells 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 harry potter has one reason for each 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.250
 spell do not have to choose the books 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.879
 representatives of each harry spell 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.320
 potter 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.809
 Let's start the first spell is 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.180
 smart patron a book related to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.100
 good memories and obviously not going to 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.859
 choose harry potter than the third 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.049
 less obvious but not so less 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.689
 obvious why I chose society 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.090
 secret of the practical target 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.770
 in fact this book besides being very 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.960
 Good. I love this. I 've already recommended it. 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 You 're from the secret society, but it's 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.020
 because it 's a book she's still an echo 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.040
 very good of my life that is my 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.360
 college 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.340
 with that book going on in college 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
 Is it okay that American is American? 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 I remembered from my college that it was the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.479
 best time of my life and I'm 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.829
 A lot of nonsense from my college 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.869
 So I chose this movie to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.270
 represent a good reminder that I 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.119
 I have that is for the spell aspect of 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.770
 zone according to the spell is to spread the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 book that took by surprise to this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.960
 category I chose the pajama boy 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.509
 striped because I always had a certain 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.619
 prejudice with this book I was giving 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.899
 this opening to read this book 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.829
 commercial posthumous and other things 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.299
 trombone 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.850
 then many of you recommended me 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.549
 this specific book to jÃºlia campos me 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.950
 gave this book and was grateful 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.930
 surprise and respected many feelings 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.899
 and many other desires to know the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.460
 john boyne's work and so on 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.670
 time of Nazism for the Second War 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.710
 It was a surprise book for me. 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.810
 spell worsens 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.790
 until the last book you read as 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.350
 I'm recording this video for 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.110
 the literary marathon 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.470
 one of the books I read was all of us 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.610
 we fought carol bensimon's cowboy 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.140
 published by the company of letters 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.940
 This is a book I read recently that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.580
 I'm finished, I'm not going. I'm reading. 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.830
 and this book quite different from everything 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.650
 which is already valid and will speak 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.590
 about homosexuality about discoveries 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.930
 on the acceptance and is a national book 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.420
 that happens in the great river of the south where 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.820
 the two girls make her a kind of 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.440
 hot chip a trip by the great river 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.280
 south of the interior of the Grande do Sul 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.200
 so cool 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.600
 I'll soon think a bit more about 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.100
 this book and make a video for you more 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.530
 This was the last book I read Wednesday 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.180
 done that there is rumor is the book that 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.830
 introduced to a genre that you do not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.660
 I had considered before, I can not 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.450
 put the boy in the striped pajamas 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.300
 in this category because it was the book that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.970
 presented of the vacancies is not form bb 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.160
 presented may made me look with others 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.590
 eyes to fiction books that are 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.690
 based on historical facts and had 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.760
 a certain prejudice before then I think 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.470
 which fits perfectly the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.250
 striped pajama boy from a forum 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.950
 again fifth made this a ridiculous one 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.710
 very funny book and as I said 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.350
 on several different things tags blood 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.300
 and scares the book I only made a video with 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.240
 books to cry laughing that I go 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.460
 leave here on the card on top is to stay with 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.950
 the number of your cousin's end was very 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.410
 and this special book to one of the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.170
 the funniest of her and the hill of laughing and it's 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.000
 ridiculous the situation of the magazine goes 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.510
 then perfect for that category 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.550
 perfect for the sixth medical spell 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.430
 sound spell 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.470
 the book that everyone should know and I 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.420
 I tried not to be obvious I was going to talk about 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.640
 blacklist but I'm not going to say I'm going 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.260
 Talk about extraordinary that I do not have 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.510
 the physical book I will choose the capinha 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.660
 here for you and extraordinary is a 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.150
 book that everyone should read to stay 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.270
 to put yourself in the situation of the other 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.410
 in this thing of prejudice this prejudice 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.710
 pre impression that we have of 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.980
 people will excuse the vision of a 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.870
 Boy is 11 years old. 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.250
 It's a deformity on the face to see how 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.650
 he sees like other people 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.810
 see and also to see the point of 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.300
 view of other people who have this 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.610
 family who live with him and the book 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.300
 that opens minds and I really enjoyed this 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.780
 book was one of the best of 2014 I did not 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.940
 I remember 2003 and probably did not 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.920
 I do not remember but we were better than I 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.940
 I saw that year I recommend it 's a book 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.880
 everyone should read 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.430
 besides the black list if the spell the milk 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.030
 a book or spoiler you would like 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.620
 forget 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.150
 here I was going to quote that you should have 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.800
 forgotten the harry potter series for 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.520
 to read everything as if it were the first 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.710
 turn 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.630
 but the double spoiler championship that I 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.160
 I would have forgotten and spoiler that 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:08.000
 I would have forgotten was the spoiler 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.040
 of the hope that I was very 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.570
 Anger when I discovered a spoiler I can not 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.770
 speak and spoiler did not happen or the 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.850
 movie still advanced then but I think 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.160
 that you can imagine having 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.620
 spoiler and I was very angry because 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.420
 we just expected how much this 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.820
 was going to happen when a show of 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.530
 no way so it was very annoying 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.550
 which is much forgotten and spreads 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.920
 when I read hope at last eighth 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.960
 spell and old book leaving that 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.640
 school and a book I always say that 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.110
 I really like this book. It was one of the 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.960
 better reading experiences 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.360
 compulsory at school it fluctuates 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.490
 josÃ© alencar I love this book at 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.040
 I cried horrors, it's very sad because 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.110
 It involves a courtesan involves us that 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.270
 passionate about it involves the diseases that 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.010
 happened then in Brazil 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.500
 I think what's happening is not super love 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.840
 I remember what the disease is very sad is 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.080
 very tasty to read yet does not use disc 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.360
 It is not the way that quotes time but it is a 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.130
 book that marked me a lot and one of the 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.550
 The only ones I liked during high school 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:13.220
 in the spell find the book that was 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.810
 It was painful to read and was very 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.510
 I was painful but the most 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.120
 recent was bitter love grv not brown 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.980
 I know if I have a cover yet if I do not add 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.990
 If I have to, I 'll put it here but not yet. 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.330
 had been released but if you have 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:29.210
 appear here and to a unit 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.840
 was launched in August and this 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.340
 month 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.889
 we are very painful that will speak 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.870
 about relationships 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.270
 I just wanted to get into the book. 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.069
 take it heavy I felt there know then it was 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.460
 very painful and very distressing 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:48.419
 I have no book so know it then. 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.430
 This is the book that marked me the most. 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.530
 recently was more painful in law 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:54.120
 recently I did not feel that I 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.990
 I think I've lost count do not signal 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.750
 ninth 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.439
 it is the job that is the place and it was the book 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:04.620
 delatar is a killing book and so I 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:07.110
 I chose the book to kill myself, but one 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.090
 book that kills a lot of people is not game of 

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.849
 thrones I did not turn on oil beyond 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:15.029
 basic would be a lot of people to travel gone 

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:17.659
 bad the whole series of gone because 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:21.300
 author kills a lot of sad people this series 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:25.590
 kind are children all the time and 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.599
 types of captured and remembered 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:30.539
 what a lot of people gave so I chose 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.909
 like killing book and long you know 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:35.219
 I even recommend it quite a lot. 

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:37.020
 This is the spell harry potter I 

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:37.889
 I hope you liked it, let's go. 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.240
 celebrate 

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:43.830
 the brasÃ­lia reporter the book about 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.599
 lawyers for upcoming releases 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.039
 which has to restore the truth of the next 

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.099
 movies do not involve harry potter
