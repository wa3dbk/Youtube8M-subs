about<00:02:05.670> seven<00:02:06.000> point<00:02:06.390> nine<00:02:06.450> grams<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.950> one's

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
about seven point nine grams this one's

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:08.660 
about seven point nine grams this one's
about

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
about

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.000 
about
1.98<00:02:09.380> ended<00:02:10.380> 121<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.190> those<00:02:12.620> now<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.680> reason

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
1.98 ended 121 of those now the reason

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.290 
1.98 ended 121 of those now the reason
why<00:02:14.220> these<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:14.730> collectible<00:02:14.940> is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
why these are very collectible is

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.470 
why these are very collectible is
because<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> lot<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.500> were<00:02:16.650> melted<00:02:17.040> down

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
because a lot of them were melted down

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.839 
because a lot of them were melted down
because<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.660> 1950s<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.950> Saudi<00:02:20.400> monetary

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
because in the 1950s the Saudi monetary

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.400 
because in the 1950s the Saudi monetary
agency<00:02:21.239> started<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.599> print<00:02:21.840> their<00:02:21.959> own<00:02:21.989> savvy

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
agency started to print their own savvy

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.220 
agency started to print their own savvy
Guinea<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> lot<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:23.880> gold<00:02:24.209> discs<00:02:25.080> were

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.420 
Guinea so a lot of these gold discs were
actually<00:02:25.680> noted<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.090> purpose<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:28.430> 1991

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
actually noted for that purpose in 1991

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.010 
actually noted for that purpose in 1991
there<00:02:29.550> was<00:02:29.640> an<00:02:29.760> article<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.390> The<00:02:30.660> New<00:02:30.690> York

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
these are so rare and that's the reason

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.160 
these are so rare and that's the reason
why<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.340> took<00:02:41.459> him<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.670> long<00:02:41.790> time<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.600> get<00:02:43.050> them

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
why it took him a long time to get them

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.050 
why it took him a long time to get them
to<00:02:43.319> me<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.400> basically<00:02:44.700> than<00:02:44.910> two

there it is and the writing on this is
actually<00:03:34.350> in<00:03:34.470> better<00:03:34.880> condition<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.940> think

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
actually in better condition I think

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.550 
actually in better condition I think
than<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.600> one<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.840> salivate<00:03:37.579> showed<00:03:38.579> but<00:03:39.560> so

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
than the one that salivate showed but so

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.660 
than the one that salivate showed but so
i'm<00:03:40.680> not<00:03:40.829> sure<00:03:41.010> if<00:03:41.100> i'm<00:03:41.190> going<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> send<00:03:41.549> this

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670

i'm not sure if i'm going to send this
out<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.910> get<00:03:42.209> graded<00:03:42.510> or<00:03:42.750> not<00:03:42.959> i<00:03:42.989> mean<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.470> know

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.670 
i'm sure it's not going to do that well
but<00:03:45.390> maybe<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.750> 64<00:03:46.350> or<00:03:46.560> 65<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:48.560> don't<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.620> it

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
but maybe a 64 or 65 I don't know it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.110 
but maybe a 64 or 65 I don't know it
could<00:03:49.739> be<00:03:49.950> less<00:03:50.100> i'm<00:03:50.280> not<00:03:50.459> i'm<00:03:50.790> not<00:03:50.850> really

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
could be less i'm not i'm not really

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.699 
could be less i'm not i'm not really
integrating<00:03:51.690> now<00:03:52.380> one<00:03:52.530> of<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.680> interesting

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
integrating now one of the interesting

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.229 
integrating now one of the interesting
things<00:03:53.310> is<00:03:53.459> also<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:53.880> know<00:03:53.970> because<00:03:54.120> we're

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
things is also you know because we're

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.880 
things is also you know because we're
used<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.569> the<00:03:54.780> Americans<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:55.560> flip

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
used to the Americans and you just flip

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.210 
used to the Americans and you just flip
it<00:03:56.329> but<00:03:57.329> here<00:03:57.630> it's<00:03:57.750> not<00:03:57.989> see<00:03:59.359> and<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.130> is

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
it but here it's not see and there it is

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.509 
it but here it's not see and there it is
um<00:04:02.489> again<00:04:03.359> you<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.319> see<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.590> weight<00:04:04.799> gross

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
um again you can see the weight gross

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.300 
um again you can see the weight gross
weight<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.000> that's<00:04:06.120> in<00:04:06.239> grains<00:04:06.569> so<00:04:06.959> for<00:04:07.530> 249

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
weight and that's in grains so for 249

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.110 
weight and that's in grains so for 249
3.1<00:04:09.090> grains<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:11.160> finesse<00:04:11.519> again<00:04:11.970> which

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
3.1 grains and the finesse again which

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.699 
3.1 grains and the finesse again which
is<00:04:12.150> really<00:04:12.269> interesting<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:12.930> nine<00:04:13.200> one<00:04:13.230> six

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
is really interesting it's nine one six

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.009 
is really interesting it's nine one six
and<00:04:13.920> two-thirds<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:15.750> know<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> lot<00:04:15.989> of

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
and two-thirds and you know a lot of

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.360 
and two-thirds and you know a lot of
people<00:04:16.109> might<00:04:16.380> not<00:04:16.500> understand<00:04:16.979> what<00:04:17.099> what's

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
people might not understand what what's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.310 
people might not understand what what's
the<00:04:17.489> point<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.880> 23

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
the point of the 23

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.500 
the point of the 23
in<00:04:18.410> America<00:04:18.860> well<00:04:19.010> basically<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:20.090> Saudis

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
in America well basically the Saudis

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.690 
in America well basically the Saudis
wanted<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.020> same<00:04:21.350> quality<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.160> gold<00:04:22.460> that's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
wanted the same quality of gold that's

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.740 
wanted the same quality of gold that's
in<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.060> British<00:04:23.420> sovereign<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:25.180> so<00:04:26.180> you<00:04:26.720> know

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
in a British sovereign and so you know

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.360 
in a British sovereign and so you know
the<00:04:26.930> Americans<00:04:27.350> obliged<00:04:27.710> because<00:04:28.100> I<00:04:28.190> think

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
the Americans obliged because I think

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.800 
the Americans obliged because I think
there<00:04:28.490> was<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.610> weight<00:04:28.850> difference<00:04:29.450> or<00:04:29.630> than

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
there was a weight difference or than

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.690 
there was a weight difference or than
the<00:04:30.200> actual<00:04:30.320> weight<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:31.280> know<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.460> British

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
the actual weight you know the British

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.310 
the actual weight you know the British
are<00:04:31.790> using<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.120> different<00:04:32.450> weight

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
are using a different weight

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.810 
are using a different weight
measurements<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:33.950> stuff<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.670> where

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
measurements and stuff so this is where

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.790 
measurements and stuff so this is where
we<00:04:34.940> get<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.290> two-thirds<00:04:36.290> from<00:04:36.500> or<00:04:36.620> at<00:04:36.680> least

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
we get the two-thirds from or at least

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.600 
we get the two-thirds from or at least
that's<00:04:36.920> what<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.070> guy<00:04:37.190> told<00:04:37.220> me<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:37.760> but<00:04:39.610> yeah

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
that's what the guy told me so but yeah

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.610 
that's what the guy told me so but yeah

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
sentiment of both countries hopefully

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.420 
sentiment of both countries hopefully
you<00:04:47.780> know<00:04:47.900> it's<00:04:48.050> as<00:04:48.260> rare<00:04:48.500> as<00:04:48.530> people<00:04:49.370> are

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430
