00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello this morning I ran to the post office 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.160
 I came here so interesting 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.160
 sachet let's see this where 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.350
 In short, this is a very difficult type. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.289
 readable 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.750
 address on general rajasthan this is somewhere in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.660
 India is such a small bag 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:32.520
 mean with a weight of 106 grams came here 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.840
 very quickly literally pa pas pa pas pa 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.489
 in two weeks I ordered myself 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.059
 cheap delivery 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.200
 Well, in general, let's open this case 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 Now let's see what's inside, I like 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:01:04.409
 we know that he himself looked paperwork 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:05.090
 some cool it's shorter this some 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.189
 leaflet 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:11.540
 starting which are sent to bear and 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.659
 forget you can see but it's not a rag it 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 the cloth 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:21.320
 still here some kind of red garbage will 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:24.890
 hope that it will not allow no dung 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:31.439
 some obscure cow 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.720
 which account besides is it more than x 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.860
 each some kind of the four gucci such 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.860
 Indian packed 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.900
 momoko look it up i'm not specifically 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.280
 I say that in the most interesting 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.180
 see how it looks like this 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:15.430
 here's a bag 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:18.950
 and here is this Indian Damascus 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.690
 quite low-priced sachet 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.830
 there is such 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.190
 terribly oily but nonetheless here 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.770
 such a pattern 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:36.620
 here is such a damask here butt 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:40.700
 probably well, about 3 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:45.490
 whose wedge soon I 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.490
 I think what a good little knife 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.690
 so something like the seat here of course 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.970
 Asian Hello and finally the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.830
 the result of this project is code 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.530
 the name of the Indians in the previous part 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.720
 video you saw what we had 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.910
 initially now we will see the final 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.090
 project well as I said it went very 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.640
 much order time there for almost three 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.640
 months what or two and a half months 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.970
 there is no connection with different difficulties 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:25.840
 We got around to this project that's well in 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:32.209
 as a result, we have such let's say 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:38.690
 Finnish type of necessary gardens we always 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:41.560
 very high quality leather embossed such 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.560
 here is the suspension 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:49.670
 our skin is as always dyed small 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.740
 technological hole to drain water 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.520
 You can say that many are needed 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.840
 more well i think that this is quite 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.190
 enough common here are the legs 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:08.030
 such here these milky such here lace 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:14.960
 well and let's look at the blade itself 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:18.080
 so now it looks like this 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.959
 such a general view of a knife means let's 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.060
 let's start with the handle on our handle 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.980
 here is some kind of palm tree which 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.940
 arrived 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:33.140
 once again from this parents trip 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.900
 In Bali, in general, came such a piece of wood 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.110
 such a mosaic pin too 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.050
 Finnish-like 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:45.200
 grip with such a light mushroom well in 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.340
 In general, what a tree I do not dare to know 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.680
 mean here we have 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.970
 brass bolter if possible so 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.730
 name red and black fiber 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.550
 Well, in general, here is the wedge v-wedge itself 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:05.410
 the wedge was restarted 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.290
 changed geometry it became even 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.450
 Symmetric 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.720
 changed then he was re-pickled 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.570
 I appeared without any problems 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.930
 what is our Damascus its though not 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.880
 very much but very pleasant 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.070
 it is clear that it would stamp to 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.640
 that forged there with an electric hammer they 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.430
 some master blacksmith uncle 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:34.190
 Well, well, let's give a little 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:38.450
 characteristics means hand me. as 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:41.960
 always 12 centimeters in the hand is very 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.770
 nice here nowhere hinders nothing not 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.800
 we on it hand fills well 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.069
 we have a wedge here 100 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.520
 9 millimeters almost 1 centimeters 10 9 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:58.930
 centimeters in the butt we have three and a half 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:02.530
 millimeter that's not about talking down 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:06.250
 I will be well a little information about 0 6 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:10.569
 the knife is very well sharpened let's 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:12.909
 look at the napkin I think on 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.280
 paper towel here without any 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:18.669
 problems knife cuts 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.349
 in general, there are no problems here, but 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.870
 It turned out in general here from this 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:25.409
 Damascus which was ordered for trial 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:29.440
 here is such an interesting wedge 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:32.919
 the knife is quite working quite possible 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:36.370
 to use in any conditions very 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:39.280
 Cutting geometry very successful fellow stay 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.169
 you can intercept the knife like that 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.840
 but the only thing that tamanski is 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:48.250
 Damascus for Damascus need to care well 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.590
 for whom it is not a problem because on 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.690
 actually need to care like here like 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.560
 for any carbon kai is again connected 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:59.259
 there are always carbon lovers with you 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.539
 people have always entered there are connoisseurs and 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:03.310
 for them it is quite a small problem 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.409
 caring for carbon here is the same 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:09.430
 the most supernatural because 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:12.520
 that in fact it is also 2 steel one slightly 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.190
 more doped another slightly less but 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.349
 in general, carbon someone so I do not 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.870
 say this is a super knife that can 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:23.139
 cut and rails then planed hair no 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.770
 in no case let's say in this case 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:26.360
 we get just 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.720
 normal good knife from adequate 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.180
 the materials you have are wonderful 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.789
 the look is very good 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.099
 charisma is very nice at the very 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:41.389
 In fact, the blade and the shape turned out well 

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:44.650
 the working ability of the knife is also the 

00:07:41.389 --> 00:07:48.349
 the best is why this is interesting 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:51.770
 the completion of this project is very 

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:53.080
 I like how the general came out 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.330
 here is the final 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.340
 the composition is clear that time though 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.800
 a lot has passed but i think it is 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.400
 It was worth it because it was ordered so 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.250
 solely to work slowly 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:11.090
 so thank you all while we wait 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:13.400
 new projects look like spring 

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:18.789
 you can spend a little more time 

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.789
 later that's why all thanks so far
