eight<00:03:00.220> millimeter<00:03:00.730> screws<00:03:01.540> are<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.410> these

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
eight millimeter screws are just these

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.849 
eight millimeter screws are just these
simple<00:03:02.830> ones<00:03:03.099> here<00:03:04.140> all<00:03:05.140> right<00:03:05.350> this<00:03:05.680> is

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
simple ones here all right this is

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.949 
simple ones here all right this is
inside<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.700> wheel<00:03:06.880> well<00:03:07.150> looking<00:03:07.600> towards

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
inside the wheel well looking towards

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.520 
inside the wheel well looking towards
the<00:03:08.019> bumper<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.650> had<00:03:09.400> removed<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.930> screw

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
the bumper I had removed the screw

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.289 
the bumper I had removed the screw
Phillips<00:03:11.890> screw<00:03:12.100> from<00:03:12.430> underneath<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:13.060> and

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
Phillips screw from underneath here and

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.599 
Phillips screw from underneath here and
so<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.690> loosens<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.440> bumper<00:03:14.829> to<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.160> fender

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
so that loosens the bumper to the fender

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.180 
so that loosens the bumper to the fender
and<00:03:15.910> then<00:03:16.510> there's<00:03:16.720> only<00:03:16.810> two<00:03:17.170> more<00:03:17.200> these<00:03:17.920> two

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.000 
and then there's only two more these two
right<00:03:18.400> up<00:03:18.549> here<00:03:19.140> which<00:03:20.140> are<00:03:20.319> ten<00:03:20.590> millimeter

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
right up here which are ten millimeter

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.340 
right up here which are ten millimeter

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.220 

definitely<00:04:00.210> one<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> most<00:04:00.660> difficult

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
definitely one of the most difficult

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.080 
definitely one of the most difficult
parts<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.710> removing<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.280> fenders<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:02.970> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
parts of removing the fenders in this

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.600 
parts of removing the fenders in this
frontal<00:04:03.540> area<00:04:03.900> here<00:04:04.260> you<00:04:04.950> can<00:04:05.100> get<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.430> these

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
frontal area here you can get to these

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.770 
frontal area here you can get to these
two<00:04:07.250> fenders<00:04:08.250> basically<00:04:08.850> sandwiched<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.570> here

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
two fenders basically sandwiched in here

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.410 
two fenders basically sandwiched in here
so<00:04:10.020> you<00:04:10.110> have<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:10.730> kind<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.790> pull<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.180> metal

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
so you have to kind of pull this metal

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.810 
so you have to kind of pull this metal
bracket<00:04:12.690> back<00:04:13.140> out<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.830> this<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.430> order<00:04:14.610> to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
bracket back out like this in order to

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.390 
bracket back out like this in order to
pull<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.150> out<00:04:15.300> but<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.440> most<00:04:16.590> difficult<00:04:16.829> piece

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
pull it out but the most difficult piece

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.120 
pull it out but the most difficult piece
is<00:04:17.730> actually<00:04:18.390> up<00:04:18.600> here<00:04:18.920> there<00:04:19.920> is<00:04:20.430> a<00:04:22.130> 10

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
is actually up here there is a 10

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.920 
is actually up here there is a 10
millimeter<00:04:23.430> bolt<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.060> very<00:04:24.300> difficult<00:04:24.750> to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
millimeter bolt it's very difficult to

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.030 
millimeter bolt it's very difficult to
get<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:26.160> what<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.370> did<00:04:26.490> was<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.050> undid<00:04:28.050> one<00:04:28.920> of

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
get to so what I did was I undid one of

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.300 
get to so what I did was I undid one of
the<00:04:29.160> front<00:04:29.820> bumper<00:04:30.000> cover<00:04:30.530> corner<00:04:31.530> bolt<00:04:31.860> here

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
and a couple of the support bolts

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.150 
and a couple of the support bolts
underneath<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:36.230> pulled<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.530> front<00:04:37.800> bumper

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
underneath and pulled the front bumper

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.820 
underneath and pulled the front bumper
cover<00:04:38.190> out<00:04:38.730> a<00:04:38.760> little<00:04:39.450> bit<00:04:39.690> just<00:04:40.260> enough<00:04:40.590> to

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
cover out a little bit just enough to

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.440 
cover out a little bit just enough to
get<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.280> this<00:04:44.870> just<00:04:45.870> enough<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.350> get<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.680> this

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
get to this just enough to get to this
