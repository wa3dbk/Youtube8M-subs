kill<00:00:06.999> her<00:00:07.180> it's<00:00:07.689> not<00:00:07.930> a<00:00:07.959> malignant<00:00:08.410> tumor<00:00:08.710> but

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370 
kill her it's not a malignant tumor but

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.129 
kill her it's not a malignant tumor but
grows<00:00:09.849> and<00:00:10.210> grows<00:00:10.299> and<00:00:10.420> grows<00:00:10.660> and<00:00:10.990> then<00:00:11.049> you

have to ask why has she got it why has

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.810 
have to ask why has she got it why has
she<00:00:13.990> got<00:00:14.259> it<00:00:14.349> mulling<00:00:14.679> me<00:00:14.860> in<00:00:15.070> her<00:00:15.280> lower<00:00:15.549> jaw

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
she got it mulling me in her lower jaw

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.279 
she got it mulling me in her lower jaw
but<00:00:16.180> also<00:00:16.359> in<00:00:16.600> her<00:00:16.720> upper<00:00:16.960> jaw<00:00:17.109> in<00:00:17.230> a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
but also in her upper jaw in a

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.189 
but also in her upper jaw in a
completely<00:00:17.830> separate<00:00:18.130> place<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.510> just<00:00:19.720> the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
completely separate place it's just the

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.050 
completely separate place it's just the
story<00:00:20.529> you're<00:00:20.769> gonna<00:00:20.920> hear<00:00:21.220> is<00:00:21.460> any<00:00:21.609> part<00:00:21.939> of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
story you're gonna hear is any part of

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.330 
story you're gonna hear is any part of
the<00:00:22.150> story<00:00:22.359> it's<00:00:22.840> in<00:00:22.990> the<00:00:23.080> middle<00:00:23.470> because

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
the story it's in the middle because

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.269 
the story it's in the middle because
she's<00:00:25.150> had<00:00:25.330> surgery<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:26.109> Zimbabwe<00:00:26.740> beforehand

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
she's had surgery in Zimbabwe beforehand

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.220 
she's had surgery in Zimbabwe beforehand
where<00:00:27.730> they're<00:00:27.880> taking<00:00:28.179> away<00:00:28.240> half<00:00:28.960> of<00:00:29.109> her

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
where they're taking away half of her

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.019 
where they're taking away half of her
lower<00:00:29.410> jaw<00:00:29.679> completely<00:00:30.250> because<00:00:30.849> that's

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
lower jaw completely because that's

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.750 
lower jaw completely because that's
where<00:00:31.179> it<00:00:31.269> started<00:00:31.750> so<00:00:32.559> when<00:00:32.890> she<00:00:33.040> saw<00:00:33.219> me<00:00:33.460> she

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
where it started so when she saw me she

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.810 
where it started so when she saw me she
only<00:00:34.149> had<00:00:34.510> half<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.379> jaw<00:00:35.680> but<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.579> jaw

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
only had half of the jaw but that jaw

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.660 
only had half of the jaw but that jaw
was<00:00:37.030> completely<00:00:37.660> eroded<00:00:38.230> away<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:39.039> taken

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
was completely eroded away and taken

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.450 
was completely eroded away and taken
over<00:00:39.760> by<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.210> benign<00:00:40.719> tumor<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.410> then<00:00:42.129> she

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
over by the benign tumor and then she

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.869 
over by the benign tumor and then she
had<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.730> in<00:00:42.879> her<00:00:43.030> upper<00:00:43.300> jaw<00:00:43.480> as<00:00:43.629> well<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.879> first

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
had it in her upper jaw as well so first

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.010 
had it in her upper jaw as well so first
of<00:00:46.030> all<00:00:46.149> questions<00:00:46.809> why<00:00:47.670> why<00:00:48.690> did<00:00:49.690> she<00:00:49.719> have

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
of all questions why why did she have

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.119 
of all questions why why did she have
this<00:00:50.199> tumor<00:00:50.590> which<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.800> normally<00:00:50.920> only

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
this tumor which you normally only

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.150 
this tumor which you normally only
occurs<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.699> one<00:00:51.910> place<00:00:52.180> in<00:00:53.020> two<00:00:53.680> separate

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
occurs in one place in two separate

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.840 
occurs in one place in two separate
parts<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.460> her<00:00:54.550> body

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
parts of her body

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.670 
parts of her body
why<00:00:55.270> didn't<00:00:55.570> it<00:00:55.600> occur<00:00:55.930> elsewhere<00:00:56.140> into<00:00:56.590> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
why didn't it occur elsewhere into the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.250 
why didn't it occur elsewhere into the
body<00:00:56.890> so<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:58.000> lots<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.570> lots<00:00:58.690> of<00:00:58.780> questions

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
body so it lots and lots of questions

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.200 
body so it lots and lots of questions
and<00:00:59.469> I'll<00:00:59.800> come<00:01:00.010> back<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.640> charity<00:01:01.059> of<00:01:01.149> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
and I'll come back to the charity of the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.160 
and I'll come back to the charity of the
moment<00:01:01.570> related<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.789> then<00:01:04.170> because

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
moment related to that so then because

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.490 
moment related to that so then because
it<00:01:05.680> occupied<00:01:06.220> all<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.880> her<00:01:07.000> upper<00:01:07.240> jaw<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.750> all

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
it occupied all of her upper jaw and all

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.440 
it occupied all of her upper jaw and all
of<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.740> remnant<00:01:09.100> of<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.250> lower<00:01:09.490> jaw<00:01:09.760> if<00:01:10.210> I'd

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
of the remnant of the lower jaw if I'd

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.660 
of the remnant of the lower jaw if I'd
taken<00:01:10.780> out<00:01:11.050> all<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.440> tumor<00:01:11.830> she<00:01:12.490> would<00:01:12.580> have

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
taken out all the tumor she would have

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.090 
taken out all the tumor she would have
had<00:01:12.880> no<00:01:13.150> face<00:01:13.450> now<00:01:14.230> we<00:01:14.620> can<00:01:14.830> certainly

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
had no face now we can certainly

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.910 
had no face now we can certainly
reconstruct<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.030> whole<00:01:16.240> jewel

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
reconstruct a whole jewel

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.640 
reconstruct a whole jewel
we<00:01:17.920> could<00:01:18.100> certainly<00:01:18.450> reconstruct<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:20.410> upper

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
we could certainly reconstruct the upper

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.070 
we could certainly reconstruct the upper
jaw<00:01:20.830> but<00:01:21.310> I've<00:01:21.490> never<00:01:21.760> reconstructed<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.810> whole

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
jaw but I've never reconstructed a whole

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.080 
jaw but I've never reconstructed a whole
face<00:01:23.470> all<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.370> way<00:01:24.400> through<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.970> come<00:01:27.970> out

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
face all the way through and come out

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.300 
face all the way through and come out
with<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.390> good<00:01:28.630> result<00:01:28.960> so<00:01:29.770> what<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.070> was<00:01:30.280> trying

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
with a good result so what I was trying

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.240 
with a good result so what I was trying
to<00:01:30.610> do<00:01:30.820> was<00:01:31.270> in<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.930> first<00:01:32.170> operation<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:33.100> be

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
to do was in the first operation to be

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.530 
to do was in the first operation to be
bulky<00:01:33.550> completely<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:36.130> allow<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.210> normal

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
bulky completely and to allow the normal

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.180 
bulky completely and to allow the normal
bone<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.930> grow<00:01:38.110> because<00:01:38.320> what<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.680> did<00:01:38.890> find

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
bone to grow because what we did find

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.970 
bone to grow because what we did find
was<00:01:40.060> we<00:01:40.240> found<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.750> she<00:01:40.810> had<00:01:41.020> over<00:01:41.440> activity

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
was we found that she had over activity

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.060 
was we found that she had over activity
or<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.790> parathyroid<00:01:43.210> gland<00:01:43.930> as<00:01:44.110> a<00:01:44.140> neck<00:01:44.410> and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
or the parathyroid gland as a neck and

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.830 
or the parathyroid gland as a neck and
that<00:01:45.250> parathyroid<00:01:46.060> gland<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.450> neck<00:01:46.690> was

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
that parathyroid gland in the neck was

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.950 
that parathyroid gland in the neck was
producing<00:01:47.640> parathyroid<00:01:48.640> hormone<00:01:49.090> which

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
producing parathyroid hormone which

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.520 
producing parathyroid hormone which
breaks<00:01:50.380> down<00:01:50.560> bone<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.790> release<00:01:51.820> calcium<00:01:52.530> you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
breaks down bone to release calcium you

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.990 
breaks down bone to release calcium you
look<00:01:53.770> at<00:01:53.920> bone<00:01:54.190> there's<00:01:54.640> something<00:01:54.970> that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
look at bone there's something that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000 
look at bone there's something that
holds<00:01:55.330> your<00:01:55.570> body<00:01:55.720> together<00:01:56.080> but<00:01:56.860> actually

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
holds your body together but actually

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.370 
holds your body together but actually
the<00:01:57.820> physiology<00:01:58.150> of<00:01:58.450> your<00:01:58.630> body

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
the physiology of your body

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.260 
the physiology of your body
it's<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.740> massive<00:02:00.190> store<00:02:00.430> of<00:02:00.520> calcium<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it's a massive store of calcium the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's a massive store of calcium the
calcium<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.870> vitally<00:02:02.290> important<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:02.830> nerve

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
calcium is vitally important in nerve

function in heart function if you have

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.470 
function in heart function if you have
too<00:02:06.130> high<00:02:06.160> calcium<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:07.000> could<00:02:07.180> die<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.360> a

heart attack if you have too low calcium

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.490 
heart attack if you have too low calcium
you<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.820> die<00:02:09.940> of<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.119> heart<00:02:10.240> attack<00:02:10.390> so<00:02:11.050> what

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you can die of a heart attack so what

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.050 
you can die of a heart attack so what
was<00:02:11.620> happening<00:02:12.040> here<00:02:12.400> was<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.790> this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
was happening here was that this

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.390 
was happening here was that this
parathyroid<00:02:13.990> tumor<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.950> benign<00:02:15.370> tumor

parathyroid tumor a benign tumor
completely<00:02:16.300> separate<00:02:16.660> tumor<00:02:17.020> was<00:02:17.530> over

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
completely separate tumor was over

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
completely separate tumor was over
producing<00:02:18.340> parathyroid<00:02:18.940> hormone<00:02:19.270> which<00:02:19.540> is

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
producing parathyroid hormone which is

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.870 
producing parathyroid hormone which is
breaking<00:02:19.930> down<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> wall<00:02:20.560> PO<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.280> imagine

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
breaking down the wall PO and I imagine

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.450 
breaking down the wall PO and I imagine
that<00:02:22.240> he<00:02:22.300> was<00:02:22.420> allowing<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.920> tumor<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.430> grow

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
that he was allowing this tumor to grow

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.400 
that he was allowing this tumor to grow
and<00:02:24.790> grow<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.060> grow<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.050> thought<00:02:26.260> right

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
and grow and grow so I thought right

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.400 
and grow and grow so I thought right
we'll<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.130> multi<00:02:27.520> completely<00:02:28.120> down<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> more

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
we'll do multi completely down to a more

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.980 
we'll do multi completely down to a more
walking<00:02:29.830> face<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:31.209> we<00:02:31.450> would<00:02:31.540> take<00:02:31.720> out<00:02:31.900> the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
walking face and we would take out the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.110 
walking face and we would take out the
parathyroid<00:02:32.260> chew<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:33.640> did<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.970> and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
parathyroid chew and we did that and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.470 
parathyroid chew and we did that and
then<00:02:34.810> two<00:02:35.050> years<00:02:35.200> later<00:02:35.320> she<00:02:35.740> came<00:02:36.070> back<00:02:36.480> just

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
then two years later she came back just

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.220 
then two years later she came back just
as<00:02:37.660> bad<00:02:37.870> as<00:02:38.020> before<00:02:38.700> so<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:40.090> we<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.080> this

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
as bad as before so then we have this

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.290 
as bad as before so then we have this
dilemma<00:02:41.590> did<00:02:41.890> we<00:02:41.980> keep<00:02:42.190> doing<00:02:42.790> these<00:02:42.910> kind<00:02:43.239> of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
dilemma did we keep doing these kind of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.540 
dilemma did we keep doing these kind of
things<00:02:43.410> or<00:02:44.410> do<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.650> do<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.830> radical<00:02:45.130> operation

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
things or do we do a radical operation

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.790 
things or do we do a radical operation
where<00:02:46.390> there's<00:02:46.540> no<00:02:46.750> chance<00:02:47.050> of<00:02:47.320> giving<00:02:47.470> her<00:02:47.770> a

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
where there's no chance of giving her a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.199 
where there's no chance of giving her a
reconstruction<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.760> going<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> be

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
reconstruction that is going to be

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.320 
reconstruction that is going to be
highly<00:02:49.959> successful<00:02:51.660> or<00:02:52.739> do<00:02:53.739> we<00:02:53.890> try<00:02:54.330> looking

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
highly successful or do we try looking

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.360 
highly successful or do we try looking
at<00:02:55.510> bone<00:02:55.840> physiology<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:56.739> I<00:02:56.770> sent<00:02:57.160> her<00:02:57.220> off<00:02:57.250> to

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
at bone physiology so I sent her off to

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.490 
at bone physiology so I sent her off to
Birmingham<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.000> found<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.540> head<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.989> boner

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
Birmingham I found the head of the boner

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.260 
Birmingham I found the head of the boner

Center affirming to see him and he said

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.050 
Center affirming to see him and he said
let's<00:03:05.140> try<00:03:05.290> some<00:03:05.620> by<00:03:06.130> Ausmus<00:03:06.580> no<00:03:06.790> those<00:03:06.940> are

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
let's try some by Ausmus no those are

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.080 
let's try some by Ausmus no those are
very<00:03:07.180> common<00:03:07.480> drugs<00:03:07.959> now<00:03:08.200> they<00:03:08.530> didn't<00:03:08.769> work

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
very common drugs now they didn't work

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.060 
very common drugs now they didn't work
he<00:03:10.090> said<00:03:10.330> have<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:10.840> all<00:03:10.989> thought<00:03:11.260> because<00:03:11.920> this

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
he said have we all thought because this

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.640 
he said have we all thought because this
is<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.250> be<00:03:12.700> fed<00:03:13.090> by<00:03:13.269> blood<00:03:13.540> vessels<00:03:13.989> and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
is a be fed by blood vessels and

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.070 
is a be fed by blood vessels and
nowadays<00:03:14.890> we're<00:03:15.400> producing<00:03:15.970> antibodies<00:03:16.360> in

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
nowadays we're producing antibodies in

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.289 
nowadays we're producing antibodies in
human<00:03:17.620> surgery<00:03:18.250> which<00:03:18.370> is<00:03:18.489> what<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.700> personally

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
human surgery which is what I personally

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.289 
human surgery which is what I personally
mainly<00:03:19.810> did<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.310> do<00:03:21.400> do<00:03:21.670> people<00:03:22.120> who<00:03:22.180> have

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
mainly did but I do do people who have

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.759 
mainly did but I do do people who have
their<00:03:22.450> faces<00:03:22.630> shot<00:03:22.989> off<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.380> things<00:03:23.650> like

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
their faces shot off and things like

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.340 
their faces shot off and things like
that<00:03:23.830> blast<00:03:24.310> interest<00:03:24.760> -<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:26.140> you've<00:03:26.320> seen

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
that blast interest - and as you've seen

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.170 
that blast interest - and as you've seen
I<00:03:26.739> was<00:03:26.860> operating<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.310> people<00:03:27.640> like<00:03:27.730> tolerate

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
I was operating on people like tolerate

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.039 
I was operating on people like tolerate
from<00:03:28.360> time<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.660> time<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.400> thought<00:03:31.049> why

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
from time to time but I thought why

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.949 
from time to time but I thought why
don't<00:03:32.080> we<00:03:32.590> try<00:03:32.920> using<00:03:33.549> an<00:03:33.730> antibody<00:03:34.180> against

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
don't we try using an antibody against

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.190 
don't we try using an antibody against
blood<00:03:35.170> vessels<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.790> we<00:03:37.000> stop<00:03:37.750> blood

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
blood vessels so that we stop blood

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.370 
blood vessels so that we stop blood
vessels<00:03:38.560> forming<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> feed<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:40.299> tumor<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
vessels forming to feed this tumor and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.410 
vessels forming to feed this tumor and
together<00:03:41.769> we<00:03:42.100> did<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.820> she's<00:03:43.269> now

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
together we did that and she's now

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.750 
together we did that and she's now
started<00:03:43.989> on<00:03:44.080> this<00:03:44.200> drug<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.650> Basten<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.340> we

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
started on this drug to Basten and we

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.699 
started on this drug to Basten and we
hope<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.570> that's<00:03:46.750> going<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.049> damp<00:03:47.320> down<00:03:47.440> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
hope that that's going to damp down the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.070 
hope that that's going to damp down the
whole<00:03:47.860> process<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:49.299> you're<00:03:49.510> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.750> watch<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
whole process so you're going to watch a

certainly<00:06:27.490> know<00:06:28.420> you<00:06:29.290> I<00:06:29.530> had<00:06:29.680> a<00:06:29.710> hip

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
certainly know you I had a hip

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.800 
certainly know you I had a hip
replacement<00:06:30.010> last<00:06:30.670> year<00:06:30.940> you<00:06:31.270> can<00:06:31.450> have<00:06:31.660> it

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
replacement last year you can have it

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.860 
replacement last year you can have it
cemented<00:06:32.440> you<00:06:33.040> could<00:06:33.220> just<00:06:33.430> have<00:06:33.670> the<00:06:34.330> surface

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
cemented you could just have the surface

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.990 
cemented you could just have the surface
replaced<00:06:35.320> not<00:06:35.800> the<00:06:36.010> whole<00:06:36.190> thing<00:06:36.220> shoved<00:06:36.820> into

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 
replaced not the whole thing shoved into

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.180 
replaced not the whole thing shoved into
your<00:06:37.120> femur<00:06:37.480> you<00:06:38.050> could<00:06:38.260> have<00:06:38.530> it<00:06:38.710> with<00:06:38.890> a

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
your femur you could have it with a

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.620 
your femur you could have it with a
metal<00:06:39.640> surface<00:06:39.850> you<00:06:40.120> can<00:06:40.240> have<00:06:40.360> it<00:06:40.450> with<00:06:40.600> a

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
metal surface you can have it with a

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.390 
metal surface you can have it with a
ceramic<00:06:40.990> service<00:06:41.500> you<00:06:41.800> can<00:06:41.950> have<00:06:42.070> it<00:06:42.160> with<00:06:42.250> all

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
ceramic service you can have it with all

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.860 
ceramic service you can have it with all
sorts<00:06:42.430> of<00:06:42.760> different<00:06:43.060> things<00:06:43.090> which<00:06:43.660> is<00:06:43.840> the

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
sorts of different things which is the

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.080 
sorts of different things which is the
best<00:06:44.170> we<00:06:44.890> don't<00:06:45.100> know<00:06:45.310> why<00:06:45.640> don't<00:06:45.700> we<00:06:45.850> know

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
best we don't know why don't we know

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.660 
best we don't know why don't we know
because<00:06:46.540> they've<00:06:46.810> never<00:06:46.990> be<00:06:47.200> compared

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
because they've never be compared

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.879 
because they've never be compared
because<00:06:48.670> surgeons<00:06:49.420> who<00:06:49.510> are<00:06:49.540> doing

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
because surgeons who are doing

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.489 
because surgeons who are doing
so<00:06:50.099> all<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.759> ceramics<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.300> best<00:06:51.509> that<00:06:51.960> metal

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
so all the ceramics the best that metal

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.920 
so all the ceramics the best that metal
hip<00:06:52.650> crap<00:06:53.069> I'm<00:06:53.310> not<00:06:53.460> using<00:06:53.639> that<00:06:53.789> so<00:06:54.780> they're

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
hip crap I'm not using that so they're

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.640 
hip crap I'm not using that so they're
never<00:06:55.169> prepared<00:06:55.650> to<00:06:55.860> do<00:06:56.009> it<00:06:57.080> so<00:06:58.080> we<00:06:58.199> don't<00:06:58.229> do

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
never prepared to do it so we don't do

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.219 
never prepared to do it so we don't do
the<00:06:58.860> research<00:06:59.159> so<00:06:59.610> that's<00:06:59.849> what<00:07:00.150> we<00:07:00.330> do<00:07:00.599> we<00:07:01.199> are

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
the research so that's what we do we are

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:05.330 
the research so that's what we do we are
going<00:07:01.620> to<00:07:01.770> have<00:07:01.949> four<00:07:02.249> million<00:07:02.580> patients
