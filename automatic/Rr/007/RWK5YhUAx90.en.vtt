00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.810
 the guitar drummer 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:22.829
 to test it card what are we going to wear 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:24.900
 on a third group that you come on 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.249
 breaks this rhythm into eight doubles 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 eighth 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.759
 especially that eighths so all 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.499
 two sixteenths we have a ride 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:43.260
 with the right hand that will fall 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:43.470
 on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 on the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.450
 1 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.480
 we are going to have a bass drum 4 5 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.130
 6 7 8 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.300
 the 3 4 5 6 7 8 will have understood this is 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.650
 really the hardest part 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.480
 it's of course the 2nd we have a shot 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.199
 of bass tom with our left hand and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.199
 all this has become accentuated 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:17.130
 4 5 6 7 8 4 5 6 7 8 on the 3 us 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:24.359
 have nothing else that so rall 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.289
 too much like this then follows on course 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.289
 a bass drum 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.499
 6.8 on leucate so the second time 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.280
 the song as we count 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:52.299
 semiquaver 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:55.640
 we have a snare drum accented 6 7 8 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.259
 on the 6th so right after the checkout 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.259
 clear we have a bass drum tale 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:16.760
 it's not easy to do 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.250
 a little toasted hunger by showing you 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.260
 already the last hit sure the set one has a 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.060
 rule alone and on the 8 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:33.970
 we're going with your left hand a 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:33.970
 tom shot and 3,4
