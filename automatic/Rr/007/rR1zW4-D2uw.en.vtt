00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 Yes jay lytro color 6 I think that many people know this 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.370
 Focus on everything camera This topic camera nitro is also a little 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.370
 Because I was able to borrow only during 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 I also want to show that I tried to shoot a lot 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.020
 Parallel the focus from after I Kedomo I have a little bit and say the focus is misleading to all 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.320
 I can do it 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.430
 In how much I usually here from after but I'm sure does not fit here Once the match focus here 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.430
 Can also change 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.200
 I'm a little hard way I'm going to Yup I got a lip in the gap 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.010
 I also will I want but I look at the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:44.750
 This is a large aperture of the lens I lens and comes with a Although filters of the screw 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.129
 There are also holes in the tripod along the school fence 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.809
 It is an interchangeable lens style but it is a style similar to single-lens reflex camera 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:59.119
 I also have an accessory shoe with electrical contacts and when I open this lid 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.030
 usb 3.0 too connector then there is a slot for sd card 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:03.280
 Those of a liquid crystal 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.130
 Hahaha, this is 90 degrees 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.000
 It is easy to take even at a low angle that unfolds. A large lens hood with a flower shape is attached. 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.729
 I am 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.450
 The power button shutter button basically splashing operation is I know I touch panel 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.270
 The shooting mode is interesting and pp is a program. 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:27.409
 There is an ism but s is a shutter m is a manual 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.189
 There 's a love going on, it 's even more priority 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:34.850
 There's no movie in it, so there's no aperture priority mode . 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:40.369
 It is written here, but it is fixed to f 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.260
 It's a fixed aperture, so it's probably because you can mess around after non-social vibrations, but 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.570
 Drive mode has a single car and continuous fire. 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.570
 Even by train, it is not so early 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.200
 this 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.260
 I wonder if you hear the shutter and then winning streak at this speed 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.810
 Influence There are two ring in the same part 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.260
 The thinner one is the focus and the thicker one does not say that the zoom changes the spin and later 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.720
 The 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.500
 There is why the graph here and it is once you do there is a focus ring peaking 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.039
 Better 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.420
 The focus is 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:19.129
 It's getting easier to sell, so why is it focused? 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:24.170
 So it does not have to say I fit into focus Well how much all of the range in anything 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.640
 It does not fit because there is also a part in the part I mean saying tailored here to the absolute focus 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 I hope to match 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:34.370
 Even af not just be manual 4 the number I spoke of the focus ring 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.370
 There is exactly when you press sutter halfway 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.690
 could hear 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.719
 Press the shutter half 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.840
 Af also at a proper speed than I thought 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:59.880
 The value of the zoom will go up here 30% displayed on the LCD 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:02.020
 Well, it's a refugee saying 250mm 30mm to 250mm zoom 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.280
 30 mm at the wide-angle end 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:11.560
 I feel like it's a bit narrow in recent days 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:17.110
 But if you move it to the telephoto side, this camera is decided to be absolutely interesting 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.430
 Because it can be messed up after focusing, it will be a composition that can not be messed up for wide spread. 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.010
 There are many things 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:28.489
 The picture I took was a touch panel here 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:31.670
 You can move the focus with and the focus moves where you touch 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:37.579
 Wonder if hard to understand you do you know I'd 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:40.549
 But after all I did not just imitate lightle, but what to do with this person who took it with a PC 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.420
 It's like this, but it's also attractive 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.420
 to be continued
