00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello to all youtube friends welcome back 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.920
 on tom's hardware 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.540
 today I talk about a device from 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.690
 gaming therefore dedicated to gamers 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.230
 of razer in particular the tartarus 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.230
 quaver 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.279
 in the past we have already known the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.410
 chroma series with the age for the mouse from 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.050
 gaming we saw a few months ago 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.210
 and this this device refers to 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.609
 just to the series characterized by the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.220
 color here with chroma lighting 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.140
 precisely to 16.8 million colors 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.940
 for those of you who don't know well or 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.940
 bad what it is this is a 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.579
 keypad or a replacement to the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.870
 classic keyboard that optimizes again 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.879
 more what are the rates that 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.370
 we are going to get us gamers in 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.170
 then play the classic vase and the one 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.750
 that we use to move all the more 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.070
 functions and possibly the macros that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.890
 we can use during ours 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.650
 games as you see in fact includes well 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.570
 25 fully programmable keys that 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.549
 they are practically in correspondence with 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.619
 the classic keyboard keys in the 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:08.500
 left part in more on the right side 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.240
 of the keypad we have a acting trackpad 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.520
 even the scroll wheel more 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 two other programmable keys the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.350
 wrist rest and ergonomically fantastic 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.090
 in addition it can also be adjusted for 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.960
 reach the position we most 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.149
 pleases 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.090
 as mentioned once attached to the pc 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.740
 tartar is configured by default as the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.450
 then left side of the keyboard 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.700
 we have the first three keys to the left which 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.009
 the block is exactly the tab 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.289
 capitalization the normal shift plus i 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.399
 classic wise and all the other keys 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.659
 that are around us 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.149
 we can also set a number 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.679
 limited macro and game profiles 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.210
 therefore going to satisfy all the 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.280
 our gamer needs 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.710
 another very important point el 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.689
 anti ghosting that on a device of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.759
 gender is essential especially for 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.429
 don't run into bad experiences 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.859
 during our games during maybe 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.479
 even those that are more agitated 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.569
 obviously like all the products the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.670
 razer is perfectly compatible with the 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.920
 synapse software so we have a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.959
 customization characterization of 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.049
 our device as of all 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.849
 our the complete gamer setting e 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.829
 since it is obviously a peripheral device 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.750
 for fans also the price will be 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.579
 adequate fact tartar sow 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.680
 we can find on the official website that 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.200
 I leave you when in description about 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.000
 100 euros while if we want the version 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.700
 the previous one does not collapse 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.150
 without lighting to 16.8 million 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.400
 colors 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.290
 we can find it at around 20 euros in 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.420
 less then more or less on the 80 euros 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
