00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.400 
kind of view of the piece mmm
I<00:02:04.569> grew<00:02:05.409> up<00:02:05.439> in<00:02:05.829> my<00:02:06.069> early<00:02:06.399> life<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:08.079> lived<00:02:08.289> in

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
I grew up in my early life we lived in

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.309 
I grew up in my early life we lived in
extremely<00:02:09.160> very<00:02:09.489> rural<00:02:09.759> area<00:02:10.360> with<00:02:10.630> ocean<00:02:11.140> and

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
extremely very rural area with ocean and

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.210 
extremely very rural area with ocean and
tides<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.239> sky<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.690> Beach<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.980> trees<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
tides and sky and Beach and trees and I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.839 
tides and sky and Beach and trees and I
think<00:02:19.060> that's<00:02:19.209> always<00:02:19.420> been<00:02:19.870> part<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.440> my<00:02:20.530> soul

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
think that's always been part of my soul

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.350 
think that's always been part of my soul
so<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:22.870> landscape<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:24.120> really<00:02:25.120> where<00:02:25.269> I'm

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
so the landscape is really where I'm

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.069 
so the landscape is really where I'm
coming<00:02:25.690> from<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:27.090> have<00:02:28.090> lots<00:02:28.359> of<00:02:28.510> projects

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
coming from I have lots of projects

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.370 
coming from I have lots of projects
running<00:02:29.319> around<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.920> my<00:02:30.250> mind<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:31.170> they<00:02:32.170> come

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
running around in my mind and they come

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.950 
running around in my mind and they come
out<00:02:32.410> gradually
