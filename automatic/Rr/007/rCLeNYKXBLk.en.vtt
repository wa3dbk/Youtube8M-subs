00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:23.050 

so<00:04:06.470> can<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:06.950> use<00:04:07.400> women<00:04:09.400> tripod<00:04:10.400> badly

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.120 

one<00:04:24.060> piece<00:04:24.330> duct<00:04:24.600> tape<00:04:24.840> disaster<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.890> is

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
one piece duct tape disaster this is

one piece duct tape disaster this is
probably<00:04:26.430> bigger<00:04:26.640> than<00:04:26.760> Giggy<00:04:28.880> take<00:04:29.880> that

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.650 

take<00:04:35.580> it<00:04:35.820> over<00:04:36.390> like<00:04:36.420> that<00:04:37.550> make<00:04:38.550> sure<00:04:38.660> tapani

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
take it over like that make sure tapani

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.500 
take it over like that make sure tapani
guitar<00:04:40.430> it's<00:04:41.430> pushed<00:04:41.730> in<00:04:41.910> when<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.210> do<00:04:42.330> this

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
guitar it's pushed in when you do this

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.160 
guitar it's pushed in when you do this
so<00:04:44.420> it<00:04:45.420> actually<00:04:45.690> works<00:04:47.390> there<00:04:48.390> now<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:48.990> get

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
so it actually works there now you get

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.740 
so it actually works there now you get
the<00:04:49.290> back<00:04:49.410> side<00:04:49.740> down<00:04:50.180> I've<00:04:51.180> hooked<00:04:51.300> over<00:04:51.540> you

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
the back side down I've hooked over you

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.190 
the back side down I've hooked over you
can<00:04:51.900> do<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:52.320> all<00:04:52.740> four<00:04:53.250> sides<00:04:54.140> camera<00:04:55.140> is

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
can do it on all four sides camera is

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:06.470 
can do it on all four sides camera is
about<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.530> die<00:04:55.650> so<00:04:56.990> do<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:58.170> real<00:04:58.380> fast

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:34.810

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.080 
last I'm guessing all west until you buy
a<00:06:13.420> new<00:06:13.540> guitar<00:06:13.840> or<00:06:14.140> something<00:06:14.320> but<00:06:14.770> I<00:06:15.090> was
