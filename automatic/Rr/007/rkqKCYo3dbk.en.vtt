00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
this is more a discussion of how to

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.269 
this is more a discussion of how to
modify<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.070> sheath<00:00:30.679> this<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> pretty

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
modify this sheath this is a pretty

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.889 
modify this sheath this is a pretty
small<00:00:33.320> hole<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.710> belt<00:00:34.980> loop<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:36.149> doing<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
small hole for a belt loop and doing a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.750 
small hole for a belt loop and doing a
little<00:00:37.050> research<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.829> think<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.730> for

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
little research I think it's more for

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
little research I think it's more for
hooking<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> button<00:00:42.480> than<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.989> for

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
hooking it on a button than it is for

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.340 
hooking it on a button than it is for
putting<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> belt<00:00:44.100> either<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
putting it on a belt either that or the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
putting it on a belt either that or the
Swedish<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.820> skinny<00:00:48.149> belts

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600

reason<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> modify<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.860> just

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
reason I want to modify this is not just

firing<00:01:37.950> range<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.729> oddly<00:01:39.150> enough<00:01:39.240> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
firing range because oddly enough this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.840 
firing range because oddly enough this
is<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> only<00:01:40.590> place<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.280> go<00:01:41.460> see

like this and you're going to string one

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
like this and you're going to string one
of<00:02:06.870> them<00:02:07.340> through<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.490> other<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:10.740> that<00:02:11.250> it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
of them through the other so that it

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.120 
of them through the other so that it
looks<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:15.319> next<00:02:16.319> you'll<00:02:16.590> take<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.950> end

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
looks like this next you'll take the end

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.449 
looks like this next you'll take the end
of<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> cords<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.360> pass<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.050> through

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
of one of the cords and pass it through

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:27.080 
of one of the cords and pass it through
the<00:02:20.459> loop<00:02:20.850> in<00:02:21.209> your<00:02:21.240> sheath<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.970> get

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the loop in your sheath so that you get

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.020 
the loop in your sheath so that you get
something<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.630> looks<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:27.959> that

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.020 

next<00:02:34.750> you'll<00:02:34.900> bring<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.230> ends<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.770> these

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
next you'll bring the ends of these

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.500 
next you'll bring the ends of these
upwards<00:02:37.030> towards<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.630> top<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> sheet<00:02:39.510> so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
upwards towards the top of the sheet so

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.050 
upwards towards the top of the sheet so
that<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> looks<00:02:40.990> like<00:02:41.200> that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.660 

and<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.810> next<00:02:49.110> step<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.709> tie<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:49.920> Solomon's

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
and the next step is to tie a Solomon's

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.600 
and the next step is to tie a Solomon's
bar<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.270> these<00:02:51.480> back<00:02:51.840> one's<00:02:52.170> over<00:02:52.950> these<00:02:53.220> two

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
bar with these back one's over these two

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.550 
bar with these back one's over these two
black<00:02:54.170> front<00:02:55.760> intercourse<00:02:56.760> strands<00:02:57.330> I'm<00:02:57.990> not

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
black front intercourse strands I'm not

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320 
black front intercourse strands I'm not
going<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.860> demonstrate<00:02:59.010> that<00:02:59.640> but<00:02:59.880> I'll<00:03:00.030> post

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
going to demonstrate that but I'll post

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.690 
going to demonstrate that but I'll post
a<00:03:00.540> link<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.990> some<00:03:01.470> other<00:03:01.560> youtube<00:03:02.069> vids<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.520> how

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
a link to some other youtube vids on how

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.380 
a link to some other youtube vids on how
to<00:03:02.760> tie<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> Solomon's<00:03:03.600> bar<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.910> next<00:03:06.090> thing

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
to tie a Solomon's bar the next thing

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.510 
to tie a Solomon's bar the next thing
you'll<00:03:06.540> do<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.989> tie<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> Celtic<00:03:07.890> button<00:03:08.310> knot

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
you'll do is tie a Celtic button knot

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.930 
you'll do is tie a Celtic button knot
with<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.420> two<00:03:10.200> loops<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.130> I'm<00:03:11.700> not

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
with the two loops here and I'm not

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.250 
with the two loops here and I'm not
going<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> demonstrate<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.900> but<00:03:13.140> I'll

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
going to demonstrate that but I'll

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.400 
going to demonstrate that but I'll
provide<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.680> link<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.280> how<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.459> do<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.410> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
provide a link to how to do that the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.190 
provide a link to how to do that the
next<00:03:16.590> step<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.400> pass<00:03:17.640> each<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.510> these<00:03:18.690> ends

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
next step is to pass each of these ends

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.520 
next step is to pass each of these ends
through<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.650> bottom<00:03:20.130> loop<00:03:20.370> here<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.350> both<00:03:22.350> of

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
through this bottom loop here so both of

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.030 
through this bottom loop here so both of
these<00:03:22.650> need<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.980> go<00:03:23.070> through<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.610> loop<00:03:25.040> and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
these need to go through that loop and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.990 
these need to go through that loop and
by<00:03:26.580> that<00:03:26.790> loop<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.180> mean<00:03:27.360> this<00:03:27.510> black<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:29.000> and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
by that loop I mean this black one and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.100 
by that loop I mean this black one and
it<00:03:30.150> helps<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.660> you<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:31.880> one<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.000> these<00:03:33.239> which

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
it helps if you have one of these which

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.840 
it helps if you have one of these which
it's<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:35.010> hemostat

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
it's just a hemostat

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.110 
it's just a hemostat
you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.300> usually<00:03:36.450> buy<00:03:36.720> hemostats<00:03:37.350> at<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
you can usually buy hemostats at a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.910 
you can usually buy hemostats at a
sporting<00:03:39.720> goods<00:03:39.750> store<00:03:39.959> typically<00:03:40.739> in<00:03:40.830> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
sporting goods store typically in the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.070 
sporting goods store typically in the
fishing<00:03:41.310> aisle<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.819> to<00:03:41.880> do<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.720> you

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
fishing aisle and to do it you just you

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.320 
fishing aisle and to do it you just you
just<00:03:43.110> kind<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.530> slide<00:03:43.800> through<00:03:44.100> here<00:03:44.340> grab<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
just kind of slide through here grab the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.030 
just kind of slide through here grab the
end<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.690> pull<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.959> through<00:03:45.989> do<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> same<00:03:46.860> with

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
end and pull it through do the same with

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.270 
end and pull it through do the same with
the<00:03:47.190> other<00:03:47.340> side<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:49.500> here<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.860> is<00:03:49.950> with<00:03:50.220> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the other side and here it is with the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.229 
the other side and here it is with the
two<00:03:50.670> strands<00:03:51.300> of<00:03:52.140> your<00:03:52.799> Solomon's<00:03:53.700> bar<00:03:53.910> pulled

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
two strands of your Solomon's bar pulled

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.270 
two strands of your Solomon's bar pulled
down<00:03:54.450> through<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.709> actually<00:03:56.100> what's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
down through this is actually what's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.330 
down through this is actually what's
going<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.519> form<00:03:56.760> your<00:03:56.880> belt<00:03:57.180> loop<00:03:57.420> or<00:03:57.829> from<00:03:58.829> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
going to form your belt loop or from the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.020 
going to form your belt loop or from the
loop<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.760> your<00:03:59.910> belt<00:04:00.090> goes<00:04:00.329> through<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:02.030> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
loop that your belt goes through and the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.910 
loop that your belt goes through and the
next<00:04:03.390> step<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.810> just<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:04.170> tie<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.410> square<00:04:04.799> knot

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
next step is just to tie a square knot

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.800 
next step is just to tie a square knot
with<00:04:05.370> these<00:04:05.579> two<00:04:05.820> ends<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.269> keep<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.630> from

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
with these two ends to keep it from

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.520 
with these two ends to keep it from
passing<00:04:07.019> back<00:04:07.470> up<00:04:07.680> through<00:04:07.950> there<00:04:08.959> next<00:04:09.959> after

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
passing back up through there next after

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.280 
passing back up through there next after
you've<00:04:10.650> tied<00:04:10.890> your<00:04:11.040> square<00:04:11.400> knot<00:04:11.610> these<00:04:12.290> two

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
you've tied your square knot these two

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.470 
you've tied your square knot these two
pieces<00:04:13.500> need<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.950> be<00:04:14.070> passed<00:04:14.459> back<00:04:14.790> through<00:04:14.850> to

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
pieces need to be passed back through to

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.590 
pieces need to be passed back through to
the<00:04:15.510> front<00:04:15.870> side<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.380> lake<00:04:16.680> sheet<00:04:17.600> like

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
the front side of the lake sheet like

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.030 
the front side of the lake sheet like
that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.950 

and<00:04:21.610> then<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:22.030> just<00:04:22.240> sheath<00:04:22.930> your<00:04:23.170> knife<00:04:24.960> and

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
and then you just sheath your knife and

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.880 
and then you just sheath your knife and
you're<00:04:26.650> gonna<00:04:26.740> tie<00:04:27.130> a<00:04:27.430> loop<00:04:28.380> around<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.710> knife

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
you're gonna tie a loop around the knife

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.270
