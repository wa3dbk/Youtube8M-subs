wondering about was a 10 by 13 so I had

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.560 
wondering about was a 10 by 13 so I had
a<00:00:36.690> couple<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.290> ideas<00:00:37.530> as<00:00:38.010> far<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.460> things<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
a couple of ideas as far as things that

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.180 
a couple of ideas as far as things that
you<00:00:39.660> could<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.770> fit<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.100> an

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you could kind of see what fit in an

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190 
you could kind of see what fit in an
interior<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> empty<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.170> now

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
interior so I have it empty right now

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.340 
interior so I have it empty right now

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
on the thickness and I'll post the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.170 
on the thickness and I'll post the
thickness<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.759> frame<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:23.180> macbook

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
thickness of this frame of your macbook

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.080 
thickness of this frame of your macbook
or<00:01:24.360> laptop<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.080> measures<00:01:25.650> 10<00:01:26.100> inches<00:01:26.130> by<00:01:26.640> 13

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
or laptop that measures 10 inches by 13

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.700 
or laptop that measures 10 inches by 13
inches<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:28.140> should<00:01:28.530> fit<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> bag<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:30.360> you

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
inches it should fit in the bag and you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.380 
inches it should fit in the bag and you
should<00:01:31.710> possibly<00:01:32.310> even<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.729> able<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> still

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
should possibly even be able to still

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
should possibly even be able to still
zip<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.860> this<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.220> hard<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> do

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
zip it up this is kind of hard to do

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.170 
zip it up this is kind of hard to do
with<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.320> hand<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.939> but<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.150> see

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
with just one hand here but you can see

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
with just one hand here but you can see
that<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.540> still<00:01:39.720> zips

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that it still zips

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.280 
that it still zips
so<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> photo<00:01:41.430> frame<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.090> fits<00:01:42.299> 10<00:01:43.140> by

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so this is a photo frame that fits 10 by

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560 
so this is a photo frame that fits 10 by
13<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.250> didn't<00:01:44.610> measure<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
13 and I didn't measure it it's not the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.749 
13 and I didn't measure it it's not the
interior<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.470> 13<00:01:46.829> it's<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.250> exterior

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
interior that's my 13 it's the exterior

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.389 
interior that's my 13 it's the exterior
of<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.210> frame<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.659> 10<00:01:48.840> by<00:01:48.990> 13<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:50.220> does

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
of this frame is 10 by 13 and it does

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.580 
of this frame is 10 by 13 and it does
fit<00:01:50.670> down<00:01:50.850> inside<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> total<00:01:51.630> totally<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
fit down inside the total totally and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.910

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.319 
that are this size that should still
work<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.290> also<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.040> tried<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.640> Toshiba<00:02:03.149> laptop

work I do also I tried my Toshiba laptop
and<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.560> 15<00:02:05.280> inches<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.180> based

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and it is 15 inches and then just based

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.760 
and it is 15 inches and then just based
off<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.780> measurements<00:02:07.200> at<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.350> total<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
off the measurements at the total you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.690 
off the measurements at the total you
can<00:02:07.920> tell<00:02:08.099> that's<00:02:08.280> not<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> work<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:10.700> my
