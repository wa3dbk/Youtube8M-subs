00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.860
 they were actually invented by 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.009
 peasants when there were the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.759
 invasions of the Turks because they were 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.560
 forced the peasants to hide 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.110
 with their agricultural products in the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 caves in the caves and I had to stay 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.420
 a long time that so many Turks do not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.489
 they went away 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.070
 and then they invented this bread which 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.330
 it took them months to be able to 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.330
 to survive let's say 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.810
 hey you 're there 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.900
 as in the cooking room we open 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.120
 bread norm of tar al tarallo that 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.400

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
 to get the pisanÃ² let's go 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.120
 this movement that once took place 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.370
 with string 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.750
 but now as we produce many 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.540
 of these for 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.350
 facilitate and speed up work 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.080
 we use this medium after where immediately 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:17.770
 chase I like it and it comes out of the 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:21.010

 now already low in temperature ea 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.110
 rest for 5 6 hours still so that 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.030
 it dries up all the moisture remains alone 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.030
 the dry part of the fisa 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.439
 use the old fashioned frisa 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.590

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.769
 salt a little oregano and eat it 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:54.659
