you<00:00:20.460> may<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:20.910> see<00:00:21.300> something<00:00:21.810> exactly<00:00:22.230> like

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
you may not see something exactly like

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
you may not see something exactly like
this<00:00:22.670> hopefully<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.820> pretty<00:00:24.060> close<00:00:24.330> though

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
this hopefully it's pretty close though

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
this hopefully it's pretty close though
because<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.109> works<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.470> well<00:00:25.939> first

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
because this one works really well first

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.630 
because this one works really well first
thing<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.269> notice<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.990> color<00:00:28.230> changes<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
thing we notice is the color changes the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.460 
thing we notice is the color changes the
black<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.060> orange<00:00:30.210> really<00:00:30.480> stands<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.109> makes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
black and orange really stands out makes

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.400 
black and orange really stands out makes
it<00:00:31.590> easier<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.009> see<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:33.420> me<00:00:33.570> easier<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> see

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it easier to see and to me easier to see

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
it easier to see and to me easier to see
means<00:00:34.680> easier<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> use<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.940> that's<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> big<00:00:36.450> plus

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
means easier to use so that's a big plus

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
means easier to use so that's a big plus
right<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:38.070> keys<00:00:38.460> themselves<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.329> do

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
right there the keys themselves I do

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
right there the keys themselves I do
believe<00:00:39.719> they're<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.960> same<00:00:40.230> color<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.829> uh

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
believe they're the same color but uh

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.030 
believe they're the same color but uh
they're<00:00:42.270> improved<00:00:42.870> their<00:00:43.200> their<00:00:43.530> sharper

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
they're improved their their sharper

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.910 
they're improved their their sharper
they<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.789> better<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.660> stand<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.200> more<00:00:46.260> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
they look better they stand out more so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.670 
they look better they stand out more so
that's<00:00:47.100> another<00:00:47.399> big<00:00:47.640> plus<00:00:48.079> voice<00:00:49.079> functions

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
that's another big plus voice functions

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.350 
that's another big plus voice functions
are<00:00:49.800> exactly<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> same<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.239> in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
