00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
about winning than about getting game

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
I would not go for the objective at all

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.110 
I would not go for the objective at all
but<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:30.800> said<00:02:30.860> before<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.760> am<00:02:31.880> playing

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
but like I said before if I am playing

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.610 
but like I said before if I am playing
solo<00:02:32.420> I'd<00:02:32.690> rather<00:02:32.840> go<00:02:33.020> play<00:02:33.230> free<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:33.560> all

solo I'd rather go play free for all

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.050 
solo I'd rather go play free for all
because<00:02:33.920> i<00:02:33.950> feel<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> chances<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.790> me

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
because i feel like the chances of me

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.540 
because i feel like the chances of me
winning<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.959> free-for-all<00:02:36.380> game<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.860> greater

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
winning a free-for-all game is greater

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.010 
winning a free-for-all game is greater
than<00:02:37.820> winning<00:02:38.300> a<00:02:38.360> team<00:02:38.600> based<00:02:38.750> game

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
than winning a team based game

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.330 
than winning a team based game
especially<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.530> hardcore<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.070> you<00:02:40.190> don't

somebody kills your teammate so I mean
if<00:02:47.570> they<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:47.989> call<00:02:48.170> out<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:48.470> they<00:02:48.560> don't

now<00:02:54.680> we're<00:02:54.800> planning<00:02:55.070> on<00:02:55.160> full<00:02:55.340> parties<00:02:55.700> I

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
now we're planning on full parties I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.259 
now we're planning on full parties I
honestly<00:02:56.420> think<00:02:56.959> it's<00:02:57.200> not<00:02:58.190> that<00:02:58.430> it's<00:02:58.610> easier

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
honestly think it's not that it's easier

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.150 
honestly think it's not that it's easier
not<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.750> it's<00:02:59.900> harder<00:03:00.290> but<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.070> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
not that it's harder but you have to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.580 
not that it's harder but you have to
share<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.400> kills<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.060> if<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.510> have<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:03.080> party

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
share the kills and if you have a party

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.590 
share the kills and if you have a party
full<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.739> six<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.340> are<00:03:04.370> these<00:03:05.000> players<00:03:05.360> on

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
full of six that are these players on

don't care about winning and you're just
going<00:05:22.590> for<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:22.860> straight-up<00:05:23.190> gameplays<00:05:23.640> I

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
going for a straight-up gameplays I

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.190 
going for a straight-up gameplays I
don't<00:05:23.970> think<00:05:24.000> that's<00:05:24.210> any<00:05:24.510> more<00:05:24.750> impressive

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
don't think that's any more impressive

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.140 
don't think that's any more impressive
than<00:05:25.229> getting<00:05:26.010> a<00:05:26.070> Kim<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.580> full<00:05:26.790> party<00:05:27.060> of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
than getting a Kim in a full party of

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.240 
than getting a Kim in a full party of
six<00:05:27.450> that's<00:05:27.960> just<00:05:28.200> my<00:05:28.350> opinion<00:05:28.380> I<00:05:28.890> mean<00:05:29.100> this

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
six that's just my opinion I mean this

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.500 
six that's just my opinion I mean this
game<00:05:29.460> play<00:05:29.610> right<00:05:29.820> here<00:05:29.970> is<00:05:30.090> probably<00:05:30.180> one<00:05:30.479> of

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
game play right here is probably one of

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.550 
game play right here is probably one of
the<00:05:30.630> best<00:05:30.810> game<00:05:31.020> plays<00:05:31.229> that<00:05:31.410> I've<00:05:31.530> ever

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
the best game plays that I've ever

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.020 
the best game plays that I've ever
gotten<00:05:31.890> i'm<00:05:32.100> only<00:05:32.250> running<00:05:32.430> with<00:05:32.640> two<00:05:32.760> people

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
gotten i'm only running with two people

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.570 
gotten i'm only running with two people
here<00:05:33.240> my<00:05:33.750> other<00:05:33.900> double<00:05:34.290> kim<00:05:34.470> i<00:05:34.740> actually<00:05:35.460> got

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
here my other double kim i actually got

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.950 
here my other double kim i actually got
in<00:05:35.700> a<00:05:35.760> full<00:05:35.940> party<00:05:36.240> which<00:05:36.360> it<00:05:36.510> was<00:05:36.630> kind<00:05:36.900> of

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
in a full party which it was kind of

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.780 
in a full party which it was kind of
like<00:05:37.080> pulling<00:05:37.470> teeth<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.950> i've<00:05:38.280> also<00:05:38.370> gotten

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
like pulling teeth and i've also gotten

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.219 
like pulling teeth and i've also gotten
Kim's<00:05:39.060> playing<00:05:39.419> with<00:05:39.570> just<00:05:39.720> one<00:05:39.870> other<00:05:39.900> person

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
Kim's playing with just one other person

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.620 
Kim's playing with just one other person
so<00:05:40.740> I<00:05:40.979> mean<00:05:41.430> it's<00:05:41.700> not<00:05:42.090> like<00:05:42.150> I'm<00:05:42.479> getting

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
so I mean it's not like I'm getting

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.930 
so I mean it's not like I'm getting
Kim's<00:05:43.250> because<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.700> full<00:05:44.910> team

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
Kim's because I have a full team

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.790 
Kim's because I have a full team
supporting<00:05:45.630> me<00:05:45.720> it's<00:05:45.960> quite<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.290> opposite

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
supporting me it's quite the opposite

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.530 
supporting me it's quite the opposite
but<00:05:47.130> I<00:05:47.160> think<00:05:47.520> personally<00:05:47.910> that's<00:05:48.210> probably

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
but I think personally that's probably

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.240 
but I think personally that's probably
the<00:05:48.720> best<00:05:48.900> compliment<00:05:49.200> that<00:05:49.620> I've<00:05:49.740> gotten<00:05:50.100> is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
the best compliment that I've gotten is

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.610 
the best compliment that I've gotten is
when<00:05:50.610> people<00:05:50.760> think<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.419> I<00:05:51.660> run<00:05:52.350> in<00:05:52.470> full

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
when people think that I run in full

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.469 
when people think that I run in full
parties<00:05:53.010> so<00:05:53.280> they<00:05:53.400> can<00:05:53.580> play<00:05:53.700> support<00:05:54.150> so<00:05:54.450> i

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
parties so they can play support so i

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.260 
parties so they can play support so i
can<00:05:54.750> get<00:05:54.870> good<00:05:55.020> game<00:05:55.229> plays<00:05:55.440> and<00:05:55.710> that<00:05:56.460> is<00:05:56.669> not

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
can get good game plays and that is not

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.210 
can get good game plays and that is not
