00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 People I am again one has one 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.410
 be changed in the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.179
 other indoor pool of us few people 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.790
 asked me what they are doing 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.330
 can do just about the pressure in the evening more 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
 too heavy 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.049
 they said yes I have no 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.119
 imprint 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.470
 it feels like it's moving 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.039
 i just can not do the water 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.600
 to grab 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.400
 Of course, there are different ones 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.769
 Exercises how to train the water feeling 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930
 I can just show you now 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 in short, two variants of this without 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 Tools can do it like that 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.360
 are actually good ours our hand 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.920
 when we swim have I poor 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 fingers do not have them but they do too 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.700
 not extremely compressed but 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 they are actually so relaxed 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.200
 next to each other to look for pressure 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.329
 build 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.710
 I'll just show you how to do it 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.539
 the whole thing can change 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 and finally the water feeling too 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.920
 we can strengthen once we were 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.989
 completely spread finger afterwards 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.780
 make the train with fist it floats 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.969
 has an effect that is me now 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 dragged plane take away and the plane 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.799
 naturally, so much less water 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.619
 I will have little expression 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.510
 and when I wake up then again 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.860
 the normal finger attitude surrounded 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.590
 I should actually have more imprint 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.090
 should I just short and 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.110
 always try to water-clear to you 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.110
 to show what I'm doing 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.280
 it has been that one possible 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.070
 I 'm pretty short again 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 bad feeling no water feelings 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.660
 Now I'm doing it with fist 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.560
 so 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.250
 Of course it can all of this 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.610
 reinforce or conceal hard 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.610
 do 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.350
 yes, and by now just times 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.880
 tried ok left hand I do the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.820
 language finger rights i did 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.470
 wrong or I always change it for 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.070
 Sensomotoric very demanding 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.110
 It was almost a step further 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:49.080
 now for me just a choice and 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.250
 spread makes twice fist twice 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.250
 Let's take a look 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.560
 a little question to you i could 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.170
 write in the comments 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.400
 what do you think you have then 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.260
 round less sensitive or less 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.629
 with spread fingers or with the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.760
 Just fist in the comments 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.769
 even if the critic or suggestions 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.200
 has thumbs up if it's you 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.150
 Please have a look at facebook 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.560
 Swim over faster and we 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.560
 See you again next technique video
