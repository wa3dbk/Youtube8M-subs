00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 honda hands not together and to 2009 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.899
 so in short, the work done is really 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.920
 extraordinary work done by franca 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.780
 bianconi and now the public welcome 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.710
 to the couple undermined by radio stories 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.109
 109 pickles other extraordinary couple 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.699
 what to say about their world champions 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.070
 We have said European champions 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.000
 national champions and have this 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.439
 beautiful short program angels and demons 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.630
 1 on their own too if they are 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.199
 particular very dramatic defined 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.199
 for them 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.460
 raised very high 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840
 just tolo 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:34.730
 applause for this thing the ice palace 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.379
 megasport of Moscow szolkowy del 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.000
 free program said it will be 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.620
 bitter to hate but I think in the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.140
 complex these programs are 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.450
 bitter to hate really think 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.299
 details in the construction of the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.640
 choice of music in costumes 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.379
 I personally love this pair no 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.840
 as few have seen puzzled 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.079
 yes because they have always used us 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.730
 of very particular programs and 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.049
 researched on a music that anyway 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.459
 eat visas i remember they have it 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.040
 also used an Italian couple 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.049
 nicole of the monica and yannick kocon that 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.269
 on these nights they had shown the 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.510
 fluidity proper of skating mi 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.909
 I was expecting from them maybe one 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.709
 more particular version is undoubtedly that 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.570
 be two extraordinary athletes who the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.340
 character and passion with which they have 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.590
 interpreted this music is 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.800
 the distinction between is indescribable 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.340
 the two characters the angel the demon e 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.500
 than from them 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.990
 maybe it's really when you have these 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.530
 these really important athletes really 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.080
 these myths at the end because it was 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.870
 present at skating level 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.090
 extremes you really expect every day 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.340
 to be surprised we go there to 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.889
 look at her but it is certain that a 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.440
 choreographic level to the idea they have 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.630
 presented the exceptional elements est 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.460
 technicians are very difficult 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.580
 presented look at the height of this 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.139
 jump launched is incredible 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.319
 this track I was thinking of 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.939
 knees that by dint of landing from 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:05.719
 these jumps sooner or later will suffer 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.819
 however she is very good at maintaining the 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:09.680
 control 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:12.710
 this the triple parallel toe loop has 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.259
 also performed this particularly 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.370
 well what really comes to me 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.580
 especially for what rightly so 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.370
 in the link then the trans in the transition 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.539
 there are between goals the other seems to me 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.370
 all quite original and sought after 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.139
 maybe the steps I saw them just now 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.280
 I was expecting something more 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.690
 fluid, however, is always my personal one 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.039
 for what I expected since then 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.669
 great expectations towards this 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:43.009
 couple queen is now the time of 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.360
 truth for them also as best 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.449
 seasonal score 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.210
 the slogan 59 45 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:55.060
 we see the score to beat here and 65 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.060
 17 thousand flights and alexander in the night 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:05.070
 Yup 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:09.450
 68 72 go to the first position with 36 and 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:11.730
 06 for the technical element 30 266 for the 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.790
 program components and therefore without any 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:18.830
 problem go to close the command 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.830
 this sport competition
