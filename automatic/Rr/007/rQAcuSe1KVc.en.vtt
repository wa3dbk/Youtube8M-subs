1st and 2nd string E minor to a minor to
the<00:00:46.840> 1st<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.550> try<00:00:48.730> pattern<00:00:49.059> for<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.719> song

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the 1st so the try pattern for the song

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.190 
the 1st so the try pattern for the song
for<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.340> two<00:00:51.550> beats<00:00:51.760> cards<00:00:52.360> will<00:00:52.809> be<00:00:52.930> playing

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
for the two beats cards will be playing

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.880 
for the two beats cards will be playing
something<00:00:53.559> that<00:00:53.770> goes<00:00:53.920> like<00:00:53.949> this<00:00:54.660> 3<00:00:55.660> 4<00:00:56.530> so<00:00:56.800> it

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
something that goes like this 3 4 so it

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.299 
something that goes like this 3 4 so it
goes<00:00:57.070> Y<00:00:57.579> to<00:00:58.570> downtown<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.770> then<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.010> change

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
goes Y to downtown and then you change

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.639 
goes Y to downtown and then you change
so<00:01:00.910> that's<00:01:01.030> two<00:01:01.390> down<00:01:01.570> strokes<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.170> down<00:01:02.379> up

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
so that's two down strokes and down up

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.150 
so that's two down strokes and down up
and<00:01:02.890> change<00:01:03.190> down<00:01:04.030> down<00:01:04.989> down

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
and change down down down

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.830 
and change down down down
you<00:01:06.399> change<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.880> next<00:01:07.030> clock

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.840 

so<00:01:14.229> that's<00:01:14.409> how<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.560> intro<00:01:14.860> sounds<00:01:15.100> like<00:01:15.280> for

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
so that's how the intro sounds like for

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.120 
so that's how the intro sounds like for
the<00:01:15.939> four<00:01:16.210> beats<00:01:16.420> rhyme<00:01:16.960> pattern<00:01:17.259> what<00:01:17.979> we'll

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
the four beats rhyme pattern what we'll

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.679 
the four beats rhyme pattern what we'll
do<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.460> just<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.990> this<00:01:20.200> down<00:01:21.060> down<00:01:22.060> up<00:01:22.420> down

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
do is just like this down down up down

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.880 
do is just like this down down up down
down<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:24.460> down<00:01:25.090> one<00:01:26.079> more<00:01:26.229> time<00:01:26.409> is<00:01:26.619> just

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
down down down one more time is just

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.420 
down down down one more time is just
down<00:01:27.659> down<00:01:28.659> up<00:01:29.049> down

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.880 

if<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:32.910> account<00:01:33.600> four<00:01:33.840> beats<00:01:34.050> this<00:01:34.710> run

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
if your account four beats this run

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.170 
if your account four beats this run
better<00:01:35.040> should<00:01:35.250> fall<00:01:35.460> within<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> four<00:01:35.970> beats

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
better should fall within the four beats

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.820 
better should fall within the four beats
so<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.780> ourselves<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.470> counting

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
so this ourselves like the counting

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:48.539 
so this ourselves like the counting
three<00:01:38.580> four<00:01:39.510> one<00:01:40.440> two<00:01:43.370> one

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.340 

so<00:01:49.390> this<00:01:49.539> is<00:01:49.659> how<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.869> sounds<00:01:49.960> like<00:01:50.170> for<00:01:50.289> the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
so this is how it sounds like for the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.560 
so this is how it sounds like for the
intro<00:01:50.679> three<00:01:51.250> for<00:01:52.149> G<00:01:53.109> a<00:01:54.390> minor<00:01:55.390> 7<00:01:56.219> G<00:01:57.219> minor<00:01:57.570> E

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
intro three for G a minor 7 G minor E

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.380 
intro three for G a minor 7 G minor E
minor<00:01:59.170> 7

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
minor 7

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.280 
minor 7
into<00:02:01.660> diverse<00:02:01.960> first<00:02:02.590> cut<00:02:02.860> involve<00:02:03.420> GPG<00:02:04.420> who

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
into diverse first cut involve GPG who

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.810 
into diverse first cut involve GPG who
makes<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.950> Sun<00:02:06.480> 8-7<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.780> rise<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.440> brings<00:02:09.399> and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
makes the Sun 8-7 to rise and brings and

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.230 
makes the Sun 8-7 to rise and brings and
breathing<00:02:10.660> earth<00:02:10.869> over<00:02:11.680> here<00:02:11.860> as<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.980> g<00:02:12.220> /b<00:02:12.520> so

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
breathing earth over here as a g /b so

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.150 
breathing earth over here as a g /b so
that's<00:02:13.390> basically<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.780> jihad<00:02:14.290> without<00:02:14.800> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
that's basically a jihad without the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.250 
that's basically a jihad without the
middle<00:02:15.400> finger<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.880> you'll<00:02:16.420> strum<00:02:16.930> from<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
middle finger and you'll strum from the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.540 
middle finger and you'll strum from the
fifth<00:02:17.530> string<00:02:17.830> down

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
fifth string down

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.120 
fifth string down
that's<00:02:19.970> how<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.150> sounds<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> dream<00:02:21.950> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
that's how it sounds like so a dream the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's how it sounds like so a dream the
earth<00:02:22.370> new<00:02:22.850> life<00:02:23.380> here's<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.440> c9<00:02:25.360> that's

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
earth new life here's a c9 that's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.180 
earth new life here's a c9 that's
basically<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> G<00:02:27.050> but<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.680> move<00:02:27.890> your<00:02:28.070> index

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
basically a G but you move your index

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.130 
basically a G but you move your index
and<00:02:28.490> middle<00:02:28.580> finger<00:02:28.970> down<00:02:29.150> one<00:02:29.570> string<00:02:29.870> each

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and middle finger down one string each

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.090 
and middle finger down one string each
