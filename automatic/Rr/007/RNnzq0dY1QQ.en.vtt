for it in exchange for losing a bit of
magazine<00:03:29.330> size<00:03:29.600> is<00:03:29.870> ridiculous<00:03:30.560> because<00:03:30.620> the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
magazine size is ridiculous because the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.410 
magazine size is ridiculous because the
core<00:03:30.920> similarly<00:03:31.340> has<00:03:31.490> like<00:03:31.670> no<00:03:31.820> recoil<00:03:32.210> it's

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
core similarly has like no recoil it's

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.760 
core similarly has like no recoil it's
got<00:03:32.540> crazy<00:03:32.810> high<00:03:33.020> fiery<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.530> one<00:03:33.650> of<00:03:33.710> the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
got crazy high fiery it's one of the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.960 
got crazy high fiery it's one of the
most<00:03:33.830> powerful<00:03:34.010> weapons<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.700> game<00:03:34.730> I

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
most powerful weapons in the game I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.580 
most powerful weapons in the game I
think<00:03:35.000> I<00:03:35.510> think<00:03:35.870> it's<00:03:35.960> right<00:03:36.050> along<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.410> same

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
think I think it's right along the same

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.250 
think I think it's right along the same
lines<00:03:36.620> as<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.270> ARX<00:03:38.270> hole<00:03:38.510> puncher<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:38.930> that

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
lines as the ARX hole puncher and that

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.020 
lines as the ARX hole puncher and that
it's<00:03:39.440> a<00:03:39.650> professional<00:03:40.520> variant<00:03:40.880> it's

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
it's a professional variant it's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.490 
it's a professional variant it's
actually<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.300> lot<00:03:41.420> better<00:03:41.660> than<00:03:41.930> all<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.260> elite

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
actually a lot better than all the elite

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.260 
actually a lot better than all the elite
variants<00:03:43.010> it's<00:03:43.160> just<00:03:43.340> ridiculously<00:03:44.000> good

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
variants it's just ridiculously good

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.610 
variants it's just ridiculously good
it's<00:03:44.480> ridiculously<00:03:44.870> powerful<00:03:45.020> super<00:03:45.440> map

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
it's ridiculously powerful super map

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.800 
it's ridiculously powerful super map
like<00:03:45.800> this<00:03:45.830> where<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:47.030> lot<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.330> the<00:03:47.420> time<00:03:47.660> of
