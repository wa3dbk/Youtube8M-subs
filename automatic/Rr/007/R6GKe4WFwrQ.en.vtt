00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.890
 In this chapter, we want it that way 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.530
 look at the named cityvision modeling 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.810
 and this will be in 4d cinema 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.910
 through the so-called hyperworks object 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.410
 implemented 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.780
 Let's take a look at this first 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.430
 Head model of a character 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.030
 and if we choose the model 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.200
 Here we get the polygon lines and 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.720
 can already see that it is 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.960
 this is a very high resolution and 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.300
 we are dealing with very fine polygon lattice 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.250
 so have very clean beautiful here 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.350
 rundungen 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.410
 and just like such fine details 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.660
 the eyelid or the ear we have 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.830
 beautiful curves and a very dense 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.830
 polygon grid 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.790
 if you like this object as it is here 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.160
 is modeled by hand so wanted eg 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.110
 with a cube beginning and divide 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.630
 then push in the right position 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.460
 then that would be a big deal 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.220
 effort and they would be the individual 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.990
 polygons probably hardly so nice round 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.810
 and get presented clean 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.420
 Therefore, this model was different 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.030
 proceeded and the actual polygon 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.970
 grid which was modeled is even 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.620
 not this one we see here 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.590
 Let's take a look at that 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.100
 object we find that in the list 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.680
 up here with the remaining objects only 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.870
 this object works in the case 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.870
 not with science but with polygons 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.980
 located in our ipad apps object 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 a polygon object and if we are 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.480
 We can choose this one 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.330
 actual polygon lines of ours 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.880
 Characteristics thus recognize the actual 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.930
 modeled shape of our head here 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.330
 we can also do the object times 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.590
 disable this green hook 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.510
 and then they can already recognize 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.820
 that the model is significantly less 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.240
 polygons owns and also clearly 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.190
 kantiger is zb here on the ear we have 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.200
 now this corner 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.030
 and also the eyes are not so 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.520
 beautiful as they were before 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.459
 the hyper net object ensures that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.160
 that these edges are interconnected 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.850
 and how much finer and 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.100
 3d rendered high resolution grid 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.950
 this method of modeling becomes 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.380
 activision modeling called man 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.870
 models the rough shape or the rough one 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.630
 surface and this surface becomes 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.600
 then subdivided society grazes in 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.640
 several smaller surfaces and these 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.830
 surfaces interconnecting 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.680
 and you get a nicer 3d 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.980
 object 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.750
 how the object works exactly now 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.230
 and how to model with its help 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.819
 can 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.329
 Let's take a look at the next one 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.329
