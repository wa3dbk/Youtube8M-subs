it<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.789> where's<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> evidence<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.510> there's

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it but where's the evidence that there's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.139 
it but where's the evidence that there's
a<00:00:57.719> UFO<00:00:58.020> we<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.829> an<00:00:58.980> opinion<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.550> everything

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
a UFO we have an opinion on everything

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
a UFO we have an opinion on everything
so<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.420> would<00:01:00.750> guess<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.770> opinion<00:01:02.280> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
so I would guess you have my opinion is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.800 
so I would guess you have my opinion is
I<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.640> no<00:01:02.969> opinion<00:01:03.539> on<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:05.659> what<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I have no opinion on this what do you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.330 
I have no opinion on this what do you
think<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.260> think<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> they're<00:01:07.799> real<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
think you think that they're real I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.070 
think you think that they're real I
think<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.450> hard<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.810> believe<00:01:10.049> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
think it's hard to believe that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.670 
think it's hard to believe that
everybody<00:01:10.680> has<00:01:11.130> been<00:01:11.790> lying<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.570> yes<00:01:13.260> okay

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
about it for logical point of view I'm

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.289 
about it for logical point of view I'm
at<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> same<00:01:16.950> point<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.400> mean<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:17.970> police

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
at the same point I mean you got police

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.210 
at the same point I mean you got police
chiefs<00:01:18.630> airline<00:01:19.049> captains<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.860> see<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
chiefs airline captains they see the

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.399 
chiefs airline captains they see the
lights<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> things<00:01:21.420> fly<00:01:21.810> near<00:01:22.020> them<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
lights and the things fly near them and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.770 
lights and the things fly near them and
they<00:01:22.500> zip<00:01:22.740> away<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.479> understand<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> they

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
they zip away I understand that they

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.230 
they zip away I understand that they
they<00:01:25.380> could<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.830> why<00:01:26.100> should<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.520> assume<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they could be why should I assume on a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
they could be why should I assume on a
logical<00:01:27.780> basis<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.290> there's<00:01:28.500> no<00:01:28.650> other

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
logical basis that there's no other

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
logical basis that there's no other
intelligent<00:01:29.400> life<00:01:29.430> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> universe<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.509> don't

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
intelligent life in the universe I don't

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
intelligent life in the universe I don't
make<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> assumption<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.680> guess<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> other

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
make that assumption I guess the other

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
make that assumption I guess the other
thing<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.360> be<00:01:33.710> yeah<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:35.220> wonder<00:01:35.430> why

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
thing would be yeah I would wonder why

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
thing would be yeah I would wonder why
they<00:01:36.000> wouldn't<00:01:36.240> land<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> middle<00:01:37.320> of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
they wouldn't land in the middle of

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.550 
they wouldn't land in the middle of
Central<00:01:38.009> Park<00:01:38.220> too<00:01:38.729> if<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.630> wanted<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> land

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
Central Park too if they wanted to land

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
Central Park too if they wanted to land
on<00:01:40.860> our<00:01:40.890> planet<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.180> would<00:01:42.390> go<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
on our planet just as we would go to a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840 
on our planet just as we would go to a
site<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.829> thought<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.820> was

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
site where we thought there was

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.300 
site where we thought there was
intelligent<00:01:45.720> life<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:46.799> maybe<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.100> don't

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
intelligent life or maybe they don't

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889

question<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> possibility<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
question is there a possibility that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.420 
question is there a possibility that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
answer is yes logically there would have

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.490 
answer is yes logically there would have
to<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> possibility<00:02:01.829> number<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:03.000> are<00:02:03.240> they

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
to be a possibility number two are they

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
to be a possibility number two are they
are<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.680> friendly<00:02:05.189> or<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.180> hostile
