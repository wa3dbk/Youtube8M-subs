00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
efficiently but gusto makes it really

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.250

easy<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.470> type<00:04:19.890> common<00:04:20.750> symbols<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.049> use

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
example the bracket keys which normally

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.380 
example the bracket keys which normally
you<00:04:26.770> would<00:04:26.890> have<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:27.190> tap<00:04:27.370> you<00:04:27.550> know<00:04:27.670> two<00:04:28.360> or

you would have to tap you know two or
three<00:04:28.780> buttons<00:04:29.110> before<00:04:29.290> you<00:04:29.500> could<00:04:29.620> even<00:04:29.710> get

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
three buttons before you could even get

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.560 
three buttons before you could even get
to<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.280> key<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:30.550> can<00:04:30.730> now<00:04:30.970> just<00:04:31.120> tap<00:04:31.390> this

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570

to the key you can now just tap this
button<00:04:31.630> here<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.320> can<00:04:32.410> say<00:04:32.680> no<00:04:32.860> div<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.180> then

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
button here so I can say no div and then

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.260 
button here so I can say no div and then
I<00:04:34.600> can<00:04:34.780> close<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.050> div<00:04:35.850> really<00:04:36.850> easily

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
I can close that div really easily

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.390 
I can close that div really easily
without<00:04:37.750> having<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:38.170> go<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.530> type<00:04:38.770> you<00:04:39.280> know

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
without having to go and type you know

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.720 
to get the special symbols that's
something<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.740> you'll<00:04:41.980> probably<00:04:42.220> use<00:04:42.370> yet

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
something that you'll probably use yet

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.100 
something that you'll probably use yet
less<00:04:43.060> if<00:04:43.270> you're<00:04:43.390> using<00:04:43.570> a<00:04:43.720> Bluetooth

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
less if you're using a Bluetooth

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.540 
less if you're using a Bluetooth
keyboard<00:04:44.590> but<00:04:44.800> again<00:04:44.980> it's<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.190> nice<00:04:45.340> feature

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
keyboard but again it's a nice feature

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.450 
keyboard but again it's a nice feature
if<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:45.820> don't<00:04:46.000> have<00:04:46.180> access<00:04:46.420> to<00:04:46.960> one<00:04:47.460> one

if you don't have access to one one

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.040 
if you don't have access to one one
thing<00:04:48.670> that<00:04:48.790> I<00:04:48.820> would<00:04:48.940> like<00:04:49.090> that<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.720> see<00:04:49.870> them

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
thing that I would like that to see them

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.860 
thing that I would like that to see them
doing<00:04:50.260> in<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.280> app<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.760> future<00:04:52.150> updates<00:04:52.330> is

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
doing in the app in future updates is

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.050 
doing in the app in future updates is
some<00:04:53.260> sort<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.560> syntax<00:04:54.100> highlighting<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.000> you

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
some sort of syntax highlighting so you

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.990 
some sort of syntax highlighting so you
could<00:04:55.300> tell<00:04:55.480> what<00:04:55.780> what<00:04:56.170> tags<00:04:56.440> are<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.820> what

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
could tell what what tags are and what

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.550 
could tell what what tags are and what
content<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.540> actually<00:04:58.930> haven't<00:04:59.110> also<00:04:59.440> they

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
content you actually haven't also they

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.320 
content you actually haven't also they
don't<00:04:59.740> have<00:04:59.920> any<00:05:00.070> sort<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.430> line<00:05:00.700> wrapping<00:05:01.150> yet

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
don't have any sort of line wrapping yet

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.280 
don't have any sort of line wrapping yet
but<00:05:01.480> they<00:05:01.570> have<00:05:01.690> said<00:05:01.930> they're<00:05:02.080> going<00:05:02.230> to

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
but they have said they're going to

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.230 
but they have said they're going to
address<00:05:02.560> these<00:05:02.890> features<00:05:03.700> in<00:05:03.910> upcoming

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
address these features in upcoming

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.330 
address these features in upcoming
updates<00:05:04.690> so<00:05:05.020> hopefully<00:05:05.590> they'll<00:05:05.770> do<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:05.980> and

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
updates so hopefully they'll do that and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.830 
updates so hopefully they'll do that and
then<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.520> app<00:05:06.700> will<00:05:06.820> be<00:05:06.880> even<00:05:07.510> better<00:05:07.630> than

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
then this app will be even better than

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.080 
then this app will be even better than
it<00:05:08.020> is<00:05:08.080> but<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.650> already<00:05:08.860> liked<00:05:09.250> it<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.670> lot<00:05:09.880> as

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
it is but I already liked it a lot as

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.210 
it is but I already liked it a lot as

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
application I was messing around with a

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.900 
application I was messing around with a
long<00:06:48.110> time<00:06:48.349> ago<00:06:48.500> when<00:06:48.889> I<00:06:48.949> first<00:06:49.009> got<00:06:49.370> my<00:06:49.430> iPad

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
long time ago when I first got my iPad

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.270 
long time ago when I first got my iPad
just<00:06:50.690> to<00:06:50.810> see<00:06:50.960> how<00:06:51.080> it<00:06:51.199> works<00:06:51.380> so<00:06:51.800> that's<00:06:52.099> what

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.280 
just to see how it works so that's what

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.490 
just to see how it works so that's what
that<00:06:52.310> is<00:06:52.610> I<00:06:52.819> can<00:06:53.690> view<00:06:53.840> them<00:06:53.960> locally<00:06:54.319> but<00:06:54.440> I

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
that is I can view them locally but I

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.870 
that is I can view them locally but I

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
can also view them remotely which is

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.820 
can also view them remotely which is
kind<00:06:56.240> of<00:06:56.270> important<00:06:56.720> if<00:06:56.810> you're<00:06:56.960> using<00:06:57.229> some

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
kind of important if you're using some

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.610 
kind of important if you're using some
sort<00:06:57.979> of<00:06:58.099> a<00:06:58.220> server-side<00:06:58.819> language<00:06:59.690> in<00:07:00.169> your

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
code such as PHP which only works when

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
web it doesn't work locally so you can

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.870 
web it doesn't work locally so you can
do<00:07:07.880> that<00:07:08.060> as<00:07:08.300> well<00:07:08.330> so<00:07:08.960> all<00:07:09.830> in<00:07:10.009> all<00:07:10.099> I<00:07:10.159> really

like this application I really love the
interface<00:07:13.909> i<00:07:14.090> think<00:07:14.300> it's<00:07:14.449> it's<00:07:14.720> just<00:07:14.960> really

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:15.349

pretty<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:15.860> really<00:07:15.949> easy<00:07:16.310> to<00:07:16.550> use<00:07:16.580> it<00:07:17.270> seems

00:07:17.529 --> 00:07:17.539 
pretty and really easy to use it seems

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.990 
pretty and really easy to use it seems
to<00:07:17.750> work<00:07:17.960> the<00:07:18.169> best<00:07:18.349> out<00:07:18.650> of<00:07:18.680> all<00:07:18.919> the<00:07:19.280> HTML
