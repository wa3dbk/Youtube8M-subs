00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
right I got the STS Code Red

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.749 
right I got the STS Code Red
ready<00:00:24.529> to<00:00:24.770> fly<00:00:25.009> rocket<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:26.289> it<00:00:27.289> is<00:00:27.759> larger

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
ready to fly rocket and it is larger

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.210 
ready to fly rocket and it is larger
than<00:00:29.270> my<00:00:29.689> other<00:00:29.930> two<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:30.470> just<00:00:30.740> reviewed

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
than my other two that I just reviewed

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.069 
than my other two that I just reviewed
and<00:00:31.520> its<00:00:32.360> max<00:00:32.629> altitude<00:00:32.870> is<00:00:33.410> 725<00:00:34.370> feet<00:00:35.079> back

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
and its max altitude is 725 feet back

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.369 
and its max altitude is 725 feet back
let's<00:00:36.379> get<00:00:36.559> into<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.949> specs<00:00:37.220> right<00:00:37.580> here<00:00:38.379> no

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
let's get into the specs right here no

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.910 
let's get into the specs right here no
sense<00:00:39.830> in<00:00:40.010> wasting<00:00:40.190> time<00:00:40.989> so<00:00:41.989> if<00:00:42.170> we<00:00:42.350> use<00:00:42.589> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
sense in wasting time so if we use the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.280 
sense in wasting time so if we use the
same<00:00:43.160> rocket<00:00:43.400> that<00:00:43.790> we<00:00:44.000> used<00:00:44.239> for<00:00:44.660> the<00:00:44.870> maidens

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
same rocket that we used for the maidens

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.490 
same rocket that we used for the maidens
of<00:00:45.530> both<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.129> rascal<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.850> high<00:00:46.970> jinks

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
of both the rascal and the high jinks

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.160 
of both the rascal and the high jinks
which<00:00:48.500> went<00:00:48.769> up<00:00:48.920> roughly<00:00:49.699> 500<00:00:50.300> feet<00:00:50.510> it<00:00:50.750> it's

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
which went up roughly 500 feet it it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.380 
which went up roughly 500 feet it it's
rated<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:51.949> are<00:00:52.339> both<00:00:52.670> those<00:00:52.879> were<00:00:53.059> rated<00:00:53.299> at

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
rated and are both those were rated at

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.490 
rated and are both those were rated at
550<00:00:54.199> feet<00:00:54.379> with<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:55.400> engine<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:57.440> don't

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
550 feet with that engine and I don't

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.020 
550 feet with that engine and I don't
think<00:00:57.680> it<00:00:57.920> got<00:00:58.010> that<00:00:58.190> high<00:00:58.460> with<00:00:58.729> either<00:00:58.879> of

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
think it got that high with either of

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.410 
think it got that high with either of
them<00:00:59.239> but<00:00:59.960> they<00:01:00.110> got<00:01:00.140> relatively<00:01:00.680> close<00:01:01.420> with

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
them but they got relatively close with

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.170 
them but they got relatively close with
this<00:01:02.629> motor<00:01:03.440> which<00:01:04.070> will<00:01:04.280> shoot<00:01:04.699> both<00:01:05.119> of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
this motor which will shoot both of

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.620 
this motor which will shoot both of
those<00:01:05.449> other<00:01:05.750> ones<00:01:05.990> up<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.530> 1100<00:01:07.189> feet<00:01:07.630> it'll

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
those other ones up to 1100 feet it'll

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.070 
those other ones up to 1100 feet it'll
shoot<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.020> one<00:01:09.200> up<00:01:09.409> about<00:01:10.510> 725<00:01:11.510> feet<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
shoot this one up about 725 feet and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.960 
shoot this one up about 725 feet and
that<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.770> due<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:13.490> being<00:01:13.810> longer<00:01:14.810> and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
that is due to this being longer and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.050 
that is due to this being longer and
almost<00:01:16.970> twice<00:01:17.240> as<00:01:17.270> heavy<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:19.060> without

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
almost twice as heavy and without

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.170 
almost twice as heavy and without
further<00:01:20.330> ado<00:01:20.720> let's<00:01:21.500> unbox<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.490> little

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
further ado let's unbox this little

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.390 
further ado let's unbox this little
beast<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.400> see<00:01:25.400> what<00:01:25.550> it<00:01:25.640> looks<00:01:25.670> like<00:01:25.970> as<00:01:27.400> you

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
beast and see what it looks like as you

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.070 
beast and see what it looks like as you
can<00:01:28.610> see<00:01:28.910> this<00:01:29.330> thing<00:01:29.690> comes<00:01:30.020> neatly<00:01:30.940> packaged

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
can see this thing comes neatly packaged

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.910 
can see this thing comes neatly packaged
comes<00:01:34.180> everything<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.450> need<00:01:35.659> including<00:01:36.530> your

comes everything you need including your
parachute<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:37.880> add<00:01:38.150> on<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.570> huge

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
parachute that you add on to this huge

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.590 
parachute that you add on to this huge
nose<00:01:39.800> cone<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:41.030> shy<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.290> sunny<00:01:43.190> day<00:01:43.600> it

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
nose cone that shy on a sunny day it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.360 
nose cone that shy on a sunny day it
shouldn't<00:01:44.870> make<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.080> really<00:01:45.320> easy<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:45.650> spot<00:01:46.070> in

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
shouldn't make it really easy to spot in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.830 
shouldn't make it really easy to spot in
the<00:01:46.610> sky<00:01:46.880> before<00:01:47.810> deployment<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.460> that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
the sky before deployment and that

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.270 
the sky before deployment and that
should<00:01:50.840> make<00:01:50.870> my<00:01:51.170> videos<00:01:51.530> with<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:51.860> pretty

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
should make my videos with this pretty

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.760 
should make my videos with this pretty
cool<00:01:52.520> it's<00:01:53.330> got<00:01:53.450> nice<00:01:53.720> big<00:01:54.229> fins<00:01:55.120> and<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:57.500> does

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
cool it's got nice big fins and it does

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.520 
cool it's got nice big fins and it does
not<00:01:57.950> have<00:01:58.370> one<00:01:58.729> of<00:01:58.820> those<00:01:58.940> little<00:01:59.110> hooks<00:02:00.110> like

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
not have one of those little hooks like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.830 
not have one of those little hooks like
my<00:02:00.830> other<00:02:00.950> ones<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.490> I'm<00:02:02.150> guessing<00:02:02.810> that

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
my other ones and I'm guessing that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.840 
my other ones and I'm guessing that
screws<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:04.070> off<00:02:04.159> but<00:02:04.430> we'll<00:02:04.549> find<00:02:04.729> that

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
screws on and off but we'll find that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.240 
screws on and off but we'll find that
out<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.240> shortly<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:06.500> fact<00:02:06.710> let's<00:02:06.950> find<00:02:07.190> that

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
out here shortly in fact let's find that

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
out here shortly in fact let's find that
out<00:02:07.460> right<00:02:07.700> now<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.709> here<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.789> Code<00:02:11.060> Red

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
out right now so here is the Code Red

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.600 
out right now so here is the Code Red
here's<00:02:13.250> its<00:02:13.519> nose<00:02:13.819> cone<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:18.049> can<00:02:18.230> see

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
here's its nose cone and as you can see

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.210 
here's its nose cone and as you can see
the<00:02:19.629> rubber<00:02:20.629> band<00:02:20.989> tether<00:02:21.590> or<00:02:21.739> whatever<00:02:22.129> you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
the rubber band tether or whatever you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.180 
the rubber band tether or whatever you
want<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.459> call<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.849> that<00:02:23.030> connects<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:25.069> the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
want to call it that connects to the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.880 
want to call it that connects to the
nose<00:02:25.370> cone<00:02:25.640> double<00:02:26.360> knot<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.080> then<00:02:27.709> you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
nose cone double knot that and then you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.849 
nose cone double knot that and then you
put<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.159> parachute<00:02:28.489> on<00:02:29.209> there<00:02:29.629> and<00:02:29.840> it's<00:02:30.650> that

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
put the parachute on there and it's that

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.970 
put the parachute on there and it's that
simple<00:02:31.129> it<00:02:31.790> really<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.420> simple<00:02:32.480> on

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
simple it really is that simple on

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.070 
simple it really is that simple on
still<00:02:34.459> pretty<00:02:34.640> much<00:02:34.849> a<00:02:34.910> rookie<00:02:35.300> with<00:02:35.450> model

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
still pretty much a rookie with model

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.010 
still pretty much a rookie with model
rockets<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:37.910> straightforward<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
rockets but it's straightforward and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.339 
rockets but it's straightforward and
simple<00:02:39.140> even<00:02:39.650> for<00:02:39.860> me<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:41.180> I'm<00:02:41.750> not<00:02:41.959> sure<00:02:42.170> how

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
simple even for me and I'm not sure how

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.449 
simple even for me and I'm not sure how
good<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.830> looks

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
good this looks

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.280

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
put the wadding in there very important

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.979 
put the wadding in there very important
in<00:03:22.190> my<00:03:22.340> last<00:03:22.489> video<00:03:22.910> you'll<00:03:23.150> notice<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.930> I

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
in my last video you'll notice that I

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.080 
in my last video you'll notice that I
burned<00:03:24.410> through<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> parachute<00:03:25.130> even<00:03:25.940> though<00:03:26.060> I

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
burned through a parachute even though I

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.770 
burned through a parachute even though I
had<00:03:26.360> wadding<00:03:26.870> was<00:03:27.260> not<00:03:27.410> enough<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.780> lesson

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
had wadding was not enough so lesson

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.350 
had wadding was not enough so lesson
learned<00:03:29.810> there<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.709> I'm<00:03:30.830> gonna<00:03:30.980> probably<00:03:31.360> go

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
learned there so I'm gonna probably go

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.120 
learned there so I'm gonna probably go
at<00:03:32.600> least<00:03:32.780> 50%<00:03:33.230> more<00:03:33.650> than<00:03:34.010> they're

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
at least 50% more than they're

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.560 
at least 50% more than they're
recommended<00:03:34.700> on<00:03:34.880> future<00:03:35.360> launches<00:03:36.130> because

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
recommended on future launches because

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.220 
recommended on future launches because
wadding<00:03:38.570> is<00:03:38.720> cheap<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:40.600> parachutes<00:03:41.600> well

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
wadding is cheap and parachutes well

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.920 
wadding is cheap and parachutes well
relatively<00:03:42.890> inexpensive<00:03:43.760> are<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.420> lot<00:03:44.690> more

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
relatively inexpensive are a lot more

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.340 
relatively inexpensive are a lot more
expensive<00:03:45.470> compared<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.220> wadding<00:03:46.549> so

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
expensive compared to the wadding so

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.310 
expensive compared to the wadding so
alright<00:03:48.350> so<00:03:49.120> next<00:03:50.120> I'm<00:03:50.570> gonna<00:03:50.780> put<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
alright so next I'm gonna put the

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.550 
alright so next I'm gonna put the
parachute<00:03:52.120> onto<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.540> nose<00:03:53.750> cone<00:03:54.049> over<00:03:54.290> there

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
parachute onto the nose cone over there

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.270 
parachute onto the nose cone over there
and<00:03:54.769> tie<00:03:55.579> this<00:03:55.640> onto<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.239> nose<00:03:56.420> cone<00:03:56.660> as<00:03:56.900> well

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
and tie this onto the nose cone as well

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.030 
and tie this onto the nose cone as well
step<00:03:58.280> one<00:03:58.310> is<00:03:58.760> complete<00:03:58.850> I<00:03:59.540> just<00:04:00.500> did<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.739> basic

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
step one is complete I just did a basic

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.539 
step one is complete I just did a basic
double<00:04:01.519> knot<00:04:02.709> under<00:04:03.709> almost<00:04:04.280> any

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
double knot under almost any

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.670 
double knot under almost any
circumstance<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:05.570> should<00:04:05.810> be<00:04:05.959> plenty<00:04:06.350> fine

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
circumstance that should be plenty fine

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.440 
circumstance that should be plenty fine
especially<00:04:07.489> if<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:07.609> have<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:07.760> wadding<00:04:08.120> so<00:04:08.299> this

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
especially if I have the wadding so this

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.920 
especially if I have the wadding so this
doesn't<00:04:08.630> get<00:04:08.810> hot<00:04:09.079> and<00:04:09.320> then<00:04:09.500> get<00:04:10.310> burnt<00:04:10.930> up

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
doesn't get hot and then get burnt up

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.719 
doesn't get hot and then get burnt up
next<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.440> parachute<00:04:14.980> alright<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.220> this<00:04:16.400> is

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729
