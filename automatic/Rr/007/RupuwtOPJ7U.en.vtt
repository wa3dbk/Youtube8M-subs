00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
the first thing is this great roof rack

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.000 
the first thing is this great roof rack
pick<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.120> up<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.900> lot<00:03:28.260> larger<00:03:28.530> than<00:03:28.800> I

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
pick that up it is a lot larger than I

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
pick that up it is a lot larger than I
thought<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.400> was<00:03:29.519> gonna<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:29.970> about<00:03:30.120> six

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
thought it was gonna be it's about six

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.280 
thought it was gonna be it's about six
inches<00:03:30.930> long<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:32.720> pretty<00:03:33.720> much<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.140> gonna

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
inches long and pretty much is gonna

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.199 
inches long and pretty much is gonna
take<00:03:34.650> up<00:03:34.830> almost<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.250> entire<00:03:35.640> roof<00:03:36.000> right

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
take up almost the entire roof right

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.120 
take up almost the entire roof right
there<00:03:36.450> which<00:03:36.720> that's<00:03:36.989> I<00:03:37.290> guess<00:03:37.680> what<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.890> roof

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
there which that's I guess what a roof

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.699 
there which that's I guess what a roof
rack<00:03:38.310> does<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.450> also<00:03:39.959> going<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.170> be<00:03:40.290> putting<00:03:40.440> on

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
rack does so also going to be putting on

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.300

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
these ridgeline bumpers front and rear

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.720 
these ridgeline bumpers front and rear
on<00:03:44.519> this<00:03:45.480> particular<00:03:45.840> build<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:46.500> then<00:03:47.400> also

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
on this particular build and then also

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.250 
on this particular build and then also
with<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.060> roof<00:03:48.330> rack<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.720> gotta<00:03:48.930> do<00:03:49.080> some
