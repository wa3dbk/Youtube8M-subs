international markets still early

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:46.920 
international markets still early
because<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.850> know<00:01:45.939> it's<00:01:46.149> only<00:01:46.329> at<00:01:46.600> about<00:01:46.899> I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
because I know it's only at about I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.590 
because I know it's only at about I
think<00:01:47.079> a<00:01:47.290> hundred<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.000> international

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600
