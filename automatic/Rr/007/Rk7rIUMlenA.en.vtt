00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.950
 hello friends today I will try to show 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:26.990
 to you as I do the collection of 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:30.190
 the seed of the crowns of Christ the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.670
 seeds in the crowns of christs 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.940
 will be what is the center of the flower and 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.270
 usually because in my plants there is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.810
 in plants that are already older than 2 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.870
 years 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.650
 you observe here this plant already 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.360
 prepared 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.090
 but in the flowers that were left 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.470
 because here we really shows us that 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.140
 she did her job of giving the fruit of 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.910
 the seed and because this time because 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.910
 I'm going to have what 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:13.980
 detach it then for later 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.980
 and be able to make the attempt to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.270
 plant them 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.970
 are not observed this is a very plant 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.320
 pretty why is that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 I'm taking care of 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.100
 not all flowers give seed how many 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.880
 are 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.189
 they are very 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.189
 very few bullets 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.729
 the flowers that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.409
 they remain seed then then if you like 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.780
 the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.900
 If you like the plant, you have to 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.970
 you have to do this this process 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.800
 there are the seeds 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.800
 and so 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.690
 let's tear some thin 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.690
 we have other little 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.550
 because all the seeds 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.550
 and 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.820
 here you see that this plant 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:27.740
 here we have another crown of Christ 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:30.430
 nuanced yellow with salmon that also 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.430
 and this 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.540
 because this year it has taken to be produced 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.620
 by 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.099
 by seeds those who observe 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.099
 yes 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:56.700
 what are moto2 seeds 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.560
 the domes they see there back little seeds 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.209
 every 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.209
 the three seeds each 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.610
 and the little flower 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.610
 I will do it 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.890
 we started 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.550
 we have today what 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.850
 help them 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.130
 the answer in the sense that it does not 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.640
 go to moisten to get them there is a 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.640
 place 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.860
 here we have other plants too 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.329
 I am a very good stop 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.790
 for the fruits the two options then 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.510
 here is the seed 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.510
 seeds 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.759
 it's like what happened to me here 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.869
 helping them 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.469
 being drying the types they 

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:43.469
 answer 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.490
 one 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:50.940
 from you 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.670
 a seed 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.610
 we have three plants that are going to give 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.710
 seed 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.900
 they have 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.110
 in this tender seed then you have to 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.900
 let her mature a little more to 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.330
 can 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.600
 We are in another crown plant 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.689
 of Christ who has also left 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.929
 seed breeders 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.929
 Well, here I show you how 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.610
 n 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.610
 you are giving the seeds true 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.219
 what 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.780
 come on we have to wait a little bit longer 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:34.560
 why 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.529
 start releasing them as in this plant 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.009
 from the top 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:42.369
 walk observing in this seed and 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.369
 until 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.730
 It's already dry, it's good 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.730
 is mature and so 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.410
 I have more 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.410
 and another 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.830
 another little seed 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.830
 I think not 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.550
 and we have 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.150
 to us 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.470
 others plus this plant came out very 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.470
 seed player 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.879
 you have to explain things 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.880
 here we have another reproductive plant 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.009
 seed 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.100
 and a rose tab 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.640
 It is already a three-year plant 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.640
 what 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.150
 the teams 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.200
 always is 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.560
 cover of 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.560
 of flowers like very large clusters 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.560
 true 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.889
 now 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.939
 he has given 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:04.340
 for the family then this plant then 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:09.220
 he has always won 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.220
 it does not put it completely
