00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.970
 gameplay today we give you a look at the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.200
 xbox one version of battlefield 4 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.509
 let's see why more precisely one 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.190
 multiplayer video demo game this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.109
 here I would have done anyway but that is me 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.609
 been requested by a user if not 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.560
 mistake on the boxing of this game 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.289
 so let's take a few minutes of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.730
 gameplay and hoping to make it to render 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.269
 the idea then in the video of what the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.460
 graphic on the microsoft console 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.140
 of these the title of ice therefore 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.120
 we are part of the fast deathmatch a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.070
 teams then a deathmatch a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.390
 simple teams 1st team against 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 another without the use of vehicles 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.800
 then purely on foot and we see that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.250
 kind of a peace choose this one 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.690
 that I do n't even begin to see 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.530
 play the game so that's all for me 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.219
 new made only another pair of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.609
 real games at the graphic level played 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.340
 then on console an excellent game 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:04.439
 especially taking into account the fact that 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.540
 I tried the beta then on xbox 360 that 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.310
 did not make good not rendered some 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
 wait while everything runs on xbox wanner 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.299
 how much better indeed it is also able to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.159
 manage multitasking 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.159
 as for the transition between 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.170
 an application to the other perfect saying 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.979
 this I leave you to the gameplay let the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 graphic leave me a comment if the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:34.100
 video you like a i like what 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.100
 both sign up for the play holes channel 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.700
 first enemy but limited 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 Italy 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.580
 here 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.650
 to end up in the pot go 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.489
 grenade 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.670
 the doctor 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.380
 little faith 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.860
 but it is 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.600
 Veneto 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.389
 exactly where you go
