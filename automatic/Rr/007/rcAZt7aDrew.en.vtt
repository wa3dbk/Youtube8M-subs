and looks like an 1800 mAh battery which

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.699 
and looks like an 1800 mAh battery which
language<00:02:31.069> X<00:02:31.430> actually<00:02:31.730> uses<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.599> all<00:02:33.319> of<00:02:33.530> their

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
language X actually uses on all of their

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.940 
language X actually uses on all of their
plans<00:02:33.950> even<00:02:34.370> gliders<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:37.150> motor<00:02:38.530> okay

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
plans even gliders the motor okay

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.270 
plans even gliders the motor okay
aha<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:41.299> is<00:02:41.569> probably<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.230> same<00:02:42.350> motor<00:02:42.860> that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
aha it is probably the same motor that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190 
aha it is probably the same motor that
