00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello people today may 28 means 19 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.780
 March this guy bought and bite there or 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.210
 they call what caste begin how much 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.160
 two months he's in my job that's when 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.039
 I said I'll carry him on my pocket 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 I want to show what it means 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.410
 let's say my job is constantly it 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.640
 material up to 16 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:37.050
 taking off drove titmouses here shot rented 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.540
 decided to shoot the department here are removed for 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 usinsk ok here plus rays to me 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 like this particular knife thin tip and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.309
 here in these holes here 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.489
 two and a half millimeters right here 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.699
 shavings from here to remove reverse burrs 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.020
 Who is it without a knife? I mean 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.370
 refuel once every three days once a week 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.750
 ordinary lanske slats 600 grit 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.309
 Well, less is not necessary because I have 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.290
 such work on metal to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 basically picking about like a screwdriver then 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:16.020
 than the general well, thinner I do not need to start 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.460
 the edge is meaningless here the paper legs 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.280
 Of course you cut after such work, not that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 so he cuts mahr it undermines 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.860
 in this here at this stage the details of the order 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.610
 500 probably about 500 like that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.650
 Makar processed that is equal to me 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.290
 like this steel horse breeder kick steel 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.780
 maybe where 90 is better or some thread 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.079
 but I like the form 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.159
 blades 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.829
 I like the shape of the pen. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.930
 somehow 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:58.770
 with the presence of excess finance order 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:02.030
 imagine 2 with a view to a year later 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.030
 where is the thread of exploitation 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.410
 I'll take another movie and put them next 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.680
 changed and geometry or not changed 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.680
 look at
