00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
string crossing exercise let's do it in

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.369 
string crossing exercise let's do it in
two<00:00:05.730> sections<00:00:06.330> let's<00:00:06.569> start<00:00:06.839> in<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.020> middle

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
two sections let's start in the middle

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.790 
two sections let's start in the middle
and<00:00:07.830> work<00:00:08.040> towards<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> tip<00:00:08.910> first<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.929> we'll

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and work towards the tip first and we'll

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.120 
and work towards the tip first and we'll
do<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.010> in<00:00:11.250> counts<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.300> three<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.080> let's<00:00:13.830> stop

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
do it in counts of three and let's stop

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.580 
do it in counts of three and let's stop
our<00:00:14.340> boat<00:00:14.580> between<00:00:14.849> each<00:00:15.269> stroke<00:00:15.630> now<00:00:16.470> I'm

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
our boat between each stroke now I'm

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
our boat between each stroke now I'm
going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.550> full<00:00:17.760> arm<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
going to be on the full arm is on the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.200 
going to be on the full arm is on the
d-string<00:00:18.539> level<00:00:19.170> I'll<00:00:19.590> play<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:20.010> first<00:00:20.279> D<00:00:20.880> and

d-string level I'll play my first D and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.320 
d-string level I'll play my first D and
bring<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.230> whole<00:00:22.439> arm<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> string<00:00:23.670> and

bring the whole arm to the a string and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
bring the whole arm to the a string and
then<00:00:24.630> instead<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.260> bringing<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.769> horn<00:00:25.980> back

this rotation of the forearm let's do it
with<00:01:26.960> stops<00:01:33.880> there's<00:01:34.880> going<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.119> be<00:01:35.210> more

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
with stops there's going to be more

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.210 
with stops there's going to be more
rotation<00:01:36.350> at<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.590> very<00:01:36.770> front<00:01:39.220> this

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.580 

understand<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:40.010> distinct<00:02:40.909> emotions

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
understand so you have distinct emotions

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.360 
understand so you have distinct emotions
or<00:02:42.590> slightly<00:02:43.069> different<00:02:43.670> motions<00:02:45.220> for<00:02:46.220> each

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
or slightly different motions for each

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.699 
or slightly different motions for each
part<00:02:46.700> of<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.879> book<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.390> remember<00:02:48.110> I'd<00:02:48.470> like

to<00:02:48.890> bring<00:02:49.099> in<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.430> middle<00:02:49.670> half<00:02:49.879> and<00:02:50.209> up<00:02:50.540> I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
to bring in the middle half and up I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.289 
to bring in the middle half and up I
bring<00:02:51.560> my<00:02:51.799> elbow<00:02:52.129> to<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.459> lower<00:02:52.670> side<00:02:52.970> and

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.009 
bring my elbow to the lower side and
then<00:02:53.810> reach<00:02:54.049> back<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:55.010> a<00:02:55.250> little<00:02:55.940> bit<00:02:56.269> it's<00:02:56.780> not

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
then reach back up a little bit it's not

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.050 
then reach back up a little bit it's not
just<00:02:57.349> the<00:02:57.530> wrist<00:02:57.769> it's<00:02:58.220> an<00:02:58.610> entire<00:02:59.030> arm<00:02:59.390> motion

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
just the wrist it's an entire arm motion

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.180 
just the wrist it's an entire arm motion
like<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.329> and<00:03:02.659> in<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.170> lower<00:03:03.379> half<00:03:03.590> remember

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
like that and in the lower half remember

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.130 
like that and in the lower half remember
it's<00:03:04.370> this<00:03:04.549> rotation<00:03:05.269> of<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.480> form<00:03:05.750> okay<00:03:06.110> so

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
it's this rotation of the form okay so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.120 
it's this rotation of the form okay so
when<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.010> make<00:03:07.099> good<00:03:07.280> luck<00:03:07.430> working<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:07.940> that
