00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 here is today I'm going to show you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.770
 so in this little video 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.639
 finally a small comparison between a species 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:15.719
 and ultra in video game mode and my ps 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.800
 vita to show you that today the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.470
 difference between a portable console and 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.980
 our smartphones these two years more 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.220
 in weaker 1 and today so 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.420
 as I put it in the article 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 honestly i'm almost out my 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.800
 vita thesis when I play caen I have a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.489
 little break and I want to play a game 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 video because the ultra xps screen 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.930
 the grip and the power are there 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 to give a video game experience 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.330
 sufficient after I'm not either a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.720
 big a big gamer so 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.980
 it is sure that ps lived at the level of 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.610
 logistic deposits and vote is over at 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.970
 even for two nice to play but 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.070
 for most games and you go 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.770
 see that it's also largely enough 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 in any case for simple moments of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.430
 relax and play quietly with his 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 experience and ultra for real 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850
 automatically gamer that will always be 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 there peaceful 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 so I'm going to show you for example I 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.010
 I 'm going to launch I 'm not necessarily the same 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.050
 games since the catalog is a little 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.810
 different and then I had not buy 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.440
 60 euros games for just to make 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.020
 this video 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.700
 so I will launch for example I was 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 In Nantes 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.759
 besides, I started gta on the xbla of 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.180
 train I'm going to launch so this is the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.340
 version that his ice time out on 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.130
 the x no ultra and I'm going to launch a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:51.770
 break the vita 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:56.340
 I was brought the divergent versions 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.010
 why do I come back I do not have if you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.450
 see it's true that the club stick 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.250
 it's super simple what about habitat 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.520
 but we see that the graphics years 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.050
 after the season than the last gta but 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.860
 the graphics are not exceptional 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.650
 but yes it's true that sheep 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.580
 it's nice to play and over there big 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 advantage to ps vita 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.440
 but here you want to see what that 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:36.230
 gives gt1 on a pultrall rescue 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:41.720
 its history loading time is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 really almost ridiculous that's what 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.450
 it gives 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.470
 the cream quality is there is enough 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.190
 exceptional 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:52.430
 my action compared to him alone a liberty 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.420
 on sur vita it's much better even 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 turin on android with five years later 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.620
 this is the experience of two at 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.769
 touch is also a question a 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.769
 question usually as soon as it's usual 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:32.220
 show that quality there that the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.510
 total mobility 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.600
 it's really the screen is really 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.300
 bluffing but if we compare even to 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.290
 the habitat screen 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.160
 here is the game experience on a vita I 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.160
 will put in danger too 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.250
 there is still a screen already 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.410
 much bigger also on the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.470
 adults radon hvac screen larger and 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.230
 best quality automatically down 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.150
 it's more pleasant to play the big game 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.430
 advantage of the vita is for your there is 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.230
 also the manads that exists around for 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.239
 android but did not say much either 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.519
 for two adults race is not very 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.500
 nice I'm going to test you just a 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.160
 little game for you to see a 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.430
 other 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.960
 what do I have biomass ralph alt 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.960
 may be fast on Thursday 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.680
 a trip so largely of the game when 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.490
 even with the processor and the chip 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.700
 adult anduze race and that's really 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.700
 very nice 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.470
 see how fluid it is 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:21.500
 really to life even almost sure sure 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.720
 it's almost amazing to see the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.430
 leak and launch some games 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.160
 we see the quality of the games 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.010
 today the graphic quality of the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.600
 level of graphics show 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.240
 today it's true that except for 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.500
 six to some games that interest you 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.040
 and that does not exist on on android 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.380
 as much as really since bought a 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.780
 almost late we did anything 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.780
 jostling by loving him 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.880
 because you see well on the video 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.630
 but it's true that the quality is there I 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.360
 really did the background a show 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.460
 unpublished today has not found 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.900
 necessarily this insurance is valid 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.760
 for all android smartphones but 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.220
 thanks to the ultra screen it's really 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.680
 it's really nice another thing that 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.700
 is nice it's really taking 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.280
 have one 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.810
 the fact that they are very hungry like that 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.300
 there is the loudspeaker dock located at the top 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.740
 on the right that's just when you play 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.500
 never lot by them actually when we 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.930
 so plays the sound out very well and the 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.880
 makes him very very hungry if we 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.980
 compare to a result 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.870
 the fact that he is very very hungry 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.430
 gives no grip really really 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.780
 great you hold like that with the 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.050
 fingers and at work and that inches 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.450
 it's true it's really great so in 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.550
 big to sum up the little game that's 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.250
 not a big comparative possible 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.670
 to tell you that except if to some 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.880
 games who can I do not know a charter 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.310
 of art fortune who you are on 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.780
 big fans serve almost nothing 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.180
 today to have a portable console 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.970
 after I do not want to compare with a 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.590
 nintendo ds because it's still a 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.990
 other experience 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.930
 but for the game side from time to time 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:25.440
 play a little car game a little 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:28.020
 fighting game or hot today was the 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.490
 android smartphone do that very well and 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.780
 thanks to the experiments and ultra 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:36.550
 it really gives a gaming experience 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:38.680
 totally nice and 

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.860
 of course so that's it for this little 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.860
 video
