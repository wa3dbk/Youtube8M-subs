that were really catchy we know with the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.530 
that were really catchy we know with the
shader<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> don't<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> name<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
shader so we don't know the name of the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.570 
shader so we don't know the name of the
shader<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.439> shader<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:08.400> get

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
shader but you get one shader you get

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.200 
shader but you get one shader you get
one<00:01:08.880> emblem<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.590> once<00:01:10.590> peril<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.759> crux

information what more could indicate it
could<00:01:22.049> probably<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.439> something<00:01:22.829> like<00:01:22.920> maybe<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
could probably be something like maybe a

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.060 
could probably be something like maybe a
dropship<00:01:24.149> or<00:01:24.469> you<00:01:25.469> know<00:01:25.499> maybe<00:01:25.590> we're<00:01:26.009> getting

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
dropship or you know maybe we're getting

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.010 
dropship or you know maybe we're getting
something<00:01:26.399> maybe<00:01:26.609> like<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.880> special<00:01:27.329> quest<00:01:27.659> or

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
something maybe like a special quest or

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.219 
something maybe like a special quest or
maybe<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.609> special<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.719> know<00:01:30.840> mark

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
maybe a you know special you know mark

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
maybe a you know special you know mark
Mark's<00:01:32.009> bonds<00:01:32.549> or<00:01:32.700> cloaks<00:01:33.030> something<00:01:33.929> like

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
Mark's bonds or cloaks something like

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.389 
Mark's bonds or cloaks something like
that<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.319> don't<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.950> does<00:01:35.189> say<00:01:35.369> more

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
that we don't know but it does say more

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.580 
that we don't know but it does say more
