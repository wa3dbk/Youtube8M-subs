and then you have what's called the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.660 
and then you have what's called the
soleus<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.990> gastrocnemius<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:25.100> best<00:01:25.310> trained

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
soleus the gastrocnemius is best trained

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.969 
soleus the gastrocnemius is best trained
with<00:01:25.969> your<00:01:26.149> leg<00:01:26.360> joint<00:01:27.020> locked<00:01:27.409> out<00:01:27.649> your<00:01:27.860> leg

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.510 
seated like press calf raises you're
neither<00:05:23.630> straight<00:05:24.230> nor<00:05:24.290> bent<00:05:24.920> with<00:05:25.190> your<00:05:25.400> knee

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
neither straight nor bent with your knee

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.400 
neither straight nor bent with your knee
there's<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:25.820> very<00:05:26.030> slight<00:05:26.450> angle<00:05:26.720> in<00:05:27.080> it<00:05:27.200> so

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
there's a very slight angle in it so

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.990 
there's a very slight angle in it so
you've<00:05:27.680> already<00:05:27.860> attacked<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:28.520> gastric

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
you've already attacked the gastric

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.730 
you've already attacked the gastric
Nemus<00:05:29.420> by<00:05:29.570> doing<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.020> standing<00:05:30.500> you've

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
Nemus by doing it standing you've

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.770 
Nemus by doing it standing you've
attacked<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.250> soleus<00:05:31.640> by<00:05:31.910> doing<00:05:32.150> it<00:05:32.240> seated

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
attacked the soleus by doing it seated

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.570 
attacked the soleus by doing it seated
so<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:33.290> finisher<00:05:33.740> is<00:05:33.890> going<00:05:34.070> to<00:05:34.160> be<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.400> leg

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
so the finisher is going to be the leg

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.040 
so the finisher is going to be the leg
press<00:05:34.790> one<00:05:35.090> legged<00:05:35.390> Khafre<00:05:35.780> because<00:05:35.930> you're

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
press one legged Khafre because you're

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.470 
press one legged Khafre because you're
isolating<00:05:36.680> each<00:05:36.860> side<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:37.550> you're<00:05:37.880> isolating

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
isolating each side and you're isolating

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.150 
isolating each side and you're isolating
both<00:05:38.660> muscles<00:05:39.170> they're<00:05:39.440> already<00:05:39.680> worn<00:05:39.950> down

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
both muscles they're already worn down

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.370 
both muscles they're already worn down
so<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:41.060> a<00:05:41.090> great<00:05:41.330> finisher<00:05:41.840> for<00:05:41.990> any<00:05:42.110> calf

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
so it's a great finisher for any calf

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.630 
so it's a great finisher for any calf
workout<00:05:42.830> one<00:05:43.070> that<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.280> really<00:05:43.640> enjoy<00:05:43.970> a

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
workout one that I really enjoy a

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.460 
workout one that I really enjoy a
question<00:05:46.640> I<00:05:46.700> get<00:05:46.850> asked<00:05:47.150> often<00:05:47.330> is<00:05:47.780> how<00:05:48.200> often

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
question I get asked often is how often

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.040 
question I get asked often is how often
to<00:05:48.800> train<00:05:49.010> your<00:05:49.190> calves<00:05:49.460> any<00:05:50.300> calf<00:05:50.570> workout

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
to train your calves any calf workout

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.080 
to train your calves any calf workout
including<00:05:51.650> this<00:05:51.800> one<00:05:52.010> I<00:05:52.220> believe<00:05:52.370> can<00:05:52.760> be<00:05:52.880> used

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
including this one I believe can be used

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.120 
including this one I believe can be used
up<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.360> two<00:05:53.780> times<00:05:54.080> a<00:05:54.260> week<00:05:54.290> if<00:05:54.680> you<00:05:54.710> are<00:05:54.860> truly

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
up to two times a week if you are truly

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.400 
up to two times a week if you are truly
training<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:55.760> calves<00:05:55.970> to<00:05:56.240> failure<00:05:56.660> they<00:05:57.200> will

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
training the calves to failure they will

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.110 
training the calves to failure they will
be<00:05:57.620> sore<00:05:57.830> for<00:05:58.040> two<00:05:58.190> to<00:05:58.310> three<00:05:58.340> days<00:05:58.550> after<00:05:59.000> you

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
be sore for two to three days after you

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.180 
be sore for two to three days after you
train<00:05:59.330> them<00:05:59.570> that<00:06:00.170> being<00:06:00.380> said<00:06:00.740> I<00:06:00.980> do<00:06:01.040> believe

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
train them that being said I do believe

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.250 
train them that being said I do believe
it<00:06:01.640> is<00:06:01.670> a<00:06:01.760> muscle<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:02.270> requires<00:06:02.720> more<00:06:03.050> than<00:06:03.110> a

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
it is a muscle that requires more than a

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.080 
it is a muscle that requires more than a
once<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.650> week<00:06:03.800> training<00:06:04.070> split<00:06:04.550> because<00:06:04.700> of

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
once a week training split because of

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.460 
once a week training split because of
how<00:06:05.210> often<00:06:05.450> the<00:06:05.720> muscle<00:06:06.050> gets<00:06:06.140> used

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
how often the muscle gets used

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.480 
how often the muscle gets used
throughout<00:06:06.770> the<00:06:06.950> day<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.220> throughout<00:06:07.430> the

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
throughout the day and throughout the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.060 
throughout the day and throughout the
week<00:06:07.790> as<00:06:08.000> I<00:06:08.120> previously<00:06:08.360> stated<00:06:09.020> you<00:06:09.680> do<00:06:09.860> have

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
week as I previously stated you do have

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.740 
week as I previously stated you do have
to<00:06:10.220> go<00:06:10.340> above<00:06:10.610> and<00:06:10.790> beyond<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.240> really<00:06:11.570> get

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
to go above and beyond to really get

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.390 
to go above and beyond to really get
growth<00:06:11.960> out<00:06:12.200> of<00:06:12.230> them<00:06:12.470> it's<00:06:12.890> a<00:06:12.920> lot<00:06:13.070> of<00:06:13.220> work

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
growth out of them it's a lot of work

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.280 
growth out of them it's a lot of work
and<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.760> hurts<00:06:14.030> but<00:06:14.360> my<00:06:14.600> calves<00:06:14.870> have<00:06:15.080> grown

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
and it hurts but my calves have grown

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.870 
and it hurts but my calves have grown
tremendously<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:16.040> I<00:06:16.160> brought<00:06:16.400> them<00:06:16.580> up<00:06:16.700> from

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
tremendously and I brought them up from

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.520 
tremendously and I brought them up from
this<00:06:16.970> weak<00:06:17.210> point<00:06:17.510> to<00:06:17.660> a<00:06:17.720> strong<00:06:17.930> point<00:06:18.380> by

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
this weak point to a strong point by

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.010 
this weak point to a strong point by
doing<00:06:18.830> so<00:06:19.070> so<00:06:19.640> don't<00:06:19.790> be<00:06:19.970> scared<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.450> training

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
doing so so don't be scared of training

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.480 
doing so so don't be scared of training
your<00:06:21.170> calves<00:06:21.380> more<00:06:21.680> than<00:06:21.800> once<00:06:21.980> a<00:06:22.100> week<00:06:22.250> you

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
your calves more than once a week you

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:38.640 
your calves more than once a week you
will<00:06:22.640> reap<00:06:22.850> through<00:06:23.120> words

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.960 

to<00:06:39.650> implement<00:06:40.070> this<00:06:40.190> work<00:06:40.370> identity<00:06:40.880> your

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
to implement this work identity your

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.130 
to implement this work identity your
split<00:06:41.270> I<00:06:41.480> have<00:06:41.780> two<00:06:41.960> different

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.140 
split I have two different

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.500 
split I have two different
recommendations<00:06:43.130> if<00:06:43.850> you<00:06:43.970> want<00:06:44.150> to<00:06:44.240> include

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
recommendations if you want to include

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.810 
recommendations if you want to include
it<00:06:44.720> on<00:06:44.810> your<00:06:44.960> leg<00:06:45.170> day<00:06:45.440> I<00:06:45.650> really<00:06:46.490> strongly

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
it on your leg day I really strongly

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.480 
it on your leg day I really strongly
recommend<00:06:47.030> you<00:06:47.810> start<00:06:48.140> with<00:06:48.230> your<00:06:48.530> calves<00:06:48.740> by

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
recommend you start with your calves by

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.100 
recommend you start with your calves by
starting<00:06:49.970> with<00:06:50.090> your<00:06:50.240> calves<00:06:50.480> and<00:06:50.720> doing<00:06:50.990> this

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
starting with your calves and doing this

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.600 
starting with your calves and doing this
work<00:06:51.350> at<00:06:51.590> you<00:06:51.830> might<00:06:52.010> not<00:06:52.160> have<00:06:52.340> as<00:06:52.460> much

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
work at you might not have as much

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.820 
work at you might not have as much
energy<00:06:52.850> to<00:06:53.090> train<00:06:53.390> your<00:06:53.570> legs<00:06:53.810> so<00:06:54.560> it's

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
energy to train your legs so it's

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.620 
energy to train your legs so it's
definitely<00:06:55.370> going<00:06:55.550> to<00:06:55.610> be<00:06:55.760> a<00:06:55.790> prioritization

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
definitely going to be a prioritization

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.500 
definitely going to be a prioritization
of<00:06:56.960> calves<00:06:57.230> if<00:06:57.530> you<00:06:57.680> employ<00:06:57.950> it<00:06:58.220> that<00:06:58.400> way<00:06:58.640> if

00:06:59.500 --> 00:06:59.510 
of calves if you employ it that way if

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.060 
of calves if you employ it that way if
you<00:06:59.660> aren't<00:06:59.960> looking<00:07:00.110> to<00:07:00.530> diminish<00:07:00.950> the

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
you aren't looking to diminish the

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.620 
you aren't looking to diminish the
performance<00:07:01.550> of<00:07:01.670> your<00:07:01.790> quads<00:07:02.000> and<00:07:02.150> hamstrings

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
performance of your quads and hamstrings

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.760 
performance of your quads and hamstrings
due<00:07:02.870> to<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.080> fact<00:07:03.260> that<00:07:03.380> you're<00:07:03.590> missing

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
due to the fact that you're missing

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.500 
due to the fact that you're missing
energy<00:07:04.070> because<00:07:04.460> of<00:07:04.580> how<00:07:04.670> hard<00:07:04.940> this<00:07:05.120> workout

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
energy because of how hard this workout

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.810 
energy because of how hard this workout
is<00:07:05.570> I<00:07:05.930> would<00:07:06.470> definitely<00:07:06.920> recommend<00:07:07.070> using<00:07:07.610> it

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:07.820 
is I would definitely recommend using it
