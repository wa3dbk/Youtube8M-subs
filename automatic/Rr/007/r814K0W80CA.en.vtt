00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
yeah so I mean like I guess that's what

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.680 
yeah so I mean like I guess that's what
kind<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.860> sets<00:02:32.100> apart<00:02:32.370> noobish<00:02:32.970> pliers<00:02:33.239> from<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
kind of sets apart noobish pliers from a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
kind of sets apart noobish pliers from a
more<00:02:34.200> experienced<00:02:34.709> hammers<00:02:35.250> um<00:02:35.520> it's<00:02:36.330> not

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
more experienced hammers um it's not

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120 
more experienced hammers um it's not
really<00:02:36.750> how<00:02:36.900> well<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.440> kill<00:02:37.680> people<00:02:37.709> I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
really how well you can kill people I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.410 
really how well you can kill people I
mean<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:38.400> obviously<00:02:38.790> part<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.239> like

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
mean that's obviously part of it like

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.210 
mean that's obviously part of it like
reaction<00:02:39.930> time<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.140> what<00:02:40.530> son<00:02:40.709> skim<00:02:40.980> do<00:02:41.130> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
reaction time and what son skim do you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.790 
reaction time and what son skim do you
guys<00:02:41.370> use<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:41.880> um<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.330> think<00:02:43.170> most<00:02:43.350> of<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.620> is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
guys use but um I think most of it is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.850 
guys use but um I think most of it is
the<00:02:44.550> ability<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.180> get<00:02:45.720> yourself<00:02:46.019> into

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the ability to get yourself into

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.000 
the ability to get yourself into

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
situations where you can protect

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.640 
situations where you can protect
yourself<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.610> at<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> same<00:02:51.060> time<00:02:51.320> be<00:02:52.320> near<00:02:52.620> a

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
yourself but at the same time be near a

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.190 
yourself but at the same time be near a
lot<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> enemies<00:02:53.400> so<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:53.820> spawn<00:02:54.630> camping<00:02:55.080> you

something like that and then like stay

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.840 
something like that and then like stay
fairly<00:03:03.690> like<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:05.040> too<00:03:05.280> close<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.550> not<00:03:05.790> too

hi<00:03:14.160> kill<00:03:15.050> possibility<00:03:16.050> situations<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.980> guess

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
hi kill possibility situations I guess

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.410 
hi kill possibility situations I guess
um<00:03:18.590> yeah<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:20.190> have<00:03:20.459> my<00:03:20.610> pave<00:03:20.850> low<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.329> I

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
actually I don't immediately call it in

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.539 
actually I don't immediately call it in
mainly<00:03:24.299> because<00:03:24.620> my<00:03:25.620> hair<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:25.829> still<00:03:26.160> out<00:03:26.340> and

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
mainly because my hair is still out and

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.949 
mainly because my hair is still out and
I<00:03:26.820> just<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.239> get<00:03:27.329> as<00:03:27.450> many<00:03:27.600> kills<00:03:27.840> as

I just like to get as many kills as
possible<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:29.269> think<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.900> should<00:03:30.930> you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
possible so I think that you should you

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.720 
possible so I think that you should you
know<00:03:31.290> colony<00:03:31.709> area<00:03:31.890> get<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> bunch<00:03:32.489> of<00:03:32.579> kills

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
know colony area get a bunch of kills

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.069 
know colony area get a bunch of kills
with<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:32.970> then<00:03:33.120> call<00:03:33.299> me<00:03:33.420> babe<00:03:33.570> low<00:03:33.780> to

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
with it then call me babe low to

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.590 
with it then call me babe low to
maximize<00:03:34.500> your<00:03:34.860> possibilities<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.760> you

maximize your possibilities and you
might<00:03:36.720> saw<00:03:36.900> right<00:03:37.170> then<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.320> actually<00:03:37.530> got

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
might saw right then I actually got

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:38.990 
might saw right then I actually got
perfection<00:03:38.250> it's<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.640> bit<00:03:38.730> back<00:03:38.970> there

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
perfection it's a little bit back there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.599 
perfection it's a little bit back there
um<00:03:39.680> that's<00:03:40.680> because<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.040> don't<00:03:41.220> really<00:03:41.250> use<00:03:41.489> the
