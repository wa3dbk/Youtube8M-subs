00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
can write that chapter when he gets a

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.060 
can write that chapter when he gets a
chance<00:06:15.310> but<00:06:15.789> the<00:06:16.390> point<00:06:16.660> is<00:06:16.900> you<00:06:17.500> can<00:06:17.740> look<00:06:17.919> at

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
chance but the point is you can look at

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.330 
chance but the point is you can look at
this<00:06:18.280> as<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:19.390> where<00:06:19.770> Plaxico<00:06:20.770> got<00:06:20.979> off<00:06:21.160> easy

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
and then you can look at it as to where

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.080 
and then you can look at it as to where
plex<00:06:23.320> ago<00:06:23.590> got<00:06:23.830> off<00:06:23.979> very<00:06:24.310> hard<00:06:24.640> but<00:06:24.910> the

to<00:06:30.340> this<00:06:30.460> moment<00:06:31.020> now<00:06:32.020> you<00:06:32.080> could<00:06:32.470> say<00:06:32.710> hey<00:06:33.160> if

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
to this moment now you could say hey if

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.219 
to this moment now you could say hey if
I<00:06:33.669> didn't<00:06:34.090> do<00:06:34.240> this<00:06:34.419> he<00:06:34.690> wouldn't<00:06:34.930> be<00:06:35.050> here

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:35.229 
I didn't do this he wouldn't be here

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.420 
I didn't do this he wouldn't be here
right<00:06:35.289> now<00:06:36.630> probably<00:06:37.630> a<00:06:37.659> stretch<00:06:37.930> if<00:06:38.710> Coughlin

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
right now probably a stretch if Coughlin

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.129 
right now probably a stretch if Coughlin
had<00:06:39.550> thrown<00:06:40.150> him<00:06:40.300> off<00:06:40.390> the<00:06:40.539> team

earlier<00:06:41.499> probably<00:06:42.430> a<00:06:42.580> stretch<00:06:42.999> that<00:06:43.240> this

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
earlier probably a stretch that this

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.270 
earlier probably a stretch that this
wouldn't<00:06:43.659> happen<00:06:43.900> probably<00:06:44.530> a<00:06:44.710> stretch<00:06:45.069> that

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
wouldn't happen probably a stretch that

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.289 
wouldn't happen probably a stretch that
he<00:06:45.430> ever<00:06:45.699> would<00:06:46.180> have<00:06:46.300> been<00:06:46.360> a<00:06:46.479> guy<00:06:46.749> who<00:06:46.810> got<00:06:47.229> it
