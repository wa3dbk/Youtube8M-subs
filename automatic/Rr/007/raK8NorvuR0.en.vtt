00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.250
 when he came in contact with their loved ones via to you find that 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.590
 in the vampire climbs and when you're downhill reduce his 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.759
 anger 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.759
 I would love to be the most open with adults 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:18.089
 the retord plateau is not a winter sports resort like the 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.570
 other 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.120
 here pride these sled dogs for over 20 years and a first 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.539
 successful experience the Nordic business flow since the records continue 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.119
 to welcome and train the sled drivers the women 9 o'clock his seven 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.730
 first dog sled races of 1984 which gave us 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.010
 the idea to Lyon because the sled dogs its effect in the race 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.210
 the marchers had stayed two or three days 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.770
 they appreciated 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.000
 the area 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.179
 and a day could you create such a barrel chain 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.949
 so while waiting for this comeback one of 7 km then a second then a 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.300
 third today there are more than 20 km of tracks waiting for 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.579
 walkers for the thirty volunteers and employees who work in the field 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.020
 success is at the rendezvous 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.060
 piloting courses are also complete until mid-March but the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.990
 success of the station are also the atmosphere that reigns far from the big 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.940
 zenten complexes so let's vote before the quiet blog playstation 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 let's start with this kind of real activity varies daily not all the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.140
 time it depends on the meaning but precisely vary the pleasures with the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.710
 employees mma or the holidays and it's the change of scenery is total is 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.380
 completely different is another atmosphere 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.910
 this is not the case then the colors but as a family for having known 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.020
 same type the alps 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.549
 there over several years it is true that we are much quieter 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.470
 much more than at the station exit and 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.420
 but even though the estate attracts many holidaymakers the small and the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.210
 snowy resort random crazy its viability with only 4 to 5 months 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.630
 of activity a year it is not always easy to make profitable the period 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.680
 winter 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.080
 a situation like this has the time of good you can see but 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.780
 economically it is true that we are always on the edge of the razor 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.810
 it's something 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 it's still complicated to balanced a balancing that will 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.009
 maybe easier in the future within three years will be able to take advantage of 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.820
 landscapes of the steward the four seasons the association that manages the 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.270
 domain offers its activities throughout the year
