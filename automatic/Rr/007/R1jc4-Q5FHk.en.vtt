00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.660
 everyone is welcome to this 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.719
 new video is actually the first video 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.320
 I do in this brand new channel e 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.509
 I am enshrined that dragon 99 then 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 this name was taken from the card of 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.279
 beat spears that I like the most in 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.939
 this channel I will deal with deaf battle 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.590
 spirits and as a first opening gave 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.230
 that I wanted to take something a little 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.449
 important in port two sachets one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.870
 of the first hour of the second series of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.210
 botta spirits and the thematic deck 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.829
 pure diamond can be seen in the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.170
 background is already there 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.440
 lightning flashes a sachet so already 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 open we don't want to do epics 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 page on the first video then we are in one 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.270
 position a little precarious and therefore now 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.340
 we want the background I searched for at 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 let you see you see then there 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.129
 we will put a better position 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.800
 we have suffered with these two packages 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.500
 then as I said in this channel 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.030
 only and exclusively makes for spirits e 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.830
 you will see in the description of this 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 video channel 24 if in chaos e 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.479
 go and see my first one too 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.340
 channel because even there I really do 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:32.520
 beautiful openings but pokÃ©mon and iulio 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:35.490
 then then I will split the openings a bit 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.670
 then the rare should be we have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.049
 the little sheet poor turkey give 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.860

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.490
 be this the brilliant and this the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.540
 not common to me I don't remember well 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.500
 then I do n't know 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.500

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:17.150

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:19.940
 Dragon's greeting opens to a non-fee 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.989

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:59.630

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.040
 that I use it for this bunch has it 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:10.220

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:32.959
 however the uncommon this is the 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:36.470
 uncommon and this is the ancient reality 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.420
 rena ok they are put to the cause but to the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.739

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.240
