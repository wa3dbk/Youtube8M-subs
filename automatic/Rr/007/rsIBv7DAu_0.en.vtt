00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.319
 for weeks and that Zeeland under the spell of the Italian cycling team the orange flag 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.930
 to Queen's Day with a swap for our flag at the doors of the

 Gazetta dello sport at the finish place Middelburg was one early on Monday 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.250
 and all the activity everywhere sounded an Italian and the carabinieri 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.929
 sharp things in the eye 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.859
 there was no question of a language barrier 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.800
 how she was with the preparation you have to cooperate with the italianes it goes 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.529
 good 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.720
 yes that goes well 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.660
 but that is not because of the fact that it is also the Netherlands always speaks 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.340
 Known that it is Italian Keira to interpreters who know that for perfect 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.320
 translate it is a well-oiled machine what he put down get that device 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.960

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.790
 the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport reduced the planned 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.460
 contribution to the surgeon who Italians of 2 million and 750,000 euros 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.410
 a big disappointment for Thursday 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.360
 but the alderman wants to know about the financial settlement of the syrup 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.830
 Freeze Monday, however, do not have to worry about its own grounds behind the 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.090
 back and that would be with Queen's Day there is still money left over 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.510
 Well if we go we first enjoy the party and that's it 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.140

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.670

 to the fullest from the event in his city 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.299
 but this is an event of the 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.570
 world format 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.130
 this is a milito sporting event 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.650
 It is wonderful that we have that in the Netherlands 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.440
 it is already great that we have that in Middelburg 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.440
 I myself am also a cycling fanatic, it also looks like his work 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.590

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.800
 Sinterklaas

 both with numerous activities organized in the city center 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:32.859
 like a big tire race on the market 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.079
