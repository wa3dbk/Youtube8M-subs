00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:22.820
 [Music] 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.929
 [Applause] 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.929
 [Music] 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.540
 hello friends as they walk I hope very 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.230
 well today I'll be back after a long time 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.230
 of absence 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.810
 I come back with a new video tutorial on 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.020
 where are we going to be seeing how 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:50.390
 download the game cost constantin 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.770
 if you know him we will see that the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.190
 game is expected in the movie of 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.530
 Konstantin and most missions 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 between quotation marks 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.670
 are inspired by some parts of the 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:09.100
 movie let's start with the tutorial 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 the first thing they should do is go to the ning 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.300
 which is on the description page in 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.300
 the video yo 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.630
 stop uploading the files to the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.810
 positive file and I'm going to start 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.760
 going up in mega like that would be better but I 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.150
 I take advantage is not already know everyone 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.600
 but it's like that in the new global mega 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.400
 it's called mega assured they do not go to the link it 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.860
 locate 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.660
 to computer and to the computer and it goes 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.250
 to start is always going to start 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.320
 download and weighs about 700 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.950
 megabytes if I'm not mistaken I do not remember 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.100
 very good but it weighs around that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:08.340
 good what you have to do and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.819
 once it has been downloaded 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.370
 you will have a file left 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.650
 with the name that says konstantin 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.939
 and a low and good all the other one let me 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.620
 we were seeing this because they had me 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.300
 I touch in another folder but I'm going to move 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.550
 the desk to work better 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:35.260
 so I'm going to wait 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:37.709
 [Music] 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.709
 Y 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.110
 good when you have downloaded 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.230
 this weird file 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.500
 you have to give right click extract 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.500
 here 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.190
 and will ask for a password which 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.769
 He was also told in the description of 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.769
 this video we will see 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.200
 once the password has been described 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.790
 ideal to enter or accept 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.739
 [Music] 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.739
 and it's going to start decompressing a 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.769
 folder which has the game 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.739
 I will pass the video to return 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:21.750
 When the des has finished with the 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:25.910
 which has finished decompressing 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.910
 well here we have almost the end 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.680
 of decompression 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.129
 make it very little 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.900
 Let's see 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.669
 [Music] 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.450
 well there it is done 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.300
 unzip and they will be able to see what was left 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.300
 a folder with the name of constantina 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.220
 if you enter that folder they go to 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:13.020
 see these files 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:14.660
 the game is portable is in Spanish and 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.329
 full 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.159
 or complete 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.159
 so nothing the only thing that has to 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:24.400
 do is enter this Excel file 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:28.669
 what is the game since that application 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.629
