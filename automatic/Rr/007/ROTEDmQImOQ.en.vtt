better track because it doesn't even fit
which<00:04:18.930> is<00:04:19.049> really<00:04:20.420> contradictory<00:04:21.420> to<00:04:21.660> what<00:04:21.690> I

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
which is really contradictory to what I

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.760 
which is really contradictory to what I
said<00:04:22.079> before<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:22.500> how<00:04:22.620> they<00:04:22.800> make<00:04:23.040> more<00:04:23.250> sense

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
said before and how they make more sense

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.290 
said before and how they make more sense
only<00:04:25.770> work<00:04:26.040> in<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.250> casino<00:04:26.670> levels<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> only

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
only work in the casino levels the only

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.610 
only work in the casino levels the only
time<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.510> really<00:04:27.690> see<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.200> these<00:04:28.320> songs

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
time I really see that these songs

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.440 
time I really see that these songs
actually<00:04:28.830> make<00:04:29.280> more<00:04:29.520> sense<00:04:29.730> than<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.060> casino

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
actually make more sense than the casino

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.870 
actually make more sense than the casino
levels<00:04:30.980> because<00:04:31.980> every<00:04:32.190> time<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.400> hear<00:04:32.670> one<00:04:32.850> of

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
levels because every time I hear one of

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.220 
levels because every time I hear one of
these<00:04:33.060> traction<00:04:33.540> makes<00:04:33.600> me<00:04:33.780> think<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.140> a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
these traction makes me think of a
