00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.730
 screenshots you and this is the first release 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.160
 new city in minecraft 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.260
 Well, I'll tell you a little bit what 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.279
 happened why is the first release 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.519
 so here so to speak 20 February 28 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.130
 I noticed that the card with the proud 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.110
 Kurchatov broke that is I even 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.700
 talked about this video if you want 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.600
 see what happened to him 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.730
 watch a video called packard and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 just look, we will understand it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 of course you have no choice how to build 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.660
 new city here I put a vote in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.969
 VKontakte my group 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.670
 build not Russian or same or 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.550
 European city and many have voted 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.379
 for the Russian city well, in principle, the battle 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.660
 was so to say between European 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.239
 Russian much because this was 50 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.150
 by 50 but then the Russian won the dove 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.450
 principle, he won somewhere in 4 votes 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.970
 forward well and here in principle let it be 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 arrange a Russian city just not the same 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.900
 how kurchatov will become lanterns 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.170
 traffic lights like infrastructure 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 break more stores more well in 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.729
 principle, I will not say so 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.920
 at home, well, sometimes I will invent but in general 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.100
 I will watch different photos of the series 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 houses but also our first one today 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.479
 House 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 so let's just see it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.000
 This is what our first apartment building looks like. 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.729
 unfortunately I forgot to write a series 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.299
 right now on the video here is a series that is you have 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.399
 the screen 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.740
 Here is a mouth on a series of residential building 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.290
 this house is located in st. petersburg 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.770
 that is, my city has the same houses 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.350
 Well, here we have a sector entrance 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 and then there are those windows are omitted here because 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.619
 that is to say I like the fact that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 we have a little cat goes big 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.829
 the cat is not another apartment 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 yes so this is another place to fucking him and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.660
 in this country, only windows are just kiu 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.610
 neat oakley are obtained for that is 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.330
 from this side should be with us 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.989
 avenues 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.450
 and there yard yes by the way write 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.030
 please how not to name this city as 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.910
 would there that was Kurchatov write 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.239
 copy call this city here so I wait 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.130
 your ideas in the description that's the way you need 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.349
 again this come up with a date of foundation then 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.870
 There is obtained now 1 March by the way 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.510
 warriors is also a birthday town 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.140
 there is a huge just coincidence of it 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.780
 the city is two years old and we tell it that day 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 principle, well, that's basically it , and 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.060
 will be our home here is the roof of us so 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.459
 look like let's take a look 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.019
 I'll tell you later later let's go in 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.920
 this front look at all 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.639
 placed here is our search for the corridor 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.859
 here they are a batik batik corridor 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.019
 so that change stairs now 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.639
 we go inside we have a poke what 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:11.489

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.000
 apartments are not the same, but 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.710
 a little different looks that is 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.710
