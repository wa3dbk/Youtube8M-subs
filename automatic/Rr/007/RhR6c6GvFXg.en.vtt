00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 episode of a horn today we will talk about a 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.960
 details of and managers will not be there 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.360
 spoiler so don't worry 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.740
 then we have already seen everyone from 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.390
 culmv master java and temple of the trailer is 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.390
 succeeded incredibly well not 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.920
 the impact is gigantic therefore not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.099
 we'll talk about the implementation but 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.180
 we'll talk about another detail that is the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.870
 a buster's codename we remember 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.920
 that the armor designed to succeed in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.680
 contain the wrath of hulk and succeed in 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.270
 to calm him and to calm him down in a manner of speaking 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.829
 knock him out what that is 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.489
 almost impossible in the comics but that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.969
 succeeds in the film thanks to a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.949
 small subterfuge called this the name 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.970
 in code for the master week is veronica 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.320
 because many have wondered about it 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.439
 which is absolutely not explained 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.700
 in the film one of the jokes is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.229
 many inside jokes of and of joss whedon 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.790
 then we all know the beloved 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.320
 by bruce banner even if in 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.780
 already from the devers in two a certain 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.149
 proximity with the black widow characters 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.299
 remember that bruce banner his 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.490
 eternal girlfriend and betty ros daughter of 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 general the same general that i 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
 from the hunt we will see in civil war 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.549
 among other things is that I can't wait 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.630
 finally returning to the attack 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:53.729
 against look as it is called the eternal for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.880
 terna fiana betti and there is a comic 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.939
 very famous in the states but at least here 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 in Italy called archie comics 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.200
 archie comics tells the stories is a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.899
 container however mainly takes 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.810
 the name of its protagonist that is 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.170
 march indeed and that has always lived 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.700
 this love triangle between two girls 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.799
 the rented car and veronica snob with the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.440
 simple girl then puts it there always 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:25.620
 this triangle for all that for 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.019
 all for the entire publishing history of 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.019
 arch away from the 41 it seems 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.790
 he sees this with whom he puts himself 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.790
 roots with betty or with however in 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:49.230
 this we say this triptych this 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.719
 this trio is very famous in 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.469
 in the American collective imagination from 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:58.139
 we have few examples of the memo of 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.169
 arci if you remember the cartoon 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:06.389
 zero in conduct at the end of the 80s 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:11.760
 or here for a tea it seems 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:19.010
 remembering them speaks of arci di 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.010
 betty and veronica a river lei 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:32.200
 nostalgia more fun the nostalgia 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.200
 and the tumor never fails 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:46.489
 this part of the code of zero in 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.439
 zero conduct in conduct is not really 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.450
 taken from the comics of arches because it is arched 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.579
 set in college 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.609
 here there are all the protagonists 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.599
 but in a pre-adolescent version 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:04.349
 which then does not actually change because 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.319
 there is always the love triangle between back 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.220
 and veronica e arci and it is for this reason 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:16.530
 that the program that deals with 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.269
 falck master and the satellite are called 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.710
 veronica then having to tease 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.169
 this this in this love story 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.750
 very strong in the imagination 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:30.090
 American collective said this there 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:35.699
 they are a lot of numerous others 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:37.500
 Scattered details throughout is rangers from in 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.260
 particular on sweet looks 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.960
 wanda division that for those who read the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.930
 comic knows what in the future not in that 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.479
 film can happen but who has not read 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.130
 the comic can understand it then 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.860
 we'll talk again 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.800
 you are satisfied now you know why 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.400
 veronica is called so called in the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.470
 film 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.639
 you have twisted other details 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.680
