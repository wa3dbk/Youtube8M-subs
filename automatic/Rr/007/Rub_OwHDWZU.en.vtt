over the last few years
intensive<00:00:15.150> research<00:00:15.480> has<00:00:16.410> taken<00:00:16.920> place<00:00:17.070> we

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.540 

did<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.730> demonstrate<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.869> today<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.859> as

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you can see it's a condition that I have

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
you can see it's a condition that I have
suffered<00:00:26.670> from<00:00:27.000> myself<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.869> probably<00:00:28.380> started

suffered from myself I probably started

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220 
suffered from myself I probably started
showing<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> effects<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.300> early<00:00:30.599> twenties
