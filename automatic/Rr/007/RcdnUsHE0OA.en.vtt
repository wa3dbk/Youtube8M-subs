do you prevent compound from getting in
the<00:00:47.950> cracks<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.630> burning<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.750> areas<00:00:50.460> with

the cracks and burning the areas with
the<00:00:51.489> buffer<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:53.170> what<00:00:53.320> we<00:00:53.440> do<00:00:53.560> a<00:00:53.590> lot<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:53.950> times

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
the buffer and what we do a lot of times

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.460 
the buffer and what we do a lot of times
is<00:00:54.370> we'll<00:00:54.730> use<00:00:54.910> tape<00:00:55.180> we'll<00:00:56.170> go<00:00:56.260> right<00:00:56.440> over

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
is we'll use tape we'll go right over

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
the cracks and that way you won't get

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.190 
the cracks and that way you won't get
the<00:01:00.730> compound<00:01:01.180> in<00:01:01.360> there<00:01:01.540> and<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:01.809> also<00:01:01.840> will

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
the compound in there and you also will

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.069 
the compound in there and you also will
not<00:01:02.380> burn<00:01:02.620> the<00:01:02.739> edges<00:01:03.100> with<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.839> buffer<00:01:04.839> the

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
not burn the edges with the buffer the

start buffing on this car this car
paints<00:01:39.670> very<00:01:40.090> nice<00:01:40.389> to<00:01:40.569> start<00:01:40.779> with<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.409> I

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
paints very nice to start with so I

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.109 
paints very nice to start with so I
don't<00:01:41.679> need<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:42.009> use<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.340> compound<00:01:42.789> at<00:01:42.969> all

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
don't need to use the compound at all

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.449 
don't need to use the compound at all
I'll<00:01:43.509> just<00:01:43.719> use<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.229> finesse<00:01:44.560> 't<00:01:44.740> which<00:01:45.159> gives

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
I'll just use the finesse 't which gives

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.260 
I'll just use the finesse 't which gives
it<00:01:45.639> the<00:01:45.670> gloss<00:01:45.999> type<00:01:46.749> of<00:01:46.899> thing<00:01:47.109> basically<00:01:48.099> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
it the gloss type of thing basically you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.959 
it the gloss type of thing basically you
put<00:01:49.270> this<00:01:49.420> on<00:01:49.889> like<00:01:50.889> you<00:01:51.009> would<00:01:51.159> catch<00:01:51.609> up<00:01:51.819> on<00:01:51.939> a

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
put this on like you would catch up on a

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:56.999 
put this on like you would catch up on a
bun<00:01:52.179> just<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.179> little<00:01:55.420> bit<00:01:55.539> in<00:01:56.020> start<00:01:56.919> in

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
bun just just a little bit in start in

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.529 
bun just just a little bit in start in
small<00:01:57.130> areas<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.759> normally<00:02:01.179> do

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
small areas what I normally do

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.359 
small areas what I normally do
let's<00:02:01.990> move<00:02:02.169> the<00:02:02.319> round<00:02:02.529> a<00:02:02.679> little<00:02:02.889> bit<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
let's move the round a little bit and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.449 
let's move the round a little bit and
then<00:02:07.020> start<00:02:08.020> this<00:02:08.349> and<00:02:08.590> go<00:02:08.800> back<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.160> forth
