00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.059
 ban so today we are we are in 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:57.780
 south-east coal sleeve ie the 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.370
 fishing actually there town hall today 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.339
 cod cod that its same facade 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.530
 fish in fact actually it depends on the 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:10.180
 how to prepare them today the 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.830
 conditions are not be very easy to 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.110
 compared to past weeks but 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.340
 good fish is still present on 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.460
 has a lot of touches by 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 against a corner then it's true 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.830
 that this time it's easy 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.259
 well hey that he is ready so difficult 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:32.799
 this shit hooks here 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.220
 the perfect example a pretty fish ya that 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.220
 I got 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:57.790
 to maybe an interesting fish it's 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.790
 the big joke get off 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.310
 the end of the high- level era om it's 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.050
 the object of disproving these advances from the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.270
 we are really very very close 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.900
 from the fire the area is very hot the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.140
 ladies points it's a tendency to greet each other 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.510
 quite quickly so that's true 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.930
 that you really do not have to regularly 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.230
 hesitate to buy hooks in the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.350
 sense where we are fishing really very very very 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.300
 very very hard we are still the 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.560
 tip it is moussa quickly and 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.270
 on fish like here who have the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.870
 mouth really hard at times on all 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.290
 the big fish 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.880
 it is true that we often tend 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.190
 aisles off the hook in the middle of the fight 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.750
 I'll go back well because 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.269
 tips are just bluntly oms the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.269
 pic evil and one piquemal the fish 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:03:13.739
 the new touch there to franck after the 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:13.739
 descent, accompanying the mayor 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.980
 so a good fish in the mean 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.390
 and there we can see that - if stung 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.390
 the hook and a future and that's stung 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.580
 here 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.989
 go hop 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.800
 it's gone 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.510
 good at their hinges in 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.970
 hearing samad and prey that's 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.100
 quite bulky as well in the form of 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.150
 jr shaped form of the year are shaped 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:30.360
 chad or so to kill, for example, the 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.320
 audits 7 one gets lost he has for example had to 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.550
 slug then regularly in if one has to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.060
 leaded very very heavy what is not 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.440
 always the case 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.510
 everything depends on the deep in the tech 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.800
 obviously and current if we have to 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.660
 take is very heavy have grown 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.760
 regularly put back a little 10th its 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.650
 garden his singing his name would see that of 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.660
 theirs simply because on 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.700
 cod a little mean size against 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.800
 sometimes a mouth a little small they 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.450
 tend to take less good 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.430
 their bulky if they are too little 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.420
 seen in mind so in this case we come 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.420
 add a small hook 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.190
 additional and at the rank level 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.470
 terms of colors we are aiming for both 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.870
 fluo of the rose of the natural so there everything 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.710
 connects well enough and at the level of 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.210
 jigs of the catches of one sees there a 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.760
 little bit the giret style styles 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.670
 and tie-2 of each current employees so 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.930
 to help them about 15 cm 15 16 cm 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.880
 we can be much more 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.590
 bulky of course everything depends on 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.390
 weight detail shifts will be to look for 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.700
 now with pussies like that 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.410
 can take as well of the lovers 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.249
 from the barc of the place the size fish 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.309
 I would say relatively 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:40.269
 mean to the big so these jigs 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:42.239
 quite quite versatile already 

00:05:40.269 --> 00:05:46.419
 stopped what we have results really 

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:48.459
 really regular at the level of would go from 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:51.249
 swimming theirs in relation to their 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:54.099
 close they all that is fan 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:56.199
 profit from the small little web post or at 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.779
 do assassin's for example they are 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.249
 relatively long lures the advantage 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.719
 it's actually so much mans plants - 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.399
 we manage to fish the depths 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.649
 relatively large 20 to 30 meters 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:10.089
 and they are actually decoys that pulls 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:11.679
 much less on the on the line of 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.749
 actually they do not really have that 

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:15.459
 mark then that chad develops 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:17.889
 more vibrations but cons 

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:20.709
 trend is to further pull on the 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:23.199
 yarn and often waxed haga married equal on 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:25.179
 has as it has often imposed the 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.679
 much more 

00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:27.939
 strongly 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.649
 so we have color bases we know 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.179
 that they operate regularly 

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:32.709
 now it's true that we notice 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:34.359
 that times from one day to another 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:36.789
 in fact we have colors that go 

00:06:34.359 --> 00:06:39.039
 really worked much better so 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:42.399
 actually facts of using it 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:43.929
 raids and currents when fishing 

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.099
 to two or three in the boat to have 

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:47.229
 colors and shapes of their 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.209
 completely opposite so 

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.429
 determine as quickly as possible 

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:54.539
 what types of traffic on their 

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:54.539
 fish reacted best
