00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.850
 very good to all we are already in a 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.279
 new minecraft video and taking advantage 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.380
 the output of version 1.6 point 1 of 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.170
 I've decided a couple of hours ago 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.540
 explain the main novelties 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.770
 that brings this version itself and one of the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.120
 most curious or the ones that will most seem 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.500
 impressive is going to be that of the 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.670
 horses and good mainly have 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.320
 added to the horses in this game and 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.630
 the truth is that they bring with them a lot 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.909
 of novelties either of decoration as 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.100
 you can see this horse that I will show you 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:38.949
 as he has done or simply from 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.999
 transport like for example this donkey 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:46.329
 You see that he has added a chest here 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:49.389
 behind that of the saddle and we 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.719
 will allow then to carry a lot 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:55.800
 of things that we want to take 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 and good mainly 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 one of the novelties is this bond that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.479
 will allow us to control the horse 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 as you can see by clicking doing 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.270
 left click we can take the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.040
 horse with this rope and we can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.710
 deal in any of these fences that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
 we have here and you see the horse is not going 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.430
 to move from there 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.170
 this can not be done in addition to 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.160
 horses of any other animal like 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.340
 for example sheep or cows will 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.190
 I will teach that you can also 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.580
 catch you see and we can take them 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.580
 towards there 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.250
 I think I'm going to break your neck 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.970
 perfect we can not stop there you see and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.760
 there we have stayed well in addition to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.040
 this new possibility of tying the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.130
 animals also brings with it the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.340
 possibility of giving them a name 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.350
 yes yes and to give us a name this for 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.960
 that we need a ship where we can 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.630
 can put an intact 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.340
 what we have here and put a 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.890
 name that we want for example I'm going to 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.370
 name that little lamb as the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.370
 dolly sheep 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:20.050
 and as you see here we get a tag with the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.080
 name made then the only thing that 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.710
 we have to do is to direct ourselves towards 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.270
 animal that we want to put the name and in 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.100
 this case my old lady and click left 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.750
 sorry click right and you see 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.490
 I automatically renames 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.400
 from the little lamb to the little lamb that I wanted 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.170
 put a hit to dolly this can 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.660
 also be used to put 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.880
 any other animal until I do not know if 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.510
 even creatures 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.540
 I think if you see everything now everything 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.750
 nicole and perfect flame and then 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.040
 to customize our horse or 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.680
 rather said to manage it 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.790
 first we have to get on top of 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.909
 it and wait for it to calm down or 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:13.049
 let some hearts come out you see many 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.590
 Sometimes it's going to expel us for 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.590
 put it like that 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.370
 let's go back to try it you see 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.280
 let's see if it calms down quietly 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.569
 quiet 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.569
 let me man make a video 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.340
 what you least want 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:40.080
 good good then once he gets 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.300
 reassured once uploaded we can 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.130
 click on the 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:51.820
 Well for example this one I already have one 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.460
 once uploaded we can boost him and 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.040
 put him for example a saddle 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:04:00.040
 and this that you can see that it serves to 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.960
 customize our horse in the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.450
 cheese that you had the diamond and in the 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.820
 case of this that is the gold and beige 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.220
 as the horse takes a look 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.600
 different this opens a lot of 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.860
 possibilities of customization 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.959
 because I get that is to say already to the 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.440
 horses bring different colors and 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.500
 we can also add it to add them this 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.870
 accessory that the truth is that it gives us a 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.570
 a lot of possibilities in this case in 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.729
 this donkey that I have put the chair of 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.870
 mount and next I added a chest 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:40.050
 this will serve us for 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:43.199
 to take us with the pile of things 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.810
 to see one of the novelties besides 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:48.120
 this is what you can see on the ground 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.180
 which are like rugs that we are going to 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.850
 to be able to decorate 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.590
 in our cases or anywhere 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.380
 that we want you see here you have them 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.760
 They are like rugs and we are going to 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.500
 serve to decorate what we want and 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.230
 good 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.030
 this I think is all I can give you 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.180
 say the most interesting thing that brings 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.460
 this new version the 1.6 point 1 if 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.160
 There was something else or you want me to 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.950
