are<00:04:42.650> light<00:04:42.860> you're<00:04:43.069> already<00:04:43.340> moving<00:04:43.639> quick

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
are light you're already moving quick

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.270 
are light you're already moving quick
you<00:04:44.569> can<00:04:44.599> bring<00:04:45.080> up<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.349> gun<00:04:45.530> pretty<00:04:45.800> fast<00:04:46.069> and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
you can bring up the gun pretty fast and

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.559 
you can bring up the gun pretty fast and
the<00:04:46.340> hipfire<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.759> pretty<00:04:47.030> good<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.389> there's

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
the hipfire is pretty good so there's

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.450 
the hipfire is pretty good so there's
really<00:04:47.629> no<00:04:47.870> reason<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.289> have<00:04:48.409> quick<00:04:48.680> draw<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.430> I

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
really no reason to have quick draw so I

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.309 
really no reason to have quick draw so I
changed<00:04:49.759> it<00:04:49.969> to<00:04:50.120> dead<00:04:50.300> silence<00:04:50.840> because<00:04:51.169> if

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
changed it to dead silence because if

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.929 
changed it to dead silence because if
you<00:04:51.409> have<00:04:51.530> a<00:04:51.560> headset<00:04:51.830> dead<00:04:52.310> silence<00:04:52.789> with
