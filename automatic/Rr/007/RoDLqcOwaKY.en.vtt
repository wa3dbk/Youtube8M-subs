00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
copies now but it's just been on for a

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.400 
copies now but it's just been on for a
few<00:03:02.050> days<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:04.690> have<00:03:04.780> high<00:03:04.930> hopes<00:03:05.140> their

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
few days and so we have high hopes their

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.520 
few days and so we have high hopes their
the<00:03:05.590> neat<00:03:05.740> thing<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:08.140> know<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.260> chose

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the neat thing is that you know I chose

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.740 
the neat thing is that you know I chose
searchable<00:03:09.130> words<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.910> I<00:03:10.300> think<00:03:10.510> this<00:03:10.600> is

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
searchable words and I think this is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360 
searchable words and I think this is
important<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.380> e-books<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:11.860> as<00:03:12.010> we<00:03:12.160> get<00:03:12.310> more

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
important for e-books and as we get more

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.120 
important for e-books and as we get more
and<00:03:12.610> more<00:03:12.730> ebooks<00:03:13.180> over<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.170> next<00:03:14.350> few<00:03:15.070> years

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
and more ebooks over the next few years

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.340 
and more ebooks over the next few years
and<00:03:15.700> decades<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:16.420> think<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.140> really

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
and decades I think it's really

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.740 
and decades I think it's really
important<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.220> words<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.420> are

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
important to have words that are

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.449 
important to have words that are
searchable<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.680> know<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:22.510> other<00:03:23.020> words

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
searchable you know so in other words

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.090 
searchable you know so in other words
and<00:03:24.459> I've<00:03:24.700> said<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:24.910> before<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:26.500> was<00:03:26.680> no

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
and I've said this before it was no

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.580 
and I've said this before it was no
coincidence<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.970> named<00:03:28.240> monkey<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.290> croc

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
coincidence that I named monkey and croc

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.970
