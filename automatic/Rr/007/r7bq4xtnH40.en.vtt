00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.710
 Hello 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.710
 they put on that, that's why I speak a little bit easier 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.500
 we wanted to take our match against mTw Cup MST Winner Bracket Final 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.929
 At the luckily won hard water exciting match in the ONZ 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.439
 also really pleased then most could win 16 11 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.199
 Why 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.140
 Nitsch topic in the finals of the European Championship is now international in the final of the euro-cup 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.890
 Contactor really good 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.520
 and he offered the postponed new team some success 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.570
 Of course, in the next few weeks, Ahmed will get rid of the idea 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.760
 This week is already a bit go 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.100
 we got our first of the Games 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.300
 against mTw also orders this evening not on the 2 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.840
 Aalen 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.180
 our very first match in the corner it will be absolute against old-fashioned 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.320
 new 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.680
 but also increase what topics 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.950
 around 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.980
 We will definitely look that we will not underestimate that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.460
 important 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.790
 I think then probably start the season well and then 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.740
 officiated go around the takes anyway we have today with our performance 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.140
 our top performance retrieve the tired 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.010
 Maybe again could have won 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.060
 It will certainly be harder because I'm coming to see you today 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.960
 Armstrongs for the season I think that's exciting as the last song 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 to sing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.380
 So she was at the finals 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 a giant fight federal four teams 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.240
 Ahmann denied the fight 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 and I think that they are real now 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.290
 and then again Zicker five teams 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.720
 five six teams maybe playing for the finals so mTw on everyone 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 case 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.890
 we hope we will be cool as well 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.270
 there's Smoke Rat 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 Kaczmarczyk maybe the Klenk 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 the candidates there have on the finals TAAHM 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.180
 Iron man will see 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.570
 In any case, we are already really hot now this new form in the team 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.079
 to be fully started 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.239
 with GAAP the case 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:10.579
 Sir
