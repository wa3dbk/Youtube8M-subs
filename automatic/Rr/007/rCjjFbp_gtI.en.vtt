that<00:00:27.090> same<00:00:27.390> idea<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.920> two<00:00:29.070> types<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that same idea with the two types of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.350 
that same idea with the two types of
gameplay<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:30.330> being<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:32.180> classic<00:00:33.180> gameplay

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
gameplay one being the classic gameplay

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.690 
gameplay one being the classic gameplay
which<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.930> 5v5<00:00:34.620> or<00:00:35.190> twisted<00:00:35.550> treeline

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
which is the 5v5 or twisted treeline

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.880 
which is the 5v5 or twisted treeline
which<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.030> 3v3<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:37.110> consists<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.500> three

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
which is 3v3 that consists of three

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
which is 3v3 that consists of three
lanes<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.360> must<00:00:39.480> push<00:00:39.750> down<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.290> have

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
lanes that you must push down they have

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
lanes that you must push down they have
turrets<00:00:40.800> along<00:00:41.040> there<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.489> protect<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
turrets along there that protect the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.540 
turrets along there that protect the
lanes<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> destroy<00:00:43.200> those<00:00:43.550> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
lanes so you have to destroy those and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.459 
lanes so you have to destroy those and
then<00:00:44.820> push<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.300> way<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.780> enemies

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
then push all the way to the enemies

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.740 
then push all the way to the enemies
crystal<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.039> destroy<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.420> three

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
crystal and destroy that so that's three

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.479 
crystal and destroy that so that's three
lanes<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.260> called<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> classic<00:00:50.280> kind<00:00:50.430> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
lanes that's called the classic kind of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.639 
lanes that's called the classic kind of
game<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:50.969> 5v5<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.780> summoners<00:00:52.140> rift<00:00:52.410> and

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
game it's with 5v5 on summoners rift and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
game it's with 5v5 on summoners rift and
33<00:00:53.250> on<00:00:53.370> twisted<00:00:53.730> treeline<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.750> also

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
33 on twisted treeline then you also

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.040 
33 on twisted treeline then you also
have<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.739> crystal<00:00:55.980> scar<00:00:56.750> which<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> the

points around the map circuit the map

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.670 
points around the map circuit the map
with<00:01:02.940> five<00:01:03.510> points<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.899> need<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> capture<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
comes gameplay so we'll just look at

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.899 
comes gameplay so we'll just look at
some<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.229> personal<00:01:25.229> stuff<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.220> this

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.830 
can see here in the map there's three
lanes<00:06:34.950> we<00:06:35.760> have<00:06:35.880> towers<00:06:36.270> along<00:06:36.480> the<00:06:36.660> lane<00:06:36.810> so

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
lanes we have towers along the lane so

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.810 
lanes we have towers along the lane so
we've<00:06:37.170> got<00:06:37.440> a<00:06:37.470> push<00:06:37.770> to<00:06:38.070> kill<00:06:38.250> these<00:06:38.370> towers

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
we've got a push to kill these towers

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.519 
we've got a push to kill these towers
and<00:06:39.030> then<00:06:39.600> we<00:06:39.660> have<00:06:39.750> to<00:06:39.810> kill<00:06:39.990> the<00:06:40.140> inhibitor

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
and then we have to kill the inhibitor

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:43.609 
and then we have to kill the inhibitor
here<00:06:40.889> and<00:06:41.849> then<00:06:41.999> we<00:06:42.119> have<00:06:42.269> to<00:06:42.379> come<00:06:43.379> all<00:06:43.529> the

00:06:43.609 --> 00:06:43.619 
here and then we have to come all the

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:48.769 
here and then we have to come all the
way<00:06:43.649> down<00:06:43.739> here<00:06:43.919> and<00:06:46.219> kill<00:06:47.219> this<00:06:47.849> crystal<00:06:48.569> back
