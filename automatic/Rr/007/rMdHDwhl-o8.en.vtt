 kevlar casco that's perfect this 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.670
 the helmet was at least 2 grade protection then 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.340
 have kept pistol bullets 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.910
 Well, on the fly there is a machine gun on and 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.220
 bullet 762 with water tactical glasses which 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.740

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.279
 not means there to protect your eyes from the sun 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.380
 These glasses stand straight shot 10 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.760
 meters hunting rifle that is all 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.780
 fragments that occur not only when 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.170
 takeoff ammunition there and this is benito 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 and a little marble so marble is concrete and 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.730
 there will give blocks there this sliver in the branch and 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.700
 so on so on so on all this 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.750
 protects the eyes these glasses they are required 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.140
 and here too we need these glasses 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.850
 Naturally hint is in the cap 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.880
 cap comforter in winter it was clave 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.290
 Balaclava plays several functions too 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.500
 this and the mask as you see and at the same time 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.710
 it's heat preservation here protection 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.590
 open body parts i am from exposure and 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.660
 temperature when breaking land mines 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.540
 high temperature these masks are off 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.720
 they can not cope with the face of the park should 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.110
 be comfortable on me here now this jacket 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.690
 that 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.490
 it was invented by pilots 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.920
 paratroopers more precisely forty third year 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.850
 English classic tailoring which 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.560
 English hi in all nato and 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.820
 43 years does not change here under it 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 ideally, two sets of thermal underwear so 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.100
 way kept warm is removed under 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.940
 and the fighter simultaneously keeps his 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.210
 flexibility speed 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:01.290
 when that is, once again winter jacket 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.210
 preferably moisture does not penetrate and under it 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.070
 several sets there a couple of exact 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.240
 a couple of sets they will follow and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.670
 wearing thermal underwear 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 this is what is necessary but we already 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.620
 We dress to buy ear 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.590
 also nato german english 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.780
 here you see me all these podstezhki 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.810
 here but in principle they are also enough 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.570
 light enough to keep warm 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.750
 it all costs money 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.220
 the best are problems further what 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.319
 you must have every fighter 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.030
 this 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.099
 three-point belt which allows 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.099
 to work very quickly 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.140
 conducting a fight that is, he has here 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.260
 several such specific functions 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.930
 this quick reset system here and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.230
 system when Rome comes unfastened 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.720
 translated about the vice turns into 1 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.670
 point belt for inspection and so on 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.430
 assisting is brought behind the back then 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.740
 same assistance assist evacuation and so 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.810
 further as for body armor it 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:09.520
 In general, a separate topic, we categorically 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 decided to use play kerry 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.980
 so call it that in what again they fight 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.230
 For decades, fighting on Tacitus 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.070
 lightweight body armor where there is nothing 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.950
 superfluous except 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.380
 that's it for the vest 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.290
 body armor is standard his plate size 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.330
 30 by 25 everything else is dressed 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.910
 that is, it is an extra cordura which gives 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.910
 weight again interferes 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.410
 movement action and then at the very 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.520
 really protects only this here stove 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.350
 a person may be possible 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.569
 a long time that is, the extra 4 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.120
 kilograms just discarded if 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.100
 take those bulletproof vests which again 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.930
 our guys there are cooking patriots corsairs 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.760
 but according to reviews 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 5 hours further the person simply not to you any more 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.320
 combat capable behind my tactical 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.220
 a backpack that must also be on 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.820
 every fighter 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.650
 its displacement is there 40 60 liters in this 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.320
 backpack is extra 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.180
 ammunition food and there 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.360
 thermal underwear set socks and so on 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.310
 all that is necessary for the fighter in the conduct 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.890
 fighting is it not as if that 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.299
 the optimum minimum there and the supply of water and 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.660
 first aid kit and 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.640
 well, all the most vital rps 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.490
 which we concluded that it 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.740
 good old horse as it is called 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.419
 belt handling system this one 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.520
 deer i'm the first so called line 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.520
 which pc I always shoot me 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.090
 once 8 shops there a couple of grenades n g 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.990
 water 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:47.000
 some kind of small engine there 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.810
 energy bars there raisins there 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.580
 dried apricots and so on for a while 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.710
 when conducting combat lead 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.930
 your tone order and constantly here's how 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.060
 be alert knee pads 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.370
 mandatory because on 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.600
 with our personal activities at the beginning 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.479
 composition was skeptical 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.830
 literally in a couple of days they 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:07.610
 understand what to do without it 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.380
 practical 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.479
 that your knees spread all over there 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.460
 round shattered now no one 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.140
 need to explain everyone is buying by 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.820
 opportunities on our own 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.919
 totally against black birds 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.479
 the reason is banal, I already later 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.850
 repeatedly said in nature no 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.490
 black here and so 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.039
 berets any 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.470
 the season is not that rock 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.810
 sticking which unmasks a fighter 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.139
 you can be completely all over 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.150
 black berets camouflage 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.960
 give us for some reason, all here is black 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.720
 black black 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.650
 so we at least brown well here on 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.310
 me too 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:48.919
 NATO option they do not work 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.940
 money would be so on the berets such order 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.009
 700 800 hryvnia tactical gloves on 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.740
 I now need the summer version 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.900
 they are also required to change 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.080
 protect hands fighting accounts 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.139
 lead not only there on a soft lawn 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.190
 naturally yes well and on asphalt and at 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.819
 falling on asphalt 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.770
 Naturally phalanxes of fingers 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:15.440
 scatter you are already injured you are no longer 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.229
 you can perform those functions qualitatively 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.870
 who are entrusted to you by my dads there 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.419
 Quixote came to us guys cyborg they 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.210
 still such as humor is not humor black 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:28.270
 prompted another use gloves 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.680
 if tears away a polystone stays inside 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.330
 that is, you can then take to put 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.349
 Kulechek sew that was repeatedly 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.780
 without gloves 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.780
 man is left without a phalanx of fingers
