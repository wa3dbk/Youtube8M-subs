like 300 almost 300 pounds probably more

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
because you couldn't get it you couldn't

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
because you couldn't get it you couldn't
get<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> stacked<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.189> version<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> any

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.260 
longer but now the prices have crashed
it<00:01:18.479> absolutely<00:01:19.049> crushed<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.790> reason<00:01:21.090> being

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it absolutely crushed the reason being

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
it absolutely crushed the reason being
because<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.810> trade<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.290> obviously<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
because you can trade up obviously to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.090 
because you can trade up obviously to
the<00:01:23.520> stattrak<00:01:24.299> versions<00:01:24.869> now<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.799> not<00:01:25.979> as

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the stattrak versions now so it's not as

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.080 
the stattrak versions now so it's not as
rare<00:01:26.130> as<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.640> once<00:01:26.790> was

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
rare as it once was

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.530 
rare as it once was
so<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.290> little<00:01:28.920> bit<00:01:29.040> does<00:01:29.250> disappoint<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> about

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
so a little bit does disappoint it about

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.249 
so a little bit does disappoint it about
that<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:33.020> try<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.200> get

are<00:02:17.930> caimen<00:02:18.940> when<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.030> trade<00:02:20.300> up<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:21.650> one

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
are caimen when you trade up and the one

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.080 
are caimen when you trade up and the one
I<00:02:21.860> really<00:02:22.100> obviously<00:02:22.580> want<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:22.880> want<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
I really obviously want we want the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
I really obviously want we want the
Orion<00:02:23.450> that's<00:02:23.690> what<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:23.959> want<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:24.920> we

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
Orion that's what we want and if we

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.729 
Orion that's what we want and if we
don't<00:02:25.250> get<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.550> Orion<00:02:26.239> we<00:02:26.480> want<00:02:26.720> knee<00:02:26.900> em<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
don't get the Orion we want knee em and

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.280 
don't get the Orion we want knee em and
the<00:02:27.980> atomic<00:02:28.700> alloy<00:02:28.940> that's<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.810> next<00:02:30.080> thing

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the atomic alloy that's the next thing

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.860 
the atomic alloy that's the next thing
that<00:02:30.319> is<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:31.100> higher<00:02:31.700> value<00:02:31.730> than<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.450> rest<00:02:32.660> if

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
that is of higher value than the rest if

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.090 
that is of higher value than the rest if
we<00:02:33.290> get<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.739> have<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.160> scar<00:02:34.610> 20<00:02:34.910> cyrix<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:36.320> hymen

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
we get I have a scar 20 cyrix or a hymen

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.009 
we get I have a scar 20 cyrix or a hymen
we've<00:02:37.610> lost<00:02:37.850> out<00:02:38.180> we've<00:02:38.390> lost<00:02:38.570> out<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.810> the

we've lost out we've lost out on the

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.600 
we've lost out we've lost out on the
money<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.890> also<00:02:40.010> depends<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.489> what

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
money and it also depends on what

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.820 
money and it also depends on what
condition<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:41.660> we're<00:02:42.320> gonna<00:02:42.440> have<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.709> look

now<00:03:41.080> I'm<00:03:41.140> pretty<00:03:41.380> sure<00:03:41.620> off<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.010> top<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.940> my

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
now I'm pretty sure off the top of my

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.870 
now I'm pretty sure off the top of my
head<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:43.360> worth<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.960> 50<00:03:44.440> 50<00:03:45.250> pounds<00:03:45.640> and

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
head that's worth like 50 50 pounds and

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.150 
head that's worth like 50 50 pounds and
we<00:03:48.880> spent<00:03:49.300> around<00:03:49.510> like<00:03:49.990> 17<00:03:50.530> pounds<00:03:50.740> on<00:03:51.040> all

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
we spent around like 17 pounds on all

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.790 
we spent around like 17 pounds on all
those<00:03:51.310> small<00:03:52.090> stat<00:03:52.390> tracks<00:03:52.690> now<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.530> at<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
those small stat tracks now that at the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.590 
those small stat tracks now that at the
moment<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.280> think<00:03:54.520> this<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:55.000> time<00:03:55.270> where

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
moment I think this is the time where

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.270 
moment I think this is the time where
you<00:03:55.720> can<00:03:55.900> sort<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.200> do<00:03:56.410> shit<00:03:56.740> like<00:03:56.890> this<00:03:57.040> and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
you can sort of do shit like this and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.880 
you can sort of do shit like this and
maybe<00:03:57.430> profit<00:03:58.120> from<00:03:58.240> it<00:03:58.450> but<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:58.900> think<00:03:58.960> in<00:03:59.440> time

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
maybe profit from it but I think in time

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.240 
maybe profit from it but I think in time
the<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:01.150> prices<00:04:02.110> of<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.500> lowest<00:04:02.830> at<00:04:02.980> tracks

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
the the prices of the lowest at tracks

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.070 
the the prices of the lowest at tracks
that<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.460> just<00:04:03.820> bought<00:04:04.060> they're<00:04:04.690> going<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.930> go

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
that I just bought they're going to go

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.170 
that I just bought they're going to go
up<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.830> up<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.010> up<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.280> up<00:04:06.460> until<00:04:06.940> they<00:04:07.030> reach

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
up and up and up and up until they reach

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.670 
up and up and up and up until they reach
the<00:04:07.330> point<00:04:07.480> where<00:04:07.690> it<00:04:07.780> all<00:04:07.870> balances<00:04:08.290> out<00:04:08.440> and

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
the point where it all balances out and

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.180 
the point where it all balances out and
you<00:04:08.740> won't<00:04:08.950> make<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:10.300> much<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.440> profit<00:04:11.890> so

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
you won't make that much of a profit so

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.150 
you won't make that much of a profit so

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
I've got 1286 on this so we'll select

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.000 
I've got 1286 on this so we'll select
that<00:05:05.770> for<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.160> swap<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:07.140> I<00:05:08.140> won't<00:05:08.710> put<00:05:08.860> it<00:05:08.890> on

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
that for a swap and I won't put it on

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.160 
that for a swap and I won't put it on
this<00:05:09.130> one<00:05:09.340> because<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:10.240> think<00:05:10.750> that's<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.050> bad

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
this one because I think that's a bad

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.110 
this one because I think that's a bad
example<00:05:11.320> I'll<00:05:12.070> just<00:05:12.130> show<00:05:12.550> that<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.790> can<00:05:12.970> put

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
example I'll just show that you can put

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.660 
example I'll just show that you can put
it<00:05:13.210> on<00:05:13.300> any<00:05:13.540> other<00:05:14.220> Guardian<00:05:15.220> it<00:05:15.340> has<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.580> be

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
it on any other Guardian it has to be

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.600 
it on any other Guardian it has to be
the<00:05:15.790> same<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:17.320> a<00:05:17.350> USB<00:05:17.860> so<00:05:18.130> it<00:05:18.190> has<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.430> be<00:05:18.520> the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
the same so a USB so it has to be the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.439 
the same so a USB so it has to be the
same<00:05:18.820> type<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.180> weapon<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.780> doesn't<00:05:20.020> matter

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
same type of weapon it doesn't matter

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.909 
same type of weapon it doesn't matter
skin<00:05:20.779> type<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.400> you<00:05:22.400> can<00:05:22.580> swap<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:24.740> way

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
skin type so you can swap it that way

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.679 
skin type so you can swap it that way
and<00:05:25.129> back<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:25.699> obviously<00:05:26.389> I'm<00:05:26.479> going<00:05:26.509> to

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
and back so obviously I'm going to

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.059 
and back so obviously I'm going to
change<00:05:26.870> this<00:05:27.020> back<00:05:27.080> after<00:05:27.529> we're<00:05:27.650> done<00:05:27.800> but

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
change this back after we're done but

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:30.489 
change this back after we're done but

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
proceeds look at all those numbers again

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.779 
proceeds look at all those numbers again

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
like that confirm swap so there we go I

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.469 
like that confirm swap so there we go I
trade<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.169> all<00:05:45.349> those<00:05:45.789> all<00:05:46.789> of<00:05:46.999> those<00:05:47.120> points
