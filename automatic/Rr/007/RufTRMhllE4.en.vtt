00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.369
 I'll explain how to build a microphone 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.829
 suffered for battery cases by copying the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.410
 famous microphone calls that has a cost 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:33.550
 around 400 euros 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 how to do it with 30 40 euros at most 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.410
 using materials you can find 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.420
 any hardware store to do this 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.780
 microphone as I told you we used 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.350
 an 8 inch with an impedance of 16 or in 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.680
 Exit 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.190
 another or let's say fundamental part is 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.799
 the housing of the microphone which in 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.250
 this case was done with a 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:01:00.460
 very simple pvc tube one of the tools 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.949
 that are used for sewage or drainage 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.199
 water drains this pipe into 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.490
 origin was one meter 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.280
 I am paid around 22 cm using 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.840
 let's say the part you use for 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.659
 channel the next tube then the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.350
 part that goes to open to one of the two 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.490
 end 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.780
 then it took I made stirrups of 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.370
 iron and 8 bolts using these 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.320
 materials that I have listed to you 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.570
 we have then 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.030
 proceeded to assemble them in this way 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.690
 we drilled the holes in 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.960
 matching the bolts in the pipe 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.700
 of PVC and shaped our rooms 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.729
 live them with a certain pressure indeed 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.860
 as you can see the bracket exercises 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.500
 some pressure on the tire that 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.070
 protects our cone before doing 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.630
 this however we proceeded to 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.840
 internal wiring of the delbono as 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.430
 you can see our neck was 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.020
 connected using the positive pole of the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.150
 cone on our hot pole of the del 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.580
 collector that not from panel that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.970
 we used while the negative pole 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.140
 of our cone has been connected 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:33.610
 on the cold pole of the collector which 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:37.710
 no extra panel we added 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.760
 also a mass that we say 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.060
 in sound terms 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.939
 real we say does not affect the 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.500
 I play in a particular way but that we 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:55.819
 let's say we preferred to install 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:59.409
 by connecting one of ours to your neck 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:02.930
 collector that does not from panel to cable 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:06.700
 commonly used for mass on one 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:12.079
 of our bolts then recapitulating 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.099
 the positive pole of our cone on 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:19.069
 pole number two of ours that not the 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.549
 negative pole of our cone on the pole 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.920
 number three of ours that not the mass a 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.489
 one of the iron bolts on pole 1 of the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.280
 our theme connector now we will do 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:35.450
 demonstrations to hear how 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.000
 sounds and compares it and adds it to 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.540
 other microphones commonly used for the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 battery case small premise the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.169
 our sub who is the exit of ours 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.160
 immediately in this case it is directed on 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:54.019
 next tutorial we will show you how 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.609
 install a small switch with one 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:02.959
 second output that will have an output 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:06.379
 attenuated by about 20 of b so as to 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.720
 be able to make your sub kick more 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:13.069
 manageable according to the first situation 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.980
 rich go and use ok now let's try 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.690
 operation before trying it on 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.959
 real tool the functioning of the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.599
 our sub kick to check if 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.610
 we have a good kind of signal not 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:31.080
 saturated connected to a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:34.590
 universal audio to infinity 710 where 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.789
 as you can see I have inserted a pub 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:44.729
 of 15 types 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:47.520
 let's try it now we will do 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.139
 tests with the real instrument with 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.139
 a real battery case 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:22.660
 aud xd six out xd 6 consumption kick to kg of 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:24.990
 12 vr to 12 vr kg with kick on only 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.990
