so<00:00:48.839> for<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.079> next<00:00:49.170> few<00:00:49.410> minutes<00:00:49.530> we're<00:00:49.920> going

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so for the next few minutes we're going

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.900 
so for the next few minutes we're going
to<00:00:50.100> talk<00:00:50.250> about<00:00:50.339> the<00:00:50.489> problem<00:00:50.789> with

avoid<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.870> over<00:00:54.870> correction<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.350> almost

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
avoid it over correction is almost

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.319 
avoid it over correction is almost
always<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.370> result<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.820> other<00:00:56.969> dangerous

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
always the result of other dangerous

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.660 
always the result of other dangerous
driving<00:00:57.570> habits<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.530> remember<00:00:58.949> stay<00:00:59.640> focused

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
driving habits so remember stay focused

driving habits so remember stay focused
and<00:01:00.329> alert<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.929> driving<00:01:01.350> over<00:01:05.360> correction

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and alert when driving over correction

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.969 
and alert when driving over correction
is<00:01:06.509> when<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.960> find<00:01:07.170> yourself<00:01:07.259> off<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> road

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979

and it's that impulse to get back on the
road<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.789> the<00:01:11.789> knee-jerk<00:01:12.119> reaction<00:01:12.570> to
