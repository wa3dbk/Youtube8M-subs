have for you guys today is your

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.659 
have for you guys today is your
sensitivity<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.500> your<00:00:31.740> sensitivity<00:00:32.399> whenever

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
sensitivity so your sensitivity whenever

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.670 
sensitivity so your sensitivity whenever
you're<00:00:32.850> playing<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.660> has<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> huge<00:00:34.260> effect<00:00:34.350> on

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
you're playing it has a huge effect on

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.889 
you're playing it has a huge effect on
you<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.270> you're<00:00:36.390> playing<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> low

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you so if you're playing on a low

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.799 
you so if you're playing on a low
sensitivity<00:00:37.579> me<00:00:38.579> personally<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> play<00:00:39.660> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
sensitivity me personally I play in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.610 
sensitivity me personally I play in
fast-paced<00:00:40.230> games<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.670> i<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.050> 10<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
fast-paced games so i have it on 10 I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.100 
fast-paced games so i have it on 10 I
used<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.340> 10<00:00:44.550> sensitivity<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.629> did<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
used the 10 sensitivity it did take a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.540 
used the 10 sensitivity it did take a
while<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:46.410> me<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.340> there

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
while for me to actually get there

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.770 
while for me to actually get there
though<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> didn't<00:00:48.030> automatically<00:00:48.480> start

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
though I didn't automatically start

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
though I didn't automatically start
using<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.370> started<00:00:50.879> off<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.570> three

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
using it but I started off at like three

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.869 
using it but I started off at like three
or<00:00:52.020> four<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.680> then<00:00:52.800> after<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.370> year<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.670> decided

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
or four and then after a year I decided

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.670 
or four and then after a year I decided
to<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.829> I<00:00:55.829> guess<00:00:57.109> challenge<00:00:58.109> myself<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
to kind of I guess challenge myself and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.369 
to kind of I guess challenge myself and
after<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> year<00:00:59.969> was<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.600> went<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> seven

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
after that year was up I went to seven

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470 
after that year was up I went to seven
and<00:01:02.039> after<00:01:02.399> seven<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:03.000> felt<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.300> was

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and after seven I just felt like it was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.969 
and after seven I just felt like it was
easier<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.989> bump<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.650> 10

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
easier just to bump it all the way to 10

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.210 
easier just to bump it all the way to 10
and<00:01:05.220> now<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.210> my<00:01:07.110> sensitivities<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.130> way

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and now my my sensitivities all the way

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.060 
and now my my sensitivities all the way
up<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> could<00:01:08.850> turn<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.240> people<00:01:09.630> and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
up just so I could turn on people and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.340 
up just so I could turn on people and
it's<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.250> crazy<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.180> completely<00:01:13.110> do<00:01:13.320> a

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's pretty crazy like I completely do a

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
it's pretty crazy like I completely do a
180<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.220> somebody<00:01:14.700> simply<00:01:15.090> because<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.630> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
180 on somebody simply because I have a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
180 on somebody simply because I have a
higher<00:01:15.900> sensitivity<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.400> not<00:01:17.430> saying

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
higher sensitivity now I'm not saying

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.820 
higher sensitivity now I'm not saying
the<00:01:17.820> best<00:01:17.970> players<00:01:18.420> play<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.110> sensitivities

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
the best players play on I sensitivities

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.920 
the best players play on I sensitivities
but<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.670> does<00:01:20.909> give<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> an<00:01:21.240> advantage<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
but it does give you an advantage and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320 
but it does give you an advantage and
after<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> while<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.280> can't<00:01:23.490> control<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
after a while if you can't control that

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.780 
after a while if you can't control that
sensitivity<00:01:24.890> I<00:01:25.890> would<00:01:26.460> highly<00:01:26.729> recommend

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
sensitivity I would highly recommend

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.020 
sensitivity I would highly recommend
using<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.890> like<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> said<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.220> i'm<00:01:29.909> not

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
using it now like I said I i'm not

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.660 
using it now like I said I i'm not
saying<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.590> best<00:01:31.890> players<00:01:32.280> play

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
saying at all that the best players play

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
saying at all that the best players play
on<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.329> i<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.600> few<00:01:33.689> people<00:01:34.140> i

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
on that because i know a few people i

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
on that because i know a few people i
shouldn't<00:01:34.500> play<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.740> low<00:01:34.890> sensitivities<00:01:35.579> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
shouldn't play on low sensitivities but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.670 
shouldn't play on low sensitivities but
they<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> great<00:01:37.650> understanding

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
they just have a great understanding

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.490 
they just have a great understanding
about<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.729> maps<00:01:38.990> about<00:01:39.990> how<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> other

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
about the maps about how the other

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.050 
about the maps about how the other
people<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:40.950> playing<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.759> they

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
people are playing and they just they

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.280 
people are playing and they just they
play<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> lot<00:01:42.450> better<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:42.990> lower

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
play a lot better with lower

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.639 
play a lot better with lower
sensitivities<00:01:44.119> but<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.290> urge<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.619> guys

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
sensitivities but I I just urge you guys

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.120 
sensitivities but I I just urge you guys
to<00:01:46.799> kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.640> test<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.149> out<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.329> what<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
to kind of test it out see what it is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.179 
to kind of test it out see what it is
because<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.970> help<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.420> um<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:53.159> said

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
because it can help you um like I said

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.010 
because it can help you um like I said
just<00:01:53.369> turned<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.880> people<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.360> gives<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
just turned on people it's gives you a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.139 
just turned on people it's gives you a
huge<00:01:55.200> advantage<00:01:55.549> I've<00:01:56.549> been<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.909> numerous

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
huge advantage I've been in numerous

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.709 
huge advantage I've been in numerous
situations<00:01:57.659> where<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:59.240> probably<00:02:00.240> should<00:02:00.630> have

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
situations where I probably should have

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.569 
situations where I probably should have
got<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.930> kill<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.979> had<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> quicker

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
got the kill but I just had that quicker

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.690 
got the kill but I just had that quicker
reaction<00:02:02.820> time<00:02:03.149> turn<00:02:03.570> around<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:05.340> killed<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
reaction time turn around and killed the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.270 
reaction time turn around and killed the
person<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:07.049> next<00:02:07.259> thing<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.560> follows

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
person and the next thing that follows

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.630 
person and the next thing that follows
by<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.819> I<00:02:08.849> guess<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> nice<00:02:09.629> little<00:02:09.869> segue

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
by that I guess is a nice little segue

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.970 
by that I guess is a nice little segue
is<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.330> at

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
is going to be at

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.600 
is going to be at
so<00:02:13.610> by<00:02:14.569> having<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.930> high-sensitivity<00:02:15.140> i<00:02:16.040> play

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so by having a high-sensitivity i play

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.729 
so by having a high-sensitivity i play
on<00:02:16.640> 10<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.299> lot<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.840> people<00:02:17.989> can't<00:02:18.260> control<00:02:18.560> it

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
on 10 a lot of people can't control it

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.110 
on 10 a lot of people can't control it
so<00:02:18.890> their<00:02:19.040> accuracy<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.580> off<00:02:19.760> they<00:02:19.940> might

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
so their accuracy is off they might

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.869 
so their accuracy is off they might
spray<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.540> pray<00:02:20.569> or<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:22.459> something<00:02:22.760> like

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
spray and pray or it's something like

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.270 
spray and pray or it's something like
that<00:02:23.180> but<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:24.110> personally<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> have<00:02:24.920> really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
that but be personally I have really

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.509 
that but be personally I have really
really<00:02:25.430> good<00:02:25.700> accuracy<00:02:26.620> even<00:02:27.620> though<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.250> plant

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
really good accuracy even though I plant

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.670 
really good accuracy even though I plant
in<00:02:28.730> sensitivity<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.599> think<00:02:30.049> my<00:02:30.170> accuracy<00:02:30.500> is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
in sensitivity I think my accuracy is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.539 
in sensitivity I think my accuracy is
over<00:02:31.519> 20<00:02:31.910> for<00:02:32.060> sure<00:02:32.239> but<00:02:33.049> even<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:34.160> whenever

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
over 20 for sure but even so whenever

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.339 
over 20 for sure but even so whenever
you<00:02:34.700> see<00:02:34.940> me<00:02:34.970> shoot<00:02:35.299> somebody<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.900> very<00:02:36.140> very

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
you see me shoot somebody is very very

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.819 
you see me shoot somebody is very very
pinpoint<00:02:36.920> it's<00:02:37.459> very<00:02:37.790> on<00:02:38.780> target<00:02:39.410> whenever

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
pinpoint it's very on target whenever

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.680 
pinpoint it's very on target whenever
you<00:02:39.980> whenever<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.670> see<00:02:40.910> an<00:02:41.000> enemy<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.510> not

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
you whenever I see an enemy it's not

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.990 
you whenever I see an enemy it's not
spraying<00:02:42.409> all<00:02:42.650> over<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.980> place<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
spraying all over the place so that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.050 
spraying all over the place so that
takes<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.510> lot<00:02:44.659> of<00:02:44.720> time<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:46.430> accuracy

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
takes a lot of time because accuracy

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.050 
takes a lot of time because accuracy
that's<00:02:47.299> that's<00:02:48.110> just<00:02:48.319> all<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.849> rent<00:02:49.849> come

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's that's just all in the rent come

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.199 
that's that's just all in the rent come
stick<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:51.069> highly<00:02:52.069> recommend<00:02:52.340> practicing

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
stick so I highly recommend practicing

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.080 
stick so I highly recommend practicing
your<00:02:53.629> accuracy<00:02:53.989> too<00:02:54.349> because<00:02:54.769> if<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.910> have

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
your accuracy too because if you have

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.509 
your accuracy too because if you have
that<00:02:56.239> first<00:02:56.540> shot<00:02:56.750> off<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.140> somebody<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.890> you

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
that first shot off on somebody and you

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.300 
that first shot off on somebody and you
hit<00:02:58.790> them<00:02:58.819> if<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.510> accuracy<00:02:59.959> is<00:02:59.989> there<00:03:00.310> you're

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
hit them if the accuracy is there you're

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.309 
hit them if the accuracy is there you're
gonna<00:03:01.430> get<00:03:01.579> to<00:03:01.700> kill<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.180> majority<00:03:02.989> of<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.109> time

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
gonna get to kill a majority of the time

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.440 
gonna get to kill a majority of the time
so<00:03:04.090> accuracy<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.359> a<00:03:05.390> huge<00:03:05.810> thing<00:03:06.079> for<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.560> and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
so accuracy is a huge thing for you and

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.780 
so accuracy is a huge thing for you and
the<00:03:08.450> way<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.840> practice<00:03:09.319> accuracy<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.129> going

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
the way the practice accuracy is going

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.780 
the way the practice accuracy is going
to<00:03:10.879> be<00:03:11.140> used<00:03:12.140> like<00:03:12.290> mk14<00:03:13.099> a<00:03:13.129> single<00:03:13.579> shotgun

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
to be used like mk14 a single shotgun

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.610 
to be used like mk14 a single shotgun
because<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.660> can't<00:03:14.870> really<00:03:15.019> spray<00:03:15.440> with

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
because you can't really spray with

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.819 
because you can't really spray with
those<00:03:15.769> weapons<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:17.200> i<00:03:18.200> would<00:03:18.739> highly

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
those weapons so i would highly

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.470 
those weapons so i would highly
recommend<00:03:18.980> using<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.669> like<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> one-shot

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
recommend using that like a one-shot

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.750 
recommend using that like a one-shot
semi-automatic<00:03:21.349> and<00:03:21.470> that<00:03:22.250> will<00:03:22.400> help<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.730> a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
semi-automatic and that will help you a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.800 
semi-automatic and that will help you a
lot<00:03:23.060> because<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:24.380> have<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.950> hit<00:03:25.430> your<00:03:25.700> I<00:03:26.060> guess

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
lot because you have to hit your I guess

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.839 
lot because you have to hit your I guess
gets<00:03:27.049> your<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:28.069> center<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.430> screen<00:03:28.609> on

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
gets your the center of the screen on

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.839 
gets your the center of the screen on
that<00:03:28.880> person<00:03:29.419> in<00:03:29.540> order<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.900> kill<00:03:30.019> them<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.470> I

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
that person in order to kill them so I

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.729 
that person in order to kill them so I
highly<00:03:31.849> recommend<00:03:32.090> doing<00:03:32.930> that<00:03:33.109> you<00:03:33.500> know<00:03:33.530> if

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
highly recommend doing that you know if

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.960 
highly recommend doing that you know if
your<00:03:33.889> accuracy<00:03:34.130> isn't<00:03:34.400> too<00:03:34.549> high<00:03:34.730> because

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
your accuracy isn't too high because

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.270 
your accuracy isn't too high because
well<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> lot<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:35.959> people<00:03:36.260> use<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.829> Kimbo

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
well a lot of people use like a Kimbo

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.940 
well a lot of people use like a Kimbo
weapons<00:03:37.760> and<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.810> really<00:03:39.019> destroys<00:03:39.620> your

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
weapons and that really destroys your

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.849 
weapons and that really destroys your
accuracy<00:03:40.609> simply<00:03:41.209> because<00:03:41.540> you're<00:03:42.410> shooting

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
accuracy simply because you're shooting

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.470 
accuracy simply because you're shooting
all<00:03:42.980> those<00:03:43.130> bullets<00:03:43.549> towards<00:03:43.849> somebody<00:03:44.030> and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
all those bullets towards somebody and

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.650 
all those bullets towards somebody and
you're<00:03:44.989> kind<00:03:45.230> of<00:03:45.290> ensuring<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.919> kill<00:03:46.160> but<00:03:46.660> if

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
you're kind of ensuring the kill but if

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.000 
you're kind of ensuring the kill but if
you're<00:03:47.810> trying<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.019> get<00:03:48.169> your<00:03:48.260> accuracy<00:03:48.590> up<00:03:48.829> if

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
you're trying to get your accuracy up if

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.890 
you're trying to get your accuracy up if
you're<00:03:49.099> trying<00:03:49.250> to<00:03:49.340> get<00:03:49.489> better<00:03:49.609> that<00:03:49.970> way<00:03:50.150> I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
you're trying to get better that way I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.229 
you're trying to get better that way I
would<00:03:51.440> highly<00:03:51.650> recommend<00:03:51.680> using<00:03:52.250> like<00:03:52.459> mk14

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
would highly recommend using like mk14

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.750 
would highly recommend using like mk14
or<00:03:53.540> any<00:03:53.690> type<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.900> semi-automatic<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.889> well<00:03:55.730> I

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
or any type of semi-automatic so well I

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.059 
or any type of semi-automatic so well I
guess<00:03:55.940> that's<00:03:56.120> the<00:03:56.180> only<00:03:56.269> one<00:03:56.480> on<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.690> game

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
guess that's the only one on this game

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.890 
guess that's the only one on this game
anyways<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.940> next<00:03:59.209> thing<00:03:59.329> I<00:03:59.480> have<00:03:59.629> for<00:03:59.870> you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
anyways the next thing I have for you

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.670 
anyways the next thing I have for you
guys<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:01.579> button<00:04:01.819> layout<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:03.049> a<00:04:03.379> lot<00:04:03.650> of

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
guys is the button layout so a lot of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.309 
guys is the button layout so a lot of
people<00:04:03.799> use<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.730> default<00:04:05.209> layout<00:04:05.419> and<00:04:06.109> what<00:04:06.290> I

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
people use the default layout and what I

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.319 
people use the default layout and what I
mean<00:04:06.470> by<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.799> is<00:04:07.040> whenever<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.910> try<00:04:08.299> to

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
mean by that is whenever you try to

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.629 
mean by that is whenever you try to
knife<00:04:08.599> somebody<00:04:09.079> it's<00:04:09.290> going<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.560> be<00:04:09.829> the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
knife somebody it's going to be the

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.250 
knife somebody it's going to be the
right<00:04:10.790> thumbstick<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.599> default<00:04:11.989> and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
right thumbstick for the default and

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.250 
right thumbstick for the default and
then<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.739> try<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.010> drop<00:04:13.849> drop<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:15.019> prone

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
then if you try to drop drop and prone

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.590 
then if you try to drop drop and prone
it's<00:04:15.919> going<00:04:16.130> to<00:04:16.160> be<00:04:16.340> B<00:04:16.609> or

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
it's going to be B or

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.360 
it's going to be B or
is<00:04:17.740> circle<00:04:18.740> on<00:04:19.510> circle<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.660> ps3<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.410> highly

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
is circle on circle on ps3 I highly

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.140 
is circle on circle on ps3 I highly
recommend<00:04:22.520> using<00:04:23.590> tactical<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:25.460> started

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
recommend using tactical and I started

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.120 
recommend using tactical and I started
using<00:04:26.300> tactical<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.930> couple<00:04:27.410> years<00:04:27.590> ago<00:04:27.680> and

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
using tactical a couple years ago and

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.860 
using tactical a couple years ago and
it's<00:04:28.280> absolutely<00:04:28.430> amazing<00:04:29.030> because<00:04:29.480> i<00:04:29.540> really

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it's absolutely amazing because i really

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.930 
it's absolutely amazing because i really
don't<00:04:30.020> come<00:04:30.200> into<00:04:30.350> too<00:04:30.620> many<00:04:30.940> knife

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
don't come into too many knife

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.370 
don't come into too many knife
situations<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.020> i<00:04:33.650> come<00:04:33.980> into<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.280> lot<00:04:34.490> more

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
situations and i come into a lot more

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.370 
situations and i come into a lot more
what's<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.650> guess<00:04:37.220> drop<00:04:37.580> shotting<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.300> if<00:04:39.200> you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
what's I guess drop shotting so if you

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.990 
what's I guess drop shotting so if you
don't<00:04:39.530> know<00:04:39.590> drop<00:04:39.980> shotting<00:04:40.220> is<00:04:40.460> its<00:04:40.760> when<00:04:40.970> you

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
don't know drop shotting is its when you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.640 
don't know drop shotting is its when you
immediately<00:04:41.690> drop<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.230> floor<00:04:42.350> whenever

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
immediately drop to the floor whenever

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.470 
immediately drop to the floor whenever
you<00:04:42.890> encounter<00:04:43.220> an<00:04:43.730> enemy<00:04:44.030> or<00:04:44.060> come<00:04:44.390> across

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
you encounter an enemy or come across

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.690 
you encounter an enemy or come across
one<00:04:44.930> and<00:04:45.170> it<00:04:45.770> gives<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.190> slight<00:04:46.520> advantage

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
one and it gives you a slight advantage

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.930 
one and it gives you a slight advantage
I<00:04:47.240> feel<00:04:47.450> like<00:04:47.600> instead<00:04:48.290> of<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:49.190> enemy<00:04:49.580> aiming

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
I feel like instead of the enemy aiming

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.570 
I feel like instead of the enemy aiming
directly<00:04:50.090> towards<00:04:50.720> a<00:04:50.780> standing<00:04:51.200> body<00:04:51.580> just

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
directly towards a standing body just

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.730 
directly towards a standing body just
that<00:04:52.760> slight<00:04:53.150> difference<00:04:53.720> in<00:04:53.960> the<00:04:54.290> position

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
that slight difference in the position

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.060 
that slight difference in the position
of<00:04:54.860> where<00:04:55.010> you're<00:04:55.220> at<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.880> can<00:04:56.060> definitely

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
of where you're at it can definitely

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.360 
of where you're at it can definitely
help<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.220> survive<00:04:58.730> a<00:04:58.790> few<00:04:59.180> gun<00:04:59.420> battles<00:04:59.840> and

do is just play around with the

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.800 
do is just play around with the
sensitivity<00:05:25.000> work<00:05:26.000> on<00:05:26.180> your<00:05:26.330> accuracy

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810
