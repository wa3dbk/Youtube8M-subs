00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
some tweaking and the truth is I know

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.160 
some tweaking and the truth is I know
these<00:01:44.159> things<00:01:44.579> are<00:01:44.850> very<00:01:45.149> important<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
these things are very important to you

these update videos for you we tend to
have<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.049> discussion<00:01:52.829> around<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310

vegetation and the cover on the map so
the<00:01:56.670> fact<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.060> dice<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.780> saying

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the fact that dice are saying

that I I I do feel means that we are

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
more dense vegetation in my humble

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.760 
more dense vegetation in my humble
opinion<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:15.150> as<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.810> say<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.080> need<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.260> move<00:02:16.560> on

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
opinion but as I say we need to move on

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.980 
opinion but as I say we need to move on
and<00:02:16.920> we<00:02:17.040> need<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> focus<00:02:17.610> any<00:02:18.090> feedback<00:02:18.570> we

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
and we need to focus any feedback we

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.930 
and we need to focus any feedback we
have<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.770> get<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> chance<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> play<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.790> map

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
have if you get a chance to play the map

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.230 
have if you get a chance to play the map
at<00:02:21.090> least<00:02:21.300> on<00:02:21.630> how<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.650> actual<00:02:23.430> flags<00:02:23.820> hell

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
at least on how the actual flags hell

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.940 
at least on how the actual flags hell
the<00:02:24.450> points<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:24.960> interest<00:02:25.470> feel<00:02:26.130> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
the points of interest feel and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.250 
the points of interest feel and
specific<00:02:27.610> feedback<00:02:27.819> on<00:02:28.330> how<00:02:28.390> they<00:02:28.840> can<00:02:29.110> be

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
specific feedback on how they can be

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.100 
specific feedback on how they can be
improved<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.310> I've<00:02:30.940> got<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.420> say<00:02:31.629> really<00:02:31.870> of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
improved and I've got to say really of

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.380 
improved and I've got to say really of
the<00:02:32.260> two<00:02:32.470> maps<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:33.129> are<00:02:33.190> still<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.879> come<00:02:33.910> in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
the two maps that are still to come in

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.180 
the two maps that are still to come in
battlefield<00:02:34.930> 4<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.470> mean<00:02:35.769> of<00:02:35.860> course<00:02:35.920> they

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
battlefield 4 I mean of course they

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.190 
battlefield 4 I mean of course they
could<00:02:36.430> be<00:02:36.580> some<00:02:36.849> more<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.239> future<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.900> I'm

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
could be some more in the future and I'm

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.890 
could be some more in the future and I'm
discounting<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> night<00:02:39.670> maps<00:02:40.000> because<00:02:40.209> in<00:02:40.599> my

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
discounting the night maps because in my

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.720 
discounting the night maps because in my
mind<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.620> already<00:02:41.769> have<00:02:42.129> those<00:02:42.280> maps<00:02:42.580> we

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
mind we already have those maps we

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.759 
mind we already have those maps we
getting<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> different<00:02:43.360> version<00:02:43.569> but<00:02:44.349> of<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
getting a different version but of the

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.009 
getting a different version but of the
two<00:02:45.010> maps<00:02:45.310> which<00:02:45.610> are<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:46.060> dragon<00:02:46.420> Valley<00:02:46.630> and

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
two maps which are the dragon Valley and

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.370 
two maps which are the dragon Valley and
this<00:02:47.470> jungle<00:02:47.950> Matt<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.310> do<00:02:48.430> prefer<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.810> jungle

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
this jungle Matt I do prefer this jungle

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.559 
this jungle Matt I do prefer this jungle
map<00:02:50.560> now<00:02:51.010> don't<00:02:51.190> get<00:02:51.370> me<00:02:51.489> wrong<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:52.150> dragon

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
map now don't get me wrong the dragon

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.930 
map now don't get me wrong the dragon
Valley<00:02:52.750> can<00:02:53.140> be<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.470> fun<00:02:53.830> map<00:02:54.069> but<00:02:54.459> I<00:02:54.489> think<00:02:54.760> it's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
Valley can be a fun map but I think it's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.850 
Valley can be a fun map but I think it's
one<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.180> those<00:02:55.330> where<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:56.260> would<00:02:56.500> need

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
one of those where you really would need

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.390 
one of those where you really would need
to<00:02:57.730> have<00:02:57.970> say<00:02:58.330> three<00:02:58.900> four<00:02:59.260> five<00:02:59.709> friends<00:03:00.190> on

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
to have say three four five friends on

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.460 
to have say three four five friends on
there<00:03:00.580> with<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.599> make<00:03:01.780> sure<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:02.170> can<00:03:02.349> get

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
there with you to make sure you can get

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.620 
there with you to make sure you can get
the<00:03:02.590> most<00:03:02.830> out<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.459> experience<00:03:03.970> on<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.269> map

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
the most out of that experience on a map

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.170 
the most out of that experience on a map
that<00:03:04.660> size<00:03:05.170> whereas<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.099> jungle<00:03:06.640> map<00:03:06.849> the

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
that size whereas the jungle map the

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.990 
that size whereas the jungle map the
size<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.660> scale<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.079> it<00:03:08.410> are<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.459> that<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.790> can

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
size and scale of it are so that you can

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.900 
size and scale of it are so that you can
just<00:03:10.299> dip<00:03:11.290> in<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.799> of<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:12.519> own<00:03:12.549> if

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
just dip in and out of it on your own if

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.699 
just dip in and out of it on your own if
need<00:03:13.120> be<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.360> you<00:03:13.540> don't<00:03:13.780> have<00:03:14.110> friends<00:03:14.349> online

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
need be if you don't have friends online

which you wouldn't necessarily have I

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.110 
which you wouldn't necessarily have I
don't<00:03:19.390> think<00:03:19.660> on<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.290> dragon<00:03:20.680> Valley<00:03:20.860> map<00:03:21.250> but

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
don't think on the dragon Valley map but
