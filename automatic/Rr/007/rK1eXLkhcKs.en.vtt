00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.810 
that's acrylic that battle will shatter
upon<00:01:41.410> impact<00:01:41.740> but<00:01:42.040> it<00:01:42.160> does<00:01:42.280> stop<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.520> bullet

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
upon impact but it does stop a bullet

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.400 
upon impact but it does stop a bullet
pretty<00:01:43.090> well<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:43.570> there's<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.960> stop<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.170> bullet

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
pretty well so there's a stop a bullet

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.050 
pretty well so there's a stop a bullet
this<00:01:44.619> will<00:01:44.770> also<00:01:44.920> stop<00:01:45.250> a<00:01:45.280> bullet<00:01:45.580> pretty<00:01:45.850> well

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
this will also stop a bullet pretty well

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.520 
this will also stop a bullet pretty well
do<00:01:46.240> they<00:01:46.390> just<00:01:46.570> don't<00:01:46.720> use<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:47.050> but<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.410> lot

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
do they just don't use it but it's a lot

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.780 
do they just don't use it but it's a lot
more<00:01:47.680> expensive<00:01:47.920> what's<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.460> next<00:01:48.580> step

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
more expensive what's the next step

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.490 
more expensive what's the next step
could<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.060> get<00:01:49.180> something<00:01:49.509> like<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.840> tinted

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
could you get something like this tinted

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830 
could you get something like this tinted
well<00:01:51.009> we<00:01:51.130> can<00:01:51.310> do<00:01:51.430> tinting<00:01:51.940> we<00:01:52.060> can<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:52.390> edging

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
well we can do tinting we can do edging

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.350 
well we can do tinting we can do edging
and<00:01:53.050> then<00:01:53.200> I'm<00:01:53.320> also<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:54.340> little<00:01:54.759> bit<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.090> a<00:01:55.149> top

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
and then I'm also a little bit of a top

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.090 
and then I'm also a little bit of a top
secret<00:01:55.390> but<00:01:55.899> I'll<00:01:56.020> reveal<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.009> all

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
your viewers we're working on a concave

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.219 
your viewers we're working on a concave

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
convex center here so we'll actually

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.570 
convex center here so we'll actually
have<00:02:02.560> some<00:02:02.770> three<00:02:02.979> dimensions<00:02:04.770> next<00:02:05.770> year
