00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.940
 hey of the enemy cat how is it so good 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.030
 Well here I bring you a trick case of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.099
 infinite money for the online a 5 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.360
 well in this case what are we going to do 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.070
 is to clone camps 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.800
 and cars I could take that are not from 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 the super class could be 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.509
 of the sports class as well as the lg and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.970
 and would serve the sit-down would also serve and 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:36.570
 just as it is the well the only thing that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.850
 we must do is have two dredges one 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.629
 have it completely full as he 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 what is going to do now and the other have it 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.500
 empty if you have no car 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.500
 matter or has been completely 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.470
 well now as you will see with this car 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.340
 just fill this garage this is going to 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.190
 have full completely I recommend you 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.040
 have the garages that are near 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.950
 so that they are even faster 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.200
 and better 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.649
 then ready I have the garage full 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.260
 and now what he's going to do is take out the 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:19.700
 axis that I have on the other channel 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.110
 is this trick really is very easy and 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.340
 it's very practical because if you could 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.770
 earn between 150 and 200 and if it reaches 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.780
 fix the pantin well that is one the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.710
 that could be better in the a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 300 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.890
 in this case he will do with choosing if 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.940
 I already had it almost touching the top brother in law 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.240
 that is comfortable 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.690
 so I recommend that you use the 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:56.440
 phantom and the more keyboard is more 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.810
 value to keep then what there is 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.820
 what to do is take the car with which 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.610
 go to clarify 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.880
 go to the garage they have completely 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 full 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.509
 be located in a position that between 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.739
 car 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:19.959
 after positioning well puts the grenade 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:22.269
 and they point directly towards the garage and 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.769
 after having aimed the throw and 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.930
 they pass over the grenade 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.890
 the field will explode 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.219
 ready from there what you have to do is 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.340
 catch any street car 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:40.890
 whoever is out there, they take us 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.769
 they rob our being to jessica what 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.269
 they took directly and makes the car 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:51.870
 that you just exploded then 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.060
 and there they have to call us mutual already 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.099
 when I will get to win never and 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.409
 when he answers he will leave and the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.530
 car that just exploded in my case 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.760
 I get the chosen one then they have ready 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.980
 there to send to repair the car and 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.810
 as soon as they enter, they see that 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.770
 the car is already on the map then 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.680
 always my car just goes on the map 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.099
 they enter it 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.050
 and immediately what they have to do 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:27.140
 is to go to the blue circle that is behind 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.150
 this circle enter and change it by 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.010
 any space exchange it 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.180
 and there they would have their law and 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.129
 so now what you have to do is 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:45.480
 get out of the garage and just get out to enter 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:50.489
 a mission that is 1 to 4 people 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.829
 whatever it is worth as you see here 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.939
 I open a gerad mission that the one from 1 to 4 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.409
 people 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.590
 so what you have to do is 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.680
 enter directly leave the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.819
 mission once and what they will have 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.889
 to the front is your car duplicated if as 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.040
 they see it the complicated car already be without 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:15.000
 duplicate and if they want they can have what 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.340
 they can sell whatever 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.109
 Y 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.630
 now the next step that you have to 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:26.210
 do is take it to the holy courses and 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.229
 make any change you want 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.590
 change it either the paint the wheels 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:36.849
 the lights any change in this case 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.749
 Well, I'm going to change the plate 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.529
 which is what is least worth and most 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:46.039
 easy to make 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:50.779
 then it would only be any 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:53.569
 change to the car would be from us look and 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.459
 I changed the plate and the car did not 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.399
 can sell because he had just read 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:00.139
 another car and nine have gone from 45 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.749
 minutes 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.870
 then you can not give it but that car 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:08.120
 at 468,000 you can cut more 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.389
 it may cost them less depending on how 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.860
 have improved then nothing until 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.229

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.749
