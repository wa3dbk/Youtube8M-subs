00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
spending that much it's about $1 for the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
you have to order online that you use a

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.959 
you have to order online that you use a
light<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.039> heat<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> wax<00:00:58.039> that<00:00:59.039> holders

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
light to heat up the wax that holders

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.400 
light to heat up the wax that holders

all different designs that come in
different<00:01:03.239> colors<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:04.559> recommend<00:01:05.489> getting

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
different colors I recommend getting

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.000 
different colors I recommend getting
blocks<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.869> does<00:01:07.229> take<00:01:07.560> less<00:01:07.770> time<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
blocks because it does take less time to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.810 
blocks because it does take less time to
heat<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> lot<00:01:09.600> easier<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.990> clean

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
heat up and it is a lot easier to clean

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.399 
heat up and it is a lot easier to clean
when<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> clean<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> wax<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.170> do

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
when you clean the wax all you really do

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
when you clean the wax all you really do
is<00:01:13.439> wait<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.159> washed<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.760> get<00:01:14.909> warm

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is wait for it to get washed to get warm

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
is wait for it to get washed to get warm
and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.500> push<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.220> it'll

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and then you just push on it and it'll

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
and then you just push on it and it'll
come<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.720> not

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
come up because right now it's not

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.440 
come up because right now it's not
giving<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.580> push<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> it'll<00:01:21.299> come

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
giving so you just push on it it'll come

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.760 
giving so you just push on it it'll come
up<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.259> put<00:01:22.409> another<00:01:22.619> thing

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
up and then you just put another thing

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.140 
up and then you just put another thing
so<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.040> really<00:01:23.280> simple<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> clean<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so it's really simple to clean it's a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.499 
so it's really simple to clean it's a
mess<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:24.990> no<00:01:25.080> dripping<00:01:25.320> no<00:01:25.590> nothing<00:01:25.920> um

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
mess there's no dripping no nothing um

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.120 
mess there's no dripping no nothing um
they<00:01:27.509> have<00:01:27.630> animals<00:01:28.080> -<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.590> an<00:01:28.680> elephant

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
three to ten dollars and the higher

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.880 
three to ten dollars and the higher
market<00:02:36.060> price<00:02:36.240> ones<00:02:36.510> are<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:37.170> lot<00:02:37.740> better

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
market price ones are a lot better

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.950 
market price ones are a lot better
because<00:02:38.190> they<00:02:38.430> are<00:02:38.610> glass<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.300> they<00:02:39.510> are<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
because they are glass and they are a

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.640 
because they are glass and they are a
lot<00:02:40.410> easier<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.920> clean<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.990> second<00:02:43.440> type<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
lot easier to clean the second type of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.320 
lot easier to clean the second type of
candles<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.130> have<00:02:44.280> who<00:02:44.580> don't<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.120> one

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
candles they have who don't have one

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.930 
candles they have who don't have one
with<00:02:45.930> me<00:02:45.960> they<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.320> glass<00:02:46.950> containers<00:02:47.700> and

they have them online and they have they

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.690 
they have them online and they have they
look<00:02:51.330> like<00:02:51.510> jars<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:52.590> instead<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.280> using<00:02:53.520> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
look like jars but instead of using a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.410 
look like jars but instead of using a
candle<00:02:54.030> it's<00:02:54.450> used<00:02:55.220> by<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.250> light<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:57.270> keeps

candle it's used by a light that keeps
it<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.440> have<00:02:58.650> kids<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.790> don't

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.420 
it up so if you have kids and you don't
want<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.660> chance<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.920> candle<00:03:02.190> getting

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
or the lights in it so you don't have to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.710 
or the lights in it so you don't have to
ever<00:03:08.370> touch<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.760> light<00:03:08.940> unless<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.330> burns<00:03:09.510> out

and then you put the top back on it so

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.370 
and then you put the top back on it so

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
light bulb itself is a lot more but

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.780 
light bulb itself is a lot more but
