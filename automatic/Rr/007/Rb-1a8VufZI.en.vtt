00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 I know 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.790
 that 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.790
 I know 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.570
 Thank you for releasing and saving for 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.760
 to have died 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.760
 it's my place said agra 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.320
 the chinese shishi agra 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.320
 it is 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.149
 ef 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 that 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
 that 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:28.180
 the chords used in the song will be 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:42.069
 the greatest king is the gift of music is alone 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:44.819
 later with seventh and younger 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.819
 Greater there 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.930
 in this version you can put many 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.609
 other records including lower sun in 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.760
 some sections but it will be simplified 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.909
 the draw quite a chord and this makes 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.900
 that the harmony stays until a little middle 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.060
 committed to those who are already 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.700
 have used more refined involved 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.409
 not beginner will realize and will stay 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.209
 a little strange but who is a beginner 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.379
 it will not make that much difference 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.669
 beauty the rhythm of the song is a rhythm three 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.280
 for four 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:20.500
 or the rhythm that will have three tempos 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.919
 to make it easy I'll divide it into three 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.639
 shares that three-stroke grandson will be 123 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:30.569
 beauty so serious so to a job 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:37.690
 beauty 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:41.200
 the two down to the top then 11 12 and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:50.470
 got 12 to 11 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:55.019
 and the two are in 122 beauty the 3 will be 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:04:07.630
 for bottom - up also equal 23 ta3 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:11.650
 Ok, getting like this on 23-23 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:22.030
 just do it a lot of time 23 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:25.540
 there goes 2 323 2 323 it's never you exchange ok 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.160
 it is for example according to a 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.160
 the rest is with seventh sun 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.210
 ah but I did as many times as I did two 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.130
 times in reverse two with seventh and 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.130
 four times in the sun when so 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.610
 Okay, it's every time I start the rhythm. 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.010
 said one to facilitate this is the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.200
 Marking ok, you're training who goes 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:18.440
 getting beauty easy then it would be a 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:28.790
 version 34 for everything you have 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:32.600
 be the future more to promise 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:38.790
 all that is that i used one the lesser 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:42.200
 It was very nice to thank you. 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.200
 all my being 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.540
 It's a kv smaller sun than cute. 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:54.600
 then it would be some stretches like that 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:06:01.910
 Thank you for releasing me and saving the 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:12.229

 and the toy anyone there with 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.730
 seventh only to play but the beat is 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.840
 to follow what is quickly she does not stay 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.550
 rolling 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.720
 but if you want more tempo 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.540
 slow you can play right 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:49.720
 What have you done? 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:53.770

 Solve the problem 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:12.010
 123 2 323 but it would only be to illustrate 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:14.050
