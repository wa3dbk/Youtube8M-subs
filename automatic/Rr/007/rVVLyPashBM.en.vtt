00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
and we're going to draw a circle we're

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.200 
and we're going to draw a circle we're
not<00:02:01.160> going<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.340> close<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:01.730> circle<00:02:02.120> we're

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
not going to close the circle we're

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.850 
not going to close the circle we're
going<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.390> leave<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.540> little<00:02:02.810> gap<00:02:02.930> as<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.680> see

going to leave a little gap as you see

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.460 
going to leave a little gap as you see
there<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:05.120> I'm<00:02:05.300> actually<00:02:05.510> going<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:05.870> zoom<00:02:06.200> in

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
there and I'm actually going to zoom in

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.039 
there and I'm actually going to zoom in
so<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.980> better<00:02:07.190> idea<00:02:07.899> what<00:02:08.899> I'm<00:02:09.019> doing

here

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.550 
here
so<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.580> want<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:11.850> balloon<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.870> start<00:02:13.170> here

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so we want this balloon to start here

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
so we want this balloon to start here
and<00:02:14.160> we<00:02:14.550> want<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.970> end<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.690> end<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.080> the
