00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
hello hello everybody so we have two new

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.650 
hello hello everybody so we have two new
petals<00:00:04.350> from<00:00:04.650> my<00:00:04.799> professor<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:06.180> first<00:00:06.450> one

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
petals from my professor the first one

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.950 
petals from my professor the first one
would<00:00:06.779> be<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.820> pre<00:00:09.110> tribal<00:00:10.110> which<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:11.960> little

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
would be a pre tribal which is a little

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.980 
would be a pre tribal which is a little
bit<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.320> boost<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.099> compression<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.120> upper

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
bit of a boost and compression and upper

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.410 
bit of a boost and compression and upper
harmonic<00:00:16.500> enhancement<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.240> like

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
harmonic enhancement it's got it's like

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.070 
harmonic enhancement it's got it's like
a<00:00:18.449> setup<00:00:19.250> set<00:00:20.250> pedal<00:00:20.699> there's<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.330> switch<00:00:21.810> for

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
a setup set pedal there's a switch for

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
a setup set pedal there's a switch for
hot<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.590> cool<00:00:22.830> which<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.060> like

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hot and cool which is what would be like

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.880 
hot and cool which is what would be like
10<00:00:24.539> BBS<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.230> cool<00:00:25.529> would<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.250> 60<00:00:26.730> bees

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
10 BBS and cool would be like 60 bees

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.959 
10 BBS and cool would be like 60 bees
then<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.039> have<00:00:29.779> totally<00:00:30.779> new<00:00:30.960> approach<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.160> two

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
then we have totally new approach to two

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.569 
then we have totally new approach to two
things<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:34.050> called<00:00:34.290> evolution<00:00:34.680> orange<00:00:35.370> on

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
things it's called evolution orange on

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.880 
things it's called evolution orange on
the<00:00:35.730> drive<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.260> say<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the drive so let's say that you have a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.990 
the drive so let's say that you have a
vintage<00:00:38.309> amp<00:00:38.629> set<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.780> crunch<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.820> maybe<00:00:41.820> when

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
vintage amp set to crunch and maybe when

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520 
vintage amp set to crunch and maybe when
you<00:00:42.120> turn<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> volume<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.260> goes<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you turn down the volume it goes a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.020 
you turn down the volume it goes a
little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:43.860> muddy<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
little bit muddy but you would like to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.350 
little bit muddy but you would like to
clean<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> up<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.360> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
clean it up you can do it with this and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
clean it up you can do it with this and
we<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:49.260> hear<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> soon

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
we will hear it soon

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
we will hear it soon
and<00:00:50.960> then<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.320> new<00:00:52.500> cable<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:54.920> this

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and then we have a new cable and this

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.799 
and then we have a new cable and this
one<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:57.260> really<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.530> new<00:00:58.739> innovation<00:00:59.370> it's

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
one is really like new innovation it's

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.529 
one is really like new innovation it's
this<00:01:00.809> nano<00:01:01.289> technology<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
this nano technology in it so there's a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.390 
this nano technology in it so there's a
magnetic<00:01:03.930> field<00:01:05.930> which<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.710> creates<00:01:08.070> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
magnetic field which which creates this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
magnetic field which which creates this
spin<00:01:09.180> X<00:01:09.360> wave<00:01:10.040> which<00:01:11.040> make<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.900> electrons<00:01:12.950> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
spin X wave which make the electrons to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.469 
spin X wave which make the electrons to
line<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.369> better<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> same

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
line up better and go in the same

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.469 
line up better and go in the same
direction<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:17.640> information<00:01:17.820> goes

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
direction so more information goes

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.730 
direction so more information goes
through<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.369> actually<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:21.509> effect<00:01:21.869> spreads

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
through and actually the effect spreads

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.200 
through and actually the effect spreads
-<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.189> your<00:01:26.189> pedals<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:26.880> guitar

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
- so your pedals and your guitar

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.940 
- so your pedals and your guitar
electronics<00:01:27.930> would<00:01:28.049> work<00:01:28.229> better<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.829> this

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
electronics would work better with this

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.920 
electronics would work better with this
cable<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.659> know<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.930> sounds<00:01:31.290> unbelievable<00:01:31.439> but

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
cable I know it sounds unbelievable but

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
cable I know it sounds unbelievable but
truthfully<00:01:33.930> sometimes<00:01:34.140> unbelievable<00:01:36.110> then

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
truthfully sometimes unbelievable then

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.330 
truthfully sometimes unbelievable then
we<00:01:37.259> have<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.820> then<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> new<00:01:39.360> amp<00:01:40.340> my

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
we have a then we have a new amp my

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
we have a then we have a new amp my
professor<00:01:41.820> old<00:01:42.090> school<00:01:42.390> 51<00:01:42.899> RT<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.360> 51

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
professor old school 51 RT so it's a 51

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.770 
professor old school 51 RT so it's a 51
watts

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.190 
watts
-<00:01:46.649> II<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.549> 34<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:51.000> also<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.899> got

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
- II and 34 and it's also it's got

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.219 
- II and 34 and it's also it's got
reverb<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.950> tremolo<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> voicing

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
reverb and tremolo and we have a voicing

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.249 
reverb and tremolo and we have a voicing
switch<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:56.009> which<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:57.149> basically<00:01:57.329> something

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
switch here which is basically something

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.630 
switch here which is basically something
like<00:01:58.520> high<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> low<00:01:59.850> input<00:02:00.149> switch
