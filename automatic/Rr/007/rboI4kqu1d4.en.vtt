00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.490
 hello young how are Ricardo good 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.440
 nights when she is an architect bochazo sana 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.930
 and good then good night to all of you 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.150
 today as many will know is 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.220
 starting spring and that's why 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.320
 that today we are going to celebrate with 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.849
 some flowers in these years of 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.070
 technology what all we have 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.570
 shine some moments calls us the 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.730
 attention everything that can produce light 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.949
 we have toys that shine our 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.480
 cell phones shine we have two behind 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.619
 the street that shine so good we're going to 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.929
 teach them how to do today 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.370
 flowers that shine because we have seen 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.050
 that scientists make rabbits that 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.550
 shining fish that shine why not 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.560
 teach them how to make flowers that shine 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.510
 that's the way it is and although it might seem that for 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.100
 all this is very expensive 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.650
 laboratory equipment to do 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.060
 genetic the truth is that it's a little bit 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.520
 simpler than that because the only thing 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.650
 we will need is a marker of 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.230
 impacts a brand text is that way 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.600
 well what is the trick first of all 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.150
 let's get inside the brand 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 texts in the little sponge that has 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.360
 the ink highway stuck very well rich 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.270
 lets this be very well done let's go 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.850
 put some water in a glass and go 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.700
 to squeeze it so that some 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.610
 little drops these drops are going to 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.970
 dissolve in the water and they will allow 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.290
 our flower absorbs them here 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.960
 we can see that the eu is starting 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.820
 to turn the color of the sea here texts and 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.100
 well here we have our classic 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.180
 riccardo vase will grab one of the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.370
 flowers and he's going to put it here is where 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.530
 comes the interesting part and the trick of 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.960
 this experiment usually when 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.729
 one is going to put flowers the cut in the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.110
 air and put them in the water 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.540
 the secret is to cut them inside the glass 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.009
 cut them while they are submerged 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.060
 finally we are going to leave our 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.649
 flower some hours and voilÃ  in the morning 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.540
 next we will have a flower 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.340
 fluorescent but what do you think if 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.990
 we show that flowers normally 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.220
 do not shine is a bit strange has to 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.229
 prove it but let's say no 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.180
 we are a lies like that is if we 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.310
 can support by lowering the light a little 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.520
 please in the studio there goes here we have 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.540
 a black light lamp 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.910
 and well the flowers do not react to the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680
 black light because they are normal flowers 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 but if we put our flowers that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.040
 we have here like that in us already 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.770
 We have previously prepared some 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.930
 flowers that were a few hours 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.210
 we can observe in the approach how 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 begin to paint the edges of the 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.450
 flower this due permission to that in the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.180
 cells that are on the shore 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.880
 the pigment that is called accumulates 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.990
 fluorescein this pigment reacts 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.130
 before the black light here we can 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.230
 observe it 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.810
 but now Ricardo here has a laser 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.330
 ultraviolet when approaching flowers 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.210
 we can see how clearly these 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.460
 they get a green glow 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.590
 this is a very interesting decoration 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.540
 very father to have in your room in the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.310
 ideal night light for young people to 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.470
 give it to the groom to the bride and good 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.470
 why not to start spring
