00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
geforce gtx 660ti because right now it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610 
geforce gtx 660ti because right now it
represents<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.940> pretty<00:00:36.270> good<00:00:36.750> value<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.350> there

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
represents a pretty good value out there

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.880 
represents a pretty good value out there
and<00:00:37.800> very<00:00:38.010> high<00:00:38.250> performance<00:00:38.790> takes<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> GPU

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
and very high performance takes the GPU

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
and very high performance takes the GPU
bottleneck<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> equation<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> let's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
bottleneck out of the equation and let's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
bottleneck out of the equation and let's
see<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.649> fares<00:00:44.010> how<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.489> new<00:00:44.730> fm2

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
see how it fares how this new fm2

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.750 
see how it fares how this new fm2
platform<00:00:45.780> stacks<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.710> against<00:00:47.219> all<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
platform stacks up against all the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.020 
platform stacks up against all the
competition<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:52.730> now<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:53.940> exactly

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
competition out there now what exactly

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
competition out there now what exactly
is<00:00:54.510> an<00:00:54.660> AMD<00:00:54.960> Trinity<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.129> they're<00:00:56.399> new<00:00:56.579> eight

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
is an AMD Trinity so they're new eight

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.869 
is an AMD Trinity so they're new eight
eighths<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> eight<00:00:57.390> 10s<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.379> an

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
eighths and eight 10s these are an

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.069 
eighths and eight 10s these are an
evolutionary<00:00:59.879> change<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.809> last

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
evolutionary change on the last

generation<00:01:01.620> Lando's<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.399> fm1<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.359> we're

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
generation Lando's on fm1 so we're

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
generation Lando's on fm1 so we're
getting<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> faster<00:01:04.290> GPU<00:01:04.769> we're<00:01:05.159> getting

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
getting a faster GPU we're getting

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670 
getting a faster GPU we're getting
better<00:01:05.729> turbo<00:01:06.330> core<00:01:06.570> technology<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
better turbo core technology that is to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.289 
better turbo core technology that is to
say<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.130> we're<00:01:08.250> using<00:01:08.460> fewer<00:01:08.820> threads

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
say that when we're using fewer threads

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
say that when we're using fewer threads
we're<00:01:09.600> boosting<00:01:09.990> up<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.140> clock<00:01:10.439> speeds<00:01:10.740> more

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
we're boosting up the clock speeds more

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
we're boosting up the clock speeds more
we're<00:01:11.369> also<00:01:11.520> getting<00:01:11.729> better<00:01:12.060> instructions

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
we're also getting better instructions

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.190 
we're also getting better instructions
per<00:01:12.869> clock<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.350> piledriver<00:01:13.890> cores<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
per clock with piledriver cores and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.679 
per clock with piledriver cores and
we're<00:01:16.200> getting<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.500> new<00:01:16.590> socket<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.820> yeah<00:01:18.390> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
we're getting a new socket so yeah it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810 
we're getting a new socket so yeah it's
like<00:01:18.780> pretty<00:01:19.409> much<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> total<00:01:19.860> overhaul<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
like pretty much a total overhaul so

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.520 
like pretty much a total overhaul so
let's<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> look<00:01:21.420> at<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.869> performance

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
let's have a look at the performance

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.880 
let's have a look at the performance
from<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.280> purely<00:01:23.930> CPU<00:01:24.930> standpoint<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.860> I

you guys can see how we work behind the
scenes<00:01:33.500> bearing<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.619> mind<00:01:34.650> eight<00:01:35.100> eighths<00:01:35.400> and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
scenes bearing in mind eight eighths and

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.749 
scenes bearing in mind eight eighths and
eight<00:01:35.700> ends<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.170> expensive<00:01:37.860> as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
eight ends are not as expensive as

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.649 
eight ends are not as expensive as
things<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.420> 35<00:01:39.840> 70<00:01:40.229> K<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.590> 3770<00:01:41.549> KS<00:01:41.790> okay

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
things like 35 70 K is in 3770 KS okay

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.649 
things like 35 70 K is in 3770 KS okay
we're<00:01:43.409> looking<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:43.950> CPU<00:01:44.640> level<00:01:45.090> performance

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
we're looking at CPU level performance

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.069 
we're looking at CPU level performance
that<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.770> 10<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.850> 15<00:01:48.210> percent<00:01:48.240> slower

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that is about 10 to 15 percent slower

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.850 
that is about 10 to 15 percent slower
than<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.159> 30<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.820> 20<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.540> core<00:01:51.899> i3<00:01:52.140> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
than a 30 to 20 that is a core i3 so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.370 
than a 30 to 20 that is a core i3 so
once<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:53.939> past<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.540> integrated<00:01:55.079> GPU

this<00:03:03.450> again<00:03:03.570> check<00:03:04.440> out<00:03:04.620> our<00:03:04.830> how<00:03:05.130> many<00:03:05.340> cores

we<00:03:07.590> find<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.890> most<00:03:08.190> games<00:03:08.400> don't<00:03:08.700> take

advantage of more than two cores anyway
which<00:03:10.830> makes<00:03:11.040> something<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.490> core<00:03:11.790> i3

which makes something like a core i3
look<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.540> pretty<00:03:12.930> darn<00:03:13.200> good<00:03:13.290> value<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:13.980> a

it<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.150> then<00:03:21.840> just<00:03:22.230> gaming<00:03:22.890> performance<00:03:23.040> so

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it is then just gaming performance so

it is then just gaming performance so
let's<00:03:23.610> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.790> look<00:03:24.030> at<00:03:24.270> Cinebench<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.320> give

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
let's have a look at Cinebench to give

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.740 
let's have a look at Cinebench to give
us<00:03:25.620> some<00:03:25.860> idea<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.250> where<00:03:26.670> it<00:03:26.790> stands<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.300> from

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
us some idea of where it stands in from

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.170 
us some idea of where it stands in from
a<00:03:27.840> 3d<00:03:28.200> rendering<00:03:28.470> perspective<00:03:29.280> so<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.940> pretty

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
a 3d rendering perspective so it pretty

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180 
a 3d rendering perspective so it pretty

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
you knock about half of that time off

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.790 
you knock about half of that time off
once<00:05:02.700> you<00:05:02.880> throw<00:05:03.150> in<00:05:03.360> a<00:05:03.510> quad<00:05:03.870> core<00:05:04.200> with

basically if you're using it with the

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.230 
basically if you're using it with the
integrated<00:05:21.930> GPU<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:23.070> new<00:05:23.280> Trinity<00:05:23.580> ap<00:05:24.090> use

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
integrated GPU the new Trinity ap use

Rock<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.930> house<00:05:25.080> if<00:05:25.380> you're<00:05:25.770> not<00:05:26.010> using<00:05:26.250> it

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
Rock the house if you're not using it

Rock the house if you're not using it
with<00:05:26.550> an<00:05:26.670> integrated<00:05:27.000> GPU<00:05:27.390> it<00:05:27.630> looks<00:05:27.810> like

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
with an integrated GPU it looks like

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.270 
with an integrated GPU it looks like
they're<00:05:28.200> pretty<00:05:28.380> competitive<00:05:29.010> with<00:05:29.160> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
they're pretty competitive with the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.130 
they're pretty competitive with the
Intel<00:05:29.550> Core<00:05:29.820> i3<00:05:29.940> but<00:05:30.720> if<00:05:30.840> you're<00:05:30.960> going<00:05:31.050> to

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
Intel Core i3 but if you're going to

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.110 
Intel Core i3 but if you're going to
throw<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.530> super<00:05:31.920> dedicated<00:05:32.100> graphics<00:05:32.580> card<00:05:32.850> on

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
throw a super dedicated graphics card on

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.000 
throw a super dedicated graphics card on
there<00:05:33.300> you<00:05:33.750> might<00:05:34.020> be<00:05:34.050> better<00:05:34.290> off<00:05:34.410> with<00:05:34.560> a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
there you might be better off with a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.740 
there you might be better off with a
different<00:05:35.040> choice<00:05:35.610> all<00:05:35.880> comes<00:05:36.330> down<00:05:36.420> to<00:05:36.690> your
