 Just put it in. I 'm looking back at the evil. So just take a breath from then. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.640

 I do not want to pay a taxi . 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:37.350

 Yeah, why one radeunga beyond Jung Hee Lee long to try such that its name 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.570
 These days, a lot of what geureonikkayo check collection shows what we have under the sun 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.420
 In the mean time, at that time, the first time to bring out the TV radio , 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.740
 I thought you were broadcasting. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:21.330
 Let's do what we can then serve in the broadcast. Oh , 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.759
 I created this program so I can find this difficult person once a week 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.920
 How is that to get a kick seeing donations come from other broadcasters That 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.659
 I did it. 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:39.479
 Nyan helping him why the program is not once a day, others a ringing program in salt 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.189
 It 's been said that this is a regular program on a weekly basis, 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.310
 I have to succeed. 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:52.229
 So now it came out the first episode on April 5 Arbor Day to hear the broadcast film 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.740
 The taxi driver who was driving was doing the whole amount of punishment that day, 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.840
 I put my car together and brought my money. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:06.090
 At that time, I had to make a call to the bar specialist , 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 I started getting more and more money, but now I wonder if the story is imminent . 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:16.050
 I'll give you my throat . Well, now that I'm a ginger, I'm ginger. 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.870
 I can not help but catch the silent time 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.620
 Then people feel it on the air. 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:32.370
 Seocho- su is crying, and then the fund is finally out 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:37.020
 I say that watching a bunch that produced physiological'm no good again this / 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.130
 I've got to take the Imperials I speak in the church these minutes late, you 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.900
 It's my favorite. Oh, I thought so. 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:50.610
 45 There we increasingly develop economically and culturally in the contemporary Republic of Korea 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 It's not easy. It 's getting worse and worse. 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.590
 You know, my program, my people, 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.540
 Listen to me. 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:10.450
 For times when you told me the ceiling from where preferential gotta 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.450
 In fact, a little thing called self-healing that would please the self-ignition in themselves 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:22.310
 The water wheel is not easy for the wheelchair to move around Why is the muddy water 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:24.139
 Bogetdago sink the mud go hand quickly sinking ever changing stable 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.180
 Made by what happens 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:34.730
 It will be even more ground. When it happens , exercise will wait for a while next to the water. 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:39.859
 So then your progressive ridiculous heavy leaves will sink 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:43.519
 I figure my time as a non-naturally emerge as the clear water when the water is also fully 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:49.760
 In light it may be but do you think will be able to see inside 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:55.010
 As nutritious as it is, a lot of these thoughts will come to mind 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:59.299
 You keep those feelings for a while. 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:04.790
 If you do that, it will be your own phone. 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:06.140
 Which healing is to purify itself so I think now 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.610
 This self- 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:15.140
 Yeah, and there's a lot of people with depression, too . 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.560
 This is the weather for today and flowers for people. 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.890
 I lost even during the day, ie Sheds 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:27.350
 What do I write a lot of the old gutters yes Proton 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.919
 Yes , I do not have any advice for people who have been healed , 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.260
 No. 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:38.510
 It takes more of the theology than I do, so I stood in my position. 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:42.770
 Helping the person in the form of it could not be a healing. 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:49.400
 Suddenly losing a job is finished printing all around the property, 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:52.910
 Mothandago and attract somebody who knows about the role the brain is also not a candidate paste 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.560
 I can not give you advice like that . 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:00.710
 That day could be a bit more spiky and hurtful. 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.890
 In the form that he wants and wants 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.890
 you
