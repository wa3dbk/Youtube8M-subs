00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.840
 we are here on show 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.869
 indeed the preparation of this exhibition 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 show wants to be non- impacting it 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:38.050
 indeed it is therefore from the ground many 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.670
 Floating ceramic floors 15 supports 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.760
 as you see behind me there are 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.710
 huge cardboard trees that also are 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.019
 symbol of an ideal and then pine forest 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.460
 how to even build on the sea in 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.920
 half a pine forest without upset 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.570
 the environment without the street because the 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.430
 move will be very very national 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.170
 we want it to be national and not 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.159
 you look like a fair but you really look like one 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.830
 Bathhouse 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:03.339
 we are convinced, however, that it will be an exhibition 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.890
 especially a man to make fair and we are 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.770
 also believe that people 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.320
 inside you will have fun will be excited and 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.500
 of beautiful things will really see 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.409
 Italian style and this is an event 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.130
 unique in both size and theme 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.510
 that for emotion because we will have a sea 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.010
 we want it to be a show that is 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.220
 an event where through 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.620
 the emotion if you also help to sell 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.340
 very difficult project very complex 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.970
 because it has forced us to coordinate more 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 of 80 companies and we wanted to think 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.100
 to a possibility of fruition 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.070
 new different and innovative of the beaches 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.350
 and will make materials that were environmentally friendly a 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.200
 think of an installation that does not 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.180
 foresaw 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.580
 cement with permanent structures 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.230
 the stand is neither a practical realization 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.510
 at the end of the fair we will dismantle this 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.750
 stand by wasting less material 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.450
 possible we are green and ecological too 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.289
 in what we want to do is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.289
 just starting
