00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
using it for a minute earlier so it just

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.370 
using it for a minute earlier so it just
warms<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.670> so

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:12.690 

just<00:01:06.380> do<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.710> for<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:07.130> minute

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:28.490 

it's<00:01:13.360> it<00:01:13.509> started

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.960 

should<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.280> go

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
should we go

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.320 
should we go
all<00:01:31.540> right<00:01:31.690> hold<00:01:31.870> on<00:01:31.960> one<00:01:32.580> sec<00:01:33.580> it's<00:01:33.970> kind<00:01:34.150> of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
all right hold on one sec it's kind of

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.910 
all right hold on one sec it's kind of
hard<00:01:34.510> for<00:01:34.570> me<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.900> do<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:35.640> with

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
hard for me to do this with

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.680
