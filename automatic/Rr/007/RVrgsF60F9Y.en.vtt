00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
an elite Moors as well but it's not

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.969 
an elite Moors as well but it's not
anywhere<00:01:35.810> as<00:01:35.960> good<00:01:36.110> as<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.320> doctor<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.860> my

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
opinion so I think it's definitely

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.380

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
it which is that an absolutely huge

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.540 
it which is that an absolutely huge
factor<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.690> IMR<00:02:27.110> already<00:02:27.530> melts<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.040> one<00:02:28.220> shot

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
factor the IMR already melts in one shot

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.430 
factor the IMR already melts in one shot
most<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.210> time<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.080> hit<00:02:30.230> them<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
most of the time if you hit them in the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.550 
most of the time if you hit them in the
torso<00:02:30.770> or<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.370> head<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.240> plus<00:02:32.810> 1<00:02:33.020> damage<00:02:33.230> makes

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
torso or the head so plus 1 damage makes

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.870 
torso or the head so plus 1 damage makes
it<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.860> can<00:02:34.010> maybe<00:02:34.130> miss<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> shot<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.850> your

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
it so you can maybe miss a shot in your

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.280 
it so you can maybe miss a shot in your
burst<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:35.390> still<00:02:35.570> get<00:02:35.720> one<00:02:35.870> shot<00:02:36.020> kills

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
burst and still get one shot kills

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.260 
burst and still get one shot kills
sometimes<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.700> fourth<00:02:37.880> strike<00:02:38.120> is

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
sometimes so the fourth strike is

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.640 
sometimes so the fourth strike is
definitely<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:38.990> there<00:02:39.050> with<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.410> Thunder

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
definitely up there with the Thunder

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.170 
definitely up there with the Thunder
task<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.100> said<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.520> Thunder<00:02:40.730> test<00:02:40.940> was<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
task I said the Thunder test was the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.880 
task I said the Thunder test was the
most<00:02:41.360> underrated<00:02:41.720> weapon<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.620> advanced

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
most underrated weapon in advanced

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.290 
most underrated weapon in advanced
warfare<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.340> still<00:02:43.670> kind<00:02:43.880> of<00:02:43.940> think<00:02:44.000> that<00:02:44.240> I

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
warfare I still kind of think that I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.760 
warfare I still kind of think that I
think<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.600> boar<00:02:44.810> strike<00:02:45.080> may<00:02:45.350> be<00:02:45.410> up<00:02:45.620> there

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
think the boar strike may be up there

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.170 
think the boar strike may be up there
with<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:45.950> kind<00:02:46.340> of<00:02:46.400> challenging<00:02:46.940> for<00:02:47.090> that

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
with it kind of challenging for that

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.850 
with it kind of challenging for that
position<00:02:47.360> but<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.200> definitely<00:02:48.500> definitely

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
position but I definitely definitely

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
position but I definitely definitely
very<00:02:49.280> underrated<00:02:49.700> elite<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.090> only

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
very underrated elite and the only

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.030 
very underrated elite and the only
reason<00:02:50.570> i<00:02:50.660> don't<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.380> Thunder<00:02:51.620> tustin

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
reason i don't have the Thunder tustin

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
people haven't really known about her so

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.080 
people haven't really known about her so
to<00:03:56.660> speak<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.739> personally<00:03:58.250> haven't<00:03:58.579> seen<00:03:58.940> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
to speak and I personally haven't seen a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.120 
to speak and I personally haven't seen a
k-12<00:03:59.510> rips<00:03:59.720> a<00:03:59.870> whole<00:04:00.049> lot<00:04:00.230> so<00:04:00.530> I'm<00:04:00.739> not<00:04:00.890> too

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
k-12 rips a whole lot so I'm not too

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.640 
k-12 rips a whole lot so I'm not too
sure<00:04:01.430> but<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.150> would<00:04:02.239> bet<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.810> ak-12<00:04:03.140> rip<00:04:03.470> is

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
sure but I would bet the ak-12 rip is

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.460 
sure but I would bet the ak-12 rip is
probably<00:04:04.250> one<00:04:04.579> of<00:04:04.610> the<00:04:04.820> top<00:04:05.030> three<00:04:05.450> most<00:04:05.780> rare

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
probably one of the top three most rare

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.740 
probably one of the top three most rare
elite<00:04:07.310> weapons<00:04:07.730> in<00:04:07.850> all<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> dance<00:04:08.269> warfare<00:04:08.660> I

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
elite weapons in all the dance warfare I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.210 
elite weapons in all the dance warfare I
could<00:04:08.959> be<00:04:09.110> wrong<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:09.829> that's<00:04:09.980> at<00:04:10.190> least

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
could be wrong but that's at least

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.920 
could be wrong but that's at least
through<00:04:10.610> personal<00:04:11.090> experience<00:04:11.570> so<00:04:11.690> let<00:04:11.870> me
