00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.019
 Have you ever wondered how big a pool can be? Today 

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.370
 I bring you the largest indoor pool in the world and is part of a leisure center 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.780
 tropical located in Germany called Tropical Islands. 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.490
 This complex is located 30 kilometers from Berlin, specifically near Krausnick 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.859
 and has a capacity for 6000 people a day. 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.939
 Tropical Islands is not only known for its huge pool but also for the gigantic 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.090
 hangar that covers it, in fact this hangar is one of the largest buildings 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.410
 of the world and has 5.5 million cubic meters. It was built with warlike intentions and 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 now serves as accommodation for people who want to enjoy a tropical environment 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.469
 whatever the season of the year. 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:51.469
 The temperature inside is about 26 ºC and has a humidity of 64% and a daily ticket 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.850
 It costs € 36 for adults and € 25 for children. Surely you will be thinking 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.899
 which is a price perhaps a little high although seeing the attractions offered one is given 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.830
 mind that it is actually quite balanced. 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.570
 Tropical Islands has a tropical forest of more than 1 kilometer long in which 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.010
 you can see several animals in the wild, also among its facilities we have beaches 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.640
 tropical, golf, sauna, spa, restaurants and even we have a balloon with the we can 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.910
 overfly the entire complex. 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.210
 Everything looks very nice, right? The truth is that everything that glitters is not gold and many 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.410
 of its visitors complain surprisingly that space is very limited for 6000 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.310
 people and that can become a bit overwhelming. 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.940
 In case you are interested, spending a night in Tropical Islands has a price that fluctuates 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.700
 between 50 and 200 euros and that varies according to the comforts that we want. 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.150
 If we take into account that the facilities are located in Germany and that therefore 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.640
 if we live there in Winter we could spend a few days of summer next to home ... 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.520
 true is that the idea is quite attractive to me although it might be better to save 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.470
 and go on a trip to Hawaii, for example, what do you think? 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.380
 I hope you liked it and see you, in the next video!
