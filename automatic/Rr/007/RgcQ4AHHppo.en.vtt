00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:19.440
 Look, it's going to be the raid pilot. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.900
 cool 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.460
 there when there is always the stick here who 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 It's going to be the double. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.350
 own water 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.610
 I can haleron the depths the poems 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:39.739
 that since this game here is the plane you 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.739
 It has a deep Haleron it messes 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:54.230
 now how do you do it to us? 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:57.899
 moving is very simple and that 's where 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.910
 you will stand on one side and take one 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 bit we kinda gross that 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:12.329
 will make the following door at the foot of the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:16.079
 rod the 90 degree angle will thread 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:18.509
 in the way that it may be that he chooses 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:23.549
 People, but it's because they are in the branch. 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:26.850
 to make the video there right? 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.130
 the angle here then you will take more 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.259
 inside 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.090
 It's going to break people here, but it's only for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:46.499
 you know you make a groove here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:47.579
 certain rage lasts except brás ferro 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.630
 here o 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.630
 up here 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.770
 the tail 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:12.120
 you pass the glue there in anger you did 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:17.630
 double that part you 're doubling 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.630
 is the part that will move the attack 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.470
 goiano is that cute little Columbus what does 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.670
 you move across it messes who 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:39.660
 will see the little plane will see the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:43.590
 What you gotta do is get him, kate. 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.950
 on one side to make an angle of 90 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.950
 degrees 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.489
 here he will stay in that way 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:03.720
 that this people here is a 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:08.040
 pianinho that he uses to 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.980
 hole it is the right diameter 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 two millimeters or even up to a 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:23.700
 another is when you put this in 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.540
 from here on your servant when he 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.390
 here o 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.160
 He is going to enter and just 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.519
 only you do not need to tighten the screw 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.750
 here we will squeeze that it will be this 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.580
 way that looks just goes through what he 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.480
 will make a move to slip through 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.980
 above his streak iron plate 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.209
 discreet 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:55.860
 It does not matter too much, does not it? 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.390
 to get out of here is an airplane that 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.680
 I'm doing it, I'll probably go. 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.570
 put this system then what 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.450
 happens 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.459
 he is in the end b or who 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.680
 hopes that whoever is watching your plane 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.019
 so he does not see any 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.299
 for example the advantage that falls to him 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.199
 on the floor I hit nothing or I have nothing 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:21.959
 for him to hit here nor here I only do 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:26.330
 Here certinho running Joãozinho 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:31.259
 float people leave the camera a focus 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:40.199
 who took away what he gives is that he 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:43.050
 is getting put by adapting a 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.120
 system here proved how to do 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.650
 another wing because I'm going to put that 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.849
 system because I showed you left missing 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.900
 to put the battery back here 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:02.849
 put the cs where that little thing is going to fly 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:09.360
 galera to the head minute 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:11.280
 then's there where people who took 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.000
 this is just a suggestion from the manager 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:20.220
 anyone who wants to make sure that here goes 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.289
 stay legal in force 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.820
 thank you all you comment on 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:30.030
 audio as it got on the picture is good 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.070
 I'm learning how to play it now. 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.000
 which may be that of the debtor not as 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.539
 of a meter and a half leprosy leaves 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.789
 everyone was like 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.900
 I also thank the staff there who went on

 link here below the video do 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.970
 donation there people made more donation 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.400
 donation of 5 reais, there were people who 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.199
 donations of more value 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.259
 had people who made donations after 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:01.669
 canceled the galley too 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:03.919
 but there the float plane tip 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.960
 different link 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.780
 Then you see if I like the bug, it's okay. 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.750
 thank you all there and we'll see at the end 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:16.310
