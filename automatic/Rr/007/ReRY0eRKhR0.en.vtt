00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
and I really don't branch out a whole

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.310 
and I really don't branch out a whole
lot<00:00:08.610> where<00:00:09.059> eyeliners<00:00:09.660> are<00:00:09.840> concerned

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
lot where eyeliners are concerned

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.919 
lot where eyeliners are concerned
because<00:00:10.559> I<00:00:10.980> am<00:00:11.400> very<00:00:11.790> stuck<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.450> Revlon

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
because I am very stuck on Revlon

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.499 
because I am very stuck on Revlon
Colorstay<00:00:13.790> products<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.880> really<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Colorstay products I really like the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.170 
Colorstay products I really like the
liquid<00:00:15.809> liners<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.440> also<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.490> pencil<00:00:17.850> liners

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
liquid liners and also the pencil liners

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.970 
liquid liners and also the pencil liners
I<00:00:18.330> think<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.660> good<00:00:18.840> too<00:00:19.080> but<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> sort<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.770> just

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I think are good too but I sort of just

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.890 
I think are good too but I sort of just
wanted<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> see<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.820> know<00:00:20.850> okay<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.539> else<00:00:21.689> is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
wanted to see you know okay what else is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
wanted to see you know okay what else is
out<00:00:22.050> there<00:00:22.380> what<00:00:23.369> sounds<00:00:23.730> interesting<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.330> try

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
out there what sounds interesting to try

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
out there what sounds interesting to try
and<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> went<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.949> CVS<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.849> other<00:00:27.000> day<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and so I went to CVS the other day and I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.759 
and so I went to CVS the other day and I
got<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.930> Milani<00:00:29.000> liquify<00:00:30.769> metallic

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
got this Milani liquify metallic

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.430 
got this Milani liquify metallic
eyeliner<00:00:32.309> pencil<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.809> particular<00:00:34.410> one

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
eyeliner pencil and this particular one

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
eyeliner pencil and this particular one
doesn't<00:00:34.980> really<00:00:35.100> look<00:00:35.340> metallic<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.000> think

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
doesn't really look metallic I think

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110 
doesn't really look metallic I think
maybe<00:00:36.450> some<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.020> colored<00:00:37.910> options<00:00:38.910> were

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
maybe some of the colored options were

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.920 
maybe some of the colored options were
but<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.670> um<00:00:41.809> just<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
but this one is really just um just a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
but this one is really just um just a
black<00:00:43.200> pencil<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.520> there

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
black pencil as you can see there

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.290 
black pencil as you can see there
so<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.670> wasn't<00:00:47.820> quite<00:00:48.030> sure

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so on this I really wasn't quite sure

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.970 
so on this I really wasn't quite sure
what<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> expect<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.260> thought<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
what to expect I thought it had the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.360 
what to expect I thought it had the
appearance<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.700> those<00:00:50.940> Urban<00:00:51.390> Decay

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
appearance of those Urban Decay

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.500 
appearance of those Urban Decay
eyeliners<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> thought<00:00:54.030> wonder<00:00:54.420> if

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
eyeliners and so I thought wonder if

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
eyeliners and so I thought wonder if
it's<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.620> might<00:00:55.829> compare<00:00:56.190> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it's if you know it might compare to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
it's if you know it might compare to
that<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.760> own<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.329> those<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.780> do

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that I don't own one of those but I do

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
that I don't own one of those but I do
know<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.500> people<00:00:58.829> say<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> goes<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> very

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
know that people say it goes on very

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
know that people say it goes on very
creamy<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:01.079> lasts<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.620> day

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
creamy and then it really lasts all day

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.920 
creamy and then it really lasts all day
and<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.239> story<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:03.750> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and that's really the story with this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.740 
and that's really the story with this
too<00:01:04.379> um<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.860> claims<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.610> all-day<00:01:06.030> wear<00:01:06.299> smooth

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

that I will do but this usually I would

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.069 
that I will do but this usually I would
use<00:04:03.060> only<00:04:03.329> think<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.019> use<00:04:04.199> a<00:04:04.229> liquid<00:04:04.560> liner<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079

wing out my eyeliner but this honestly

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.050 
wing out my eyeliner but this honestly
can<00:04:10.199> handle<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:10.769> if<00:04:10.859> I<00:04:10.979> wanted<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.489> extend<00:04:11.759> my

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
can handle it if I wanted to extend my

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.629 
can handle it if I wanted to extend my
liner<00:04:12.449> up<00:04:12.689> just<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:13.049> little<00:04:13.079> bit<00:04:13.319> this<00:04:14.099> can<00:04:14.459> do

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
liner up just a little bit this can do

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.779 
liner up just a little bit this can do
that<00:04:14.879> and<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.629> I<00:04:15.659> just<00:04:15.780> find<00:04:16.289> that<00:04:16.409> very<00:04:16.889> I

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
that and so I just find that very I

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.080 
that and so I just find that very I
guess<00:04:18.320> surprising<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:20.400> something<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:20.970> go

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
guess surprising that something can go

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.740 
guess surprising that something can go
on<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.570> creamy<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.289> yet<00:04:23.039> dry<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
on so creamy and yet dry and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.200 
on so creamy and yet dry and
so<00:04:24.230> long<00:04:24.530> so<00:04:25.070> if<00:04:25.370> that's<00:04:25.820> what<00:04:26.030> you're<00:04:26.180> looking

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
so long so if that's what you're looking

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.720 
so long so if that's what you're looking
