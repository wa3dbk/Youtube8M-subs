or<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.779> least<00:00:21.960> these<00:00:22.590> five<00:00:22.920> dreads<00:00:23.300> because

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
or at least these five dreads because

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
or at least these five dreads because
these<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.840> ones<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.230> still<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.859> the
