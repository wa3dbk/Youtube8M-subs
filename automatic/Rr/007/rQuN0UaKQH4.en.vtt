00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.710 
it last year and couldn't get into it I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.390 
she's super embarrassed she goes into
her<00:05:28.930> class<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:29.440> he's<00:05:29.530> her<00:05:29.680> new<00:05:29.830> professor<00:05:30.190> for

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
one of her classes so it sounds like

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.120 
one of her classes so it sounds like
it's<00:05:32.020> going<00:05:32.140> to<00:05:32.170> be<00:05:32.260> an<00:05:32.350> awkward<00:05:32.470> interaction
