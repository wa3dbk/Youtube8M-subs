00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.830
 friends and friends of madonie laughs we are 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.050
 with nicola fiasconaro one of the witnesses 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.680
 to the Sicilian patisserie 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.199
 Sicilian in the world we are in yours 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.690
 craft workshop with yours 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.270
 started panettone production are you 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.760
 creating system is creating a system 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.489
 Sicilian pastry and there is one 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.410
 of need also because here when it is 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.589
 speaks in Sicily of food 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.500
 there is a millennial heritage 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.839
 the fact that the decision has always been 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.880
 occupied for better or for worse by many 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.530
 peoples have left a trace 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.620
 indelible in this case 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.450
 the food of the Norman Arabs and 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.510
 other peoples still have this heritage 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.360
 that then our land in the sector 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.100
 agricultural man is able to bear fruit 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 wonderful this tradition 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.580
 millennial confectionery that the world is 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.110
 envy 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:32.490
 today a moment is needed to make sure 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.950
 to pay attention to the world 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.710
 grows evolves and maintains this 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.520
 primacy is something I care about 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.160
 really the fiascon family joins 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.140
 Italy in the sense that you use 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.990
 confectionery products that do not have their own 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.490
 a great Sicilian matrix feeding them 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.620
 and instead building them with the big one 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.690
 Sicilian actually not helmeted 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.230
 black does not mean cannolo il 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.400
 prince or cassata that the reggina 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.920
 even if these obviously 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.430
 traditional dorsal productions 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.649
 Sicilian we actually make them 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.170
 sour dough and sourdough the sweets of 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.409
 Easter recurrences or in this case 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.780
 Christmas a Milanese tradition is the 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.450
 the Milanese main cake 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.209
 just the Piedmontese or Venetian culture 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.550
 of sour pastes that do not belong to us 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.550
 but what do we put right inside 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.409
 a panettone we put our citrus fruit the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.209
 our sultana our sweet wines il 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.290
 biting off free and a Muscat of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.870
 syracuse 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.159
 or the mythical marsala then with ours 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.560
 orange our grapes our 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.769
 pistachio our almonds culture 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.109
 in ours but scents of the Mediterranean 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.140
 that really belong to us here they are 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.900
 I refer to these flavors of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.010
 Mediterranean today, your 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.870
 production in what differs but 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.170
 in being perhaps the term between 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.170
 manic quotes on what on 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.120
 I am receiving the raw materials where it is 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.290
 possible made in sicily because it is 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.329
 winning 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.489
 today the world envies this heritage 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.489
 that they have but are likely to fall apart 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.900
 because with many globalization 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.480
 countries have evolved in exporting the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.250
 their agricultural heritage in other states 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.260
 and therefore sicilia at this time a 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.290
 this suffering that more than export 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.689
 we receive food products from 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.930
 the whole world and this heritage yes 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:38.769
 can really disperse to resume that 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:43.359
 which is an ancient discourse at the first point 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.150
 in this land food tourism 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.159
 would be a winning combination since 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.879
 the suffering is truly incredible 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.260
 the almond once in the 60s 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.209
 productions only from the province of 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.919
 eighty percent were agrigento 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.260
 of world production 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:02.769
 today we are the bottom end so in 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.829
 lots of other wonderful delicacies 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.000
 farms that this land can give us 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.590
 if you add value to the productions 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.659
 like the agile pastas with ours 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.639
 agricultural products and this one 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.190
 the winning combination is the demonstration that 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:20.979
 piasco naro not only in Sicily not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.260
 only in Italy but also in the north-east 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.479
 in the private room where the panettone know 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.849
 really what it is and all over the world 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.550
 we are able to export these products 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.949
 of tradition then the cubaita e 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.990
 marzipan nougat with ours 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:41.380
 panettone but with the logic of the gods 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.490
 scents and historical value that 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.259
 our land 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.360
 to demonstrate in feeding into 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.690
 generally we conclude with a question 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.789
 curious how much there is a panettone ad 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.069
 arrive in our tables from 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.750
 tax proofing and that's it 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.470
 a bit the key to everything 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:03.190
 recently we had the great pleasure with 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:06.039
 you talk about bacteria strains 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.610
 of ceresio or san francisco this 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.460
 she can't understand this for a while at home 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.830
 the sour pasta ucri feel that 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.840
 anciently it was used of families in 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.430
 family gave themselves to make bread 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.770
 homemade 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.630
 mother yeast to make panettone a 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.430
 of similarities 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.139
 obviously the concept is a little different and 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.020
 much more complicated also because 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.940
 compared to a bread that is very thin here 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.130
 let us put the riches of godly wealth 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.800
 sugar candies in general 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.509
 but that is precisely the strength that from 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.770
 first passage of yeast a 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.949
 knead a panettone we are at the second 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.050
 day after cooking and finally i 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.469
 I close them also become elegant faults 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.320
 Gaginis we are three days and costs 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:57.419
 This is understood by important companies 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.580
 all this is a key digestibility 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.139
 my shelf life softness over time 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.120
 without addition of products of 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.830
 conservation without synthesis without the 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.979
 chemistry in nature with mother yeast 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:11.210
 we can make this product that the 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.030
 world appreciates with great great echo 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:17.449
 this was and then came to me 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.830
 the mouth watering for what I have 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:24.949
 heard from gourmet we can 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.199
 wish our followers to those who 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.840
 are our friends and friends of 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.830
 madonia and live a good tasting a 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.830
 see you soon
