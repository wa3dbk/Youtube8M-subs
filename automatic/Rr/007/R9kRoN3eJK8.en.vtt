00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.110
 hello everyone today 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.469
 cottage cheese home 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.660
 I have a nut and a half liters of milk 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.029
 sour 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:21.200
 since my milk was skimmed 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.750
 I will add 250 300 grams of sour cream 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.450
 if you use fatty homemade 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.200
 milk can be sour cream quietly not 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.509
 add also if you take the store 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.989
 kefir then be sure to add or 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.059
 cream or milk is not mini honeycomb cake 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.270
 otherwise, the cheese will be skimmed too 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:47.180
 although who then achieve the result we 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:51.730
 we combine sour cream with kefir 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:55.010
 it must be combined and put in the oven 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.070
 can be done in a water bath on 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.090
 low temperature 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.040
 allow to settle 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.040
 the only thing that can not be here 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.130
 give very high heat 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.120
 temperature for cottage cheese and even if you 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.510
 make cheese and homemade she 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.150
 destructive 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.280
 will you rubber curd be 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.360
 tasteless meaning it is on low 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.729
 temperature is 80 to 90 degrees if you 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.420

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.400
 you it warms it all connect in 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.409
 aluminum saucepan and i do in 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.340
 oven and so I have an hour boil a shaft at 90 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.229
 degrees and then somewhere around 40 probably 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.400
 300 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.780
 next we give the curd mass completely 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.659
 cool and only then we will 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.939
 strain through a sieve through cheesecloth 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.820
 because you have a lot now 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.150
 will go into the serum if you merge everything into 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.330

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.659

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.280

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.220

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.880
 well watered strictly prohibited 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.250

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.500

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.230
 her pancakes are very tasty 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.580

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.650
 I put this device here 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.959

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.330

 This means that it does not overheat buy 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.530
 Of course the store is so real too 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.920
 because the industrial conditions of it 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.190
 can 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.130
 any curd grind into a paste but when 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.200
