00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello everyone is happened and we are here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.850
 in a new tutorial in which you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.280
 will teach to get free appearance in 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 league of legends and well this is a 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 program that what it does is that then 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.100
 You can have all the aspects but 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 only you can see it and this program 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 was created just so you could 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.160
 use the skin see them and if you 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.920
 you liked you can buy them 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 that there are also people who instead of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.220
 buy the skin 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.830
 all the games a skin of 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.070
 these are also being updated and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.739
 well as you can see, you can choose the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 skin you want even those that are already 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.989
 have finished those that are no longer already 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.870
 It was like a promotion and they left 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.700
 they are all for example this is no longer 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.040
 and well you can choose the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.130
 sometimes whoever you want from 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.800
 the champions you have and one the 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.570
 it's really fine, that's that 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.880
 to change the corners and you want to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.739
 some particular skin to play in 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.590
 the next game 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.619
 this is where you are going to save 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.979
 in the game route this is the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.689
 stopwatch but it is for the jungle the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.299
 truth is that this a league of legends 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:22.450
 good to riot did not like much 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.119
 so you can put it but if you get it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.240
 not something you way the links who is 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.090
 one hundred percent as I have verified that 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.920
 they are going to drive us safely here to 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.929
 quick messages for example we had 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.090
 to press the letter to you more for 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.829
 example one if we give subjects one can 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.289
 leave to leave be careful with the gun 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.700
 or for example three issues if not and you do not go 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.130
 to go directly without writing what 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.950
 we need to regroup that is very 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.780
 well the truth to save you time 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.689
 and good is also the cursor type 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.729
 you can choose between these those that there are 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.640
 but well I use the normal one I do not 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.159
 like to use it after the appearance of 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.810
 sentinel I do not know if you want to use it 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.909
 Well you use it but I do not recommend it 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.880
 since they can catch you and you can 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.250
 to drive here to do is to write shot 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.230
 and then not also this that is for 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.260
 to be able to record your videos the truth is that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.019
 record very well and if you do not have 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.190
 video capture that easily what 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.540
 you can get but if you do not have 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.000
 you can record league of legends and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.690
 directly without capture 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.580
 Y 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.280
 and good but I'm going to record with my 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.500
 like my program so if you want 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.080
 use it because you can record here and 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 good here to fly and well I will give 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.300
 an example so you can see that really 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.400
 serves for example I'm going to put here a 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.700
 champion 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.340
 well here nasus is for example I'm going to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.080
 put this 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.790
 wait I'm going to reset it because you have to 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.500
 choose here for example the one you want and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:02.080
 we apply changes after this 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.530
 we put small 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.730
 for example, this is not going to come out 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.540
 example of na 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.849
 Well, it's not going to come out here, it's going to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.440
 leave the recommended objects of 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.819
 champion for example if we play it in 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.799
 July will not leave the objects of 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.349
 jungle and if we play in everything because 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.310
 example when you are going to look in the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.870
 objects, it's going to leave you something 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.099
 recommended objects but this is why 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.379
 truth is that it is very good at the time 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.330
 that you take a new champion and you do not know 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.620
 what what objects to use and now 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.730
 also here are the skin because 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.300
 we will be here 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.980
 and we apply it, and here we set 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.980
 and for 10 seconds we will wait 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.160
 well we are already as you see here is the 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.810
 champion and as you have seen I do not have the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.340
 corner 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.140
 of this program 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.270
 it was very good 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.630
 and well also the skills either 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.970
 they change for example 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.080
 for example, it does not change any 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.080
 aspect of skills 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.019
 and good nothing else here I leave the link in 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.459
 the description and good you can leave 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.920
 your like and if you are not subscribed 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.930

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.560
 lucero video a greeting and even the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.980
 next 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.980
 goodbye
