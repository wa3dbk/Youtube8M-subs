that and this is a perfect example of
that<00:05:31.570> it's<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.230> variable<00:05:32.590> rate<00:05:32.860> so<00:05:33.130> when<00:05:33.280> you're

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
that it's a variable rate so when you're

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.920 
that it's a variable rate so when you're
in<00:05:33.520> race<00:05:33.760> mode<00:05:33.790> with<00:05:34.300> these<00:05:34.480> different

driving<00:05:35.140> modes<00:05:35.610> it's<00:05:36.610> nice<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:37.060> tight<00:05:37.210> it

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480
