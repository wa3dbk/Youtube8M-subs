42 points our opening night against and

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.540 
42 points our opening night against and
it's<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.750> bad<00:03:39.930> matchup<00:03:40.230> for<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.950> Miami

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
it's just a bad matchup for the Miami

it's just a bad matchup for the Miami
Heat<00:03:41.580> players<00:03:42.060> obviously<00:03:42.360> Ben<00:03:43.260> Wallace<00:03:43.530> down

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
Heat players obviously Ben Wallace down

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.800 
Heat players obviously Ben Wallace down

low can't check won't Shaq one-on-one

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.750 
low can't check won't Shaq one-on-one
but<00:03:46.020> he<00:03:46.140> could<00:03:46.290> put<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.620> some<00:03:46.650> defense<00:03:47.280> and

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
but he could put up some defense and

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.030 
but he could put up some defense and
make<00:03:47.970> Shaq<00:03:48.240> work<00:03:48.570> perimeter<00:03:49.560> play<00:03:49.740> for<00:03:49.950> the

make Shaq work perimeter play for the
Chicago<00:03:50.070> Bulls<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:50.940> outstanding<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.870> wild

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
Chicago Bulls was outstanding the wild

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.070 
Chicago Bulls was outstanding the wild
eggs<00:03:52.350> really<00:03:52.620> come

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
eggs really come

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.530 
eggs really come
to<00:03:53.260> his<00:03:53.380> own<00:03:53.590> being<00:03:54.250> Gordon<00:03:54.700> makes<00:03:54.970> big<00:03:55.240> shots

to his own being Gordon makes big shots

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.030 
to his own being Gordon makes big shots
with<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.870> best<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.290> them<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> league

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
with the best of them in the league

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680 
with the best of them in the league
obviously<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.640> Wayne<00:03:57.790> Way<00:03:58.030> was<00:03:58.210> coming<00:03:58.540> back

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
obviously the Wayne Way was coming back

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.480 
obviously the Wayne Way was coming back
from<00:03:58.840> injury<00:03:59.230> probably<00:03:59.980> wasn't<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.340> hundred

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
from injury probably wasn't a hundred

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.520 
from injury probably wasn't a hundred
percent<00:04:00.700> but<00:04:01.660> it<00:04:01.780> wasn't<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.110> great<00:04:02.230> matchup

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
percent but it wasn't a great matchup

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.290 
percent but it wasn't a great matchup
obviously<00:04:03.160> for<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.370> Miami<00:04:03.760> Heat<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.150> got
