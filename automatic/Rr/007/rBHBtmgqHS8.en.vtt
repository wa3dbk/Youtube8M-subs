00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
now the center itself this thing is on

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.750 
now the center itself this thing is on
the<00:00:19.020> computer<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.500> I'll<00:00:19.619> show<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> the

what's in the box and yeah you can see
there<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.279> stuck<00:00:26.279> software<00:00:26.880> disk<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
there is a stuck software disk that I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.130 
there is a stuck software disk that I
have<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.750> computer<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.230> now<00:00:28.260> or<00:00:28.640> a

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
have in the computer right now or a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.720 
have in the computer right now or a
Chinese<00:00:31.140> instructions<00:00:32.329> and<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:35.550> is

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
Chinese instructions and that is

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.290 
Chinese instructions and that is
actually<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:37.309> this<00:00:38.309> pen<00:00:38.700> right<00:00:39.000> here

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
actually it and this pen right here

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.130 
actually it and this pen right here
little<00:00:39.960> edge<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.920> cap<00:00:41.840> right<00:00:42.840> there

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
little edge a little cap right there

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.400 
little edge a little cap right there
um<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.510> see<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> box<00:00:46.079> or

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
um this way you can see in the box or

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.540 
um this way you can see in the box or
the<00:00:46.530> picture<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.079> that<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the picture of it and that and of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.540 
the picture of it and that and of
somebody<00:00:50.910> drawing<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> computer<00:00:51.629> okay

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
somebody drawing on the computer okay

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.290 
somebody drawing on the computer okay
let's<00:00:53.550> trick<00:00:53.789> okay<00:00:54.510> over<00:00:55.410> here

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
let's trick okay over here

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
let's trick okay over here
Peter<00:00:58.039> come<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.460> okay<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.820> see

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
Peter come on in okay so you can see

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.340 
Peter come on in okay so you can see
right<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> sensor<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.680> is

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
right here that is the sensor it is

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.780 
right here that is the sensor it is
really<00:01:07.350> small<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.740> taped<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
really small and taped it on there is a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300 
really small and taped it on there is a
magnetic<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.860> not<00:01:10.860> using<00:01:11.130> as<00:01:11.220> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
magnetic thing that I not using as a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.230 
magnetic thing that I not using as a
permanent<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:11.909> um<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> let's<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.950> there<00:01:14.880> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
permanent use um but let's see there we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.649 
permanent use um but let's see there we
go<00:01:15.439> okay<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.490> can<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.360> way<00:01:18.479> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
go okay so you can see the way this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.130 
go okay so you can see the way this
works<00:01:18.930> actually<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> take<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.009> tech<00:01:20.280> kappa

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
works actually do I take this tech kappa

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.550 
works actually do I take this tech kappa
if<00:01:22.140> i<00:01:22.380> press<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.950> i'm<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> hear<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.560> but

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
if i press this i'm going to hear it but

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.620 
if i press this i'm going to hear it but
it<00:01:25.680> actually<00:01:25.830> may<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.000> can't<00:01:27.450> really

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
it actually may be here i can't really

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.609 
it actually may be here i can't really
tell

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
tell

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.920 
tell
it'll<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.549> makes<00:01:29.909> its<00:01:30.119> vibration<00:01:30.750> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
it'll make it makes its vibration and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.460 
it'll make it makes its vibration and
noise<00:01:31.040> now<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.850> right<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.439> listen<00:01:34.439> for

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
noise now this right here listen for

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080 
noise now this right here listen for
that<00:01:34.680> noise<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.250> tell<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.060> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that noise and it can tell where it is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
that noise and it can tell where it is
exactly<00:01:36.920> it's<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> complicated<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.790> i'm

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
exactly it's kind of complicated but i'm

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.490 
exactly it's kind of complicated but i'm
sure<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.689> online<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> figure<00:01:40.259> out

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
sure you can go online and figure out

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.819 
sure you can go online and figure out
how<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:40.979> work<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.049> i'm<00:01:43.619> going

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
how these work so you can see i'm going

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
how these work so you can see i'm going
to<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.640> comes<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> optical<00:01:45.630> mint

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to go to it comes with this optical mint

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.830 
to go to it comes with this optical mint
it<00:01:46.680> adds<00:01:47.070> calibration<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it adds calibration and kind of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.929 
it adds calibration and kind of
note-taking<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:50.280> i'm<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> calibrate

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
note-taking but i'm going to calibrate

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.060 
note-taking but i'm going to calibrate
the<00:01:51.119> display<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> i<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:55.079> have<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.680> press

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
is so that it knows where exactly I am

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.370 
is so that it knows where exactly I am
um<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.869> pen<00:02:10.050> itself
