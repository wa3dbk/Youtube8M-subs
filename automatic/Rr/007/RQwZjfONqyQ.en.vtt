this<00:02:02.820> way<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:05.000> if<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:07.460> across<00:02:08.460> here<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:09.240> see

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
this way and if we go across here we see

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.400 
this way and if we go across here we see
that<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.800> grass<00:02:11.420> eaten<00:02:12.420> by<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.630> rabbit<00:02:13.170> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that the grass eaten by the rabbit and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.670 
that the grass eaten by the rabbit and
then<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.250> rabbit<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:14.820> eaten<00:02:15.330> by<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.110> hawk

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
then the rabbit is eaten by the hawk

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.760 
then the rabbit is eaten by the hawk
this<00:02:17.610> would<00:02:17.820> mean<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.600> hawk<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.020> also<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
this would mean that the hawk is also a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.980 
this would mean that the hawk is also a
secondary<00:02:20.760> consumer<00:02:22.340> however<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.959> also

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
secondary consumer however we can also

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.020 
secondary consumer however we can also
see<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.480> hawk<00:02:27.750> if<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.010> Frog<00:02:29.400> feeds<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
see that the hawk if the Frog feeds on

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
see that the hawk if the Frog feeds on
the<00:02:30.090> small<00:02:30.990> birds<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.550> grass

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
the small birds then we have grass

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.050 
the small birds then we have grass

looking for evidence of multiple
predators<00:02:48.330> we<00:02:49.320> can<00:02:49.500> see<00:02:49.710> that<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> slug<00:02:50.550> is
