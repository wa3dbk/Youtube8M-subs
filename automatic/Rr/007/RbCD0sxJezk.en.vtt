vacuum cleaner and quite often with use
you<00:00:14.160> periodically<00:00:14.910> need<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.360> change<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.960> belt

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199

of<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.680> vacuum<00:00:16.949> cleaner<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.270> think<00:00:18.539> this

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
of your vacuum cleaner and I think this

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.480 
of your vacuum cleaner and I think this
is<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> good<00:00:19.050> vacuum<00:00:19.289> cleaner<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.920> demonstrate

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
is a good vacuum cleaner to demonstrate

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.269 
is a good vacuum cleaner to demonstrate
how<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:22.199> pretty<00:00:22.560> simple<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.220> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
how to do this it's pretty simple but a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.730 
how to do this it's pretty simple but a
lot<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.490> people<00:00:23.820> have<00:00:24.170> concerns<00:00:25.170> about<00:00:25.350> doing

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
lot of people have concerns about doing

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.990 
lot of people have concerns about doing
it<00:00:25.830> right<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.849> video<00:00:27.300> will<00:00:27.539> show<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.810> how

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
it right so this video will show you how

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.690 
it right so this video will show you how
so<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> just<00:00:30.300> lift<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> vacuum<00:00:31.500> upside<00:00:32.070> down<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
so I just lift the vacuum upside down so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.600 
so I just lift the vacuum upside down so
you'd<00:00:32.880> reveal<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.630> bottom<00:00:33.920> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> vacuum

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
you'd reveal the bottom of the vacuum

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.450 
you'd reveal the bottom of the vacuum
here<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.780> here's<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> brush<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.129> kind<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
here and here's the brush that kind of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.220 
here and here's the brush that kind of
spins<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:40.350> belt<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.780> brush

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
spins and the belt for this this brush

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.440 
spins and the belt for this this brush
control<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.829> either<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.850> side<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
control is either on one side or the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.440 
control is either on one side or the
other<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.500> first<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.100> get<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.670> top

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
other but first you have to get this top

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.709 
other but first you have to get this top
or<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.230> bottom<00:00:49.710> off<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.510> normally<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
or this bottom off and normally it's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.110 
or this bottom off and normally it's
very<00:00:52.110> simple<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.309> few<00:00:53.340> screws<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
very simple to do just a few screws and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.790 
very simple to do just a few screws and
in<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.390> case<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.020> five<00:00:55.410> screws

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
in this case it's just five screws

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.950 
in this case it's just five screws
you'll<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.399> hole<00:00:56.730> there<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.239> if

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you'll see a little hole there and if

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
you'll see a little hole there and if
you<00:00:58.109> look<00:00:58.320> inside<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> screw<00:00:59.579> head

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you look inside you can see a screw head

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
you look inside you can see a screw head
typically<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> Phillips<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.739> case<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
typically a Phillips so in this case is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.870 
typically a Phillips so in this case is
one<00:01:02.399> two<00:01:02.910> three<00:01:03.680> four<00:01:04.680> five<00:01:05.159> there's<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> couple

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
one two three four five there's a couple

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.300 
one two three four five there's a couple
of<00:01:06.000> small<00:01:06.119> holes<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.770> kind<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> do

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of small holes but just just kind of do

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.710 
of small holes but just just kind of do
the<00:01:08.460> most<00:01:08.670> obvious<00:01:09.270> holes

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the most obvious holes

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:19.760 
the most obvious holes
and<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:12.320> unscrew<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:18.140> and<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.650> don't

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and just unscrew a can and you don't

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350 
and just unscrew a can and you don't
have<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.070> try<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> get<00:01:20.580> them<00:01:20.700> out<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.150> try<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
have to try to get them out just try to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.460 
have to try to get them out just try to
get<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.630> loose<00:01:22.850> because<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> loosen

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
get them loose because when you loosen

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.300 
get them loose because when you loosen
up<00:01:25.770> each<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.640> them<00:01:27.439> the<00:01:28.439> whole<00:01:28.740> back<00:01:29.040> will

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
up each one of them the whole back will

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
up each one of them the whole back will
come<00:01:29.340> out<00:01:29.790> at<00:01:30.420> once<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.049> when<00:01:34.229> they're

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
come out at once and then when they're

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.830 
come out at once and then when they're
all<00:01:34.409> loose<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.040> whole<00:01:35.250> thing<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.060> come<00:01:36.329> out<00:01:36.509> if

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
all loose the whole thing to come out if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.690 
all loose the whole thing to come out if
it<00:01:37.110> doesn't<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.680> may<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> loosen<00:01:38.460> some

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it doesn't you may have to loosen some

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.789 
it doesn't you may have to loosen some
more<00:01:38.939> or<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.180> find<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> through<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
more or just find it through that you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.520 
more or just find it through that you
missed<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.930> look<00:01:43.140> at<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> back

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
missed and then if you look at the back

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
missed and then if you look at the back
here<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.159> them<00:01:44.490> screw<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> if<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
here you can see them screw and if you

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.200 
here you can see them screw and if you
just<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.710> upside<00:01:47.100> down<00:01:47.310> all

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
just kind of take them upside down all

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.139 
just kind of take them upside down all
five<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
five will come out and this is what the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.700 
five will come out and this is what the
inside<00:01:51.540> looks<00:01:51.570> like<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:54.380> couple<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> things

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
inside looks like a couple of things

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
inside looks like a couple of things
could<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.100> wrong<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.369> your<00:01:56.700> belt<00:01:56.969> first<00:01:57.240> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
could be wrong with your belt first it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.410 
could be wrong with your belt first it
could<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:58.280> simply<00:01:59.280> maybe<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.299> just

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
could it just simply maybe it's just

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.660 
could it just simply maybe it's just
loosened<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:01.020> time<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.680> kind<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.009> flexed

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
loosened with time it's kind of flexed

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.819 
loosened with time it's kind of flexed
it's<00:02:03.390> sort<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.899> burn<00:02:04.229> marks

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it's sort of have burn marks

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.980 
it's sort of have burn marks
basically<00:02:05.159> here's<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.729> motor<00:02:05.939> here's<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
basically here's the motor here's the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.469 
basically here's the motor here's the
motor<00:02:07.140> rod<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.829> controls<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.429> belt<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.849> then

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
motor rod that controls it belt and then

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.280 
motor rod that controls it belt and then
it<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.410> moves

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
it just kind of all moves

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.160 
it just kind of all moves
like<00:02:11.799> that<00:02:12.129> so<00:02:12.400> as<00:02:12.519> this<00:02:12.700> spins<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.420> spins<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
like that so as this spins it spins the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.460 
like that so as this spins it spins the
main<00:02:14.799> brush<00:02:15.159> so<00:02:15.909> sometimes<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.170> gets

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
main brush so sometimes this gets

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.979 
main brush so sometimes this gets
overheated<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:18.370> melts<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.060> doesn't<00:02:19.629> make

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
overheated and melts and doesn't make

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.619 
overheated and melts and doesn't make
good<00:02:20.170> contact<00:02:20.739> this<00:02:20.950> becomes<00:02:21.340> loose<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.000> it

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
good contact this becomes loose and it

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.380 
good contact this becomes loose and it
just<00:02:22.840> doesn't<00:02:23.049> provide<00:02:23.560> enough<00:02:24.010> friction<00:02:24.970> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
just doesn't provide enough friction to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.470 
just doesn't provide enough friction to
spin<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.560> sometimes<00:02:27.250> built<00:02:27.730> entirely

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
spin this and sometimes built entirely

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.559 
spin this and sometimes built entirely
breaks<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.099> in<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.400> case<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.390> may

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
breaks and in that in that case you may

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.990 
breaks and in that in that case you may
not<00:02:31.720> even<00:02:31.930> see<00:02:32.049> this<00:02:32.500> belt<00:02:32.799> mind<00:02:33.129> it<00:02:33.280> falling

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
not even see this belt mind it falling

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.930 
not even see this belt mind it falling
off<00:02:34.120> or<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.379> could<00:02:35.590> just<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.950> left<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:36.760> all

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
off or it could just be left in here all

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.420 
off or it could just be left in here all
broken<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.840> would<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.590> easier<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.099> remove

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
broken up and would be easier to remove

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.699 
broken up and would be easier to remove
but<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.209> this<00:02:40.299> case<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.930> an<00:02:41.019> intact<00:02:41.319> belt

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
but in this case I have an intact belt

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.589 
but in this case I have an intact belt
it's<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.069> generally<00:02:42.519> good<00:02:42.579> shape<00:02:42.909> but<00:02:43.420> I'll

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
it's in generally good shape but I'll

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.599 
it's in generally good shape but I'll
remove<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.349> put<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.650> back<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:45.099> just<00:02:45.430> this

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
remove it and put it back in just this

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.860 
remove it and put it back in just this
demonstration<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:49.060> depending<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.599> what<00:02:49.810> type

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
demonstration so depending on what type

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.750 
demonstration so depending on what type
of<00:02:50.230> back<00:02:50.409> and<00:02:50.590> clean<00:02:50.799> you're<00:02:50.980> have<00:02:51.280> sometimes

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
of back and clean you're have sometimes

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.210 
of back and clean you're have sometimes
you<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.480> remove<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.840> whole<00:02:53.260> brush<00:02:53.590> to

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
you have to remove the whole brush to

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.000 
you have to remove the whole brush to
get<00:02:54.430> this<00:02:54.609> belt<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.319> or<00:02:56.319> sometimes<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.889> can

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
get this belt out or sometimes you can

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.059 
get this belt out or sometimes you can
just<00:02:57.220> slip<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.609> belt<00:02:57.819> over<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.769> little<00:02:59.769> drive

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
just slip the belt over the little drive

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.430 
just slip the belt over the little drive
mechanism<00:03:00.790> but<00:03:01.030> let's<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.840> take<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.200> out

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
mechanism but let's just take this out

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.390 
mechanism but let's just take this out
just<00:03:04.109> just<00:03:05.109> like<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.650> could<00:03:05.769> just<00:03:05.980> pull

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
just just like that you could just pull

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.660 
just just like that you could just pull
up<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.700> whole<00:03:06.909> thing<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.389> this<00:03:07.959> will<00:03:08.519> kind<00:03:09.519> of

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
up the whole thing and this will kind of

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.119 
up the whole thing and this will kind of
have<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.849> little<00:03:10.060> tension<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.409> then<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:11.950> can

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
have a little tension and then you can

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.819 
have a little tension and then you can
just<00:03:12.280> remove<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.849> belt<00:03:13.530> sometimes<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.680> go

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
just remove the belt sometimes you go

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.319 
just remove the belt sometimes you go
again<00:03:15.129> you<00:03:15.159> could<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:15.459> remove<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.060> without

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
again you could just remove it without

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.470 
again you could just remove it without
removing<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.319> brush<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.790> that's<00:03:19.000> fine<00:03:19.299> as

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
removing the brush and that's fine as

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.319 
removing the brush and that's fine as
well<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.680> case<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.489> have<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.819> just<00:03:22.090> come

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
well in this case you have to just come

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.369 
well in this case you have to just come
on<00:03:23.400> down<00:03:24.400> here<00:03:24.849> and<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.569> kind<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.900> bend<00:03:26.199> this

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
on down here and just kind of bend this

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:32.000 
on down here and just kind of bend this
under<00:03:26.889> the<00:03:27.730> drive<00:03:27.970> mechanism<00:03:30.389> just<00:03:31.389> like<00:03:31.569> that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
under the drive mechanism just like that

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.400 
under the drive mechanism just like that
and<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.040> kind<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.609> kind<00:03:34.599> of<00:03:34.720> shimmy<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.260> out

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
and just kind of kind of shimmy it out

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.659 
and just kind of kind of shimmy it out
at<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:36.069> edge<00:03:36.480> there<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.569> go<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.500> belts<00:03:38.829> up<00:03:39.010> so

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
at the edge there you go the belts up so

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.430 
at the edge there you go the belts up so
essentially<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.419> would<00:03:40.480> grab<00:03:40.780> your<00:03:41.019> new<00:03:41.169> belt

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
essentially you would grab your new belt

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.220 
essentially you would grab your new belt
and<00:03:41.680> sometimes<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:43.060> new<00:03:43.269> belt<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.810> on<00:03:44.019> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and sometimes the new belt is on the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.270 
and sometimes the new belt is on the
back<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:46.319> are<00:03:47.319> the<00:03:47.349> bottom<00:03:47.769> of<00:03:47.889> vacuum

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
back of the are the bottom of vacuum

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.879 
back of the are the bottom of vacuum
cleaner<00:03:48.519> something<00:03:49.480> sometimes<00:03:50.079> you<00:03:50.199> don't

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
cleaner something sometimes you don't

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:52.650 
cleaner something sometimes you don't
see<00:03:51.099> these<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.489> you<00:03:51.549> just<00:03:51.730> have<00:03:51.879> to<00:03:52.000> go

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
see these and you just have to go

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.629 
see these and you just have to go
purchase<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:53.139> new<00:03:53.349> one<00:03:53.560> or<00:03:53.739> some<00:03:54.099> people<00:03:54.370> storm

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
purchase a new one or some people storm

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.729 
purchase a new one or some people storm
someplace<00:03:55.030> ill<00:03:55.239> but<00:03:55.989> putting<00:03:56.290> them<00:03:56.379> back<00:03:56.680> on

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
someplace ill but putting them back on

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.280 
someplace ill but putting them back on
is<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.760> reverse<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.329> taking<00:03:59.049> them<00:03:59.169> off

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
is just the reverse of taking them off

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.530 
is just the reverse of taking them off
so<00:03:59.680> you're<00:04:00.010> taking<00:04:00.669> it<00:04:00.790> sideways<00:04:01.090> like<00:04:01.299> this

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
so you're taking it sideways like this

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.149 
so you're taking it sideways like this
you<00:04:02.500> can<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> shimmer<00:04:03.190> shimmer<00:04:03.639> in<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:04.060> down<00:04:05.159> the

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 
you can a shimmer shimmer in it down the

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.170 
you can a shimmer shimmer in it down the
arm<00:04:06.430> here<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.199> then<00:04:08.199> in<00:04:08.319> my<00:04:08.500> case<00:04:08.849> you<00:04:09.849> just

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
arm here and then in my case you just

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.050 
arm here and then in my case you just
have<00:04:10.329> to<00:04:10.510> put<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:10.959> brush<00:04:11.889> mechanism<00:04:12.639> back<00:04:12.819> on

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
have to put the brush mechanism back on

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.960 
have to put the brush mechanism back on

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
you could do that but in most times you

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.620 
you could do that but in most times you
could<00:04:37.040> just<00:04:37.280> kind<00:04:37.490> of<00:04:37.550> set<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:37.880> there<00:04:38.150> and<00:04:38.330> de

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
could just kind of set it there and de

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.219 
could just kind of set it there and de
spin<00:04:39.080> this<00:04:39.290> around<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.160> let<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.460> brush<00:04:41.229> do

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
spin this around and let the brush do

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.870 
spin this around and let the brush do
all<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.530> work<00:04:42.740> while<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:43.220> kind<00:04:43.400> of<00:04:43.550> put<00:04:43.760> this

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880

all the work while you kind of put this
in<00:04:44.060> place<00:04:44.270> and<00:04:44.570> then<00:04:45.380> eventually<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:46.100> just

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
in place and then eventually it just

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.969 
in place and then eventually it just
kind<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.639> works<00:04:47.210> its<00:04:47.479> way<00:04:47.600> through<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.260> then

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
kind of works its way through and then

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.340 
kind of works its way through and then
you<00:04:49.070> just<00:04:49.310> want<00:04:49.550> move<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:50.660> back<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.050> forth<00:04:51.290> a
