what you're going to need is one egg a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.760 
what you're going to need is one egg a

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
just cuz it's softer and it's not gonna

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
just cuz it's softer and it's not gonna
tear<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.259> toilet<00:01:16.590> paper<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:17.040> much<00:01:17.400> though<00:01:17.670> we

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
tear the toilet paper as much though we

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969

beat<00:01:20.220> up<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> egg<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.850> also<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.270> just

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
beat up the egg you can also use just

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
beat up the egg you can also use just
like<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> fork<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.500> anything<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.310> like<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
like a fork or anything I just like a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.179 
like a fork or anything I just like a
West<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.780> designed<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
West because it's designed for that and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.800 
West because it's designed for that and
then<00:01:26.790> you're<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> need<00:01:27.240> some<00:01:27.479> toilet

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
then you're going to need some toilet

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.520 
then you're going to need some toilet
tissue

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
tissue

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.640 
tissue
I<00:01:28.799> prefer<00:01:29.460> fan<00:01:29.970> toilet<00:01:30.390> tissue<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
I prefer fan toilet tissue because it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
I prefer fan toilet tissue because it
just<00:01:31.740> seems<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> work<00:01:32.100> better<00:01:32.369> alright<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
just seems to work better alright so

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.600 
just seems to work better alright so
let's<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
let's get to it

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
let's get to it
start<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:35.759> separating<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> egg<00:01:36.780> white<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
start off by separating the egg white I

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.190 
start off by separating the egg white I
found<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.920> easiest<00:01:38.040> way<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> do<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.200> by

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
found the easiest way to do this is by

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.170 
found the easiest way to do this is by
cracking<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> egg<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> half<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> then

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
cracking the egg in half and then

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.359 
cracking the egg in half and then
pouring<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.049> contents<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> forth

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
pouring the contents back and forth

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.679 
pouring the contents back and forth
between<00:01:44.579> each<00:01:44.970> half<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> egg

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
between each half of the egg

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.770 
between each half of the egg
continuously<00:01:46.560> until<00:01:46.860> egg<00:01:47.610> white<00:01:47.909> naturally

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
continuously until egg white naturally

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.380 
continuously until egg white naturally
separates<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.740> egg<00:01:49.920> yolk<00:01:50.240> now<00:01:51.240> you're

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
separates from the egg yolk now you're

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.609 
separates from the egg yolk now you're
