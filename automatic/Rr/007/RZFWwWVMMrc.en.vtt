00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.970 

my<00:00:09.510> passion<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:09.900> scanning<00:00:10.290> comes<00:00:10.679> from<00:00:10.860> my

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
my passion for scanning comes from my

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.490 
my passion for scanning comes from my
vision<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> future<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.780> see<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.380> in

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
vision of the future I can see that in

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.470 
vision of the future I can see that in
10<00:00:13.710> years<00:00:13.920> time<00:00:14.219> everybody<00:00:15.089> will<00:00:15.269> own<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
10 years time everybody will own a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.510 
10 years time everybody will own a
scanner<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.080> everybody<00:00:16.770> will<00:00:16.949> do<00:00:17.130> scanning

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
scanner and everybody will do scanning

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.019 
scanner and everybody will do scanning
in<00:00:17.609> their<00:00:17.760> normal<00:00:18.029> jobs<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:19.020> simple<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.500> that

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
in their normal jobs it's simple as that

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.609 
in their normal jobs it's simple as that
the<00:00:21.029> biggest<00:00:21.359> benefit<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.840> scanning<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the biggest benefit in scanning is the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
the biggest benefit in scanning is the
time<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.039> takes<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> scan<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
time it takes to do the scan and the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.140 
time it takes to do the scan and the
fact<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.260> complete<00:00:25.800> everything<00:00:26.150> you

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
fact that you complete everything you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
fact that you complete everything you
don't<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.840> pick<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.410> points<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.859> you

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
don't just pick up the points that you

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
don't just pick up the points that you
would<00:00:29.130> normally<00:00:29.279> pick<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.689> pick<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.050> those

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
would normally pick up you pick up those

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
would normally pick up you pick up those
points<00:00:31.740> plus<00:00:32.219> millions<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.910> others<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:34.020> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
points plus millions of others so you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.020 
points plus millions of others so you
have<00:00:34.320> everything<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.800> need<00:00:35.010> from<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.700> button
