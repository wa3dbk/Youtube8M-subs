00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.590

 coffee maker met this youtube 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:31.050
 called mr coffee and implied 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.529
 what is cheap mobile and way from 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 home 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:39.590
 away from home the coffee maker is on top of us 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:44.820
 there is a cap under which some 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:50.480
 strange things such a thing is a hole 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:01:00.750
 here apparently need to pour water capacity 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:01:03.750
 for coffee, too, with a cap I poured into 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.869
 water capacity is cold from the tap better 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.090
 must of course some 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.060
 filtered super water and bit pour 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.560
 but what is on the mark of three and a half 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.409
 cups but practice shows that this 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.040
 about 2 150 grams cup and now 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.810
 I do not put containers here and pour 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.280
 all its contents here in this container 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 the top where by the way there are marks too 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.770
 In general, until the end and put it empty 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.720
 it turned out that here we have the same 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:52.189
 most three and a half water poured 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 cold coffee smart growth smart fire 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:58.340
 one hundred percent movie here in a pack 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.829
 they are right there and actually said 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:08.990
 young and slowly carefully selected and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.990
 about roasted arabica coffee beans 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.410
 but inside here is such a packet filter 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.640
 looks like a huge round tea 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.100
 a bag for a bag like this 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.460
 way flat neatly fits on 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.040
 bottom 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:38.000
 coffee makers if my coffee was just 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.650
 roasted in ground beans separately 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.080
 without a bag, I would need 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.920
 coffee maker with special mesh 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.610

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.560
 Well, that is a more expensive model 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.560
 coffee makers 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:00.200
 drove know need about five minutes 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:17.890

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:23.530

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.530
