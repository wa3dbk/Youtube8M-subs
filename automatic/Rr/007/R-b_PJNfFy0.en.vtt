 if I have it here 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.569

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.220

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.690
 selection we would do here our 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:07.490
 device 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.060

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.130
 updates that you have 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.050

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.610
 do the free 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.400
 However, here is the warning that 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.060
 do hi bred changing the theme of the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.800

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.610
 the termination of 35 that that information 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.610
 I'm going to leave it 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:10.569
 well taking this out as we have trouble 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.890

 here you can detect it 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.840
 I do not need to put the program 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.410

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.170
