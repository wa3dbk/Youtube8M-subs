it's a delay of about 28 days what can
you<00:02:49.109> do<00:02:49.519> it's<00:02:50.519> not<00:02:50.700> too<00:02:50.970> bad<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.709> much

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
you do it's not too bad it's a much

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.990 
you do it's not too bad it's a much
better<00:02:53.549> than<00:02:53.670> can<00:02:53.849> be<00:02:53.879> expected<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:56.760> can

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
better than can be expected and we can

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.030 
better than can be expected and we can
hopefully<00:02:57.359> move<00:02:57.750> on<00:02:57.930> from<00:02:58.049> here<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.500> had<00:02:58.680> people

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
hopefully move on from here I had people

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.940 
hopefully move on from here I had people
ask<00:02:59.129> me<00:02:59.220> about<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.700> air<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.180> bits<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
ask me about the air the bits for the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.199 
ask me about the air the bits for the
football<00:03:02.129> club<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:04.400> think<00:03:05.400> people<00:03:05.819> were

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
football club and I think people were

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.619 
football club and I think people were
under<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:06.959> impression<00:03:07.049> that<00:03:08.299> you<00:03:09.299> know<00:03:09.420> we

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
under the impression that you know we

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.599 
under the impression that you know we
would<00:03:09.900> hear<00:03:10.170> from<00:03:10.409> about<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.069> bid<00:03:11.250> straight

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
would hear from about the bid straight

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.490 
would hear from about the bid straight
away<00:03:11.819> but<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.239> don't<00:03:12.599> think<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.319> to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
away but I don't think that is going to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.599 
away but I don't think that is going to
be<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> case<00:03:14.060> although<00:03:15.060> five<00:03:15.659> indicative

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
be the case although five indicative

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.920 
be the case although five indicative

path it's a process that needs to be

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.789 
path it's a process that needs to be
followed<00:03:38.959> do<00:03:39.959> I<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.200> anything<00:03:40.440> about<00:03:40.650> the
