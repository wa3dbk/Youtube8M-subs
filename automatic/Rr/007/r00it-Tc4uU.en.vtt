00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the 100 seat segment so there is not a

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
the 100 seat segment so there is not a
lot<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.310> choice<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.210> Embraer<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.140> a

transitioning aircrafts lead times and
that<00:02:47.020> is<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.890> guess<00:02:48.850> come<00:02:49.090> from<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
that is really I guess come from the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.010 
that is really I guess come from the
commercial<00:02:49.630> side<00:02:49.990> but<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:51.600> would<00:02:52.600> say<00:02:52.780> that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
commercial side but I would say that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.050 
commercial side but I would say that
today<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.700> support<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:54.910> get<00:02:55.000> from

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
today the the support that we get from

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.820 
today the the support that we get from
the<00:02:55.360> on<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.600> technical<00:02:55.989> side<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.380> it's<00:02:56.739> just

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
the on the technical side is it's just

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.830 
the on the technical side is it's just
as<00:02:57.130> strong<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.580> not<00:02:57.640> stronger<00:02:58.030> than<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.780> the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
as strong if not stronger than on the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.680 
as strong if not stronger than on the
commercial<00:02:59.230> side<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:01.180> taken<00:03:01.480> some<00:03:01.630> time

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
commercial side so it's taken some time

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.040 
commercial side so it's taken some time
in<00:03:02.260> all<00:03:02.440> honesty<00:03:02.830> but<00:03:03.120> we're<00:03:04.120> quite<00:03:04.750> happy

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
in all honesty but we're quite happy

in all honesty but we're quite happy
with<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.160> way<00:03:06.280> it's<00:03:06.430> turned<00:03:06.760> out<00:03:06.910> it's<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:08.080> an

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
with the way it's turned out it's not an

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.690 
with the way it's turned out it's not an
aircraft<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.920> we<00:03:09.070> deliver<00:03:09.370> but<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.640> a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
aircraft that we deliver but it's a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.520 
aircraft that we deliver but it's a

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
different services that I by the way

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.080 
different services that I by the way
everyone<00:03:13.690> delivers<00:03:14.530> these<00:03:14.709> MRO<00:03:15.400> services

everyone delivers these MRO services
material<00:03:16.720> technical<00:03:17.590> services<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.760> how<00:03:18.970> you

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
material technical services but how you

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.940 
material technical services but how you
do<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.049> think<00:03:20.140> that's<00:03:20.380> what<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.650> matters

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
do it and I think that's what it matters

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.830 
do it and I think that's what it matters
because<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:22.000> one<00:03:22.120> makes<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.390> difference<00:03:22.720> is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
because that one makes a difference is

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.050 
because that one makes a difference is

it's<00:03:39.549> very<00:03:39.850> important<00:03:40.360> to<00:03:40.660> notice<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.220> on

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
it's very important to notice that so on

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.800 
it's very important to notice that so on

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.170 
Whitney engines we are investing more so
we<00:03:50.860> have<00:03:51.459> brand-new<00:03:52.060> state-of-the-art<00:03:53.130> wings
