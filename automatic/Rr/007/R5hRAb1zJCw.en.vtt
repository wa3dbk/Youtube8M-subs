00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.750
 one which is generally written without sticks 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.130
 for real gamers 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.690

 super mega cool by the way he looks 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:37.310
 more pleasant without regretting it seemed at first 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:40.940
 look as we see the sticks here since 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:45.020
 sony playstation so i mean dual 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:47.389
 shock and be a little uncomfortable to get used to 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:52.360
 will have to do this but nothing 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:56.930
 get used yusbi connector 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.930
 wire there meters 600 well and buttons 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.820
 a billion is shorter can even be yourself 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.280
 play or 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.270
 so sitting on the couch playing for 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:14.380
 Persian pumping 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:18.380
 just masturbate so here is shorter 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:23.210
 review and something else I wanted to say somewhere 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:24.520
 this read that yes yes here is shorter here 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.720
 even have 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:33.500
 headphone and microphone jacks 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.349
 it is very good in principle because I 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.570
 It has become vpadlu climb for computers 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:46.039
 rearrange these wires constantly when 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:50.270
 we play buttons are pressed in the market 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:52.300
 But the buttons are still normal here 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.580
 here are gimmicks 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.759
 They are numbered not as 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.699
 on strange console like all sorts 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:04.610
 crosses more understandable more beautifully 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.560
 there are still light bulbs that have not yet 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:13.030
 understand why but then somehow 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:16.190
 understand and damn, in principle, here 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.599
 as far as I understand it will be 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.060
 adjust volume 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:25.270
 even 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:29.970
 in these headphones on the joystick principle 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:37.830
 why the hell would you have to let it be 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:37.830
 This is a review on the gamepad mazafaka Ñ‘pta 

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.190
 and
