with<00:01:11.070> everybody<00:01:11.430> else<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.090> those<00:01:12.210> low<00:01:12.570> levels

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
with everybody else for those low levels

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.700 
with everybody else for those low levels
or<00:01:13.350> copycat<00:01:13.740> users<00:01:14.400> etc<00:01:14.900> like<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.200> low<00:01:16.320> levels

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
or copycat users etc like the low levels

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.100 
or copycat users etc like the low levels
you<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> non<00:01:17.490> prestige<00:01:17.939> people<00:01:18.360> they

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you see the non prestige people they

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.330 
you see the non prestige people they
don't<00:01:19.170> really<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> use<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> guns<00:01:20.189> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
don't really get to use the guns that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.160 
don't really get to use the guns that
you're<00:01:20.549> using<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> high<00:01:21.299> level<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you're using at that high level so I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.590 
you're using at that high level so I
figure<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:22.979> kill<00:01:23.220> me<00:01:23.400> enough<00:01:23.640> times<00:01:23.939> then

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
figure if they kill me enough times then

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
figure if they kill me enough times then
they<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.110> probably<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.770> pick<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.159> up

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
they can probably get to pick some up

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
they can probably get to pick some up
somewhere<00:01:26.729> or<00:01:27.000> if<00:01:27.509> I've<00:01:27.810> killed<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.320> enough

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
somewhere or if I've killed them enough

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
somewhere or if I've killed them enough
times<00:01:28.829> but<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> setup<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:29.850> they<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
times but the setup then they get the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
times but the setup then they get the
opportunity<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> copycat<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
opportunity is copycat on it and in this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.910 
opportunity is copycat on it and in this
game<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.360> somebody<00:01:33.869> actually<00:01:33.930> does<00:01:34.380> copycat

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.600 
got the idea i was looking around in the
form<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.079> i<00:01:52.110> mentioned<00:01:52.470> stealth<00:01:52.979> bomber<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
form so i mentioned stealth bomber and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.520 
form so i mentioned stealth bomber and
not<00:01:54.060> having<00:01:54.270> bear<00:01:54.509> may<00:01:54.659> have<00:01:54.780> kills<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.380> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
not having bear may have kills with it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
not having bear may have kills with it
and<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:56.310> anyway<00:01:56.939> second<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.869> got

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and I was like anyway second really got

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.910 
and I was like anyway second really got
me<00:01:58.170> killed<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.530> with<00:01:58.770> my<00:01:58.920> stove<00:01:59.189> bomber<00:02:00.049> 27<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
me killed out with my stove bomber 27 so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.109 
me killed out with my stove bomber 27 so
I<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.250> I'll<00:02:02.460> try<00:02:02.700> something<00:02:02.969> different

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
I think I'll try something different

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.609 
I think I'll try something different
being<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.630> level<00:02:03.930> something<00:02:04.229> now<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> needs

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
being a level something now it needs

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.490 
being a level something now it needs
something<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.979> keep<00:02:05.280> myself<00:02:05.460> entertained

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
something to keep myself entertained

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.290 
something to keep myself entertained
so<00:02:07.010> I'll<00:02:07.250> start<00:02:07.490> running<00:02:07.790> with<00:02:07.910> a<00:02:07.940> stealth

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
so I'll start running with a stealth

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.180 
so I'll start running with a stealth
bomber<00:02:08.360> set<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:08.960> and<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:11.210> got<00:02:11.630> surprised

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
bomber set up and I I got surprised

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.670 
bomber set up and I I got surprised
