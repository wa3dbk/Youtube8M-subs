00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.820 
on the system and by the way all the
other<00:04:29.970> fans<00:04:30.270> of<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.539> case<00:04:30.750> are<00:04:30.990> also<00:04:31.289> going<00:04:31.710> to

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
other fans of the case are also going to

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.119 
other fans of the case are also going to
be<00:04:32.039> on<00:04:32.250> in<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:33.120> test<00:04:33.479> so<00:04:34.319> i'll<00:04:34.470> do<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.800> first

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
be on in this test so i'll do that first

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.490 
be on in this test so i'll do that first
without<00:04:35.849> the<00:04:36.030> side<00:04:36.240> panel<00:04:36.690> on<00:04:36.840> and<00:04:37.050> then<00:04:37.409> I'll

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
without the side panel on and then I'll

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.529 
without the side panel on and then I'll
place<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.919> side<00:04:38.129> panel<00:04:38.520> back<00:04:38.729> so<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.360> can

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
place the side panel back so you can

00:04:39.539 --> 00:05:15.600 
place the side panel back so you can
hear<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.050> difference

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.999 

finally<00:05:16.599> how<00:05:16.960> to<00:05:17.020> listen<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.710> stock

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
finally how to listen to the stock

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:28.870 
finally how to listen to the stock
cooling

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.870 

oddly<00:05:29.810> enough<00:05:29.840> not<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.560> lot<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:30.950> cases<00:05:31.160> have

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
oddly enough not a lot of cases have

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.510 
oddly enough not a lot of cases have
sound<00:05:32.540> dampening<00:05:32.930> material<00:05:33.110> but<00:05:33.830> this<00:05:34.280> one

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
sound dampening material but this one

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.550 
sound dampening material but this one
does<00:05:34.880> but<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.330> only<00:05:35.480> has<00:05:35.810> it<00:05:35.840> on<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.200> left<00:05:36.350> and

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
does but it only has it on the left and

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.610 
does but it only has it on the left and
right<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:36.980> top<00:05:37.610> knot<00:05:38.450> on<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.690> back<00:05:38.780> bottom<00:05:39.350> of

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
right and top knot on the back bottom of

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.590 
right and top knot on the back bottom of
front<00:05:39.860> they<00:05:40.100> should<00:05:40.400> included<00:05:41.120> some<00:05:41.330> sound

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
front they should included some sound

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.170 
front they should included some sound
damping<00:05:41.990> material<00:05:42.110> there<00:05:42.920> as<00:05:43.100> well<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.580> have<00:05:44.150> a

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
damping material there as well I have a

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.310 
damping material there as well I have a
concern<00:05:44.630> with<00:05:44.900> that<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:46.270> filter<00:05:47.270> cage<00:05:47.750> thing

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
concern with that and filter cage thing

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.650 
concern with that and filter cage thing
at<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:48.800> front<00:05:49.070> because<00:05:49.880> what<00:05:50.090> happens<00:05:50.420> is<00:05:50.540> if

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
at the front because what happens is if

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.830 
at the front because what happens is if
you<00:05:50.750> push<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.200> fan<00:05:51.470> too<00:05:51.830> far<00:05:52.160> into<00:05:52.460> it<00:05:52.790> the<00:05:53.570> fan

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
you push the fan too far into it the fan

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.170 
you push the fan too far into it the fan
blades<00:05:54.140> will<00:05:54.410> hit<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.950> filter<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.580> the

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
blades will hit the filter and the

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.750 
blades will hit the filter and the
family<00:05:56.690> either<00:05:56.780> make<00:05:57.200> noise<00:05:57.530> or<00:05:58.160> will<00:05:58.430> stop

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
family either make noise or will stop

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.300 
family either make noise or will stop
altogether<00:05:59.030> but<00:05:59.870> the<00:05:59.990> case<00:06:00.200> itself<00:06:00.560> does<00:06:01.040> have

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
altogether but the case itself does have

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.210 
altogether but the case itself does have
an<00:06:01.400> eye<00:06:01.520> catchy<00:06:02.480> design<00:06:03.230> the<00:06:03.860> overall

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
an eye catchy design the overall

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.700 
an eye catchy design the overall
construction<00:06:04.490> is<00:06:05.000> pretty<00:06:05.510> good<00:06:05.750> also<00:06:06.020> that

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
construction is pretty good also that

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.940 
construction is pretty good also that
lots<00:06:07.010> of<00:06:07.310> drive<00:06:07.850> bays<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:08.660> plenty<00:06:09.530> of<00:06:09.560> air

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
lots of drive bays and plenty of air

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.070 
lots of drive bays and plenty of air
circulation<00:06:10.460> overall<00:06:11.150> it's<00:06:11.390> a<00:06:11.510> great<00:06:11.540> product

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
circulation overall it's a great product

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.640 
circulation overall it's a great product
until<00:06:12.830> next<00:06:13.010> time<00:06:13.160> take<00:06:13.490> care
