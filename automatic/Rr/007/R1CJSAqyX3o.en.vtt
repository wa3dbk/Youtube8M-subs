whoo<00:02:05.799> three<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.310> here<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.090> go<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.430> can

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
whoo three and here we go so you can

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.490 
whoo three and here we go so you can
hear<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.880> whole<00:02:14.150> fourth<00:02:14.540> bar<00:02:14.810> was<00:02:15.050> nothing

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
hear that whole fourth bar was nothing

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.430 
hear that whole fourth bar was nothing
but<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.709> drum<00:02:16.069> fill<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:17.360> let's<00:02:17.930> slow<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.410> down

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
but a drum fill now let's slow that down

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.860 
but a drum fill now let's slow that down
just<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:19.040> make<00:02:19.190> sure<00:02:19.220> you<00:02:19.520> got<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:19.940> take<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
just to make sure you got it take the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.910 
just to make sure you got it take the
temple<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.290> slow<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.590> down<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:23.180> do<00:02:23.959> here<00:02:24.830> we

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
temple and slow it down what do here we

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:41.380 
temple and slow it down what do here we
go<00:02:32.110> 23<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.790> go<00:02:40.060> we're<00:02:41.060> going<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.299> take

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
go 23 and here we go we're going to take

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.150 
go 23 and here we go we're going to take
it<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.660> next<00:02:41.780> step<00:02:41.930> we're<00:02:42.769> actually<00:02:42.890> going

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
it to the next step we're actually going

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.670 
it to the next step we're actually going
to<00:02:43.250> take<00:02:43.459> that<00:02:43.850> same<00:02:44.269> rhythm<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.840> same<00:02:44.900> four

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
to take that same rhythm that same four

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.920 
to take that same rhythm that same four
bars<00:02:46.209> same<00:02:47.209> rhythm<00:02:47.360> but<00:02:47.600> we're<00:02:47.720> going<00:02:47.870> to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
bars same rhythm but we're going to

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.470 
bars same rhythm but we're going to
spread<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.440> around<00:02:48.590> on<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.280> tom-toms<00:02:49.790> it's

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
spread it around on the tom-toms it's

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.289 
spread it around on the tom-toms it's
going<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.690> sound<00:02:50.840> something<00:02:51.170> like<00:02:51.319> this<00:02:55.299> again

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
going to sound something like this again

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.900 
going to sound something like this again
I'll<00:02:56.360> actually<00:02:56.690> do<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.110> slower

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.210 

so<00:03:03.910> it's<00:03:04.090> four<00:03:04.390> notes<00:03:04.720> on<00:03:04.960> each<00:03:05.020> drum<00:03:05.650> I'll

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
so it's four notes on each drum I'll

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.740 
so it's four notes on each drum I'll
play<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.880> metronome<00:03:07.150> so<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.600> also

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
play with the metronome so you can also

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:17.130 
play with the metronome so you can also
here<00:03:08.010> too<00:03:15.090> now<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.150> also<00:03:16.360> notice<00:03:16.750> right<00:03:16.900> there

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
here too now you also notice right there

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.020 
here too now you also notice right there
notice<00:03:17.470> all<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.650> hit<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.950> crash<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.850> bass

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
notice all I hit the crash and the bass

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.030 
notice all I hit the crash and the bass
drum<00:03:19.210> together<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:20.530> basically<00:03:20.920> is

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
drum together that basically is

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.280 
drum together that basically is
signaling<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.360> beginning<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.170> next

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
signaling the beginning of the next

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.320 
signaling the beginning of the next
phrase<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.860> it's<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:24.070> typical<00:03:24.460> at<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
phrase and it's a very typical at the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.760 
phrase and it's a very typical at the
end<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.510> a<00:03:25.600> drum<00:03:25.810> fill<00:03:26.020> to<00:03:26.230> actually<00:03:26.560> hit<00:03:26.710> the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
end of a drum fill to actually hit the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.700 
end of a drum fill to actually hit the
bass<00:03:27.070> drum<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.490> the<00:03:27.580> symbol<00:03:28.570> together<00:03:28.870> so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
bass drum and the symbol together so

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.930 
bass drum and the symbol together so
here<00:03:29.890> we<00:03:29.920> go<00:03:29.980> we're<00:03:30.130> going<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> play<00:03:30.520> with<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
here we go we're going to play with the

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:43.340 
here we go we're going to play with the
music<00:03:31.150> at<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:32.020> slow<00:03:32.260> tempo<00:03:32.620> one<00:03:33.130> two<00:03:33.940> three

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:52.380 

and<00:03:44.350> here<00:03:44.680> we<00:03:44.710> go<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:51.310> get<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.550> idea<00:03:51.580> let's

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
and here we go you get the idea let's

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:08.190 
and here we go you get the idea let's
speed<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.690> up<00:03:52.840> one<00:03:53.620> two<00:03:54.220> three<00:04:06.990> pretty<00:04:07.990> cool

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
speed it up one two three pretty cool

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.470 
speed it up one two three pretty cool
huh<00:04:08.610> here's<00:04:09.610> another<00:04:09.790> variation<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.450> that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
huh here's another variation of that

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.270 
huh here's another variation of that
that<00:04:10.720> we<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:10.990> do<00:04:11.110> which<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.320> shorten<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.070> fill

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that we can do which is shorten the fill

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.310 
that we can do which is shorten the fill
now<00:04:13.060> as<00:04:13.120> you<00:04:13.240> know<00:04:13.360> before<00:04:13.720> we<00:04:13.900> played<00:04:14.140> the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
now as you know before we played the

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.510 
now as you know before we played the
fill<00:04:14.500> for<00:04:14.800> four<00:04:15.070> beads<00:04:17.160> now<00:04:18.160> we're<00:04:18.370> going<00:04:18.460> to

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
fill for four beads now we're going to

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:25.590 
fill for four beads now we're going to
do<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.880> in<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.600> two<00:04:19.870> beats<00:04:20.310> what<00:04:21.310> do<00:04:24.510> here<00:04:25.510> we

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
do it in just two beats what do here we

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:36.090 
do it in just two beats what do here we
go<00:04:25.750> with<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.050> music<00:04:26.230> one<00:04:26.950> two<00:04:27.240> three

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.490 

one<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:39.820> get<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.970> idea<00:04:41.300> let's<00:04:41.960> do<00:04:42.140> the<00:04:42.290> same

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
one to get the idea let's do the same

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.800 
one to get the idea let's do the same
thing<00:04:42.740> except<00:04:43.070> with<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.220> tom-toms<00:04:46.810> instead

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
thing except with the tom-toms instead

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.750 
thing except with the tom-toms instead
of<00:04:47.930> four<00:04:48.170> times<00:04:48.500> on<00:04:48.680> each<00:04:48.740> time<00:04:49.190> we're<00:04:49.700> gonna

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
of four times on each time we're gonna

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.050 
of four times on each time we're gonna
do<00:04:50.000> two<00:04:50.270> beats<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.780> each<00:04:50.930> time<00:04:51.230> one<00:04:51.710> two<00:04:52.340> great

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
do two beats on each time one two great

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.010 
do two beats on each time one two great
here<00:04:53.390> we<00:04:53.480> go<00:04:53.600> and<00:04:53.870> I'll<00:04:53.960> just<00:04:54.170> need<00:04:54.290> to<00:04:54.350> fill

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.060 

two<00:05:01.900> that's<00:05:02.900> how<00:05:03.080> it<00:05:03.140> goes<00:05:03.320> let's<00:05:03.680> do<00:05:03.800> with<00:05:03.980> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
two that's how it goes let's do with the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:20.500 
two that's how it goes let's do with the
music<00:05:04.270> one<00:05:05.270> two<00:05:05.900> three<00:05:18.700> pretty<00:05:19.700> cool<00:05:19.940> a<00:05:20.180> nice

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
music one two three pretty cool a nice

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.780 
music one two three pretty cool a nice
variation<00:05:21.010> let's<00:05:22.010> say<00:05:22.160> we<00:05:22.190> want<00:05:22.520> something

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
variation let's say we want something

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.140 
variation let's say we want something
shorter<00:05:23.450> we<00:05:23.930> can<00:05:24.140> do<00:05:24.290> just<00:05:24.530> one<00:05:24.920> beat<00:05:25.160> give<00:05:26.060> you

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
shorter we can do just one beat give you

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.970 
shorter we can do just one beat give you
an<00:05:26.210> example<00:05:26.510> of<00:05:26.660> that<00:05:26.750> with<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.140> click<00:05:27.350> one

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
an example of that with the click one

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.860 
an example of that with the click one
two<00:05:28.610> three<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.580> all<00:05:31.640> you<00:05:31.730> have<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:31.910> do<00:05:32.090> just

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
two three so all you have to do just

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.520 
two three so all you have to do just
beat<00:05:33.050> 4<00:05:33.430> 12<00:05:36.370> if<00:05:37.370> you<00:05:37.490> want<00:05:37.730> to<00:05:37.850> change<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.420> up
