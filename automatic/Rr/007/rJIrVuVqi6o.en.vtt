around<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:20.989> like<00:04:21.229> of<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.560> different<00:04:21.949> for

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
around that like of this different for

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.760 
around that like of this different for
different<00:04:22.550> students<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.470> some<00:04:24.470> have

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
different students and some have

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.680 
different students and some have
problems<00:04:25.460> with<00:04:25.580> their<00:04:25.940> technician<00:04:26.599> the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
problems with their technician the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.450 
problems with their technician the
sparkle<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.289> needed<00:04:27.590> others<00:04:27.889> are<00:04:28.039> problems

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
sparkle is needed others are problems

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.610 
sparkle is needed others are problems
more<00:04:28.759> likely<00:04:29.270> with<00:04:29.449> that<00:04:30.050> kind<00:04:30.229> of<00:04:30.259> suppleness

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
more likely with that kind of suppleness

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.750 
more likely with that kind of suppleness
with<00:04:30.919> fluidity<00:04:31.190> with<00:04:31.639> regard<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.389> mean

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
with fluidity with regard to I mean

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.360 
with fluidity with regard to I mean
a<00:04:32.850> technical<00:04:33.360> problem<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:34.160> producing<00:04:35.160> a<00:04:35.190> most

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
a technical problem is producing a most

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.040 
a technical problem is producing a most
wonderful<00:04:35.640> contaminant

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
wonderful contaminant

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.280 
wonderful contaminant
so<00:04:37.890> there<00:04:38.160> are<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.490> think<00:04:39.420> for<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.140> three

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
so there are I think for the three

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.260 
so there are I think for the three
students<00:04:40.890> they<00:04:41.040> may<00:04:41.520> come<00:04:41.790> with<00:04:41.940> things<00:04:42.180> that

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
students they may come with things that

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.520 
students they may come with things that
are<00:04:42.480> well<00:04:42.600> developing<00:04:43.110> things<00:04:43.230> that<00:04:43.410> were

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
are well developing things that were

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.860 
are well developing things that were
less<00:04:43.680> well<00:04:43.920> developed<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.840> just

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
less well developed and I think you just

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.730 
less well developed and I think you just
have<00:04:46.140> to<00:04:46.850> work<00:04:47.850> with<00:04:47.880> each<00:04:48.060> student<00:04:48.470> both<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
have to work with each student both to

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.440 
have to work with each student both to
strengthen<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.430> strengths<00:04:50.820> but<00:04:50.970> also<00:04:51.150> to

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
strengthen the strengths but also to

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.380 
strengthen the strengths but also to
build<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.620> weaknesses<00:04:55.580> and<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:57.060> know<00:04:57.210> your

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
build the weaknesses and you know your

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.380 
build the weaknesses and you know your
favorite<00:04:57.840> shop<00:04:58.080> and<00:04:58.290> interpreters<00:04:58.980> um<00:04:59.280> yes<00:05:00.240> I

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
think we shot like this very much this

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.200 
think we shot like this very much this
technique<00:06:32.290> if<00:06:33.040> you<00:06:33.310> understand<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.090> music

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
technique if you understand the music

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.030 
technique if you understand the music
appreciate<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.170> if<00:06:35.320> helps<00:06:35.620> you<00:06:35.740> learn<00:06:35.890> the

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
appreciate it if helps you learn the

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.200 
appreciate it if helps you learn the
technique<00:06:36.400> better<00:06:38.340> be<00:06:39.340> sensitive<00:06:39.910> being

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
technique better be sensitive being

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.410 
technique better be sensitive being
sensible<00:06:40.840> the<00:06:41.140> enquiring<00:06:41.890> try<00:06:42.880> find<00:06:43.180> that<00:06:43.300> the

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
sensible the enquiring try find that the

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.780 
sensible the enquiring try find that the
music<00:06:43.720> has<00:06:43.870> to<00:06:43.900> say<00:06:44.230> work<00:06:44.650> through<00:06:44.920> that<00:06:45.130> to

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
music has to say work through that to

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.440 
music has to say work through that to
speak<00:06:46.680> not<00:06:47.680> just<00:06:47.710> with<00:06:48.190> respect<00:06:48.370> for<00:06:49.060> tropi

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
speak not just with respect for tropi

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.990 
speak not just with respect for tropi
though<00:06:49.750> never<00:06:50.320> without<00:06:50.680> it<00:06:50.740> but<00:06:51.430> also<00:06:51.610> for<00:06:51.970> a

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
though never without it but also for a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.150 
though never without it but also for a
belief<00:06:52.330> that<00:06:52.630> this<00:06:52.900> was<00:06:53.050> all<00:06:53.260> great<00:06:53.530> music<00:06:53.980> I

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
belief that this was all great music I

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.910 
belief that this was all great music I
think<00:06:54.700> great<00:06:55.420> music<00:06:55.780> gives<00:06:55.990> you<00:06:56.140> a<00:06:56.170> chance<00:06:56.530> to

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
think great music gives you a chance to

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.370 
think great music gives you a chance to
demonstrate<00:06:57.760> something<00:06:58.360> of<00:06:58.600> yourself<00:06:59.110> as<00:06:59.260> an

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
have been able to hear that person again

and I want to get the professional man

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.490 
and I want to get the professional man
because<00:07:27.760> to<00:07:27.880> me<00:07:28.030> shoppers<00:07:28.780> it's<00:07:29.080> not<00:07:29.230> the<00:07:29.410> only

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:29.500 
because to me shoppers it's not the only

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.040 
because to me shoppers it's not the only
company<00:07:29.980> but<00:07:30.400> it<00:07:30.550> is<00:07:30.760> a<00:07:30.790> huge<00:07:31.180> challenging<00:07:31.840> one

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
company but it is a huge challenging one

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.710 
company but it is a huge challenging one
I<00:07:32.260> think<00:07:33.010> I<00:07:33.130> find<00:07:33.520> that<00:07:33.700> students<00:07:34.630> are

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 
I think I find that students are

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.600 
I think I find that students are
actually<00:07:34.750> they<00:07:35.740> love<00:07:35.950> Tropper<00:07:36.220> but<00:07:36.490> they're

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610 
actually they love Tropper but they're

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.340 
actually they love Tropper but they're
quite<00:07:36.760> afraid<00:07:37.000> of<00:07:37.240> playing<00:07:37.450> it<00:07:37.690> because<00:07:38.140> they

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.350 
quite afraid of playing it because they

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.550 
quite afraid of playing it because they
know<00:07:38.560> it's<00:07:38.860> a<00:07:39.130> very<00:07:39.730> very<00:07:39.880> tough<00:07:40.360> test

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 
know it's a very very tough test

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.939 
know it's a very very tough test
so<00:07:42.280> I<00:07:42.310> don't<00:07:42.370> hear<00:07:42.849> people<00:07:42.879> who<00:07:43.360> are<00:07:43.389> just

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:43.949 
so I don't hear people who are just

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:47.159 
so I don't hear people who are just
dutiful<00:07:44.949> students<00:07:45.310> I<00:07:45.490> would<00:07:46.270> hear<00:07:46.479> people<00:07:46.539> who

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:47.169 
dutiful students I would hear people who

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:49.710 
dutiful students I would hear people who
to<00:07:48.009> rise<00:07:48.280> to<00:07:48.520> the<00:07:48.639> artistic<00:07:48.879> challenge<00:07:49.270> if

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
to rise to the artistic challenge if

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.659 
to rise to the artistic challenge if
they<00:07:49.780> of<00:07:50.560> course<00:07:50.770> the<00:07:50.949> more<00:07:51.099> perfect<00:07:51.340> they<00:07:51.639> are

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:51.669 
they of course the more perfect they are

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:54.839 
they of course the more perfect they are
the<00:07:51.849> better<00:07:52.030> but<00:07:52.740> perfection<00:07:53.740> in<00:07:54.159> itself<00:07:54.580> is

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:54.849 
the better but perfection in itself is

00:07:54.849 --> 00:07:59.129 
the better but perfection in itself is
is<00:07:55.470> less<00:07:56.470> important<00:07:57.039> than<00:07:57.099> the<00:07:57.250> ability<00:07:57.610> to<00:07:58.139> to

00:07:59.129 --> 00:07:59.139 
is less important than the ability to to

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:01.980 
is less important than the ability to to
speak<00:07:59.409> into<00:07:59.620> community<00:08:00.220> and<00:08:01.030> I<00:08:01.180> was<00:08:01.419> out<00:08:01.599> here

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990 
speak into community and I was out here

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.970 
speak into community and I was out here
