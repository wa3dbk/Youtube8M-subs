this world I know some people I've been

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.620 
this world I know some people I've been
asking<00:04:10.590> for<00:04:10.739> me<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.890> bring<00:04:11.579> back<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.600> original

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
asking for me to bring back the original

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.250 
asking for me to bring back the original
drones<00:04:13.380> craft<00:04:13.709> world<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:15.630> think<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:16.019> have

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
drones craft world and I think I have

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.890 
drones craft world and I think I have
that<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.400> don't<00:04:18.270> know<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:18.570> I<00:04:18.630> don't<00:04:18.840> know

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
that but I don't know but I don't know

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.570 
that but I don't know but I don't know
because<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.320> world<00:04:19.590> isn't<00:04:20.039> spawning

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
because that world isn't spawning

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.400 
because that world isn't spawning
anything<00:04:21.539> it's<00:04:21.690> not<00:04:21.870> spawning<00:04:22.169> horses<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
anything it's not spawning horses it

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.230 
anything it's not spawning horses it
it's<00:04:23.500> not<00:04:23.710> spawning<00:04:24.040> any<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.310> didn't<00:04:24.550> you<00:04:24.610> ORS<00:04:24.910> I

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
it's not spawning any I didn't you ORS I

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.630 
it's not spawning any I didn't you ORS I
don't<00:04:25.420> think<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.650> it's<00:04:26.740> pretty<00:04:26.920> outdated<00:04:27.130> I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
don't think so it's pretty outdated I

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.460 
don't think so it's pretty outdated I
don't<00:04:27.820> know<00:04:27.880> if<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.090> can<00:04:28.150> bring<00:04:28.420> it<00:04:28.600> back<00:04:28.780> that

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
don't know if I can bring it back that

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.970 
don't know if I can bring it back that
easily<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.070> mean<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.520> could<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.450> could<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.380> could<00:04:32.770> be

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
easily I mean I could I could I could be

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:41.460 
easily I mean I could I could I could be
making<00:04:33.220> my<00:04:33.490> mission<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:40.050> okay<00:04:41.050> we're<00:04:41.200> gonna<00:04:41.290> go

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
making my mission to okay we're gonna go

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.560 
making my mission to okay we're gonna go
kill<00:04:41.650> some<00:04:41.860> stuff<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:43.150> hopefully<00:04:43.450> go

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
kill some stuff and hopefully go

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.640 
kill some stuff and hopefully go
exploring<00:04:44.110> how<00:04:44.830> much<00:04:45.430> more<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.360> remember<00:04:47.020> I

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
exploring how much more I remember I

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.260 
exploring how much more I remember I
remember<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:49.000> happened<00:04:49.450> yes<00:04:50.200> yes<00:04:50.620> yes<00:04:51.270> wait

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
remember what happened yes yes yes wait

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.720 
remember what happened yes yes yes wait
I<00:04:52.570> don't<00:04:53.440> entirely<00:04:53.740> remember<00:04:54.220> what<00:04:54.370> happened

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
I don't entirely remember what happened

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.520 
I don't entirely remember what happened
I'm<00:04:55.150> pretty<00:04:55.360> sure<00:04:55.450> the<00:04:55.600> last<00:04:55.750> time<00:04:56.050> I<00:04:56.080> was<00:04:56.320> here

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
I'm pretty sure the last time I was here

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.120 
I'm pretty sure the last time I was here
and<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:57.820> reason<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.450> don't<00:04:58.510> have<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:59.380> chest

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
and the reason I don't have a chest

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.700 
and the reason I don't have a chest
plate<00:05:00.310> or<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.640> helmet<00:05:00.880> is<00:05:01.180> because<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:01.930> think<00:05:02.110> I

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
plate or a helmet is because I think I

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.800 
plate or a helmet is because I think I
got<00:05:02.970> exploded<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.530> got<00:05:05.530> exploded<00:05:06.180> by<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.210> creeper

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
got exploded I got exploded by a creeper

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.610 
got exploded I got exploded by a creeper
and<00:05:08.160> I<00:05:09.160> think<00:05:09.480> it<00:05:10.480> went<00:05:10.660> away<00:05:10.720> I'm<00:05:11.260> pretty<00:05:11.440> sure

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
and I think it went away I'm pretty sure

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.570 
and I think it went away I'm pretty sure
that's<00:05:11.800> what<00:05:12.070> happened

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
that's what happened

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.100 
that's what happened
I'm<00:05:12.910> not<00:05:13.120> entirely<00:05:13.390> sure<00:05:13.570> if<00:05:13.870> that<00:05:14.080> is

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
I'm not entirely sure if that is

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.050 
I'm not entirely sure if that is
actually<00:05:14.890> what<00:05:15.010> happened<00:05:15.310> but<00:05:15.730> we're<00:05:15.970> gonna
