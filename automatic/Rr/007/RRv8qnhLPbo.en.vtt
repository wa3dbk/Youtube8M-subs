00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:09.290
 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 I would be the slugger 31 the red ones 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.740
 we have the same number and we want 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.300
 but not with whole numbers 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.550
 but with with chrome or broken 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.930
 pay figures also say real numbers 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.840
 deal with this and gained comma 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.540
 put for example from 987 and so on 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.540
 continue or belong here behind the happy 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:52.739
 Courses set 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.570
 98 million so and now need what 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.699
 we somehow kind of agree 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.219
 data format or a number format 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.340
 consider how to set, so to speak 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.280
 like the dual number behind this 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:13.049
 regional number looks like 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.850
 Okay that's a question 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.590
 how to do that so you can do it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.299
 not just like that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.570
 dual convert the free 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.450
 because a dual payment system can not 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 neither signed nor broken numbers 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.220
 There is no one in the dual system 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.079
 no 11 01 or something yes that exists 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.110
 because not synonymous therefore must now 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.400
 how can they manage it ? 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.200
 be transformed that way and then said 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.610
 okay and live as easy where the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.810
 Sitting commerce has indeed so 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:52.320
 for example and now they are telling 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.490
 a year a bwm and say so you 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.150
 may count on such a maximum number 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.270
 and so on , he tells me with mine 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.870
 a balance of 10 million 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.210
 what interests me 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.720
 after-decimal the formula 1 nothing 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.220
 no number has and he said hermann 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.220
 that you get another stars then 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.800
 keep out business hall couple pose 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.420
 more of out more and less out 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.730
 so and then they tell 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:28.260
 the scientists yes you are allowed now 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:30.180
 until 89 89 90 something 1 computing said 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.530
 I think that's great with such a big one 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.520
 number but I have many or 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.710
 to do small numbers 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.600
 because it will create functions beyond 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.830
 as front so and we have nowadays 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.080
 universal bill 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 Anyone can use it as they wish 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.870
 there is, so to speak, the point of the comma 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.360
 or the point of the point ever 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.940
 after what is not defined 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.690
 that's why we say gleitkomma 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.370
 or equal score so the point the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.160
 place where ascom is located 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.110
 wants to detain and therefore says 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.120
 one that scorer point heads 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.120
 the place where you would like to have him
