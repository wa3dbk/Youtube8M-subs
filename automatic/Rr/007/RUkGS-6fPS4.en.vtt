00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello friend hello friend hello everyone and 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.289
 This is a maternity hospital, finally, yes, everyone asked 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.820
 right now and random and that does not mean 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.010
 I must first of all dofiga 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.689
 to say it means that we will today 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.850
 do 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 hot dog and crackers are not that very 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.750
 simple recipes but probably oral so 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.640
 what shall we do now we proceed 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.820
 need hot dog buns 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.910
 Sausages preferably smoked salad 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 leaf mayonnaise and ketchup and mustard 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.570
 naturally first we clean our 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.520
 sausage peel 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.559
 There are several types of buns for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.739
 hot dogs immediately cut and not 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.989
 cut well I cut cut 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.440
 sausages in buns for hotdogs after 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.930
 what we put our hot dogs in 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 microwave for 2 minutes we have better with 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.969
 warmed up thin and take out sausage 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.739
 we put salad under them further to us 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.689
 actually only mayonnaise and 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.080
 ketchup and mustard on the first ducks we 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.320
 spread mayonnaise and ketchup on 2 walker 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.869
 smear ketchup and mustard well and on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.009
 the last we can comfortably all at once mayo 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.780
 pretty ketchup and mustard 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.600
 a simple recipe well let's 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.390
 try we start with a hot dog which 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.689
 we did the first one that is this mayonnaise and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.689
 ketchup 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.000
 we can say it is delicious but oh well I 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.530
 don't do anything tasty in the random 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.619
 generally gorgeous let's try 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:48.030
 next year is a mustard oh such a crap in 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:51.149
 Mustard means, and this one is already here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.149
 such an expression of legs is convenient because 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.490
 what's normal dream hot dogs with 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.340
 normal hot dogs speak there 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.100
 must always be mustard and mix from 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.350
 which I hope I will not be ill later 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.710
 sit too pretty well 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.440
 from text 3 1 2 I like the most 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.790
 because here is the fusion of ketchup mayonnaise 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.060
 and this is mustard 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230
 yes yes in general it clearly burns but such taste 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.080
 specific 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.750
 but although that is exactly how a hot dog should 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.900
 we got chic hot dogs 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.190
 which can fact canopies i wanted 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.700
 say and what the price of such buns are 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.270
 four pieces 47 rubles is in my opinion it is 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.760
 for one piece about 12 rubles 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.709
 quite normal price I just don't know 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.810
 how much is the whole walker foot us 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.019
 turned out delicious and we see that there 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.220
 inside in general cool we did 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.870
 do create 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.940
 but we go do further crackers for 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 crackers we need rye bread 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.560
 3-4 slices of garlic and butter in my 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.100
 grape case you can take any 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.550
 other 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 take cut bread in any way well 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.670
 so that all the pieces are the same we 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.680
 spent about 500 grams of bread finely 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.930
 squeezed or chopped garlic we 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.730
 put in a separate container pour 2 there 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.130
 tablespoons of butter and all that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.230
 shuffle but if you want others 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.910
 tastes there are various smoking or something 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.850
 still you can take cubes gallina 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.489
 blanca them a lot of flavors and add 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.519
 them there but i don't want to do this our 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.590
 mix we add crackers there too 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.299
 add two more tablespoons of the masses 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.110
 All this is thoroughly mixed so that 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.420
 every bite 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.650
 soaked lay out our crackers on 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.519
 baking tray with parchment 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.459
 preheating oven about top 180 200 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.100
 degrees and put our crunches on five 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.850
 minutes approximately 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.610
 a down to do on the dune and crackers too 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.920
 ready it is also very simple and even 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.070
 probably now try delicious just 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.170
 masterfully we have the way gorgeous crackers 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.040
 They are different from the fact that 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.710
 the fact that they are natural that you yourself 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.820
 do u know cho yes how from those 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.860
 all mixed up well you understood why I 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.320
 and said earlier if you want for example 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.840
 what taste do you can take cubes 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.230
 gallina blanca or other soluble 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:28.160
 soups and add there when you cook 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:30.920
 crunches are not worth surgery for a while 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.170
 worth relying on what state 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.320
 has your cracker ie you don't need 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.690
 overcook them but follow this Kharkov 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.540
 we get quite a lot 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.390
 one rye bread is well, in my opinion 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.030
 rubles 18-17 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.460
 19 well shorter than twenty worth you 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.380
 get a lot a lot of crackers butter 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.380
 all there is garlic I also think the whole brush 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.600
 and so yes it is cool done farig 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.860

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.430

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.210
