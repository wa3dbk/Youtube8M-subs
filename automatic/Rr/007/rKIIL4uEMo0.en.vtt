00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.529
 what we have to do is get 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.240
 the Romanesque knuckles in what we come 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 doing right now is duplicating the no 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 we have to have two knuckles 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.460
 organic and the time bomb that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.820
 now they see that they got it 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.500
 this one is not used to choose 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.050
 looking for the pump the time to grab 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 the time bomb then directly 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.619
 look here they look like they come out they grab the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.029
 guama of the time to live they go 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.279
 directly to the bank to double your 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.619
 final clearly and they saw it in the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.350
 good title and what we have general 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 is to take all your money out of the bank bonds 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 what I already had to take out all the money 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.629
 here it will not take up to 20 thousand and of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.010
 short for because I have 71,000 and they put 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.370
 the time bomb where they hit the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.620
 win 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.559
 think money there and then with the media 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.210
 of fans hit you there they start like 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.910
 when they lend Andean it's not like that they know 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.850
 they start to take out everything that you 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.850
 have I had in 71,000 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.790
 and then doubled it doing thirty and 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.870
 thirty -something because they charge me 100 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.240
 points for each one provided 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.650
 good terms to put all the lord 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.210
 if they take their time and then like 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.220
 we will see what will happen x 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.250

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.380
 last we let it go a thousand and before 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.150
 grip receding time will have 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.640
 his seventy-something thousand and he will continue 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.550

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.610
 that is seventy-something thousand there is more 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.520

 we already have one hundred thirty and 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.030
 so many in your case will be different and 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.100
