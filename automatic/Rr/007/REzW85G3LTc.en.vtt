and underneath is this regular painters
tarp<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:35.390> mill<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:37.190> it's<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.520> think<00:02:37.760> it's<00:02:37.940> doable

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
tarp to mill so it's I think it's doable

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.949 
tarp to mill so it's I think it's doable
very<00:02:40.760> doable<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:43.550> dual<00:02:43.760> mid<00:02:44.030> under<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.630> seat

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
very doable the dual mid under the seat

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.930 
very doable the dual mid under the seat
of<00:02:45.050> Summit<00:02:45.350> as<00:02:45.860> you<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.190> see<00:02:46.370> my<00:02:46.640> feet<00:02:46.760> are

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940

barely touching the netting not that

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.010 
barely touching the netting not that
much<00:02:51.440> Headroom<00:02:51.680> so<00:02:52.300> once<00:02:53.300> again<00:02:53.420> it's<00:02:53.720> it's

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
much Headroom so once again it's it's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.050 
much Headroom so once again it's it's
livable<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:55.390> consider
