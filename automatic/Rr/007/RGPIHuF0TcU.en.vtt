00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.300
 Please, do not see ... 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 Only a boy caught between dreams and fantasies. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.200
 Please look at me.... 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.200
 Reaching someone who can see. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.400
 Take my hand and we'll see where we wake up tomorrow. 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.200
 The best of the plans sometimes is just a simple sleepless night. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 Damn it, cupid again asks for his arrow to be returned. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 So let's get drunk. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 In Our Own Tears ..... 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 !! God!! tell us the reason why boys waste their youth. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.300
 It's hunting season and the lambs are fleeing. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.900
 Looking for a meaning ... 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.500
 But we are all 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.300
 "LOST STARS" 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.400
 Trying to illuminate in the dark. 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 About us ? 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.700
 Only a trace of dust in the galaxy 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.300
 Oh! from my. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.700
 If we are not careful it will become reality ... 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.800
 Do not even think about it, make our best memories bring sadness. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.500
 pass the page maybe we find a new end 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 Where we are dancing in our tears. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 Y !! GOD! 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 Tell us the reason why boys waste their youth. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200
 It's hunting season and the lambs are fleeing. 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.200
 Looking for a meaning ... 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.200
 But we are all 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 "LOST STARS" 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.300
 Trying to illuminate in the dark. 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.300
 I thought I saw you outside crying. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 I thought I heard you mentioned my name. 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 and I think I hear you outside crying. 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.800
 Just the same. 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.800
 !! GOD! 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.800
 Tell us the reason why boys waste their youth. 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 It's hunting season and the lambs are fleeing. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800
 Looking for a meaning ... 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.400
 But we are all 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 "LOST STARS" 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400
 Trying to illuminate in the dark. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 We are "Lost Stars" 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.400
 Trying to illuminate in the dark.
