00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.340
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.920
 next of the league of legends 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.650
 beginner guide presented by sk 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 gaming and media my name is melli 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.730
 and in the last videos we have 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.610
 the middle and the eddy curry closer 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.210
 looked at and this time it is about the 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.640
 support 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.190
 the bright selection is here first 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.110
 line of the team composition and still 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.289
 more important of the interaction with the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.449
 lg carey off no other role can be too 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.030
 used so many different ways 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.640
 so we will be fresh about any 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.519
 via leona to cale and morgana 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.769
 a large part of the available 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.839
 champions as support can see the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.109
 already mentioned in the video before 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.960
 form lg carrie &amp; support 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:55.620
 traditionally a duo on the hotline 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.989
 while the eddy curry 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.739
 mainly in farms tries the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.809
 support him as much as possible 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.880
 on the ley this means concretely 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.680
 skillful positioning damage from 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 keep eddy curry away 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 if necessary at own expense and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 at the same time damage as much as possible 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 to cause the opposing hero 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.750
 from the outset to the weaker one 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 to bring the initial situation 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.289
 For beginners we recommend televising 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 champions, for example, name or 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.119
 Sona usually easier 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.920
 beyond that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.380
 have both names yes and son 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.570
 ali ability friends 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 heal and are a big one 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.740
 support in the lady also in the team 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.119
 fight 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.920
 sometimes the most important task for the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.929
 support player is the so-called 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.299
 vision control therefore the control 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:47.850
 about which parts of the map of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.859
 own team are visible and which 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.670
 parts viewed by the opposing team 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.579
 can be 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.409
 in the first 10 to 15 minutes is enough 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.869
 it if her and disposals the bot 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.999
 lane with eyes so with watts revealed 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.100
 and attack you so in front of enemies 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:03.929
 to protect 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.880
 about the further course of the game should 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.649
 you try important routes of the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.289
 opposing players and important ones 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.660
 objects on the map, for example, the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.210
 dragon or berisha under control 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.930
 to bring with your team one 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.430
 to gain strategic advantage 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.090
 it is here to distinguish between 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.610
 a migranten break 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.980
 only he himself is invisible about one 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.569
 period of three minutes near the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.349
 see over a certain radius 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.720
 Uncover nail shorts on the other 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.970
 Side are themselves not invisible 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.440
 no time limit of king 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 but also done that 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.489
 units such as champions 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.560
 sakes or normal watts on 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.780
 which kind of ward is to be used depends 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.330
 decisively holds by the opposing and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.190
 the playing situation in each case 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.290
 but you should the visual control as 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.329
 best of all, consider that 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.200
 game outcome to a considerable extent 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.780
 affected 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.760
 next to butt you should support each other 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.319
 So always with sufficient wards 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.239
 both the classic and the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.040
 magical stocking and her 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.269
 strategically important points on the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.000
 place card 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.129
 Apart from that, there are also helpful ones 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.150
 Immediately items like the engine are faithful 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.269
 the gold income is strengthening as well 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.530
 it is advisable to buy a time stone 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.840
 or 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.359
 keystone the four or five 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.720
 have charge and after each transition to 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.790
 is nexus Neupotz disposal 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.680
 for more information on the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.300
 suitable items should be here as well 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.120
 a look at the guides and aruba 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.890
 fireworks for next to the vision control 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.650
 can play immediately in the later 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.230
 course of the game for you too 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.360
 be responsible to your teams 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.810
 Of course this depends on the type of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.090
 champions and the team composition 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.260
 the names and so close or even annie and 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.550
 leona can 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.120
 her face 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.200
 start fighting abruptly as well 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.240
 if the support is not to the 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.220
 heard is most popular roles in the game 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.020
 she still worth gold for a good one 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.700
 support can also believed lost 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.560
 play for a better turn 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.510
 it's best to try it yourself 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.510
 again until next time
