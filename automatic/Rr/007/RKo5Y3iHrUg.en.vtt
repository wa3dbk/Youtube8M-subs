00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.620
 hi girls then today the new one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.809
 appointment with the double cliffs 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.580
 conomici of the most expensive products and between 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 the other I believe I have never had 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.070
 so many de let you see start with the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.020
 first than if you remember 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.750
 he had already mentioned to me that I had the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 doubt that this enamel has me 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 sent oreal was very very similar 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.869
 to another chanel enamel 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.320
 actually when I returned home 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.270
 because in Italy I checked how 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 I had promised and indeed I am 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.860
 really just that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 swarm is naturally more expensive 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.610
 of the eye so surely if you 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.969
 like black this color in short 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.489
 very famous green chanel with this base 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.620
 I certainly liked school 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.469
 also the oreal because they are the same 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.300
 among other things, if I'm not mistaken the black was 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.160
 in limited edition it is still found from 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.409
 somewhere but hard to find 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
 and it is very expensive while the real one 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.720
 precisely because it is just released e 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.119
 it costs a lot much less then a ho 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 found the gup of this lipstick of the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 to face these these are the lipsticks of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.909
 which I told you about in the video on 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.030
 favorite I really like because 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.759
 although they are translucent they are very 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 very pigmented that this lipstick is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.770
 virtually identical to another of the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 that is making a mess beyond the new m 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.740
 york which is precisely this cherry color 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 dark this plum color also this is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.079
 very much like so much that even from the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.650
 I find it hard to distinguish them mi 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.870
 they seem 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.940
 this too is really identical 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.980
 maybelline cost much less than 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.720
 the one to face so if you are interested if 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.670
 you like this color 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 in short, you know how to do it if you want 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.440
 save I also found double 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.540
 perfect king of weylandt lear lipstick 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.910
 red mac this had come out with the 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 retro matt collection so these are the ones 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.130
 dull lipsticks that drive me crazy and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.860
 among other things, there are must-haves too 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.470
 because I bought this lipstick from 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 flic that I realized only 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.860
 subsequently that is identical identical 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.770
 to mac lipstick 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.959
 both have these coloring I don't 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.910
 I know I would call them watermelon 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.920
 the beauty is that not only the coloring is 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.110
 identical but also the finish because 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.980
 precisely even that of the slick is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 completely matt and therefore in short 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 I really don't need to tell you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.900
 I believe because also that of flic 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.230
 I think it costs less than half the amount 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.580
 to that mac so in short, yes you are 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.230
 I definitely recommend it also because 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.610
 those clicks 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.140
 they are very good as non formulation 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.870
 the degrees do not dry out too much so me 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.940
 like them is yes this discovery I have to say 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.560
 touched me a little because altobello not 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.970
 I would have taken that flick of not having 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.390
 took the name taken from before 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.760
 sincerely yes, in short, they are the same 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.440
 I was trying in vain to settle down 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.870
 hair that today has its own life e 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.570
 really, however, it was then I have 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.420
 found the perfect economic duplication 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.250
 of this enamel is the sky color 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.930
 colored typhoons that enamel pupa that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.670
 see them this way though the mini size though 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.120
 take the full size one 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.070
 the price is practically more than double 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.500
 compared to the puppet one then vi 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.019
 I agree, I love this 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.030
 color maybe that pupa turns a little bit 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.560
 more towards the green while 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.810
 more than I showed not really 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.490
 identical this away a little more 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.750
 towards the green, however, I guarantee you that 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.209
 once laid on the nails 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.430
 practically the impossible difference 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.170
 to see is among other things a very color 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.540
 very nice that i like a lot for 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.220
 the warm season so I recommend it 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.080
 in any case, because it really is 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.940
 very very good resources for many 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.920
 congratulations wearing this color ho 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.290
 also tried the economic twin of 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.300
 this gloss food chic is one of mine 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.870
 glossy so favorite because a 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.209
 beautiful color news has some 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.150
 fishing undertone and then to these micro 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.160
 silver glitter as you know not 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.950
 I like neither glitter on the lips but 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.470
 when they are so soft they give just a little bit 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.720
 I like very much of shine e 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.540
 I found this liquid lipstick 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.560
 the oreal which is really very much 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.010
 similar 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.890
 I don't mean identical though 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.870
 really the difference is very much 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.250
 very difficult to see 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:44.130
 and the beauty is that both have these 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.919
 micro glitter that just makes them 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:51.540
 even more similar and therefore also short 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:53.550
 here the price is very very different between 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.860
 these two products and in the end the 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.810
 result is super super super similar 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.090
 really maybe that oreal is a 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.340
 even darker on the lips there is 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.680
 the difference is noted 0 also found a 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.419
 new economic duke that nail polish down 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.880
 a chanel and this beautiful color 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.130
 fishing news perfect for spring 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.110
 found this enamel for long dial up 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.610
 among other things , their economic line though 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.500
 I 'm not wrong this guy 2 euros this 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.360
 enamel while that chanel and coast 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.520
 bailey of two 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.900
 the color is really the same 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.030
 is that even the coverage is really 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.740
 identical is the result is identical 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:31.169
 so I definitely recommend this 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.419
 laila enamel because precisely this much 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.920
 very much much less than that 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:39.250
 chanel is the color 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.530
 it's really the same as last god for today i have 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.590
 tried the twin of this lipstick 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.170
 clarin that would be and is very much 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.300
 cheap this lipstick derby these 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.100
 I would say that similarity occurs 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.170
 they look like 90 percent because 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.450
 what makes it a little more wine 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.310
 a little more red undertone 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.800
 while the derby one undertone a 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.230
 a little more purple however the result is 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.030
 very much the finish is very similar 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.010
 the opacity are also very similar 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.080
 glossy and have an average opacity 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.800
 both so heartfelt are the neighbors who 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.830
 he is doing work so yes definitely 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.560
 that derby costs a quarter 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.090
 compared to what the renn are beautiful 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.820
 I must both tell the truth though 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.410
 precisely if you want to save 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.270
 surely you find a very document 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.920
 valid in this lipstick know the beat 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.740
 among other things, it didn't come out long ago 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.170
 so you will still find creed and nothing 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.140
 girls this is all I send you for today 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:37.350
 a kiss to great stimuli and us there 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.350

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.350
 Hello
