00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
have to make it because it is quite

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.439 
have to make it because it is quite
extensive<00:04:18.239> circuit<00:04:18.900> but<00:04:19.709> it<00:04:19.829> can<00:04:19.979> be<00:04:20.160> done<00:04:20.449> all

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449
