00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey guys Larry from the electric I

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.039 
hey guys Larry from the electric I
wanted<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.449> new<00:00:03.570> fixture<00:00:03.840> we're

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
wanted to show you a new fixture we're

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.630 
wanted to show you a new fixture we're
putting<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.470> our<00:00:04.560> customer<00:00:04.980> let's<00:00:05.130> say

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
putting in for our customer let's say

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.270 
putting in for our customer let's say
induction<00:00:06.299> bolt<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.410> stand<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.680> 250

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
induction bolt and this is stand of 250

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.830 
induction bolt and this is stand of 250
watt<00:00:08.429> metal<00:00:08.639> halide<00:00:08.820> which<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.240> just<00:00:09.480> warming

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
watt metal halide which is just warming

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.030 
watt metal halide which is just warming
up<00:00:10.280> your<00:00:11.280> strength<00:00:11.580> time<00:00:11.790> here<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.210> about<00:00:13.040> its

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
up your strength time here is about its

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.550 
up your strength time here is about its
instantaneous<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> warms<00:00:16.109> up<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.410> about

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
instantaneous but it warms up in about

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.450 
instantaneous but it warms up in about
30<00:00:16.740> seconds

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
30 seconds

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.680 
30 seconds
so<00:00:17.640> you<00:00:17.730> basically<00:00:17.970> got<00:00:18.150> instant<00:00:18.539> light

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so you basically got instant light

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.679 
so you basically got instant light

here again there's a 250 watt metal
halide<00:00:43.320> bowl<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> gas<00:00:45.600> inside<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
halide bowl and it's that gas inside the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.950 
halide bowl and it's that gas inside the
arc<00:00:46.410> tube<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> takes<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.430> while<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.710 

they<00:00:50.260> have<00:00:50.440> big<00:00:50.680> bulky<00:00:51.070> ballast<00:00:51.490> in<00:00:51.700> them<00:00:51.820> they

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
they have big bulky ballast in them they

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.300 
they have big bulky ballast in them they
were<00:00:52.780> basically<00:00:53.170> you<00:00:53.590> know<00:00:53.680> not<00:00:53.890> too<00:00:54.040> fun<00:00:54.280> to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
were basically you know not too fun to

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.940 
were basically you know not too fun to
work<00:00:54.520> on<00:00:54.760> pretty<00:00:55.390> easy<00:00:55.660> but<00:00:55.930> I<00:00:56.200> thought<00:00:56.740> some

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
work on pretty easy but I thought some

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.070 
work on pretty easy but I thought some
challenges<00:00:57.430> telling<00:00:57.730> when<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.480> agent<00:00:58.810> IV

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
challenges telling when the agent IV

challenges telling when the agent IV
lighting<00:00:59.380> here<00:00:59.530> is<00:00:59.560> very<00:00:59.830> simple<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.280> drop

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
lighting here is very simple you drop

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.940 
lighting here is very simple you drop
this<00:01:00.760> it's<00:01:01.660> covered<00:01:01.990> down<00:01:02.140> it's<00:01:02.620> got<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.770> little

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
this it's covered down it's got a little

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.700 
this it's covered down it's got a little
tiny<00:01:03.420> ballast<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.570> here<00:01:04.720> electronic<00:01:05.290> and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
tiny ballast in here electronic and

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.500 
tiny ballast in here electronic and
that's<00:01:06.160> about<00:01:06.340> all<00:01:06.580> there<00:01:06.730> is<00:01:06.790> to<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.390> then

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
that's about all there is to it and then

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.540 
that's about all there is to it and then
obviously<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:07.930> bulbs<00:01:08.380> what<00:01:09.040> happens<00:01:09.400> here

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
obviously the bulbs what happens here

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.860 
obviously the bulbs what happens here
there's<00:01:09.760> some<00:01:09.880> two<00:01:10.030> little<00:01:10.300> gray<00:01:10.480> arms

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
there's some two little gray arms

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.270 
there's some two little gray arms
there's<00:01:11.050> one<00:01:11.230> there<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.680> one<00:01:11.740> there

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
there's one there and one there

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.660 
there's one there and one there
creates<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:12.970> magnetic<00:01:13.120> field<00:01:13.420> which<00:01:14.550> juice<00:01:15.550> is

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
creates a magnetic field which juice is

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.070 
creates a magnetic field which juice is
counting<00:01:16.000> through<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.240> light<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.870> it's<00:01:16.990> the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
counting through the light so it's the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.110 
counting through the light so it's the
electrons<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.800> everything<00:01:18.700> gets<00:01:18.850> nice<00:01:19.090> and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
electrons and everything gets nice and

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.020 
electrons and everything gets nice and
bright<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:20.100> hundred<00:01:21.100> thousand<00:01:21.400> our<00:01:21.520> lifespan

have<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.150> come<00:01:46.300> out<00:01:46.450> here<00:01:46.650> you<00:01:47.650> know<00:01:47.740> to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
have to come out here you know to

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.470 
have to come out here you know to
service<00:01:48.400> all<00:01:48.520> these<00:01:48.670> lights<00:01:48.880> all<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.120> time<00:01:49.300> so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
service all these lights all the time so

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.830 
service all these lights all the time so
for<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.690> customer<00:01:50.140> it's<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.950> great<00:01:51.190> investment

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
for the customer it's a great investment

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.670 
for the customer it's a great investment
so<00:01:52.840> I'm<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.050> talking<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.380> little<00:01:53.470> bit<00:01:53.620> on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
so I'm just talking to a little bit on

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.320 
so I'm just talking to a little bit on
HID<00:01:54.010> lighting<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.610> noon<00:01:54.850> a<00:01:54.970> Chinese

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
HID lighting this noon a Chinese

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.490 
HID lighting this noon a Chinese
lighting<00:01:55.660> fixture<00:01:55.960> we're<00:01:56.110> putting<00:01:56.350> in

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
lighting fixture we're putting in

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.260 
lighting fixture we're putting in
hopefully<00:01:57.250> we're<00:01:57.520> going<00:01:57.610> to<00:01:57.670> do<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.940> rest<00:01:58.090> up

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
hopefully we're going to do the rest up

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.700 
hopefully we're going to do the rest up
here<00:01:58.300> there's<00:01:58.630> 20<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:58.930> them<00:01:59.110> all<00:01:59.200> together<00:01:59.320> and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
here there's 20 of them all together and

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.890 
here there's 20 of them all together and
we<00:02:00.610> put<00:02:00.790> one<00:02:00.910> in<00:02:01.030> here<00:02:01.150> for<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.390> board<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.750> see

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
we put one in here for the board and see

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.990 
we put one in here for the board and see
if<00:02:01.960> they<00:02:02.050> like<00:02:02.230> it<00:02:02.290> and<00:02:02.670> hopefully<00:02:03.670> they<00:02:03.790> look

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
if they like it and hopefully they look

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.640 
if they like it and hopefully they look
it's<00:02:04.360> going<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.540> save<00:02:04.660> 100<00:02:04.990> watts<00:02:05.140> per<00:02:05.350> fixture

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
it's going to save 100 watts per fixture

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.950 
it's going to save 100 watts per fixture
and<00:02:05.920> again<00:02:06.580> it's<00:02:06.730> three<00:02:07.210> times<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.630> lifespan

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
and again it's three times the lifespan

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.839 
and again it's three times the lifespan
of<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.290> regular<00:02:08.970> 250<00:02:09.970> watt<00:02:10.119> metal<00:02:10.300> halide

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of a regular 250 watt metal halide

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.239 
of a regular 250 watt metal halide
and<00:02:12.209> its<00:02:12.510> nominal<00:02:12.930> voltage<00:02:13.349> -<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:13.859> this<00:02:14.040> thing

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:14.249 
and its nominal voltage - so this thing

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.119 
and its nominal voltage - so this thing
can<00:02:14.400> go<00:02:14.549> from<00:02:14.730> 120<00:02:15.329> to<00:02:15.359> 277<00:02:15.920> these<00:02:16.920> lights

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
can go from 120 to 277 these lights

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.229 
can go from 120 to 277 these lights
currently<00:02:17.579> have<00:02:17.730> our<00:02:18.319> 277<00:02:19.319> volt<00:02:19.560> hookup<00:02:20.400> but

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
currently have our 277 volt hookup but

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.729 
currently have our 277 volt hookup but
you<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.629> you<00:02:21.689> just<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:22.079> three<00:02:22.319> wires<00:02:22.499> a

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
you know you just have three wires a

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.369 
you know you just have three wires a
black<00:02:23.040> white<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.519> green<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.049> the<00:02:25.049> balance

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
black white and green and the balance

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.539 
black white and green and the balance
will<00:02:25.469> take<00:02:25.620> whatever<00:02:25.889> voltage<00:02:26.069> you<00:02:26.189> give<00:02:26.400> to

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
will take whatever voltage you give to

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.110 
will take whatever voltage you give to
it<00:02:26.579> up<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.849> 277<00:02:27.450> volts<00:02:28.310> okay<00:02:29.310> guys<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.030> a

versus a new induction bulb lighting and
again<00:02:54.359> new<00:02:54.540> induction<00:02:54.989> bulb<00:02:55.199> it's<00:02:55.379> probably

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
again new induction bulb it's probably

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.550 
again new induction bulb it's probably
one<00:02:55.859> step<00:02:56.129> below<00:02:56.310> LED<00:02:56.900> this<00:02:57.900> fixture<00:02:58.230> here<00:02:58.439> is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
one step below LED this fixture here is

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.539 
one step below LED this fixture here is
about<00:02:58.739> six<00:02:58.980> hundred<00:02:59.040> bucks

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
about six hundred bucks

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.119 
about six hundred bucks
we<00:03:00.000> brought<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.329> whole<00:03:00.480> fixture<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.980> didn't

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
we brought the whole fixture we didn't

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.920 
we brought the whole fixture we didn't
retrofit<00:03:02.639> any<00:03:02.790> fixes<00:03:03.209> because<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.599> needs<00:03:03.780> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
retrofit any fixes because it needs a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.050 
retrofit any fixes because it needs a
bolt<00:03:04.169> pretty<00:03:04.469> big<00:03:04.680> verses<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.579> folks<00:03:05.849> and

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
bolt pretty big verses that folks and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.059 
bolt pretty big verses that folks and
couldn't<00:03:06.359> we<00:03:06.419> retrofit<00:03:06.930> anything<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.829> they

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
couldn't we retrofit anything so they

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.309 
couldn't we retrofit anything so they
just<00:03:08.280> bought<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.549> whole<00:03:08.669> picture<00:03:08.909> I<00:03:09.659> changed

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
just bought the whole picture I changed

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.050 
just bought the whole picture I changed
it<00:03:10.439> for<00:03:10.620> building<00:03:10.799> them<00:03:11.129> alright<00:03:11.730> thanks<00:03:12.030> for

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it for building them alright thanks for

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.389 
it for building them alright thanks for
watching
