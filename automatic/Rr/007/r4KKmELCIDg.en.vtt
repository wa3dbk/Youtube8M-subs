00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
this thing dies which egg is acceptable

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.300 
this thing dies which egg is acceptable
I<00:04:39.409> can<00:04:39.889> handle<00:04:40.099> that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.900 

why<00:04:43.820> not

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:16.879 
worm pump
I<00:04:59.710> guess<00:05:00.639> we'll<00:05:00.820> call<00:05:01.030> it

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.059 

let's<00:05:17.759> hope<00:05:17.939> he<00:05:18.060> isn't<00:05:18.180> drawn<00:05:18.509> anything

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
let's hope he isn't drawn anything

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.350 
let's hope he isn't drawn anything
 back-breaking<00:05:20.610> in<00:05:20.939> the<00:05:21.000> next<00:05:21.240> like

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
 back-breaking in the next like

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.600 
 back-breaking in the next like
three<00:05:21.389> or<00:05:21.659> four<00:05:21.689> turns<00:05:22.139> last<00:05:23.039> three<00:05:23.400> or<00:05:23.490> four

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
three or four turns last three or four

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:35.720 
three or four turns last three or four
times<00:05:23.789> right<00:05:24.120> Arcana<00:05:25.280> sure

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.210 

so<00:05:36.270> if<00:05:36.360> I<00:05:36.420> take<00:05:36.540> nine<00:05:36.840> I<00:05:36.870> go<00:05:37.140> to<00:05:37.200> nine<00:05:37.470> take<00:05:38.070> him

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
so if I take nine I go to nine take him

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.709 
so if I take nine I go to nine take him
just<00:05:38.400> Gillian<00:05:39.120> me

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.829 

and<00:05:43.169> I<00:05:44.099> mean<00:05:44.429> you<00:05:44.489> can't<00:05:44.699> risk<00:05:45.119> anything<00:05:45.449> else

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
and I mean you can't risk anything else

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.979 
and I mean you can't risk anything else
to<00:05:46.799> kill<00:05:47.039> it<00:05:47.189> other<00:05:47.339> than<00:05:47.549> my<00:05:47.729> companion<00:05:48.269> so

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:48.989 
to kill it other than my companion so

00:05:48.989 --> 00:06:11.790 
to kill it other than my companion so
why<00:05:49.110> not<00:05:49.229> just<00:05:49.349> block

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.920

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
so Sylvan Ranger and I don't think he

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.510 
so Sylvan Ranger and I don't think he
played<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.110> land<00:06:15.350> so<00:06:15.560> we<00:06:15.650> can<00:06:15.800> play<00:06:15.950> a<00:06:15.980> land<00:06:16.280> and

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
then one of his irrelevant guys then I

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.760 
then one of his irrelevant guys then I
can<00:06:19.610> kill<00:06:19.790> him<00:06:19.910> with<00:06:20.120> an<00:06:20.810> overwhelming

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
can kill him with an overwhelming

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:30.870 
can kill him with an overwhelming
stampede

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880
