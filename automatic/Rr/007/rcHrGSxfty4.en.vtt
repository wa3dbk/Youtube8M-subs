00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 . 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.130
 boiky 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.779
 not 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.760
 Hello everyone, as you already understood today 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.769
 I will show you my image on the first 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 September and certainly my first day 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.449
 school starts with waking up 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.929
 I get up and stomp in the shower in the shower and also 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.960
 after the shower i use these tools here 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:09.960
 Let's probably start with makeup and before 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.990
 meet me sleepy swollen and generally 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.479
 some kind of incomprehensible let's try 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.039
 fix it the first thing i do is 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.990
 Of course I cover all my own 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.990
 imperfections with its redness 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.400
 it's not all you need a little bit more 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.770
 cover the pimple and also visit the area 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.300
 under the eyes to look fresher 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.310
 and rested by the way concealer under 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.140
 eyes and brush with a brush 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
 that at the same time and shading was 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.860
 maximum and at the same time it 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.060
 at least somehow more or less normal 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.060
 covered my dark circles 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.660
 switch to eyebrows and as i have 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.670
 I spoke very stylish they are not isolated, I 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.340
 just a little darkening them with shadows and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.410
 also continue a little and then attach 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.480
 them form and remove all the excess with 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.460
 ordinary wet wipes and yes i am 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 I frown because it is more convenient to customize 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.480
 them under the desired shape 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.960
 turn an eye and as I said 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.600
 instead of primer i use ordinary 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.060
 concealer and this is the same concealer from re won 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.640
 I take peach shadows which are very 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.880
 look like a shade of my skin and put them on 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.770
 on all eyelid then I take light beige 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.580
 dull shadows and put them in the middle 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.280
 century 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.860
 I shade a little then I take 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.930
 brown shadows and put them on the fold of the century 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:45.990
 to create a very beautiful shadow and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.880
 the transition is the same shade in a small 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.300
 the amount I put on the bottom growth line 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.300
 eyelashes 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.260
 that's what we already get and of course 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.260
 eyelashes must also be covered with mascara 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.189
 we 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.989
 and by the way I do not show the painting process 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.879
 eyelashes to simple take away from you 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.569
 time because everyone seems to know how 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.569
 dye eyelashes 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.760
 and the final touch in this makeup is 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.890
 adding white shimmer shadows to 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.770
 corner of the eye and also by the middle of the century 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.220
 it complements the image very well and i 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.930
 just adore using this trick on 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.790
 lips by the way I decided not to apply anything 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.490
 and this is how it looks 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.560
 completed makeup makeup is very simple 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.440
 neutral but at the same time it looks 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.600
 interestingly enough and on September 1st to 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.600
 my opinion is just perfect 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.430
 now about the hairstyle actually on 1 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.499
 September I was planning to curl my hair but 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.150
 show you this on video unfortunately not 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.249
 could because i don't have mine yet 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.989
 I mean there is no curling 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:07.120
 in one of the videos you've still seen 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:08.859
 how does my curled hair look also 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.840
 Of course I was considering options with 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.609
 straight hair but she is first day 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.500
 school for some reason I want to look more 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.609
 less elegant therefore i am more inclined 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.609
 colonists vlas 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.150
 and finally outfit my outfits 1 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.460
 September will consist of this one here 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.060
 black leather skirt from black semi 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.250
 boots 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.639
 oxford from this very cute in my 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:39.000
 view of a white T-shirt well and on top 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.169
 I will definitely wear a black cardigan 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.169
 I decided to add two bracelets 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.090
 if you're wondering where does this or that 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.250
 the thing is that all the information is always down in 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.620
 description there are generally many interesting and 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.630
 just by the way there will be music that I 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.160
 used in this video so i tell you 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.160
 I advise you to go there 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.960
 also take me a backpack which I 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.960
 showed the video in my backpack 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.220
 Generally it is mind if September 1 will be 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.920
 it's too cold for this outfit 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.480
 add a jacket but for now i'm still 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.460
 stopped at this option outfit and 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.770
 In principle, this is my whole image 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:31.710
 in 1 case, the school does not know about you but personally 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.870
 I really like this combination this 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.580

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.040
