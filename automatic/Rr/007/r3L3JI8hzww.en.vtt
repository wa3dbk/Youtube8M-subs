00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.050
 beautiful to all the guys here palace e 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.950
 I'm here with my first video x me 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.930
 i enjoy eve i propose you a nice mob in 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.320
 drink even if I know you have some 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.730
 let's say the balls full of moabs before 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.939
 talk to you a moment about the game you want 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.079
 a moment you talked about a great present 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.689
 and my name is enzo I am from Milan and I am 17 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:32.320
 years and let's say they are more or less 1 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.840
 emerging youtube even if they are in the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 world of youtube from more than a year e 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.580
 so I know a little about video is everything 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.550
 let's say I started a 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:46.840
 interested in video videos that 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.720
 you have to make videos when a friend of mine gets me 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.170
 he said he did some tutorials 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.910
 on how to download games or well from 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.850
 Start following some videos 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.910
 I ended up editing exor i 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.010
 ex fittings I have known stat 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.260
 known johnny outdated strategy 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.710
 then from the beginning until when 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.130
 four months ago I bought the hd pvr 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:14.110
 obviously my priority is not to make a 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.530
 nice comment because having a little bit of it 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.750
 dull 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.960
 let's say that not everything is understood 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.990
 what sometimes jump apple is more than that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.510
 another does is a good score or they had 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.450
 a moment of this game was 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.450
 made on the terminal in the last hands 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.880
 map new relatives 77 two months ago and it is 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.250
 it was my first my second 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.820
 second game after two months than not 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.850
 I played and then started with a beautiful one 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.400
 mob especially on the launch area 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.530
 I really enjoyed it then 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.290
 because in this game it is used 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.100
 sleight of hand because even if not 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.170
 drag the bar takes two years 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.650
 and I used sleight of hand or not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.210
 jackals because as you know the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.759
 budget being the most sniper 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.710
 powerful one shot to kill him and 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.450
 therefore all the loaders are enough e 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.619
 advance 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.530
 so if it also puts on load 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.170
 tormented white in place and station 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.670
 quick and then it's not enough for me to have man 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.630
 marksman chosen as a marksman 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.190
 precisely because I tell you something that 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.340
 however you already know 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.310
 and best used three chosen because 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.880
 already being at the bar and a sniper is already 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.780
 stay with her more if you put yourself on 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.850
 on this weapon is in the ass speed and already 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.819
 stable so if my stable sardines 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.400
 almost useless as a sense of grave therefore 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.480
 shooter picked your enemies more 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.069
 when they conquer the launch zone of 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.470
 I usually always throw smoke today and then 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.959
 with stable way in the texts like the others 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.480
 but with marksman chosen island tests 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.049
 only sago mines and named them then 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.870
 then massacre this well 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.620
 here was made this fashion was 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.989
 made on the road far away party was 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.290
 made on the launch area which I think is 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.940
 the mode from an easier part but 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.340
 even from the most difficult high for fans a 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.079
 fashions and honestly I found myself in 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.019
 to do it also because I didn't want to 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:24.400
 initially do it then we start from 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:26.170
 then give an account of this match first 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.890
 I must say that this game I have 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.880
 finished making a 40 41 then strange 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.850
 and after two months doing a 4 1 dh quantum 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.250
 very good then this game 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.670
 in my opinion we start from them 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.660
 poor 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.570
 then I am two according to me one is that i 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.670
 your enemies don't mind the deaths 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.890
 who are like a domain 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.980
 being maybe you strong can 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.380
 kill 18 10 times you do it myself 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.150
 semi cd 1 10 times I leave the game 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.950
 instead here they know that anyway if mono 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.440
 many times they have the possibility of 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.410
 find a spy on the launch area 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.450
 c 130 and abel gen and therefore it is possible yes 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.590
 could do it again 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:15.219
 and another another positive thing is the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.859
 made of having strong companions having 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:20.650
 strong and conquering companions 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.110
 much the fuji sewed the throwing area 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.900
 i can find wolf and having web ti 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.070
 lets you focus on the whole 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.780
 map where the enemies are 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.090
 we pass to the files to the negative factors 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.800
 negative factors 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.479
 I think there is only one difficulty 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.430
 having no bonus whatsoever 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.410
 let's say mob fauna on john 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.060
 it's not very easy 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.039
 I give you an example to me v2 is 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.050
 quite a little girl make love 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:55.539
 because if he had 7 campers he went launching 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.780
 your beautiful air strike and ended rita 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.789
 which then takes a moment to take it 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.740
 while here it is much more difficult 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.320
 having no rewards and just certain 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.080
 false self-esteem a mabel gene number 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.020
 not even do it initially I'm there 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.580
 rediscovered 20 in a row and then ho 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.520
 said why we do not continue and I am 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:20.139
 was very close to making a high that 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:24.480
 but unfortunately I didn't make it 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:30.060
 so guys I have to say that 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:33.210
 if you want you can comment below if 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.140
 you want more mobs if you want more videos 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.940
 I do not know 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.590
 I wanted to thank the staff of me there 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.390

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.610

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:46.920

 million billion subscribers 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.330

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.720
 guys don't let this grow 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.010
 community that is always a little more 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.410
 getting worse 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.360
