 Painting device AS-310 Max Super Sprayer 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 AS-310 Max Super Sprayer - professional painting equipment 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 whose specifications allow you to perform 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 a wide range of tasks associated with the application 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 paintwork materials on all types of surfaces. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 The unit is widely used both in civil engineering and in industry. The design features of the AS-310 belong to the category of painting equipment, the main working body of which is a diaphragm-type pump. Such pumps are operated by means of a pneumatic actuator, which sets the plastic membrane in motion (flexion / extension). Paint material is taken from any container. Passing through the pump, the fluid is ejected under high pressure into the hose and rushes along it to the spray gun. In the latter, a nozzle is installed, spraying paintwork material on uniform microscopic particles. Due to the possibility of creating a pressure of 250 bar in the pump chamber, the AS-310 is capable of delivering fluid through a hose up to a distance of 45 meters. Additional convenience for work is also provided by the chamber wheels on which the unit is installed. Application areas AS-310 works with a wide range of paints, which also includes: Paints and varnishes; Putty and primer; Epoxy and alkyd compounds; Anticorrosion and other liquids of high viscosity. Thus, AS-310 can be used to solve any painting tasks. Whether it is finishing the walls or facades of buildings, painting metal, plastic or wood products - the unit shows a high level of performance and quality of work, regardless of the purpose of its use. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 The unit is widely used, as in civil engineering, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 so in industry. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Design features 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 the painting device AS-310 belongs to the category painting 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 vehicles, the main working body of which is 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 diaphragm-type pump. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 These pumps work with a pneumatic drive, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 setting the plastic membrane in motion (flexion / extension). 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Paint material is taken from any container. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 Passing through the pump, the fluid is ejected under high pressure into the hose and 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 rushes him to the spray gun. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 In the last set nozzle, spray paintwork material. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 on uniform microscopic particles. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Thanks to the possibility of creating a pressure of 250 bar in the pump chamber, AS-310 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 able to deliver fluid through a hose up to a distance of 45 meters. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Additional convenience for work also provide 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 tube wheels on which the unit is mounted. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Areas of use 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 AS-310 works with a wide range of paints and varnishes. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 which also include: 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Paints and varnishes, 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 Putty and primer; 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Epoxy and alkyd compounds; 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 Anticorrosion and other liquids of high viscosity. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Thus, AS-310 can be used 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 for the decision of any painting tasks. Be it finish 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 decoration of walls or facades of buildings, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 painting metal, plastic or wood - 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 the unit shows a high level of performance and 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 quality of work, regardless of the purpose of its use.
