00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
in a second some of these levels were

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.290 
in a second some of these levels were
very<00:00:54.890> challenging<00:00:55.489> i<00:00:55.609> had<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.820> repeat<00:00:56.089> them<00:00:56.239> a

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
very challenging i had to repeat them a

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.619 
very challenging i had to repeat them a
couple<00:00:56.480> times<00:00:56.600> some<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.589> them<00:00:57.679> very<00:00:58.039> easy<00:00:58.629> let

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
couple times some of them very easy let

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.180 
couple times some of them very easy let
me<00:00:59.719> know<00:00:59.839> if<00:00:59.960> you<00:01:00.109> want<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.410> see<00:01:00.589> a<00:01:00.620> specific

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
me know if you want to see a specific

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.220 
me know if you want to see a specific
level<00:01:01.760> i<00:01:02.089> can<00:01:02.359> definitely<00:01:02.480> make<00:01:02.960> another

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
level i can definitely make another

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.990 
level i can definitely make another
video<00:01:03.580> here<00:01:04.580> is<00:01:04.790> an<00:01:06.040> example<00:01:07.040> i<00:01:07.520> guess<00:01:07.730> on<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
video here is an example i guess on the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.850 
video here is an example i guess on the
level<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:08.690> i'm<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.020> show<00:01:09.200> you<00:01:09.230> that<00:01:09.620> i

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
level that i'm going to show you that i

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.350 
level that i'm going to show you that i
found<00:01:10.159> challenging<00:01:10.430> i<00:01:10.760> have<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.030> redo<00:01:11.240> it<00:01:11.270> a

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
found challenging i have to redo it a

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.390 
found challenging i have to redo it a
couple<00:01:11.540> times<00:01:11.710> basically<00:01:12.710> have<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.950> defend<00:01:13.220> a

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
couple times basically have to defend a

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.880 
couple times basically have to defend a
factory<00:01:14.000> here<00:01:14.030> you've<00:01:14.840> got<00:01:15.079> your<00:01:15.229> platoon<00:01:15.740> of

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
factory here you've got your platoon of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.330 
factory here you've got your platoon of
guys<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.549> you're<00:01:17.560> basically<00:01:18.560> parachuting<00:01:19.220> in

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
guys and you're basically parachuting in

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.280 
guys and you're basically parachuting in
as<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.610> can<00:01:19.759> see<00:01:19.909> right<00:01:19.939> there<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.140> can

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
as you can see right there and you can

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.990 
as you can see right there and you can
assume<00:01:21.560> different<00:01:21.770> characters<00:01:22.490> obviously

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
assume different characters obviously

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.969 
assume different characters obviously
can<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:23.720> switch<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.200> between<00:01:24.229> different

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
can you can switch in between different

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.639 
can you can switch in between different
members<00:01:25.310> of<00:01:25.340> your<00:01:25.579> team<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.780> that<00:01:27.200> protect

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
members of your team and that protect

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.800 
members of your team and that protect
defend<00:01:28.219> the<00:01:28.310> different<00:01:28.640> installations<00:01:29.299> that

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
defend the different installations that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.690 
defend the different installations that
are<00:01:29.990> in<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:30.469> factory<00:01:31.040> that's<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.399> bottom

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
are in this factory that's the bottom

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.590 
are in this factory that's the bottom
line<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:32.540> I'll<00:01:33.320> let<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.649> video<00:01:33.770> basically

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
line so I'll let the video basically

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.090 
line so I'll let the video basically
explain<00:01:35.600> itself<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.290> I'll<00:01:36.409> be<00:01:36.590> quiet<00:01:36.860> for<00:01:37.040> a

again there are the frames per second I

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.649 
again there are the frames per second I
listed<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.460> in<00:01:43.610> orange<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.180> minimum<00:01:44.509> average

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
listed it in orange the minimum average
