 actually no matter what I'm wearing 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.429
 as long as it can how about like this guy 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.140
 our the first question has a point 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.960
 staff that the elbows 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.750
 so I will reinforce that now she has to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.090
 know an elbow now the pole to and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.960
 my brother's clothes always matched 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.940
 without great learning on his knees 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.070
 Star Wars came to me that had to be there 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.870
 More precisely are even better 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 used all the filter and her clique 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.899
 everywhere in the hobby shop 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.680
 and there on the then also such a fill 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.590
 Needed a needle and then it stung 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.360
 actually a nice piece in your will 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.880
 naturally start with a nice shape and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.619
 for that I have cookies on you this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 time for a heart alone 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.920
 dogs are a flower george clooney 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920
 take your heart 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.270
 a bit of a sponge in my sleeve 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.270
 speaker 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:38.320

 and unblocker 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.840
 but really hopeful there is nothing 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.689
 what remind kindergarten the shock 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.390
 always such a figure 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:05.360
 indeed only prick lemon according to 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:08.330
 when the wool 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.369
 is stuck well sees that there is nothing 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.080
 through such a loose everything is really in it 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.080

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.440

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.420
 micheline 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.280
 that investment by thick dust 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.239
 tilting backwards helps and then ironing 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.510
 can play a role 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.510
 please mind 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.850
 must be a few millimeters larger 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.850
 our heart then that firmly on the loose 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.380
 people 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.250

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.690
 well then 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.690
 all the way 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.000
 difficult about her and archer when it 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.239
 field full 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.480
 so came scraps of dust people who were green 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.269
 we luckily still that is difficult 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.329
 she my yellow elbows 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.970
 yes here so this will be possible later on 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.599
 my glasses to the question my left or 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.599
 my judge 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.620
 the left to show a substance that is on a 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.129
 to get 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.420
 use vliesofix that type of paper 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.609
 actually 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.810
 on which you stretch and then stick along 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.969
 both sides 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.250
 so then that is directly group vliesofix 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.540
 that kind of other museum would be true 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.510
 have used dahlias 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.760
 read linen that just sticks in 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.859
 important is that a figure to the matte 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.639
 sides of kpn does the snow on the 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.639
 blink in his 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.580
 first dust was ironing 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:39.650
 that is nice and flat then a dirty fix 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:44.680
 on with the shiny side on the fabric 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.680
 then canal pulled out and strekkerweg 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:54.730
 ok there group stuck and I am one 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.730
 cut out the scissors 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.500
 how now the paper seems all many 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:21.430
 and this box of my sweatpants 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.430
 here approximately on the croo 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.080
 and iron her 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.539
 I also have a very nice technique ours 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.190
 make baby suits 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.620
 for example, you call one 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.569
 fabric and the same fabric you can 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.280
 just put the figure on the t-shirt too 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.280
 make than porthos is just with each other 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.139
 from a he was caught if you now 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:46.690
 so put in the washing machine then comes there 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.259
 sew tightly in no time 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.259
 is therefore the message 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.370
 I can do one for the old-fashioned way 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.410
 hear my needle and thread then looks like this 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.150
 endt meter and 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.150
 made by cable that child is good 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.160
 look like just out loud and share 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:24.330
 puller ready with 3 hearts in a row 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.330
