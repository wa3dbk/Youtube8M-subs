00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.900 
couple of pies in front of and I think
he<00:02:32.840> would've<00:02:33.350> asked<00:02:33.680> Emma<00:02:34.570> yes<00:02:35.570> I'd<00:02:35.990> he

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
he would've asked Emma yes I'd he

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.030 
he would've asked Emma yes I'd he
crashed<00:02:37.910> calm<00:02:38.390> down<00:02:38.420> hill<00:02:38.900> and
