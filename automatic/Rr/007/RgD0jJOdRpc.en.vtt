00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:09.480
 Tell the channel people are just arrived. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.960
 here my beats edition and I will show 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.139
 for you here in the first of the idea 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.630
 or less than it already comes with a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:28.400
 fabric diffuser 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 he is 16 inches and 40 and 41 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:40.410
 centimeters more or less or better 41 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:46.280
 is exactly changing the focus 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.280
 here from camera 41 16 inches 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:01:01.010
 it is about two feet 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:09.390
 correct where it came from that covers it 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.799
 a part here of bild chun I'm going to take 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.729
 this player 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:20.210
 here is the inside of it has a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.770
 hitter and here is a side view 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.330
 that shows more or less the size of it 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.810
 in relation to the size of the flash 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.060
 Closes question is the yang in the model yr 560 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.820
 that I already spoke in the other 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:47.340
 River the microphone is very complicated to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:50.130
 use and flight is now even more 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.510
 his vision has no mark 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.310
 it's all metal 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.260
 and has no manufacturer mark 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.600
 nothing of the kind 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.530
 and now I'll show him in detail 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:14.350
 of his constitution to be able to you 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:18.290
 to see the product is to demonstrate the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.270
 burying and reflective material that he 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:29.900
 is the rough metal 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:37.160
 this dish here is also fundamental 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:40.370
 so it is all metal the inner area 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.770
 of it here is also all constituted of 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.870
 metal so apparently it seems to be 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.209
 a well-built beauty 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:00.560
 OK 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:01.900
 on the side it is also in 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.810
 metal 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.890
 This part is metal here. 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.890
 here he has a screw 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:15.400
 Okay, I'll take it off a little bit 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:27.780
 the side view of it for you can 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.620
 see and vote dismantling it that just goes 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.800
 be easy to understand the operation 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:42.510
 is firstly got a hot flash 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:45.290
 here it's going to be a little tricky 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.290
 to let go 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.480
 so here is the purple where the flash fits 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:13.730
 ok here is the screw where you drop the 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.730
 nice 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.920
 it is worth remembering that here the screw 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:40.990
 which will fit if you are not giving to 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:50.170
 see hence the screw which will attach the 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:50.170
 support it is not a low standard 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.970
 it is a he uses the system of 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:02.300
 bolts here I do not know if you have 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:06.400
 adapt it propagates a rock bucket here is 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.400
 his support 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.170
 so leave support 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.170
 He leaves 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.250
 get out 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:40.050
 and finally the angle bracket that 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.050
 he is also made of metal 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.000
 so it's all made of metal 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.440
 this part here a purple also metal 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.820
 probably aluminum bolts 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.990
 also in metal and this support here 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.720
 also in metal 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:04.660
 the only things I see in plastic 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:06.160
 here are the screw connectors that 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.910
 are in one plastic plus one material 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.910
 quite resistant 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:20.320
 so this is one lives the fast of the 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:23.760
 beauty dish and vote for you 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.820
 then the prices here 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.820
 thank you guys
