00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.960
 and now I'm all king we're in a new 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.320
 video on this occasion we are with the so 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.689
 expected update of the game 1.0 2 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.270
 with which we will finally have the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.279
 updated templates we will have in 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.499
 community mode to be able to compete with 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.910
 all with all our friends sorry 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:27.070
 but before continuing with this 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.240
 information let's see what is first 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.310
 remember we are on the platform 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.800
 playstation 3 so I guess in 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.900
 xbox and I started will be pretty much what 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.720
 same so nothing as you see when you put the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.760
 disk when starting the game already tells us 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.280
 that there is a new version of the game the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.410
 version 1.1 remember that there is the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.140
 version of the game and on the other hand is 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.150
 the data packet version so 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.770
 nothing like you see when entering the game and we 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.750
 says that you have to update before 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.850
 get into the game as you see is a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.100
 12 of 12 megas update that does not 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.290
 you download the truth pretty fast it's 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.860
 install also pretty fast after 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.640
 after 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.520
 to put this little version of the game 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.450
 what it does to us is to prepare the game 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.330
 to add the patch or update 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.340
 1.02 we enter the game menu and we're 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:22.130
 will appear a message that puts us 10 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.350
 update or patch 1.02 brings us back to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.880
 say the details you remember the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.490
 little window of the other video that I made of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.410
 previous it does not come out the same tells us 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.760
 that we have to update and good 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.170
 it really tells us that we have to 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.660
 update but informs us that already 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.880
 is available if we do not update it 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.720
 that will not let him play online 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.119
 we can continue playing 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.729
 quietly offline without connecting 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.070
 but when trying to play a championship 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.200
 or some friendly match or ranking 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 will tell us that we have to update then 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.009
 ok this update as you see now 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.300
 it has taken me longer than normal is 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.830
 update even more than 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.350
 battlefield updates that weigh 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.270
 quite the truth I do not know if it will be because 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.610
 the konami servers will be 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.110
 very saturated of many people of all 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 the world that will be updating its 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.719
 game at a time 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.189
 or I do not know why or it will be because my 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.110
 connection lately is failing but 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.050
 good is everything unless what is said is 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.760
 update 1.02 has been installed 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.010
 the community mode we already have it 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.780
 available with which we can 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 create a community to organize 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.880
 our tournaments or play with our 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.819
 friends also we have installed the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.830
 widget this as you see up here to the 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.170
 left we have in a kind of 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.819
 watch that is similar that we have 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.489
 included of playstation but inside the 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.220
 game so it will not cost us 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.709
 both look for tournaments and others to do 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.900
 match the time of the tournament to which 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.090
 we have to enter so as you can see 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.110
 automatically updating the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.790
 first time since there are two 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.069
 authorizations updating the first 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.950
 Once the widget and the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.019
 comfort mode the second the second 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.540
 update or the second download that 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.329
 is the 1.02 update that is here 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.380
 downloading what it will do is first 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.690
 place update the templates 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.660
 we will have all the summer signings 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.910
 the most sounded in Europe as the signing 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.880
 modric by luka modric and mikael is 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.760
 Ivan by the train to Madrid the signing of 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.640
 alexander are for the club also 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.530
 We will have Bojan the ex of Barcelona in 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.060
 the milan we will have many more 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.280
 signings I do not know all of them really 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.050
 we will also have the former ex santi cazorla 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.870
 del villarreal will be in the area as well 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.850
 we will have the German player is the 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.710
 forward that right now to podolski not 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.140
 I got the name Podolski in the 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.200
 arsenal already I say we will have all or the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.910
 majority of summer signings in their 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.190
 respective teams one of the signings 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.050
 that I think I have needed because 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.160
 I wanted to play in the Copa Libertadores 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.950
 with sao paulo 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.410
 missing lack missing hook the former of 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.450
 saints in sao paulo remember that what 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.850
 they signed up to second how many weeks I think 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.290
 that for the 20 million that has been and 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.480
 It should be in Sao Paulo but not yet 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.400
 is still holy so I do not know what 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.470
 the people of konami wait to pass it 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.230
 to transfer it to the team because as 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.780
 you know the Brazilian league yes that you can 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.670
 update but the league teams 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.530
 Brazilian who play Copa Libertadores 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.970
 in the liberators cup mode the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.740
 templates can not be touched since 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.840
 those templates are the ones with 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.640
 they played in the 2012 version 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.140
 so if you're waiting for the 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.000
 liberator cup templates are 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.070
 update forget them because you do not know 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.500
 will update since they will only have 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.260
 players of the year of the season 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.930
 2012 remember that this season already 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.030
 start we start to finish just one 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.070
 cup and we start again another and that 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.140
 cup is not the one in this game this cup is 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.090
 last year so as well 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.160
 said this as you see being after 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.180
 update the game that it took I already say a 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.490
 little more than normal 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.100
 we will have this is new boots I think 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.729
 there are nine in total in nine packs of 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.189
 boots I think that in total are some 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.080
 11 or 12 boots because as you will see in a 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.599
 image come three models in one 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.580
 image here is 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.889
 the nike models so nothing like 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.430
 you see we have adidas nike boots 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.589
 foam and some other more so like 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.300
 nothing always said if you have any 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:11.180
 doubt if you leave it in the comments 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.069
 as almost always and what you will see for 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.949
 update the country game simply to 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.659
 menu there is information update that is 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.599
 the second option is the option that is 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.789
 right in the middle and you give it and then already 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.289
 with a little bit of luck, download it 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.930
 'aces' as you see here once 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.370
 updated the game I will take a 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.469
 Friendly match simply to see 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.149
 that really the templates were 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:33.969
 updated and as you can see also has 

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:36.740
 changed a little bit of the tactical drawing 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:38.839
 each team has its tactical drawing not 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.610
 as before the tactical drawings 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.499
 they were a little bit touched in some 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.139
 teams as you see here is already alexander 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.969
 are now changing to realmadrid and os 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.039
 I will show that there is also 100 and 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:51.229
 below is just the luka modric that 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.819
 it has an average of 89 so it will be a good 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.700
 player to consider and say that 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.680
 it's even better that he and he in the game 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.960
 so nothing like you see here again I'm going 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.410
 to edit mode to really see that 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.030
 all teams have the majority or if 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.250
 not the vast majority of players 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.800
 pierced and templates 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.570
 practically updated as I say 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.280
 I've needed some players already 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.480
 I say like hook in sao paulo since 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.860
 is no longer in saints so as you see 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.180
 All templates are updated 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.370
 all tactical drawings are 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.470
 updated we have the mode 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.300
 community we have the widget above 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.920
 that the only thing that makes us is to mark the 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.200
 moment of time I have not seen any 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.000
 other no other functionality and 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.670
 also the most important thing we can already 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.030
 play online championships we can now 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.710
 dispute if you see that you are on the menu if 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.090
 you want before you update and you get 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.920
 So in the championship and can 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.930
 dispute the odd championship 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.580
 online so nothing said as 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.320
 always if you have any doubt what do you leave 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.470
 in a comment thank you very much already 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.840
 We are 270 subscribers of pro fans 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.699
 evolution soccer and nothing 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.680
 any questions in the comments do not 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.900
 I will always try to answer you the most 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.639
 fast possible if you have any problems 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.770
 to update I would recommend that 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:04.479
 connect your cable console to 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.979
 avoid losing the connection in 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.470
 some time and you have to go back to 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.699
 start the download so nothing like 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.410
 you see here we are doing a small 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.729
 review of the equipment so you can see that 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.639
 they really have all their templates 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.900
 updated and remember that you do not know 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.520
 update the cup templates 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.960
 santander liberators since the 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.260
 season that is in the game is the 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.479
 season is the previous 2012 not the 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.220
 it's going to start that will be 2003 so 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:30.540
 nothing as always many thanks and 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.540
 see you in the next greetings
