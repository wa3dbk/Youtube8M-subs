00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:01.849
 one 

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:04.849
 min 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.130
 relatively recently the European Union released a statement in which 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.279
 is intended as a matter of global warming and others to withdraw from the market a 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 series of televisions etc. the rhetoric that never again and they are also thought 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.189
 that all plasma TVs were bad bad in the sense that they consume 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.769
 much 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.710
 yes it is true I want to remove the plasma TV there are a few 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.930
 manufacturer that uses a technology 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.840
 that prevents them from consuming so many eco-friendly or something like that with the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.200
 technology that makes it not enough is the reason that revolution to the market and I have 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.350
 served for two things first so that manufacturers who do great team flat 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 of lower consumption already close to the east 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 and second for what 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.370
 they eat a little bad head manufacturers to new technologies 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.860
 as is my case of the led 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.430
 and so that they understand a television dep the maintenance of each point is 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.100
 turn on by itself say are like 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.850
 by the way ford center 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.440
 generated by the chants 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.260
 an LCD television is like when they see a regulation the doctor decides to cradle 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.300
 retro lighting a led fluorescent screen illuminates 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.680
 and that one 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.000
 in this case with the fia and makes us have it 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 well it works a year what happens in the case of cd the level of black 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.610
 in it is harder to get that in the case of plasma than shoemaker 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.090
 good but manufacturer giving a twist and have done between and know 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.600
 ltd 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.290
 there is no longer a fluorescent tube of the uniforms but little dot formed by 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.920
 led 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.830
 read that they are light emitting 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.900
 after being a climax to the pixel that we have to see is to say that 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.040
 using lcd technology it has been achieved that this difference in 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.080
 contrast and that difference that there is the image quality of a CD term is 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.840
 surpass therefore part let's see that is in evolution of television 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.830
 high definition however we wanted to have your voice high and 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.369
 responsible and in that of málaga de niro 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.990
 for fans of a little read how it goes 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.430
 the election yard the first thing you would have to ask them what south 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.349
 turn 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.799
 what they differentiate and technology 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.229
 and the set 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.599
 plasma and lcd let's see how totally different technology 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.519
 e the plasma in a combination of mintra gases that the lcd are a screen 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.499
 interpellates the vital liquid 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.539
 the differences 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.289
 it's a matter of taste really 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:38.469
 p I would charge it to inches koala bigamy to the dimensions of the screen 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:39.449
 do not 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:44.169
 Mars one would be better than the other one we can still say that the plan more than 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:46.299
 the plasma 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.499
 let's say you can have a little more resolution definition but 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.289
 definition to have it contract 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.829
 a little bit higher 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.269
 relata white travelator to me particularly I like I like it more 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.879
 two large emporada 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.769
 has better definition is 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.230
 the device even that can carry it also had even more distances 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.859
 short 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.680
 xerez cd you have to stumble eta and france because that screen 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.829
 liquid crystal what could only environment that is not stop some 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.069
 some interception 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.829
 eye that does not have it 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.359
 and speaking of consumption that difference of consumption 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.259
 exists between these detainees 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.469
 of plasma technology 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.749
 and the television with lcd technology 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.609
 the baker plan a little more consumption 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 and I say a little because it has improved a lot lately 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.879
 a plasma of two three four years ago today up to 3 4 times more than a lcd 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:43.069
 thing that now with the new plasma relationships 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.659
 let's say brands like panasonic for it have reduced practically by 50% 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.779
 still getting very very close to what you should just give up 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.989
 that sue the public when buying 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.049
 with ice cream technology are the ones that people demand most to plasma the 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:03:59.709
 injury 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.660
 the motto what favors 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.150
 in a mmm a comparison of ten cds alíns 7 in that sport of plasma 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:10.889
 because what worries me 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.619
 been tested 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.519
 the day mola inch that sells the most 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.109
 then as there is very little plasma of 32 inches the fdp is usually sold 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.909
 yes yes also big inch from 42 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.990
 usually smoke square 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.570
 mainly because nobody has the right distance and it looks better 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:34.900
 ap a short distance 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.750
 that essential difference between an 8 and a plasma who has given that the bush sock 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.099
 and that people owe what they really liked technology 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.610
 they are pretty good 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.610
 Jesus, what do you think will be the technology of the future 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.379
 talk about peace talk about the future of radiology that may be left 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.750
 they'll look at lighthouse keeper's mokaba takes little market time that the 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.099
 led technology 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.759
 the to vote for it but 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.759
 To venture to say that there will be a lodge will be left 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:03.339
 it's complicated 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.449
 we have seen a lot of demagoguery 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.659
 ivanovic all to fleetingly not 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.009
 the zamorano of lula ateneo and for example not 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.479
 e the one of rock and that one that disappeared with four months in the market 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.919
 then they venture to say what I have to swallow 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.360
 I the goal 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.809
 the bacteria that 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.029
 e the next step 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:28.449
 telde of course for the mop 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.229
 start to bear strong 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.819
 and the plasma while it has important marks behind it porcello I think 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.559
 see how and continue there 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:38.189
 always when 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.629
 min the technology that comes to us the house of wood the scheme of 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:45.749
 North does not arrive in the digital chronology continue without arriving 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:48.749
 tosel plasma the one that has less less possible to say 

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.260
 thank you very much and 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.630
 and with an information system to decide which products we will not go to 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.150
 look for terrain the security ceilings arbitrators 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.919
 after these portable terminals the advantage that has its headquarters 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.460
 it's just that 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.020
 lower consumption 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.020
 and a higher image quality because it has a very dirty contrast 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.599
 other technology 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.119
 xk and that is a couple on the ballot in this case are organic dots 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:19.249
 self luminescent that consumes little but still to see a 3 11 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.969
 kilos 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:24.019
 there are few left next week in this section to the German some 

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:26.569
 issues also related to the digital home 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.679
 and all this from the televisions cameras and cameras
