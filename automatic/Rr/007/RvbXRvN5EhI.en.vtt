games<00:01:55.340> can<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.490> well<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.909> Nintendo

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
games can do well because Nintendo

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
games can do well because Nintendo
themselves<00:01:58.170> marketed<00:01:58.920> them<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.610> well<00:01:59.700> they

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
themselves marketed them very well they

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.050 
themselves marketed them very well they
do<00:02:00.360> TV<00:02:00.570> commercials<00:02:00.719> more<00:02:01.500> kind<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.829> stuff

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
do TV commercials more kind of stuff

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.280 
do TV commercials more kind of stuff
obviously<00:02:03.060> our<00:02:03.329> games<00:02:03.540> haven't<00:02:03.869> got<00:02:04.020> TV

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
obviously our games haven't got TV

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.469 
obviously our games haven't got TV
commercial<00:02:04.680> jets<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.729> moon<00:02:06.060> had<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
commercial jets I think if if moon had a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.059 
commercial jets I think if if moon had a
TV<00:02:06.780> commercial<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.320> obviously<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.860> so

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
TV commercial then obviously it was so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.770 
TV commercial then obviously it was so
better<00:02:08.429> than<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.819> did

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
better than it did

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.490 
better than it did
so<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:10.929> think<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:12.069> problem<00:02:12.840> obviously<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.230> that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
so I think the problem obviously is that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.620 
so I think the problem obviously is that
as<00:02:15.220> far<00:02:15.430> as<00:02:15.550> publishers<00:02:15.910> not<00:02:16.150> feelings<00:02:16.480> though

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
as far as publishers not feelings though

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.290 
as far as publishers not feelings though
they<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:16.959> take<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> risk<00:02:17.860> with<00:02:18.090> original<00:02:19.090> games

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
they can take a risk with original games

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.240 
they can take a risk with original games

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
me what's that they may be great you

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.780 
me what's that they may be great you
know<00:03:02.019> they<00:03:02.290> may<00:03:02.440> not<00:03:02.590> be<00:03:02.650> but<00:03:03.400> that's<00:03:03.640> that's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
know they may not be but that's that's

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.400 
know they may not be but that's that's
the<00:03:03.970> problem<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.989> that's<00:03:05.140> why<00:03:05.260> people

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the problem so that's why people

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.120 
the problem so that's why people
gravitate<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.010> think<00:03:06.220> towards<00:03:07.380> known<00:03:08.380> familiar

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
gravitate I think towards known familiar

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.460 
gravitate I think towards known familiar
brands<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.360> know<00:03:10.390> or<00:03:10.660> titles<00:03:11.019> meaning

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
brands you know or titles meaning

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.110 
brands you know or titles meaning
they're<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:11.739> no<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:11.950> ya<00:03:12.459> feel<00:03:12.730> comfortable

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
they're like no I ya feel comfortable

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.910 
they're like no I ya feel comfortable
that<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.360> understand<00:03:13.989> what<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.920> so

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
that I understand what that is and so so

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.009 
that I understand what that is and so so
I<00:03:17.950> think<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.579> this<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.850> call<00:03:19.329> to<00:03:19.360> arms<00:03:19.540> here

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
I think so this is a call to arms here

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.780 
I think so this is a call to arms here
you<00:03:20.230> can<00:03:20.410> help<00:03:20.560> it's<00:03:21.040> why<00:03:21.190> we<00:03:21.310> don't<00:03:21.489> make<00:03:21.670> this

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
you can help it's why we don't make this

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.870 
you can help it's why we don't make this
happen<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.690> think<00:03:22.780> if<00:03:23.019> we<00:03:23.170> can<00:03:23.320> actually

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
happen and so I think if we can actually

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.710 
happen and so I think if we can actually
get<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:26.610> statement<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.910> know<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.060> movement

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720
