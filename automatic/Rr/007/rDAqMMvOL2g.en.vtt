soldiers and warriors and archers the
encounter<00:03:50.090> pulse<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.360> can<00:03:50.450> build<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:51.230> need

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
encounter pulse you can build you need

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.810 
encounter pulse you can build you need

train Knights you need supplies

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.340 
train Knights you need supplies
the<00:04:19.090> top<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.450> corner<00:04:19.720> there<00:04:19.900> there's<00:04:20.109> there's

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
the top of corner there there's there's

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.410 
the top of corner there there's there's
buildings<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.070> build<00:04:21.280> those<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
buildings and you build those so the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.820 
buildings and you build those so the
more<00:04:22.630> people<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:23.170> have<00:04:23.230> assigned<00:04:23.560> to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
more people you have assigned to

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.590 
more people you have assigned to
building<00:04:24.100> those<00:04:24.280> two<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> faster<00:04:25.450> they'll

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
building those two the faster they'll

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.780 
building those two the faster they'll
get<00:04:25.750> built<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.290> mean<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.280> don't<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.639> enough

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
get built I mean I don't have enough

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.250 
get built I mean I don't have enough
stone<00:04:28.030> for<00:04:28.240> example<00:04:28.570> for<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.139> go

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
stone for example for that so I can go

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.250 
stone for example for that so I can go
to<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.950> city<00:04:30.220> I<00:04:30.310> can<00:04:30.550> trade<00:04:30.850> money<00:04:31.780> or<00:04:31.990> gold

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
to the city I can trade money or gold

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.310 
to the city I can trade money or gold
whatever<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:34.000> just<00:04:34.210> gets<00:04:34.570> really<00:04:34.930> addicting

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
whatever it just gets really addicting

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.320 
whatever it just gets really addicting
because<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:36.430> gets<00:04:36.610> complicated<00:04:36.910> as<00:04:37.150> well

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
because it gets complicated as well

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.930 
because it gets complicated as well
because<00:04:37.660> further<00:04:38.290> missions<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:38.950> have<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.250> get

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
because further missions you have to get

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.879 
because further missions you have to get
X<00:04:40.300> amount<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.690> Wizards<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.230> here's<00:04:41.710> some

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
X amount of Wizards or here's some

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.500 
X amount of Wizards or here's some
