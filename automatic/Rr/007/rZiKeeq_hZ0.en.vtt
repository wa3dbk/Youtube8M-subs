slip latches there that's that's all it

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.979 
slip latches there that's that's all it
is<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.860> just<00:02:50.099> you<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.640> slip<00:02:51.540> on<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
is that just you know slip on and

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.569 
is that just you know slip on and
everything<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.489> know<00:02:54.230> real<00:02:55.230> real<00:02:55.410> nice

everything is you know real real nice
there's<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.670> spline<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.180> here<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.420> pull<00:02:57.569> that

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
there's a spline in here you pull that

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.960 
there's a spline in here you pull that
out<00:02:57.720> if<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:57.989> want<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> put<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.410> custom<00:02:58.730> color<00:02:59.730> in

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
out if you want to put a custom color in

there<00:03:01.160> each<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.370> these<00:03:02.430> panels<00:03:02.879> comes<00:03:03.629> apart

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
there each of these panels comes apart

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.110 
there each of these panels comes apart
so<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.440> you<00:03:04.799> know<00:03:04.829> only<00:03:05.190> knee<00:03:05.549> if<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:05.940> only
