00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
other row which is sort of made this

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.380

texture<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.710> fabric<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:01.289> lots<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
texture on the fabric so there's lots of

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.630 
texture on the fabric so there's lots of
things<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.219> with<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.460> but

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
things that you can do with this but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.979 
things that you can do with this but
most<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> time<00:01:03.449> you're<00:01:03.600> going<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.750> see

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
most of the time you're going to see

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:12.050 
most of the time you're going to see
this<00:01:04.250> abbreviated<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:06.920> pattern<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.340> B<00:01:09.740> P<00:01:11.060> SC

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this abbreviated in a pattern as B P SC

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320 
this abbreviated in a pattern as B P SC
and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.500> what<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.330> when

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and then this is what you would do when

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
and then this is what you would do when
you<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:16.799> step<00:01:16.979> 1<00:01:17.250> we<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.460> going

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you see that so for step 1 we are going

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.719 
you see that so for step 1 we are going
to<00:01:17.729> take<00:01:17.939> our<00:01:18.150> hook<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.720> insert<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.320> into<00:01:19.729> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
loops on our hook just like we would for

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109 
loops on our hook just like we would for
a<00:01:58.290> normal<00:01:58.350> single<00:01:58.890> crochet<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.369> let's<00:01:59.640> do<00:01:59.790> this

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
a normal single crochet so let's do this

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.490 
a normal single crochet so let's do this
again<00:02:00.540> we're<00:02:00.659> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> come<00:02:01.020> through<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
again we're going to come through the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.399 
again we're going to come through the
back<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.960> fabric<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.240> hole<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:07.020> front

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
back of the fabric in the hole in front

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.320 
back of the fabric in the hole in front
of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> post<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.879> we're<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> go

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
of the post then we're going to go

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.080 
of the post then we're going to go
through<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.259> hole<00:02:10.560> next<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> post

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
through the hole next to the post

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.050 
through the hole next to the post
okay<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.200> we're<00:02:13.349> going<00:02:13.470> from<00:02:13.860> front<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.370> back

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
okay so we're going from front to back

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.030 
okay so we're going from front to back
then<00:02:15.750> we'll<00:02:15.930> yarn<00:02:16.170> over<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.530> draw<00:02:16.770> through

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
then we'll yarn over and draw through

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.860 
then we'll yarn over and draw through
both<00:02:19.010> holes<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:21.239> we<00:02:21.360> will<00:02:21.510> work<00:02:21.690> our

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
both holes and then we will work our

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.500 
both holes and then we will work our
single<00:02:22.230> crochet<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.770> normal

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
single crochet as normal

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.890 
single crochet as normal
okay<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.569> let's<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.470> one<00:02:25.650> more<00:02:25.860> time

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
okay so let's do that just one more time

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.870
