00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
and it was a smaller and it'll be dried

up<00:02:46.870> which<00:02:47.870> makes<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.319> easier<00:02:48.709> for<00:02:49.010> us<00:02:49.130> to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.559 
up which makes it easier for us to
conceal<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.390> put<00:02:51.110> foundation<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:52.569> but

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
conceal it and put foundation on it but

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.600 
conceal it and put foundation on it but

pimple<00:02:56.150> ok<00:02:56.330> actually<00:02:56.660> makes<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.260> worse<00:02:57.470> so

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
pimple ok actually makes it worse so
