00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the choke signal and him calling out

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
the choke signal and him calling out
Crabtree<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.380> saying<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.860> he<00:01:55.920> was

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
Crabtree you know saying that he was

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.260

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
other honestly I think that in the long

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.030 
other honestly I think that in the long
run<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.229> Sherman<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.740> more<00:02:01.950> than

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
run I think that Sherman was more than

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.350 
run I think that Sherman was more than
likely<00:02:02.189> probably<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.909> get<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.090> long

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
likely probably going to get a long

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
likely probably going to get a long
