00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
their fatigue if they're just in your

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.069 
their fatigue if they're just in your
roster<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.759> usually<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.899> have

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
roster so usually what I do is just have

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.810 
roster so usually what I do is just have
two<00:01:46.380> decent<00:01:46.740> goalies<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.490> keep<00:01:47.670> on

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
two decent goalies and just keep on

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
two decent goalies and just keep on
swapping<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.990> usually<00:01:49.380> how<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> win

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
swapping and that's usually how I win

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.539 
swapping and that's usually how I win
