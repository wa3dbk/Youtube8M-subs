 how to burn point on a dvd 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.559
 first you will download the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.650
 parents 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:22.610
 then download the iso from the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.119
 ubuntu also has the virgin dvd in its 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.119
 House 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:43.309
 come on put the virgin dvd in the player 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:49.500
 and close open the power iso application 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:51.870
 select record images you go 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 seek iso ubuntu 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.260
 you will click on your recent my case 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:09.350
 the image is on the desktop, I'm going 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:12.420
 select it here is where you do not edit 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:17.570
 the speed you put the minimum 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.570
 possible in my case 6 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.030
 now just click on record and wait 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.870
 this is so I know percent already recording 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.240
 successful ended the dvd is already 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:46.550
 ready to use did not last more than 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:50.360
 three minutes to record is now just 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.060
 You boot the dvd. 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.080
 anyone who wants to install installs 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:04.850
 I recommend testing it only because it has this 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:08.479
 option for you could have used turbay 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.140
 and but I found it better to stop the iso through 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.900
 fact of being fast and practical as you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.170
 they saw 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.170
 Thank you, it's just that, see you later.
