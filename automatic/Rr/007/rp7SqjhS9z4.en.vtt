little bit of information about my
previous<00:00:21.750> main<00:00:22.710> systems<00:00:23.720> if<00:00:24.720> you'll<00:00:24.900> notice

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
previous main systems if you'll notice

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
previous main systems if you'll notice
one<00:00:25.529> thing<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> pay<00:00:26.220> attention<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.210> my

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
one thing if you pay attention all of my

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.480 
one thing if you pay attention all of my
main<00:00:27.660> stand<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.380> arcades<00:00:28.830> had<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
main stand up arcades had one thing in

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.640 
main stand up arcades had one thing in
common<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.330> let's<00:00:31.170> see<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.410> figure

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
common so let's see if you can figure

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.700 
common so let's see if you can figure
that<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:32.570> now<00:00:33.570> obviously<00:00:34.110> because<00:00:34.380> its<00:00:34.530> main

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that out now obviously because its main

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.330 
that out now obviously because its main
it<00:00:34.950> runs<00:00:35.100> off<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.460> pc<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> instead<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> when

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
it runs off of a pc so instead of when

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.680 
it runs off of a pc so instead of when
it<00:00:38.460> starts<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.850> hearing<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.360> infamous

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
it starts up hearing that infamous

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
it starts up hearing that infamous
windows<00:00:40.290> noise<00:00:40.829> bill<00:00:41.430> whatever<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.149> called

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
windows noise bill whatever it's called

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.119 
windows noise bill whatever it's called
i<00:00:42.660> decided<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.559> something<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.920> little<00:00:43.950> bit

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
i decided to do something a little bit

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.150 
i decided to do something a little bit
different<00:00:44.750> yeah<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> windows<00:00:46.739> tuned

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
different yeah because the windows tuned

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.750 
different yeah because the windows tuned
we<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> sounds<00:00:48.570> like

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
there was no bulb in there so I had to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.790 
there was no bulb in there so I had to
replace<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:57.050> if<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.140> stand<00:02:58.380> back<00:02:58.590> the

basic<00:03:12.500> 2<00:03:12.920> player<00:03:13.190> 7<00:03:13.760> button<00:03:14.150> layout<00:03:14.710> so<00:03:15.710> you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
basic 2 player 7 button layout so you

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.880 
basic 2 player 7 button layout so you

can do street fighter games with those

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.610 
can do street fighter games with those
or<00:03:19.370> maybe<00:03:20.090> what<00:03:20.240> these<00:03:20.450> do<00:03:20.810> neo<00:03:21.050> geo<00:03:21.320> type

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
or maybe what these do neo geo type

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.550 
or maybe what these do neo geo type
games<00:03:22.960> now<00:03:25.540> what<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.570> have<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.020> have<00:03:27.170> obviously

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
games now what I have I have obviously

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.710 
games now what I have I have obviously
the<00:03:27.860> mouse<00:03:28.100> right<00:03:28.370> here<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.330> reason<00:03:29.570> why<00:03:29.690> I

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
the mouse right here the reason why I

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.960 
the mouse right here the reason why I
don't<00:03:30.260> just<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:30.740> program<00:03:31.550> everything<00:03:31.850> up

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
don't just don't program everything up

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.180 
don't just don't program everything up
to<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.240> control<00:03:32.750> panels<00:03:33.260> because<00:03:33.410> got<00:03:34.040> some

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
to the control panels because got some

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.500 
to the control panels because got some
kids<00:03:34.400> who<00:03:34.580> like<00:03:34.730> to<00:03:34.760> come<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:34.970> play<00:03:35.150> with<00:03:35.240> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
kids who like to come and play with it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.600 
kids who like to come and play with it
it's<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.320> lot<00:03:36.470> easier<00:03:36.680> for<00:03:37.040> them<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.190> use

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
it's just a lot easier for them to use

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.700 
it's just a lot easier for them to use
the<00:03:37.730> mouse<00:03:37.880> instead<00:03:38.360> of<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:39.200> know<00:03:39.230> me<00:03:39.530> being

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
the mouse instead of you know me being

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.350 
the mouse instead of you know me being
called<00:03:40.040> every<00:03:40.280> 10<00:03:40.460> minutes<00:03:40.670> trying<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.090> load<00:03:41.330> a

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
game so here's the system itself it's

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.730 
game so here's the system itself it's
actually<00:03:45.140> two<00:03:45.320> giant<00:03:45.800> pieces<00:03:46.010> I'm<00:03:46.700> sure<00:03:47.740> any
