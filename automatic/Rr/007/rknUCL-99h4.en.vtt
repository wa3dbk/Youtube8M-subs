gonna<00:00:47.789> cut<00:00:48.000> out<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.239> inside<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:51.030> off

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
gonna cut out from the inside you off

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.189 
gonna cut out from the inside you off
between<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:52.949> doesn't<00:00:52.980> rust

what's that thing to be take a lot more
time<00:01:33.110> problem<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.439> down<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> does<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
time problem is is down here it does the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.130 
time problem is is down here it does the
same<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.700> hours<00:01:36.090> though<00:01:36.210> either<00:01:36.990> way

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
sections here so it should be solvent on

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.469 
sections here so it should be solvent on
this<00:01:50.579> side<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.000> shouldn't<00:01:51.240> tell<00:01:51.329> me<00:01:51.360> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
this side it shouldn't tell me I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.130 
this side it shouldn't tell me I
shouldn't<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:52.670> as<00:01:53.670> far<00:01:53.909> as<00:01:55.610> movement<00:01:57.110> when<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
shouldn't but as far as movement when I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
shouldn't but as far as movement when I
turn<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> car<00:01:58.619> over<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.729> do

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
turn the car over and that's one one do

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.850 
turn the car over and that's one one do
one<00:01:59.939> turn<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> camera<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.600> put<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> car<00:02:01.829> on

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
one turn the camera off put the car on

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
one turn the camera off put the car on
this<00:02:02.100> side<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.729> actually<00:02:03.479> spin<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> car

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this side here actually spin the car

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.660 
this side here actually spin the car
around

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
around

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.669 
around
we're<00:02:05.670> fronts<00:02:06.000> facing<00:02:06.390> out<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> garage

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
we're fronts facing out the garage

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.979 
we're fronts facing out the garage
and<00:02:09.959> put<00:02:10.959> it<00:02:11.049> on<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.290> side<00:02:11.530> here<00:02:11.560> and

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and put it on the side here and

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.759 
and put it on the side here and
hopefully<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.019> haven't<00:02:14.319> messed<00:02:14.409> up<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.650> other

hopefully I haven't messed up the other

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:21.380 
hopefully I haven't messed up the other
side<00:02:16.019> so<00:02:17.019> step<00:02:17.560> back

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.490
