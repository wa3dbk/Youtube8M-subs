hairspray<00:05:55.259> is<00:05:55.349> really<00:05:55.769> great<00:05:55.949> for<00:05:55.979> wigs

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:56.399 
hairspray is really great for wigs

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:58.850 
hairspray is really great for wigs
because<00:05:56.699> it<00:05:56.849> gives<00:05:57.029> them<00:05:57.179> texture<00:05:57.719> I<00:05:57.929> find

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
because it gives them texture I find

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.349 
because it gives them texture I find
that<00:05:58.949> when<00:05:59.069> you<00:05:59.159> tease<00:05:59.429> a<00:05:59.459> wig<00:05:59.789> it<00:06:00.029> makes<00:06:00.209> it

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:00.359 
that when you tease a wig it makes it

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:04.909 
that when you tease a wig it makes it
look<00:06:00.509> a<00:06:00.599> lot<00:06:00.749> more<00:06:00.809> real<00:06:03.499> now<00:06:04.499> around<00:06:04.709> your

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
look a lot more real now around your

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.629 
look a lot more real now around your
hairline<00:06:05.249> I<00:06:05.819> recommend<00:06:06.479> not<00:06:06.689> teasing

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 
hairline I recommend not teasing

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.949 
hairline I recommend not teasing
horizontally<00:06:08.639> but<00:06:08.999> rather<00:06:09.149> Konev<00:06:09.689> going

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:09.959 
horizontally but rather Konev going

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.959 
horizontally but rather Konev going
vertically<00:06:10.349> around<00:06:10.709> the<00:06:10.799> hairline<00:06:11.009> so<00:06:11.759> that

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
vertically around the hairline so that

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:24.029 
vertically around the hairline so that
you<00:06:12.059> don't<00:06:12.239> end<00:06:12.419> up<00:06:12.479> with<00:06:12.659> lines<00:06:12.929> like<00:06:13.139> that

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.329 

so<00:06:24.669> we've<00:06:24.789> got<00:06:24.969> our<00:06:25.059> teasing<00:06:25.719> done<00:06:26.650> I'd<00:06:27.009> really

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:27.339 
so we've got our teasing done I'd really

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:29.010 
so we've got our teasing done I'd really
like<00:06:27.580> a<00:06:27.639> lot<00:06:27.849> of<00:06:27.909> this<00:06:28.089> hair<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.389> go<00:06:28.509> away<00:06:28.809> from

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
like a lot of this hair to go away from

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.469 
like a lot of this hair to go away from
the<00:06:29.139> face<00:06:29.319> so<00:06:29.619> I'm<00:06:29.770> going<00:06:30.369> to<00:06:31.199> spray<00:06:32.199> it<00:06:33.479> and

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
the face so I'm going to spray it and

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.060 
the face so I'm going to spray it and
just<00:06:34.659> twist<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:35.229> away

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
just twist it away

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.940 
just twist it away
the<00:06:37.640> heat<00:06:37.850> of<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.120> dryer<00:06:38.450> is<00:06:38.900> great<00:06:39.620> because

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
the heat of the dryer is great because

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.520 
the heat of the dryer is great because
it<00:06:40.070> just<00:06:40.250> softens<00:06:40.970> this<00:06:41.270> plasticky<00:06:42.020> hair<00:06:42.260> and

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
it just softens this plasticky hair and

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.100 
it just softens this plasticky hair and
just<00:06:42.800> helps<00:06:43.190> shape<00:06:43.430> it<00:06:43.580> a<00:06:43.700> little<00:06:43.970> bit<00:06:44.120> but

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
just helps shape it a little bit but

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.530 
just helps shape it a little bit but
literally<00:06:45.350> just<00:06:45.680> some<00:06:45.980> hairspray<00:06:46.540> twisting

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:47.540 
literally just some hairspray twisting

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.570 
literally just some hairspray twisting
heat<00:06:48.050> from<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.500> dryer<00:06:48.740> and<00:06:49.100> I<00:06:49.250> think<00:06:49.460> it's

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
heat from the dryer and I think it's

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.550 
heat from the dryer and I think it's
really<00:06:49.760> perfect<00:06:50.060> for<00:06:50.300> a<00:06:50.660> very<00:06:51.230> pretty
