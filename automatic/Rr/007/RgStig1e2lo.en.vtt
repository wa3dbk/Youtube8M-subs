00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:29.870

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.180
 It is feeling 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.060
 I wrote it here too 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 The ears move in tandem when you move them to the side 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:14.780
 It is interesting from 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.610
 In the part that moves after the hand moves, I do not call once on the top 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.540
 From here to here 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.960
 Feet do not move 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.880

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.599
 After the seal part 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.470
 This white part of the eye Seto flower 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:51.030
 And the pink part of the mouth is the seal 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:55.960
 There is no such a sense of incongruity at all, but the broad flower is a bit 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.230
 It looks like it can be taken immediately and if you look at it with yellow part 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.330
 Hey Tsu know the difference between body 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.760

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.790
 I think 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.599
 But it is cute 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.599

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:23.210
 I 've always been with my little kid, but I've assembled

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:34.860
