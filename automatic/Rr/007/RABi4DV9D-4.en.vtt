hey guys it's woody and today I learned
the<00:00:02.310> Xbox<00:00:02.730> one<00:00:03.000> is<00:00:03.030> going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.270> have<00:00:03.449> the<00:00:03.570> same

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
the Xbox one is going to have the same

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.990 
the Xbox one is going to have the same
functionality<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.710> ps4<00:00:05.069> will<00:00:05.549> have<00:00:05.759> in

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
functionality that the ps4 will have in

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.460 
functionality that the ps4 will have in
that<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.240> can<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.600> someone<00:00:06.899> else<00:00:07.080> remotely

that you can have someone else remotely
play<00:00:07.890> your<00:00:08.099> game<00:00:08.280> for<00:00:08.580> you<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.880> thought<00:00:09.210> I'd

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
play your game for you I thought I'd

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.030 
play your game for you I thought I'd
talk<00:00:09.480> about<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.139> how<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.650> works<00:00:10.800> as<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
talk about that and how it works as a

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.070 
talk about that and how it works as a
platform<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.759> then<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.120> general<00:00:12.509> idea<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.840> what

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
platform and then a general idea of what

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
platform and then a general idea of what
a<00:00:13.139> platform<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.799> all<00:00:13.889> about<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.370> software<00:00:20.359> so<00:00:21.359> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
a platform is all about in software so a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
a platform is all about in software so a
platform<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.010> hardware<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> api's

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
platform is the hardware and the api's

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
platform is the hardware and the api's
the<00:00:24.689> application<00:00:25.230> programming<00:00:25.619> interfaces

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the application programming interfaces

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.220 
the application programming interfaces
that<00:00:26.400> make<00:00:27.000> up<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.390> tools<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
that make up the tools in the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.200 
that make up the tools in the
programmers<00:00:28.859> toolbox<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.939> makes<00:00:30.119> any

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
programmers toolbox if that makes any

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.380 
programmers toolbox if that makes any
sense<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:31.619> things<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.610> basic

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
sense with these things with these basic

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.260 
sense with these things with these basic
concepts<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.140> can<00:00:34.380> put<00:00:34.680> together<00:00:35.270> amazing

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
concepts they can put together amazing

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
concepts they can put together amazing
stuff<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.989> let's<00:00:37.440> talk<00:00:37.649> about<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.040> iphone

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
stuff so let's talk about the iphone

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
stuff so let's talk about the iphone
when<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.969> first<00:00:39.180> came<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.690> apple's<00:00:40.260> version

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
when that first came out apple's version

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.010 
when that first came out apple's version
of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> iphone<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:42.120> opinion<00:00:42.420> pretty

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
of the iphone in my opinion pretty

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450 
of the iphone in my opinion pretty
underwhelming<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.190> thing<00:00:44.340> was

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
underwhelming right this thing was

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.130 
underwhelming right this thing was
supposed<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.850> change<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> world<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.600> what

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
supposed to change the world and what

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.830 
supposed to change the world and what
was<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.010> phone<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.719> an

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
was it really a phone and and I like an

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080 
was it really a phone and and I like an
mp3<00:00:49.140> player<00:00:49.379> mixed<00:00:50.100> into<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.309> where<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
mp3 player mixed into one where you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.580 
mp3 player mixed into one where you
could<00:00:51.239> also<00:00:51.390> check<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.899> mail<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.410> your

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
could also check your mail and your

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.920 
could also check your mail and your
calendar<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> was

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
calendar and and that was it so that was

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.220 
calendar and and that was it so that was
like<00:00:55.199> apples<00:00:55.739> grand<00:00:56.100> idea<00:00:56.640> once<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.780> opened

creative centers of the planet they're
just<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.250> platform<00:03:16.849> developers<00:03:17.420> it's<00:03:17.930> once

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
just the platform developers it's once

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.349 
just the platform developers it's once
you<00:03:18.470> take<00:03:18.769> this<00:03:19.010> new<00:03:19.280> thing<00:03:19.609> and<00:03:19.850> hand<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.299> off

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
you take this new thing and hand it off

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.120 
you take this new thing and hand it off
to<00:03:20.420> everything<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.079> to<00:03:21.260> everybody<00:03:21.650> else<00:03:21.889> that

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
to everything in to everybody else that

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.789 
to everything in to everybody else that
the<00:03:22.579> good<00:03:22.790> stuff<00:03:23.060> happens<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.720> it's<00:03:24.530> also

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
the good stuff happens and it's also

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.520 
the good stuff happens and it's also
important<00:03:25.670> that<00:03:25.730> it's<00:03:26.000> on<00:03:26.239> both<00:03:26.600> consoles<00:03:27.230> and

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
important that it's on both consoles and

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.470 
important that it's on both consoles and
presumably<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.310> can<00:03:28.459> do<00:03:28.579> anything<00:03:28.819> on<00:03:29.060> a<00:03:29.090> PC

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
presumably you can do anything on a PC

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.390 
presumably you can do anything on a PC
so<00:03:29.540> that's<00:03:29.810> not<00:03:30.049> really<00:03:30.260> limited<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:31.190> on

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
so that's not really limited but it's on

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.559 
so that's not really limited but it's on
both<00:03:31.639> consoles<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.700> before<00:03:34.700> like<00:03:35.030> if<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.420> were

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
both consoles so before like if you were

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.170
