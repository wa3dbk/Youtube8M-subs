so<00:04:51.190> little<00:04:52.030> charging<00:04:52.420> symbols<00:04:52.780> aren't<00:04:52.960> let's

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
so little charging symbols aren't let's

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.980 
so little charging symbols aren't let's
charge<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:54.070> ipad<00:04:54.340> mini<00:04:56.250> there's<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.400> sound

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
charge the ipad mini there's the sound

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.540 
charge the ipad mini there's the sound
this<00:04:58.990> one's<00:04:59.230> indicating<00:04:59.860> its<00:05:00.010> charging<00:05:00.310> as

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
this one's indicating its charging as

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.430 
this one's indicating its charging as
well<00:05:01.050> so<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.200> have<00:05:02.430> simultaneous<00:05:03.430> charging

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
well so we have simultaneous charging

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.190 
well so we have simultaneous charging
i'm<00:05:05.440> sorry<00:05:05.770> there's<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.130> battery<00:05:06.460> meter<00:05:06.640> so

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.560 

apart<00:05:11.200> from<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.670> it's<00:05:12.670> it's<00:05:12.970> a<00:05:13.090> good<00:05:13.300> size

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
apart from that it's it's a good size

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.270 
apart from that it's it's a good size
it's<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.230> real<00:05:14.440> good<00:05:14.470> size<00:05:14.860> it's<00:05:15.310> heavy<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:17.280> the

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
it's a real good size it's heavy but the

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
it's a real good size it's heavy but the
power<00:05:18.790> IQ<00:05:19.270> technology<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.560> great<00:05:20.970> i've<00:05:21.970> had

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
power IQ technology is great i've had

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.560 
power IQ technology is great i've had
this<00:05:22.480> on<00:05:22.860> a<00:05:23.860> knocker<00:05:24.400> wall<00:05:24.760> charger<00:05:25.270> that<00:05:25.540> I

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
this on a knocker wall charger that I

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.140 
this on a knocker wall charger that I
was<00:05:26.230> provided<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:27.040> be<00:05:27.430> able<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.640> review<00:05:27.910> for

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
was provided to be able to review for

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.770 
was provided to be able to review for
them<00:05:28.300> and<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:29.700> really<00:05:30.700> like<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:31.060> because<00:05:31.240> it's

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
them and I really like it because it's

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.770 
them and I really like it because it's
got<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:33.430> let<00:05:33.610> you<00:05:33.760> plug<00:05:34.000> in<00:05:34.180> any<00:05:34.390> device

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
got to let you plug in any device

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.290 
got to let you plug in any device
whether<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.260> be<00:05:35.380> droid<00:05:35.710> or<00:05:35.980> Apple<00:05:36.490> or<00:05:36.700> your

garmin your garmin watch or your your
bluetooth<00:05:42.460> speaker<00:05:43.030> you<00:05:43.540> name<00:05:43.780> it<00:05:43.960> it's<00:05:44.200> going

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
bluetooth speaker you name it it's going

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.310 
bluetooth speaker you name it it's going
to<00:05:44.440> find<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.980> it's<00:05:45.340> going<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.610> detect<00:05:46.320> what

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
to find it it's going to detect what

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.720 
to find it it's going to detect what
it's<00:05:47.470> connected<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.980> and<00:05:48.370> it's<00:05:48.490> going<00:05:48.669> to

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
it's connected to and it's going to

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.170 
it's connected to and it's going to
optimize<00:05:49.240> its<00:05:49.510> charging<00:05:49.870> for<00:05:50.440> that<00:05:50.590> device<00:05:51.180> so

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
optimize its charging for that device so

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.909 
optimize its charging for that device so
you<00:05:52.630> also<00:05:53.290> get<00:05:53.470> a<00:05:53.770> built-in<00:05:54.280> overcurrent

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
you also get a built-in overcurrent

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.670 
you also get a built-in overcurrent
short<00:05:56.919> circuit<00:05:57.310> protection<00:05:58.090> and<00:05:58.720> one<00:05:59.530> of<00:05:59.590> the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
short circuit protection and one of the

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.900 
short circuit protection and one of the
things<00:05:59.710> awkward<00:06:00.130> is<00:06:00.220> great<00:06:00.370> about<00:06:00.490> is<00:06:00.790> they

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
things awkward is great about is they

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.240 
things awkward is great about is they
provide<00:06:01.240> voltage<00:06:01.630> regulation<00:06:02.080> so<00:06:02.860> it's<00:06:03.130> going

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
provide voltage regulation so it's going

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.650 
provide voltage regulation so it's going
to<00:06:03.310> monitor<00:06:03.580> these<00:06:03.669> two<00:06:03.880> ports<00:06:04.210> make<00:06:04.419> sure<00:06:04.540> it

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
to monitor these two ports make sure it

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.260 
to monitor these two ports make sure it
keeps<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:04.960> output<00:06:05.260> at<00:06:05.350> 5<00:06:05.560> volts<00:06:05.590> if<00:06:06.240> for<00:06:07.240> some

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
keeps the output at 5 volts if for some

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.270 
keeps the output at 5 volts if for some
reason<00:06:07.419> one<00:06:07.870> of<00:06:07.960> these<00:06:08.050> devices<00:06:08.410> starts

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
reason one of these devices starts

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.220 
reason one of these devices starts
pulling<00:06:09.640> more<00:06:09.790> amperage<00:06:10.240> or<00:06:10.450> whatnot<00:06:10.630> it

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
pulling more amperage or whatnot it

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.600 
pulling more amperage or whatnot it
would<00:06:11.410> pull<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:11.710> voltage<00:06:12.070> down<00:06:12.280> that<00:06:12.490> was

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
would pull the voltage down that was

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.030 
would pull the voltage down that was
shut<00:06:12.790> off<00:06:12.820> so<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:14.410> short-circuit

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
shut off so the short-circuit

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.320 
shut off so the short-circuit
overcurrent<00:06:15.460> protection<00:06:15.550> all<00:06:16.180> those

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
overcurrent protection all those

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.909 
overcurrent protection all those
wonderful<00:06:16.540> technologies<00:06:17.350> that<00:06:17.560> anchors

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
wonderful technologies that anchors

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.340 
wonderful technologies that anchors
famous<00:06:18.310> for<00:06:18.550> its<00:06:19.450> built<00:06:19.810> right<00:06:20.020> into<00:06:20.169> this

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
famous for its built right into this

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:26.330 
famous for its built right into this
power<00:06:20.590> brick<00:06:22.919> so<00:06:23.919> I<00:06:24.190> wanted<00:06:24.580> to

you<00:06:27.340> know<00:06:27.430> go<00:06:27.610> over<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:27.850> size<00:06:28.060> the<00:06:28.300> size<00:06:28.480> of

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
you know go over the size the size of

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.590 
you know go over the size the size of
this<00:06:28.870> is<00:06:29.110> as<00:06:29.680> huge<00:06:30.100> as<00:06:30.250> 16,000<00:06:31.000> million<00:06:31.300> hours

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
this is as huge as 16,000 million hours

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.070 
this is as huge as 16,000 million hours
your<00:06:31.720> mail<00:06:31.900> charge<00:06:32.200> lots<00:06:32.620> of<00:06:32.800> stuff<00:06:33.010> harness

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
your mail charge lots of stuff harness
