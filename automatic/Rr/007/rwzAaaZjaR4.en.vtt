pots but this is just two flower pots so
what<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.699> since<00:01:03.149> I've<00:01:03.570> got<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> hole<00:01:03.930> in

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
what I do is is since I've got a hole in

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.179 
what I do is is since I've got a hole in
I<00:01:04.229> block<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> hole<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:07.189> and

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
I block that hole up start off with and

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
I block that hole up start off with and
that<00:01:08.700> way<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.060> gets<00:01:09.299> hot<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.840> air<00:01:09.960> gets

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that way this gets hot the air gets

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.810 
that way this gets hot the air gets
trapped<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.950> gets<00:01:11.220> hot<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> then

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
trapped in there this gets hot and then

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.770 
trapped in there this gets hot and then
over<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> top<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:13.369> put<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.640> big<00:01:14.820> flower<00:01:15.060> pot<00:01:16.430> so

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
over the top I put the big flower pot so

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
over the top I put the big flower pot so
what<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.259> an<00:01:19.619> inner<00:01:20.280> core<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
what you have is an inner core of a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
what you have is an inner core of a
flower<00:01:21.060> pot<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.420> gets<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:21.810> hot<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.290> then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
flower pot which gets very hot and then

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.140 
flower pot which gets very hot and then
you<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.460> which<00:01:23.700> doesn't<00:01:24.030> get

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you have this one which doesn't get

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.940 
you have this one which doesn't get
massively<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.990> does<00:01:25.110> get<00:01:25.259> one<00:01:25.409> boy<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.619> get<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
massively it does get one boy you get is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.850 
massively it does get one boy you get is
a<00:01:25.979> convection<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.909> air<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
a convection of air up here and out the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.490 
a convection of air up here and out the
hole<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> top<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.810> really

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
hole at the top and it really really

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.440 
hole at the top and it really really
flows<00:01:32.040> out<00:01:32.280> well<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> nice<00:01:33.060> flow

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
flows out well so you get a nice flow

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.170 
flows out well so you get a nice flow
there<00:01:33.750> around<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.350> thing<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.790> warms<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there around the thing and it warms the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
there around the thing and it warms the
room<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:37.009> you'd<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.040> amazed<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.610> mean<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.850> not

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
room up you'd be amazed I mean it's not

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.780 
room up you'd be amazed I mean it's not
a<00:01:39.000> massive<00:01:39.329> room<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:46.189> with<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> flower<00:01:47.520> pot

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
a massive room and with the flower pot

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.740 
a massive room and with the flower pot
thing<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:50.540> computer

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
thing and the computer

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
thing and the computer
it<00:01:52.619> keeps<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> room<00:01:53.189> warm<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.670> room<00:01:53.850> needs<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
it keeps the room warm the room needs to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.160 
it keeps the room warm the room needs to
keep<00:01:54.450> warm<00:01:54.720> because<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.799> big<00:01:57.170> CRT

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
keep warm because I use have big CRT

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.490 
keep warm because I use have big CRT
monitors<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.310> they're<00:01:59.869> little<00:02:00.869> ones<00:02:01.049> now

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
monitors but now they're little ones now

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
monitors but now they're little ones now
they're<00:02:01.710> flat<00:02:01.920> screens<00:02:02.310> they<00:02:02.909> don't<00:02:03.119> produce

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
they're flat screens they don't produce

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.090 
they're flat screens they don't produce
nearly<00:02:03.630> as<00:02:03.780> much<00:02:03.930> heat<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.530> need<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> extra

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
nearly as much heat so I need the extra

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.469 
nearly as much heat so I need the extra
heat<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.790> really<00:02:06.030> starting<00:02:06.420> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
heat and that is really starting to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
heat and that is really starting to
churn<00:02:06.810> out<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.259> now<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.220> say<00:02:08.399> each<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
churn out here now and as I say each of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.500 
churn out here now and as I say each of
these<00:02:09.270> will<00:02:09.720> last<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.160> four<00:02:11.760> hours<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.450> I'm

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
these will last for four hours so I'm

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.610 
these will last for four hours so I'm
heating<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.020> room<00:02:13.200> four

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
