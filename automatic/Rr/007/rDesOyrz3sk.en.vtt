00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 a greeting all hdblog reader one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 of the most interesting barbarian criminals 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.410
 kong although it is a prototype is the yacht 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.090
 thoroughly his second generation is a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.170
 product that right now is still 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 in the prototype phase 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 so the design should be big 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.109
 so hail this obviously there 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 may be small changes 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.800
 interesting the basic concept of eight 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 von which incorporates everything done in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.359
 first model and brings it into a new one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.369
 formed into this new model 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.380
 in practice we have a double display that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.870
 allows us to view content 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 in the back and in the part 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.239
 front with a link 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 behind and an amoled display in front is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 You can use some small ones 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.110
 applications that are here now in demo 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.070
 on the product they allow to manage 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.300
 for example 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.200
 the sorry part with swype the part 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 of the links so it is possible 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.300
 view and without battery consumption 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.790
 rss for example or with a double tap 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.410
 we can go back to the screen we say 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.460
 main 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.080
 many of the applications present 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.500
 inside the smartphone can 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.210
 be sent to the back 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 then to the rear display in this 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.690
 case for example the calendar and therefore 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.510
 we have the ability to view 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.780
 the calendar with all the various 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.790
 feature now here 25-day guns 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.440
 26 there are no appointments so no 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.710
 seems to change but here on top 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.190
 you have seen that it has changed is possible 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.780
 also read books for example if 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.060
 this is my book i'm reading about 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.810
 this screen but I don't want to consume e 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.140
 practically energy press the part 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.060
 higher does work this not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.370
 works and wanted to display behind 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.100
 unfortunately, as mentioned, it is a product 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.990
 still prototype and compared to the first 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.240
 model we also have the back part 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.610
 like the touch so the interaction is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.020
 real and we can visualize then 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.400
 all in a manner practically without 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.880
 resort to 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.460
 battery consumption that have a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.490
 important impact on the phone 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.870
 then there are the various options that 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.510
 allow you to manage all 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.580
 let's say live apps for example 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.420
 you can also go and change 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.420
 some parts of the fireplaces wallpaper for 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.769
 example we can set it called it 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.110
 the holy family as a background in the 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.260
 yacht to phone in the lens in the second 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.329
 model is possible with a double tap or 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.280
 return to previous applications 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:50.500
 so this case was the rss e feed 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.769
 then display the contents of the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.290
 movie probably quite enough 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.780
 Quickly, the links are clearly 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.940
 technology that refreshes the screen e 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.280
 this is not a slowness in the phone 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.659
 reflection of the screen but it is precisely the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 technology is evident that works in 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.769
 this way 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.010
 sorry for the rest is a device 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.370
 android however more or less everything is 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.849
 classic of google interface is a 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.120
 product still prototype but not there 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.190
 are particular novelties compared to a 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.370
 nexus e 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.080
 the android line 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.030
 the features they also see 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.940
 at the back the connector 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.970
 micro usb a case would seem a bit 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.019
 probably the camera microphone 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.730
 front capsule earphone jack 3.5 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:47.769
 mm on / off volume button 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.909
 disney and back camera link 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:54.579
 flash should be the stop la with 2.2 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.159
 ghz with 2gb of ram 32 gigabytes of 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:03.150
 memory of a high-end product co 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:04.769
 will arrive in q4 2014 in 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.720
 the selected markets is not yet 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.489
 clear exactly what i will be 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.799
 markets that will see lights come out 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.799
