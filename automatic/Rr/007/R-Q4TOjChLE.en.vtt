00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.409
 in the middle of the month there was then the question but during a school fight 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.249
 here in Brazil they have 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.139
 the following synthesis to the table below presents today the positive multiples of 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.150
 3 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 willing and yes 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 according to a certain pattern 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.579
 if this period is maintained indefinitely 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.210
 surely the number 462 will belong 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 I want to know the column and the number 462 would be 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.180
 he is in the fifth column the number 462 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.700
 What would be the column b? 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.720
 try to solve this I'll note that to all audiences or multiple of 3 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.790
 all groupings are very common 462 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.160
 not very often of course I will want them not to be here 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.330
 so let's go any taste father the column believe 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.780
 the police then 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.370
 first the following 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.990
 all the names are very beautiful 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.970
 462 is very beautiful and iesf 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.080
 let's keep in reference one of these columns 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.140
 for example the 5th column as six to the 5th place 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.270
 note those from the 5th column 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.400
 that everyone in the world - and who are in the 5th column 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.710
 isa or the multiple of 15 anna paquin c30 45 60 75 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 so you're here for the column 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.570
 all this some kind of 15 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.800
 the guys on the first column 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.510
 we think the actress 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 which was divided by arrest kishida 3 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.310
 my father said the leader for example 18 by 15 August 3 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.399
 thirty-three by 30 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.399
 give this 3rd 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.809
 45 48 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.439
 Why are there still three 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.739
 so that everyone very close to those who are in first place 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.119
 I divide by 15 items to 3 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.609
 which according to the column all the names of the second column divided by August 15 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.709
 6 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.859
 of the third column all new divided by 15 northern cities 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:42.929
 and from the fourth column all numbers of kits were divided by kishida rest 12 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:50.729
 So let's split 462 for 15 runs on the rest so we'll know what the 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.879
 column if the rest was the 3d will be in the first column 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.110
 if they were provided according to the column if the mobile school will be in the 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.349
 third column if the rest was from the south of the river will be in the fourth column 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.199
 the new dvd 462 for 15 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.309
 that is to say 462 

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:15.369
 divided by 15 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:24.309
 to adopt 46 46 type that exceeds 3 3 times 15:45 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.849
 for 46 then the low 2 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.299
 twelve for 15 of 00 20 15 from zero for adults and seniors 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.299
 So 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.529
 462 divided by 15 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.729
 dalcol 130 thousand reais all said 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.829
 the barÃ© silva of these 12 which completes a stretch 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.869
 sylvester 12 he will be in the fourth column 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.969
 all names in the honey owed by 15 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:04:00.139
 will display a readjust equal to 12 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:05.789
 so this number 462 would be in the fourth column 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:07.569
 ansa 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.569
 40 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.169
 as the number 432 due per client has study to see 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.029
 be on wednesday 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.259
 was not 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.259
 Collor attacked in 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.430
 fourth placed the correct alternative 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.330
 It's the granddaughter's alternative. 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.080
 dedicated 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.900
 fourth column 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.889
 1 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.290
 he would have given 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.360
 in the doubt of the nasa amiga ii 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.319
 Danilo 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.800
 friends are still reviewing their doubts following the solutions 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.740
 that's how I've tried to stop here 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.039
 in the whole process I highlighted 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.880
 good luck and until then the next question eight thank you and land
