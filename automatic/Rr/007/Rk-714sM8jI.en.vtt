00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 in the period between Christmas and new mittens 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.870
 everything exactly as quiet it is 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.880
 moment to think of myself 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.820
 the thermostat that cells we higher and the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 new slippers coming soon though 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 me and my slippers start i go one 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 pattern making that sounds difficult but 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.410
 that's actually not about that at all 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.630
 pattern I am going to make this old one 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.349
 slippers of mine just use 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.130
 important days on the to script 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:37.440
 share the correct pattern from the start 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.960
 so after no all parts about drawing 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.600
 it can actually patterned paper what 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.629
 sure made but may illness 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.160
 as well with the pattern I can so 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.680
 a lot comes when I try 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.680
 so well 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.030
 oh what 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 Oh 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.560
 pattern part here are ready in my 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.620
 foot chef 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.310
 now I have a great cut there 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.830
 fabric order times purchased for such a 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.670
 baby blanket may so slippers that is 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.670
 ideal for it 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.700
 and on 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.950
 as a tiny centimeter 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.300
 left for 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.300
 to such an i can here 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.810
 this the food and the bottom 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.390
 there recognize image or full use but 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.530
 a piece of leather when playing firmly and that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.530
 also works close 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.610
 that piece of leather doesn't go fast 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.920
 wear down 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.680
 but then seen belgian holland 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.880
 so limp thingy and daryl now good at that 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.380
 must be really soft 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:29.980
 layer of fleece line then go a lot 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:29.980
 get well soon and now be rich or 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.550
 first vossendaal perfect exactly then 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.130
 must 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 and these two sides are guided together 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.870
 lie in front of each other 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:03:03.380
 Bachelor in and Commitments this is already 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.500
 the foot 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.900
 menno wrong because it's there 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.900
 some man so stuck so 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:26.030
 a son is only choked butcher 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.030
 I have a good turn that pulls 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.069
 want 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.810
 why maybe horigen if we have it 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.430
 each other is the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.709
 the needle from behind so that he too 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.989
 flush with the back of your 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.670
 son and because as lord the light then 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.629
 are completely wrong 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.019
 each other 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.379
 ok then put the bearings together first 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.379
 choke 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.010
 so people 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.349
 and you must touch this attention then 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.140
 will you see my as the side turned so 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.659
 a pity then completely inserted inside 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.519
 are the right sides 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.519
 only on the beautiful are work together 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.049
 and then the act of the food how it 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.220
 you then equate with 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.220
 place of the last 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.690
 crash 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.960
 people or on the outside is finished 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.960
 and now just the would for the inside 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.800
 the outside of my slipper is already 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.990
 ready and for the inside I do 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.000
 put down the same use only 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.389
 turn white membrane that is nice and warm 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.389
 the feet 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:58.000
 we have the outside and the inside 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.159
 and now to put together inside that 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.270
 church in the basics 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:07.259
 score and this one 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.259
 I knew third less 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.310
 fixed games and then tap around us 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.810
 but not completely closed 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.430
 because I have to go to have some order 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.430
 my slippers that can turn properly 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.800

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.100
 turn the whole building over for jacket, yes the time 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.100

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.340
 put together now and now 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.860

 slipper number one is almost finished 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.340
 I think it is such a detail 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.410
 missing so that icing on the cake is the pom 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.850
 pom on the boot 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.060
 And that is not difficult at all to self 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.060
 to make 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:22.840
 then insert the detector and completely 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.840

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:38.819

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.580

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.040
 I don't get my pompoms twice 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.570
