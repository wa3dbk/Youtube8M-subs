thought that the best way to water fast
is<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.319> you<00:01:37.100> know<00:01:37.160> water<00:01:37.729> fast<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.420> be<00:01:38.600> really

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
is to you know water fast and be really

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.730 
is to you know water fast and be really
active<00:01:39.200> this<00:01:40.069> way<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.580> will<00:01:40.640> burn<00:01:40.970> more

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
active this way you will burn more

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.440 
active this way you will burn more
and<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.820> was<00:01:44.120> trying<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.690> explain<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.110> them<00:01:45.380> but

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
and I was trying to explain to them but

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.690 
and I was trying to explain to them but
it's<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:47.630> not<00:01:48.460> because<00:01:50.920> the<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.400> thing

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's really not because the the thing

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.149 
it's really not because the the thing
that<00:01:52.970> your<00:01:53.119> body<00:01:53.420> will<00:01:53.720> be<00:01:53.960> burning<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:54.920> thing

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
that your body will be burning the thing

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.340 
that your body will be burning the thing
that<00:01:55.340> it's<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> easiest<00:01:56.240> for<00:01:56.540> it<00:01:56.659> to<00:01:56.810> burn<00:01:56.990> is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
that it's the easiest for it to burn is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.310 
that it's the easiest for it to burn is
muscle<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.880> when<00:01:59.540> you're<00:02:00.159> fasting<00:02:01.159> and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
muscle so when you're fasting and

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.859 
muscle so when you're fasting and
exercising<00:02:03.580> you're<00:02:04.580> needing<00:02:04.909> more<00:02:05.090> calories

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
exercising you're needing more calories

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.620 
exercising you're needing more calories
you're<00:02:06.710> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.490> be<00:02:07.610> taking<00:02:08.060> those<00:02:08.209> calories

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
you're going to be taking those calories

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.680 
you're going to be taking those calories
from<00:02:09.080> muscle<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.670> other<00:02:10.819> thing<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.420> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
from muscle and the other thing is you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.280 
from muscle and the other thing is you
won't<00:02:11.930> have<00:02:12.140> enough<00:02:12.709> energy<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.959> deep

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
