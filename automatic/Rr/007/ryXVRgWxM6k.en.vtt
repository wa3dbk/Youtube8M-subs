really compact three by three door made

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.929 
really compact three by three door made
by<00:00:19.840> me<00:00:20.080> of<00:00:20.230> course<00:00:21.480> um<00:00:23.189> yeah<00:00:24.189> this<00:00:24.460> is<00:00:24.640> all<00:00:24.820> it

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
by me of course um yeah this is all it

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.280 
by me of course um yeah this is all it
is<00:00:27.119> three<00:00:28.119> circuits<00:00:28.599> do<00:00:28.810> you<00:00:28.869> have<00:00:28.960> the<00:00:29.110> red

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
is three circuits do you have the red

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.990 
is three circuits do you have the red
circuit<00:00:29.739> the<00:00:29.860> blue<00:00:30.070> circuit<00:00:30.489> in<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.759> Sian

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
circuit the blue circuit in the Sian

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.780 
circuit the blue circuit in the Sian
circuit<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.840> i'll<00:00:35.320> show<00:00:36.100> you<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.430> blue

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
circuit so i'll show you the blue

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.020 
circuit so i'll show you the blue
circuit<00:00:37.239> what<00:00:38.109> if<00:00:38.230> what<00:00:38.530> it<00:00:38.649> does<00:00:38.859> a<00:00:39.219> blue

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
circuit what if what it does a blue

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.680 
circuit what if what it does a blue
circuit<00:00:40.539> will<00:00:40.780> close<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.859> door<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.579> then<00:00:43.390> it

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
circuit will close the door and then it

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.479 
circuit will close the door and then it
will<00:00:44.519> retract<00:00:45.519> half<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.750> and<00:00:46.989> then<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.250> red

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
will retract half of it and then the red

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.470 
will retract half of it and then the red
circuit<00:00:49.030> retracts<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.809> whole<00:00:50.079> thing<00:00:51.480> see

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
circuit retracts the whole thing see

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.689 
circuit retracts the whole thing see
here<00:00:54.149> altogether<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.530> closed<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.249> opened

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
here altogether it closed and opened

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.919 
here altogether it closed and opened
this<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.780> red<00:00:59.019> circuit<00:00:59.499> itself<00:01:00.929> right

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
this is the red circuit itself right

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.580 
this is the red circuit itself right
here<00:01:02.199> is<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.410> cyan<00:01:02.980> circuit<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:05.080> blue

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
here is the cyan circuit so the blue

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.110 
here is the cyan circuit so the blue
circuit<00:01:06.070> in<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.159> red<00:01:06.370> Sark<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.790> would<00:01:06.909> be

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
circuit in the red Sark it would be

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.820 
circuit in the red Sark it would be
right<00:01:07.300> here<00:01:07.510> under<00:01:07.720> your<00:01:07.870> two<00:01:08.080> sticky<00:01:08.409> pistons

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
right here under your two sticky pistons

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.850 
right here under your two sticky pistons
would<00:01:08.950> be<00:01:09.580> right<00:01:09.790> there<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.150> stuff<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.770> you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
would be right there and stuff so you

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.980 
would be right there and stuff so you
can<00:01:12.160> do<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.550> and<00:01:12.820> then<00:01:13.120> there<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.540> go<00:01:13.690> it's

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
can do that and then there you go it's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.870 
can do that and then there you go it's
closed<00:01:14.460> open<00:01:15.660> closed<00:01:16.660> oh<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:21.040> now<00:01:21.220> I'll<00:01:21.610> be

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
closed open closed oh so now I'll be

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.760 
closed open closed oh so now I'll be
telling<00:01:22.300> you<00:01:22.570> how<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.750> make<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:22.990> um<00:01:23.410> and

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
telling you how to make this um and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.960 
telling you how to make this um and
before<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.160> get<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:25.210> block<00:01:25.540> area<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> 7<00:01:27.040> by<00:01:27.580> 3

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
before I get the block area is a 7 by 3

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.760 
before I get the block area is a 7 by 3
by<00:01:28.450> nine<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.340> would<00:01:30.580> be<00:01:30.850> seven<00:01:31.540> long<00:01:32.320> and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
by nine so it would be seven long and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.590 
by nine so it would be seven long and
three<00:01:33.130> wide<00:01:33.400> and<00:01:34.440> ninth<00:01:35.440> all<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.000> equal

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
three wide and ninth all so that equal

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.800 
right here put a dust right there with a
torch<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.370> then<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.519> want<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.760> put<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.209> piston

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
torch and then you want to put a piston

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.250 
torch and then you want to put a piston
right<00:02:49.989> there<00:02:50.230> with<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.769> piston<00:02:51.519> right<00:02:51.730> here

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
right there with a piston right here

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.699 
right there with a piston right here
with<00:02:53.260> two<00:02:53.620> pistons<00:02:54.069> right<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.709> then

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
with two pistons right there and then

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.759 
with two pistons right there and then
now<00:02:57.250> we<00:02:57.670> go<00:02:57.880> on<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.150> red<00:02:58.450> circuit<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.709> you

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
now we go on to the red circuit so you

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.039 
now we go on to the red circuit so you
want<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.130> draw<00:03:00.340> power<00:03:00.670> from<00:03:00.880> this<00:03:01.269> block<00:03:01.660> and

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
want to draw power from this block and

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.530 
want to draw power from this block and
put<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.590> note<00:03:02.950> take<00:03:03.190> repeater<00:03:05.069> place<00:03:06.069> three<00:03:06.790> red

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
put a note take repeater place three red

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.990 
put a note take repeater place three red
blocks<00:03:07.959> with<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:09.030> 3-2<00:03:10.030> creepier<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.720> for<00:03:11.200> take

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
blocks with a 3-2 creepier and for take

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.809 
blocks with a 3-2 creepier and for take
make<00:03:13.000> sure<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:14.019> not<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.829> three<00:03:15.549> ticks

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
make sure this is not like three ticks

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.900 
make sure this is not like three ticks
and<00:03:16.060> for<00:03:16.390> ticks<00:03:16.829> not<00:03:17.829> exactly<00:03:18.099> sure<00:03:18.340> if<00:03:18.519> it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
and for ticks not exactly sure if it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
and for ticks not exactly sure if it
would<00:03:19.090> mess<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.390> up<00:03:19.630> but<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.170> haven't<00:03:20.530> tried<00:03:20.739> it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
would mess it up but I haven't tried it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.150 
would mess it up but I haven't tried it
so<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.319> wouldn't<00:03:23.739> try<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.280> um<00:03:24.609> so<00:03:25.329> now<00:03:25.540> we<00:03:25.600> put<00:03:25.720> a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so I wouldn't try it um so now we put a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.940 
so I wouldn't try it um so now we put a
dust<00:03:27.160> right<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:28.109> with<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.910> piston<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.950> sand

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
dust right here with a piston and sand

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.860 
dust right here with a piston and sand
or<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:34.420> can<00:03:34.630> put<00:03:34.810> a<00:03:35.049> piston<00:03:35.650> in<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.100> block<00:03:36.400> on

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
or you can put a piston in a block on

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430 
or you can put a piston in a block on
the<00:03:37.870> piston<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.359> sand<00:03:40.359> is<00:03:40.569> more<00:03:40.870> survival

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
the piston and sand is more survival

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.289 
the piston and sand is more survival
friendly<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:45.010> yeah<00:03:45.220> that's<00:03:45.549> more<00:03:45.850> survivable

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
friendly so yeah that's more survivable

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.170 
friendly so yeah that's more survivable
friendly<00:03:46.690> surprised<00:03:47.109> it<00:03:47.260> works<00:03:47.470> um<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:49.120> we

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
friendly surprised it works um now we

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.849 
friendly surprised it works um now we
want<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:50.400> 4<00:03:51.400> tick<00:03:51.639> repeater<00:03:52.120> right<00:03:52.420> there

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
want to a 4 tick repeater right there

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.770 
want to a 4 tick repeater right there
with<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:53.889> to<00:03:54.160> take<00:03:54.639> repeater<00:03:55.060> right<00:03:55.299> there<00:03:55.540> with

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
with a to take repeater right there with

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.979 
with a to take repeater right there with
a<00:03:55.810> block<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.790> then<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:58.060> want<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.329> place<00:03:58.540> go

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
a block and then you want the place go

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.430 
a block and then you want the place go
ahead<00:04:00.299> want<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.389> go<00:04:01.569> ahead<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.170> place<00:04:02.410> your

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.190 
ahead want to go ahead and place your
3-door<00:04:03.190> blocks<00:04:05.400> get<00:04:06.400> out<00:04:06.549> a<00:04:06.790> slab<00:04:07.569> of<00:04:07.900> some

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
3-door blocks get out a slab of some

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.110 
3-door blocks get out a slab of some
sort<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.180> place<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:10.389> right<00:04:10.540> here<00:04:11.970> right<00:04:12.970> above

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.349 
sort and place it right here right above
this<00:04:13.450> to<00:04:14.169> take<00:04:14.349> repeater<00:04:14.739> and<00:04:15.209> then

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
this to take repeater and then

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.949 
this to take repeater and then
next<00:04:16.900> you<00:04:17.049> want<00:04:17.199> to<00:04:17.349> put<00:04:18.129> a<00:04:18.340> redstone<00:04:19.150> desk<00:04:19.629> top

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
next you want to put a redstone desk top

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.950 
next you want to put a redstone desk top
of<00:04:20.109> that<00:04:20.229> slab<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:21.639> put<00:04:21.909> redstone<00:04:22.270> dust<00:04:22.750> on

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
of that slab and put redstone dust on

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.399 
of that slab and put redstone dust on
top<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.259> the<00:04:23.319> red<00:04:24.250> block<00:04:24.520> put<00:04:25.509> a<00:04:25.539> block<00:04:25.870> next<00:04:26.199> to

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 
top of the red block put a block next to

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.339 
top of the red block put a block next to
the<00:04:26.590> repeater<00:04:27.009> and<00:04:27.129> the<00:04:27.430> redstone<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:29.020> when

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
the repeater and the redstone so when

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.600 
the repeater and the redstone so when
this<00:04:29.530> gets<00:04:29.800> powered<00:04:30.310> it'll<00:04:30.819> power<00:04:31.770> here<00:04:32.770> power

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
this gets powered it'll power here power

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.200 
this gets powered it'll power here power
into<00:04:33.819> this<00:04:34.120> power<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.139> block<00:04:35.620> also<00:04:36.219> and<00:04:36.939> it

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
into this power this block also and it

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.420 
into this power this block also and it
will<00:04:37.330> power<00:04:37.539> this<00:04:38.020> block<00:04:38.379> right<00:04:38.650> here<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.400> a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
will power this block right here so a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.839 
will power this block right here so a
power<00:04:39.759> a<00:04:39.909> piston<00:04:42.449> so<00:04:43.449> now<00:04:43.599> we<00:04:43.659> have<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.169> cyan

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
power a piston so now we have the cyan

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.379 
power a piston so now we have the cyan
color<00:04:45.849> in<00:04:46.060> part<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:47.319> first<00:04:47.889> we<00:04:48.219> would<00:04:48.819> probably

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
color in part so first we would probably

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.230 
color in part so first we would probably
want<00:04:49.659> to<00:04:49.779> make<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.139> frame<00:04:50.789> so<00:04:51.789> you<00:04:51.849> want<00:04:52.120> to

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
want to make the frame so you want to

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.300 
want to make the frame so you want to
build<00:04:52.479> a<00:04:52.719> block<00:04:53.139> right<00:04:53.409> here<00:04:53.439> with<00:04:54.129> two

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
build a block right here with two

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.269 
build a block right here with two
pistons<00:04:54.729> on<00:04:54.849> top<00:04:55.120> and<00:04:55.330> take<00:04:55.539> that<00:04:55.689> out<00:04:56.279> right

00:04:57.269 --> 00:04:57.279 
pistons on top and take that out right

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.779 
pistons on top and take that out right
here<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.909> want<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:59.039> put<00:05:00.039> a<00:05:00.069> block<00:05:00.370> next<00:05:00.610> to

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
here you want to put a block next to

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.089 
here you want to put a block next to
that<00:05:01.060> slab<00:05:01.629> not<00:05:02.409> forever<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.960> put<00:05:05.259> two<00:05:05.529> Pistons

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
that slab not forever so put two Pistons

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:09.300 
that slab not forever so put two Pistons
right<00:05:06.310> there<00:05:06.580> take<00:05:07.539> out<00:05:07.719> that<00:05:07.870> block<00:05:08.310> and

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
right there take out that block and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.100 
right there take out that block and
place<00:05:09.729> in<00:05:10.060> your<00:05:10.330> wall<00:05:10.719> blocks<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:13.599> go<00:05:13.960> ahead

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
place in your wall blocks and go ahead

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.149 
place in your wall blocks and go ahead
and<00:05:14.229> place<00:05:14.560> your<00:05:14.590> top<00:05:16.560> place<00:05:17.560> three<00:05:17.860> blocks

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
and place your top place three blocks

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:20.640 
and place your top place three blocks
above<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.699> top<00:05:18.909> place<00:05:19.750> your<00:05:19.960> three<00:05:20.199> Pistons

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
over here and then get out some blocks

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.829 
over here and then get out some blocks
and<00:06:26.069> then<00:06:27.069> put<00:06:27.370> box<00:06:27.729> right<00:06:27.940> there<00:06:27.969> put<00:06:28.810> a

repeater

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.209 
repeater
repeater<00:06:30.849> repeater<00:06:30.969> repeater<00:06:32.039> so<00:06:33.039> now<00:06:33.159> we

a repeater right there now if we try
this<00:06:43.629> out<00:06:46.379> so<00:06:47.379> we'll<00:06:47.469> open<00:06:47.710> and<00:06:48.249> close<00:06:52.469> if<00:06:53.469> you

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
this out so we'll open and close if you

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.510 
this out so we'll open and close if you
want<00:06:53.889> to<00:06:54.009> make<00:06:54.159> it<00:06:54.309> too<00:06:54.490> fast<00:06:54.729> as<00:06:55.029> they<00:06:55.210> can<00:06:55.270> go
