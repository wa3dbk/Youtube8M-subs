00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.230
 certain areas of the brain serve to 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 direct movements 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.969
 the sectors of the brain that control 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.370
 the face the tongue and the hands occupy a 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.370
 they are also complicated 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.380
 the sense of hearing collaborates in said 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.990
 control 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.210
 in both cerebral hemispheres these 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.570
 areas have been printed early in 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.570
 the baby 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.500
 the areas of the auditory pavilion 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.990
 left and the facial features of 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.630
 same side are controlled on the side 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.110
 right and those on the right side in the 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.110
 left 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.860
 in order to be understood with the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.610
 language is necessary to assimilate 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.500
 interpret the sounds of others 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.239
 the sound waves that reach the ears 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.790
 are transformed into nerve impulses 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.720
 and transmitted to various regions of the 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.720
 Central Nervous System 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.729
 they pass through switching cores that are 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.810
 found in the intermediate zone of 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:21.060
 brain called the brainstem 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.579
 these with mutations are necessary for 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.649
 that for example before a menacing noise 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.020
 a reflex reaction occurs 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.720
 before it is interpreted by 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 the brain at the same time reach a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 impulse to the auditory area in the cortex 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.840
 brain once there the noise will have a 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 meaning 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.119
 what you hear and what you experience 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:47.520
 they have to be in close relation to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.380
 end of what you hear have an authentic 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.039
 meaning to be able to be 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.079
 understand 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.409
 there has to be a connection between 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.349
 sounds the gestures and mimic this only 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.270
 can be achieved with experience the 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.459
 man learns with games to understand the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.219
 intentions of others and at the same 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.959
 time to make himself understood he himself 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.629
 sounds transformed into impulses 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.349
 nervous by the auditory organs are 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.730
 compared with those of memory 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.650
 finally these impulses reach a 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.430
 computer zone from which they can 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.650
 originate several reactions 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.060
 children learn to spell the 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.060
 words for example the word mom 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.060
 mom 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.720
 to be able to say something there are many 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.079
 nerves and muscles that are put in 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.079
 action 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.330
 this switch sector acts on a 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.400
 motor zone where what is meant 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.580
 find the necessary means to 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.550
 come true for example the 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.680
 tongue mouth and lips are put on 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.230
 movement the action of the ropes 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.470
 vocal and laryngeal are also 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.390
 activated when speaking the indicated areas 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.150
 they act with each other 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.310
 one after another or at the same time 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.260
 so that the sounds emitted by the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.599
 vocal cords can go outside 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.400
 the sound space of the mouth and the 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.209
 larynx have to be willing 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.209
 adequately 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.379
 let's see through the x-rays how 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.220
 shape the letter so the space is arranged 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.220
 sound for side 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.709
 and so for one or one and 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.379
 in this way you get a u 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.519
 this is how the mouth moves to emit 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.519
 the word mom 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.510
 let's observe this same thing through some 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.510
 Cartoon 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.530
 The whole system is excited by noise 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.970
 understanding memory is activated 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.970
 to understand this noise 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.370
 through understanding the will 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.370
 of wanting to talk becomes a reality 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 at that moment the last one comes into action 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.750
 phase 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.319
 the muscles of the talking system 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.319
 they start acting 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.629
 even the fact of speaking has to be 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.629
 controlled by the ear 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.770
 in a dialogue all these areas act 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.270
 jointly 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.150
 hear understand the will to speak 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.129
 understand and control some languages 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.260
 these brain areas are the cause 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.890
 of all this 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.570
 their work together directs the speech 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.430
 guarantees understanding when speaking and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.430
 also the retention of words 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.300
 for this reason it should not be surprising that the 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.220
 center to write and to 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.570
 understand what is written is 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.570
 organized in this area 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.600
 since the writing is the reflection of 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.940
 the word and how we can only write 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.760
 with one hand the action of writing is 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.890
 directed by one half of the brain by 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.540
 that reason the center of speech is 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.540
 found in one half of the brain 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.590
 the ability to write takes place in 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.590
 three zones 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.520
 up lit intermittently the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.400
 area that guides the movement of the hand 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.460
 below the control area for 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.289
 speech movements and beside it the 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.520
 speech understanding area and the 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:11.069
 control of words 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.050
 in this case the left side of the 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.360
 brain and right hand are 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.159
 closely related once 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.650
 computed the appropriate areas of 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.930
 brain man is able to perform 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.030
 this action 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.910
 human understanding is carried out 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.310
 also by the mimic gestures and 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.980
 finally for the ability of expression 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.020
 of our body 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.060
 we have the power to make ourselves 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.060
 understand and understand others
