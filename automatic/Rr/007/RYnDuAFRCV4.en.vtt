taste terrible
they<00:01:04.059> just<00:01:04.479> taste<00:01:04.780> neutral<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:06.340> we<00:01:06.550> have<00:01:06.670> to

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
they just taste neutral so we have to

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.510 
they just taste neutral so we have to
look<00:01:06.850> for<00:01:07.090> those<00:01:07.210> neutral<00:01:07.750> tasting<00:01:08.520> perhaps

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
look for those neutral tasting perhaps

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.830 
look for those neutral tasting perhaps
rather<00:01:10.360> than<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.810> bitter<00:01:11.020> ones<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.880> that<00:01:13.090> they

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
rather than the bitter ones so that they

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.770 
rather than the bitter ones so that they
won't<00:01:14.020> spoil<00:01:14.470> a<00:01:14.799> good<00:01:15.159> taste<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:16.299> the<00:01:16.570> soup

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
won't spoil a good taste of the soup

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
won't spoil a good taste of the soup
that<00:01:17.020> you're<00:01:17.170> making

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
that you're making

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.039 
that you're making
remember<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.060> herb<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.479> something<00:01:19.869> you'll

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
remember the herb is something you'll

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.410 
remember the herb is something you'll
add<00:01:20.289> on<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:23.579> another<00:01:24.579> reason<00:01:24.939> why<00:01:25.210> we

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
add on to it and another reason why we

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.069 
add on to it and another reason why we
use<00:01:25.450> those<00:01:25.840> wraps<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.289> because<00:01:26.680> they<00:01:27.430> are<00:01:27.549> soft

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
use those wraps is because they are soft

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.520 
use those wraps is because they are soft
after<00:01:29.079> oiling<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.009> simmering<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.869> they<00:01:32.320> can

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
after oiling and simmering so they can

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.639 
after oiling and simmering so they can
be<00:01:32.680> eaten<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.869> we<00:01:35.020> don't<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.320> few

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
be eaten and because we don't have a few

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.880 
be eaten and because we don't have a few
herbs<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.759> can<00:01:37.180> be<00:01:37.479> used<00:01:37.750> due<00:01:38.649> to<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
herbs that can be used due to the

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.389 
herbs that can be used due to the
neutral<00:01:39.369> taste<00:01:40.200> they're<00:01:41.200> for<00:01:41.439> their<00:01:42.130> healing

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
neutral taste they're for their healing
