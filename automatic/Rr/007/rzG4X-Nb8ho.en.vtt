00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.769
 we have another bulb vegetable yes 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.259
 treats of the yo is a bit of the male of the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.800
 onion and let's see how it is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.660
 then treat a head of garlic for 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.570
 peel the sea, you have to give it a shot 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.580
 stationary with the palm of your hand on the radio 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 without letting it slip from the suit and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.519
 need to make a slight pressure in 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.119
 this way we go to get the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.119
 garlic cloves 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.350
 in this case we have the garlic in 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:46.949
 shirt we select everything 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.949
 cloves and poached garlic 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.430
 we get the aop and your live always in 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:04.500
 this way a slight blow on the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:08.259
 garlic clove every preparation wants 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.119
 the garlic clove in a different way 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:16.270
 in this case we can peeled arrival 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.550
 also get crushed garlic for 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.250
 the preparations in the kitchen where the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.679
 hint of garlic must be more tenuous 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.500
 milder at this point garlic not 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:31.750
 the thing peeled is peeled 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.630
 always wants to see you always ask 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.649
 what means farewell without a soul 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:43.360
 it is represented by the bulb that the part 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:46.060
 less digestible than garlic and that's it 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.210
 that after eating it shows up 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.149
 as regurgitation and it is this part 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.149
 central when the white one because one 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.369
 young when it is green because yes 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:04.590
 ilio already has some conservation 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.590
 maybe hanging on the walls of the house 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.830
 here 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.920
 got soulless garlic 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.930
 let's go to make large slices of vaio a 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.020
 slices and what is used 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.140
 to cook garlic and spaghetti 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.540
 Radio chili should not be admitted in 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.550
 whole minced for lajolo e 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.819
 chilli because we risk it if 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:33.810
 let's put the whole thing out of donating that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.959
 hint of freshness and the Rome of 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.570
 character that garlic owns if it 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.250
 we put instead chopped happens that 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.739
 garlic burns and then becomes 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.450
 even toxic 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.920
 formerly collagen should be made 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.239
 cyanide which is one of the most venelli 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.410
 known in the world 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.570
 so colleagues need to do 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.630
 attention must be known how to use e 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.260
 you need to know it to use it in a 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.150
 elegant and not in an intrusive way 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.130
 then this eladio in slices that there 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.850
 We reserve to make garlic garlic spaghetti 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.840
 and chili instead wanting to chop a 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.370
 audio in the classic way then with 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.860
 the soul or without soul we have seen how 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.100
 he takes a prince with a knife 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.100
 surely we are going to give it a shot 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.130
 still with the blade on the slice 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.500
 of garlic in such a way that we flatten it 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.150
 and then later we go to 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.579
 then chop the technique is to 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 use the knife as a friend 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:41.480
 audio and not as an enemy who is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:44.040
 then the thickness of the lake moves away 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.500
 it depends on what we have to do 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.239
 if we have to make them fried and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.200
 preferable not to chop it in a way 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.910
 thin because we risk burning it in 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.340
 a very fast way 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.049
 if instead we have to use garlic 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.810
 inside a filling of a filling 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:04.829
 it is preferable to mince it in a very way 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.740
 thin to make it more deliverable 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:12.180
 within the 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.180
 mass here is the minced garlic
