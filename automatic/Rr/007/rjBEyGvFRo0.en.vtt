00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 i 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.920
 no doubt that he will face one of the me 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.500
 I would not say only about the America that has been 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.180
 cautious plus one of the great players or 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.320
 of the icons that America has had and 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.510
 who has been one of the great players 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.430
 Mexicans who 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.730
 who has had the Mexican pleasure of being able 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 to play 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 It's always a pleasure because 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.020
 I enjoyed watching him play in his 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.490
 better time so how good that 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.779
 when we have returned to your house and that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.000
 people make him a great recognition 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.250
 for all that he has given not only in 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.410
 america but Mexican football not me 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 I think that the quality players of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 class and magic as has been cauhtÃ©moc 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 you can always always make a 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 mischief without a doubt that he is a player who 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.350
 he has magic that he has a lot 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.230
 inventive I think one of the things 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 that you have to like to see them play is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.520
 the great inventiveness he had not because 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 the play that made him lift the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.079
 ball with both feet and went between 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.820
 two rivals as the court called girl 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.739
 with its particular form of departure 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.850
 free throws or penalties but 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.409
 especially the character that always 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.549
 showed to play for me has been one of 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.549
 the big ones play in giant football 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 is what we have talked with ricardo that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.510
 There is a need for 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.790
 of the incorporation that the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.310
 team and we are working on that subject 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.350
 which is an attack player also today 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.390
 they came this if the idea is to use it but 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.980
 I need you to give me more than one because if 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.000
 I'm not going , I 'm going to burn it all week 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.230
 the same suit this is the issue is to say 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.090
 dressed knowing I'm going to an event 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.210
 important that is the america will play 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.400
 which represents an institution that is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.680
 very large worldwide and as 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.620
 I do not care if he has the shield if 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.400
 you do not have it I will always be dressed 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.400
 as the occasion merits 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.800
 no no, it does not change anything, it does not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.800
 the team plays better or worse not 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.990
 but give me more work
