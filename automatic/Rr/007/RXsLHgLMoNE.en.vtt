two dummy cartridges right here and for

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.400 
two dummy cartridges right here and for
some<00:02:45.800> reason<00:02:46.340> you<00:02:47.270> don't<00:02:47.480> put<00:02:47.660> darts<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.200> those

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
but I don't know why because if you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.750 
but I don't know why because if you
could<00:02:50.900> then<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.410> could<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.710> more<00:02:52.040> darts<00:02:52.310> but

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
could then you could have more darts but

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.230 
could then you could have more darts but

batteries my dad is gonna unscrew them
wide<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.270> scooter<00:03:08.750> what<00:03:09.140> if<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.440> get<00:03:09.710> two<00:03:09.980> six

wide and scooter what if I get two six

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:19.640 
wide and scooter what if I get two six
batteries

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.100 

so<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.209> unscrewed<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:22.970> just<00:03:23.970> pop<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
so we have unscrewed this just pop it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.460 
so we have unscrewed this just pop it
out

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.790 

I<00:03:28.640> woke<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.790> up<00:03:30.830> kind<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.950> hard<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:33.530> just<00:03:34.530> put<00:03:34.710> the

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
I woke it up kind of hard I just put the

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:48.140 
I woke it up kind of hard I just put the
batteries<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.310> them<00:03:37.490> I<00:03:38.490> think<00:03:45.740> okay<00:03:46.740> so<00:03:47.150> we're

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
batteries in them I think okay so we're

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.830 
batteries in them I think okay so we're
gonna<00:03:48.300> test<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.840> thing<00:03:49.080> out<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:49.710> we<00:03:49.860> just

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
gonna test this thing out and if we just

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.670 
gonna test this thing out and if we just
switch<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:52.170> on

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.400 

so<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.950> was<00:03:59.220> way<00:03:59.970> faster<00:04:00.540> than<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.080> thought<00:04:01.260> it

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
so that was way faster than I thought it

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.010 
so that was way faster than I thought it
was<00:04:01.530> okay<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.580> figured<00:04:03.030> out<00:04:03.180> how<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.690> put

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
was okay so I figured out how to put

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:12.520 
was okay so I figured out how to put
this<00:04:04.170> in<00:04:04.410> it's<00:04:05.310> supposed<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.730> go<00:04:05.910> through<00:04:06.150> here

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:29.980 

and<00:04:16.549> let's<00:04:17.549> try<00:04:17.760> this

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.219 

the<00:04:30.710> dummy<00:04:30.979> cartridges<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.910> think<00:04:32.210> are<00:04:32.449> to<00:04:33.050> help

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
the dummy cartridges I think are to help

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.830 
the dummy cartridges I think are to help
you<00:04:33.440> when<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.669> help<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.970> align<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.539> ml

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
you when you to help you align the ml

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.170 
you when you to help you align the ml
belt<00:04:36.080> when<00:04:36.259> you<00:04:36.350> put<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.680> on<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.430> gun<00:04:37.729> it's

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
belt when you put it on the gun it's

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:55.769 
belt when you put it on the gun it's
time<00:04:38.419> I<00:04:38.660> brothers

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:55.779 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:59.949 

so<00:04:56.779> what<00:04:57.109> I<00:04:57.139> think<00:04:57.589> about<00:04:57.769> this<00:04:57.979> gun<00:04:58.339> is<00:04:58.699> I<00:04:59.569> like

00:04:59.949 --> 00:04:59.959 
so what I think about this gun is I like

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.879 
so what I think about this gun is I like
it<00:05:00.259> because<00:05:00.709> it<00:05:01.339> goes<00:05:01.549> really<00:05:02.379> really<00:05:03.379> fast

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
it because it goes really really fast

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.619 
it because it goes really really fast
and<00:05:05.529> it<00:05:06.529> is<00:05:06.919> way<00:05:07.309> faster<00:05:07.729> than<00:05:07.999> I<00:05:08.179> thought<00:05:08.449> it

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:08.629 
and it is way faster than I thought it

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:09.399 
and it is way faster than I thought it
was<00:05:08.719> gonna<00:05:08.899> be

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
was gonna be

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.489 
was gonna be
I<00:05:09.439> like<00:05:10.249> that<00:05:10.489> could<00:05:10.819> hold<00:05:11.139> pretty<00:05:12.139> high

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:12.499 
I like that could hold pretty high

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.219 
I like that could hold pretty high
competitive<00:05:12.949> darts<00:05:13.639> that<00:05:13.849> control<00:05:14.299> 20<00:05:14.629> darts

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
competitive darts that control 20 darts

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.469 
competitive darts that control 20 darts
this<00:05:15.859> is<00:05:15.979> pretty<00:05:16.189> good<00:05:16.429> a<00:05:16.759> life<00:05:17.179> better

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
this is pretty good a life better

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.019 
this is pretty good a life better
actually<00:05:17.989> gives<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.319> one<00:05:18.699> so<00:05:19.699> how<00:05:19.759> you<00:05:19.849> gonna

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:20.029 
actually gives you one so how you gonna

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.779 
actually gives you one so how you gonna
hold<00:05:20.269> it<00:05:20.479> -<00:05:20.659> you're<00:05:20.809> not<00:05:20.929> pulling<00:05:21.859> it<00:05:22.039> here<00:05:22.519> or

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
hold it - you're not pulling it here or

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.179 
hold it - you're not pulling it here or
here<00:05:22.819> I<00:05:23.529> would<00:05:24.529> be<00:05:24.559> really<00:05:24.979> uncomfortable

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
here I would be really uncomfortable

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.039 
here I would be really uncomfortable
holding<00:05:26.059> it<00:05:26.149> here<00:05:26.359> while<00:05:26.569> the<00:05:26.719> barrels

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:39.069 
holding it here while the barrels
turning<00:05:27.529> because<00:05:27.799> it<00:05:27.949> would<00:05:28.039> be<00:05:28.189> like<00:05:38.079> it's

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:39.079
