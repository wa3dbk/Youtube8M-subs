trying<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.009> grab<00:01:41.189> pencil<00:01:41.579> whatever<00:01:41.790> we<00:01:41.909> call

trying to grab pencil whatever we call
it<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.049> I'm<00:01:43.200> grafting<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:44.340> berries<00:01:44.670> were

it and I'm grafting these berries were

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.569 
it and I'm grafting these berries were
sawn<00:01:45.090> back<00:01:45.360> hard<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:47.670> time<00:01:47.939> last<00:01:48.180> year<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
sawn back hard this time last year and

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.800 
sawn back hard this time last year and
because<00:01:50.579> bromley<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.030> no<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> us<00:01:51.509> I'm

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because bromley is no use to us I'm

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
because bromley is no use to us I'm
graphing<00:01:52.020> them<00:01:52.259> over<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> side<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.850> up

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
graphing them over to a side or up

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.600 
graphing them over to a side or up
variety<00:01:54.210> Arlington<00:01:54.960> mill<00:01:55.250> that's<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> best

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
variety Arlington mill that's the best

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
variety Arlington mill that's the best
way<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:59.450> because<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.689> quite<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:01.049> big

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
way to do this because it's quite a big

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.260 
way to do this because it's quite a big
difference<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.189> diameter<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:03.119> they're

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
difference in diameter I think they're

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.590 
difference in diameter I think they're
probably<00:02:03.570> they<00:02:05.570> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.140 

this<00:02:10.600> saddle<00:02:11.200> graft<00:02:11.890> might<00:02:12.130> not<00:02:12.280> be<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.610> good<00:02:12.850> I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
this saddle graft might not be so good I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
this saddle graft might not be so good I
think<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.900> might<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.080> better<00:02:14.380> off<00:02:14.500> with<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
think you might be better off with the

stiff butter I was tempted to buy up the
entire<00:04:12.880> stock<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.420> thought<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.690> would<00:04:13.780> be

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
entire stock I thought that would be

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
very selfish think me to do this will

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.860 
very selfish think me to do this will
last<00:04:15.550> me<00:04:15.700> probably<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.540> rest<00:04:16.660> of<00:04:16.780> my<00:04:16.840> life

much more aft in here having said that

I've been using mr. seal at the ends of
the<00:04:53.410> sign<00:04:54.250> would<00:04:54.400> I<00:04:54.610> send<00:04:54.880> out<00:04:55.120> so<00:04:55.510> quite

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the sign would I send out so quite

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.830 
the sign would I send out so quite
likely<00:04:56.340> to<00:04:57.340> rephrase<00:04:57.730> that<00:04:57.760> there<00:04:58.180> anyway

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
likely to rephrase that there anyway

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.500 
likely to rephrase that there anyway
it's<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.950> yes<00:05:00.400> a<00:05:00.430> bit<00:05:00.669> harder<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.910> find<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.419> it

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
it's a yes a bit harder to find that it

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:09.680 
it's a yes a bit harder to find that it
used<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.810> be<00:05:03.810> got<00:05:04.810> my<00:05:04.990> supply

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:25.640 

probably<00:05:10.690> any<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:11.080> regulation<00:05:11.950> or<00:05:12.130> some<00:05:12.340> sort

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.310 

I'm<00:05:26.650> going<00:05:26.800> to<00:05:26.860> do<00:05:26.950> the<00:05:27.070> other<00:05:28.050> three<00:05:29.050> here<00:05:29.290> I

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
I'm going to do the other three here I

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:37.560 
I'm going to do the other three here I
won't<00:05:29.560> film<00:05:29.830> them<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:36.160> can<00:05:36.340> almost<00:05:36.730> sort<00:05:37.330> not

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
won't film them you can almost sort not

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.220 
won't film them you can almost sort not
bother<00:05:37.900> with<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:39.510> tying<00:05:40.510> in<00:05:40.750> probably

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
bother with the tying in probably

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.870 
bother with the tying in probably
because<00:05:41.620> this<00:05:42.070> is<00:05:42.220> holding<00:05:42.490> under<00:05:42.700> some

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
because this is holding under some

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.250 
because this is holding under some
tension<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:44.140> wax<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.950> some<00:05:46.260> hopefully

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
tension and the wax is some hopefully

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.460 
tension and the wax is some hopefully
sealing<00:05:48.570> moisture<00:05:49.570> in<00:05:49.720> but<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:52.870> know<00:05:52.930> I<00:05:53.020> don't

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
sealing moisture in but you know I don't

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.310 
sealing moisture in but you know I don't
think<00:05:53.620> it's<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.860> great<00:05:54.040> idea<00:05:54.780> yeah<00:05:55.780> why<00:05:56.140> would

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
think it's a great idea yeah why would

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.120 
think it's a great idea yeah why would
you<00:05:56.410> want<00:05:56.560> to<00:05:56.620> cut<00:05:56.800> corners<00:05:57.190> in<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.550> way<00:06:00.990> and

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
you want to cut corners in that way and

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.770 
you want to cut corners in that way and
before<00:06:03.130> anybody<00:06:03.400> posted<00:06:03.820> yes<00:06:03.970> I<00:06:04.090> know<00:06:04.150> that<00:06:04.570> so

you may be surprised to see me grafting
as<00:06:38.470> late<00:06:38.680> as<00:06:38.710> this<00:06:39.070> I<00:06:39.190> know<00:06:39.250> that<00:06:39.490> some<00:06:39.760> of<00:06:39.790> you

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
as late as this I know that some of you

as late as this I know that some of you
against<00:06:40.690> my<00:06:41.050> advice<00:06:42.720> did<00:06:44.550> graft<00:06:45.550> as<00:06:46.120> soon<00:06:46.390> as

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
against my advice did graft as soon as

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.420 
against my advice did graft as soon as
you<00:06:46.660> received<00:06:47.080> the<00:06:47.470> wood<00:06:50.160> although<00:06:51.160> I

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
you received the wood although I

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.330 
you received the wood although I
counseled<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.419> wait<00:06:52.750> until<00:06:53.260> there<00:06:53.890> was<00:06:54.010> clear

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
counseled to wait until there was clear

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.970 
counseled to wait until there was clear
evidence<00:06:54.610> of<00:06:55.470> growth<00:06:56.470> taking<00:06:56.950> place<00:06:58.980> before

evidence of growth taking place before

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.100 
evidence of growth taking place before
drafting<00:07:00.520> so<00:07:01.150> I<00:07:01.180> really<00:07:01.540> believe<00:07:01.840> that<00:07:01.870> that's

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
drafting so I really believe that that's

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.570 
drafting so I really believe that that's
the<00:07:02.290> more<00:07:02.500> effective<00:07:02.800> way<00:07:02.860> to<00:07:02.919> do<00:07:03.070> it<00:07:03.190> cut<00:07:03.400> the

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
the more effective way to do it cut the

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.310 
the more effective way to do it cut the
wood<00:07:03.760> in<00:07:04.690> deep<00:07:04.990> dormancy<00:07:05.440> store<00:07:05.919> it<00:07:06.070> cool<00:07:06.880> and

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
wood in deep dormancy store it cool and

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.090 
wood in deep dormancy store it cool and
moist

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100 
moist

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.730 
moist
and<00:07:10.400> then<00:07:10.580> graft<00:07:10.940> onto<00:07:11.540> wood<00:07:11.750> that<00:07:12.290> has<00:07:12.500> begun

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:12.740 
and then graft onto wood that has begun

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.460 
and then graft onto wood that has begun
to<00:07:13.430> grow
