by<00:00:11.269> two<00:00:11.330> to<00:00:11.719> four<00:00:11.959> feet<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.530> get<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.709> ball

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
by two to four feet to get the ball

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.339 
by two to four feet to get the ball
safely<00:00:13.549> up<00:00:13.669> over<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.030> net<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.450> then<00:00:14.839> to<00:00:14.990> pull

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:15.349 
safely up over the net and then to pull

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.550 
safely up over the net and then to pull
it<00:00:15.530> back<00:00:15.740> down<00:00:15.769> into<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.430> service<00:00:16.820> box

topspin<00:00:18.560> is<00:00:18.619> what<00:00:18.920> helps<00:00:19.190> you<00:00:19.310> do<00:00:19.490> that

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
topspin is what helps you do that

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.910 
topspin is what helps you do that
remember<00:00:20.540> once<00:00:20.780> you<00:00:20.930> get<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.260> ball<00:00:21.440> spinning

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
remember once you get the ball spinning

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.000 
remember once you get the ball spinning
forward<00:00:22.460> it<00:00:22.640> creates<00:00:23.480> air<00:00:23.900> pressure<00:00:24.290> on<00:00:24.620> top

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
forward it creates air pressure on top

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.770 
forward it creates air pressure on top
of<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.280> ball<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:25.760> it's<00:00:25.910> always<00:00:26.090> pushing<00:00:26.660> the

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
of the ball so it's always pushing the

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.710 
of the ball so it's always pushing the
ball<00:00:26.960> back<00:00:27.230> down<00:00:27.560> now<00:00:28.550> think<00:00:28.850> about<00:00:29.120> it<00:00:29.300> when

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
ball back down now think about it when

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.960 
ball back down now think about it when
you<00:00:29.840> hit<00:00:30.080> top<00:00:30.350> spin<00:00:30.380> on<00:00:30.830> a<00:00:30.920> forehand<00:00:31.460> let's<00:00:31.760> say

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
you hit top spin on a forehand let's say

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.590 
you hit top spin on a forehand let's say
your<00:00:32.509> racket<00:00:32.899> starts<00:00:33.320> below<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:33.800> ball<00:00:34.600> you're

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
your racket starts below the ball you're

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.959 
your racket starts below the ball you're
swinging<00:00:36.019> from<00:00:36.230> low<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.499> high<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:37.129> you're

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
swinging from low to high and you're

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.970 
swinging from low to high and you're
brushing<00:00:38.359> up<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.019> backside<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.559> the<00:00:39.769> ball

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
brushing up the backside of the ball

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.369 
brushing up the backside of the ball
you're<00:00:40.730> hitting<00:00:41.059> basically<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.749> equator<00:00:42.230> of

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
you're hitting basically the equator of

the ball that imaginary line around the
center<00:00:44.989> of<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.350> ball<00:00:45.559> and<00:00:45.769> you're<00:00:45.980> brushing

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
center of the ball and you're brushing

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.029 
center of the ball and you're brushing
up<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:47.539> imparts<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.260> topspin<00:00:48.739> or<00:00:48.800> the

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
up that imparts the topspin or the

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.369 
up that imparts the topspin or the
forward<00:00:49.309> spin<00:00:49.760> now<00:00:50.600> with<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:50.870> serve<00:00:51.109> you're

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379

this and just practice this this will

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.810 
this and just practice this this will
give<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.020> idea<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.890> wrist<00:01:40.189> movement

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
give you the idea of the wrist movement

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.599 
give you the idea of the wrist movement
on<00:01:40.939> this<00:01:41.240> serve<00:01:41.799> now<00:01:42.799> when<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.039> do<00:01:43.219> this<00:01:43.399> you

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
on this serve now when you do this you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.340 
on this serve now when you do this you
can<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.969> let<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.180> roll<00:01:44.450> on<00:01:44.659> your<00:01:44.869> hand<00:01:45.109> and

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
can just let it roll on your hand and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.560 
can just let it roll on your hand and
then<00:01:45.530> just<00:01:45.799> snap<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:46.490> wrist<00:01:46.640> up<00:01:47.000> towards<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
then just snap the wrist up towards the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.990 
then just snap the wrist up towards the
sky<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.770> you're<00:01:48.920> going<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.070> make<00:01:49.250> contact<00:01:49.850> with

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
sky so you're going to make contact with

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.550 
sky so you're going to make contact with
the<00:01:50.149> ball<00:01:50.390> with<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.960> racket<00:01:51.109> in<00:01:51.380> this
