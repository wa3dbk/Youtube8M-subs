and<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.330> failures<00:02:15.840> were<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.200> course<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and the failures were of course the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.890 
and the failures were of course the
mutants

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.820 

then<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:20.990> course<00:02:21.230> there's<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.650> authority<00:02:23.830> you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
then of course there's the authority you

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.500 
then of course there's the authority you
don't<00:02:24.980> really<00:02:25.190> get<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.459> understand<00:02:26.209> or<00:02:26.360> know

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
don't really get to understand or know

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.940 
don't really get to understand or know
what<00:02:26.690> they're<00:02:26.840> about<00:02:26.959> until<00:02:27.470> later<00:02:27.680> in<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
what they're about until later in the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.710 
what they're about until later in the
game<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.430> they've<00:02:28.580> kind<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:28.819> twisted<00:02:29.330> this

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
game and they've kind of twisted this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.710 
game and they've kind of twisted this
new<00:02:30.020> reality<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:31.069> be<00:02:31.580> what<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:31.910> is<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.569> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
new reality to be what it is that the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.480 
new reality to be what it is that the
player<00:02:33.020> will<00:02:33.260> eventually<00:02:33.740> find<00:02:33.950> out<00:02:34.220> as<00:02:34.400> you

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
player will eventually find out as you

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.940 
player will eventually find out as you
get<00:02:34.640> span<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.180> game<00:02:36.820> these<00:02:37.820> guys<00:02:38.150> are

freely<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.660> decided<00:03:14.990> to<00:03:15.080> kind<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.260> make

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
freely we decided to kind of make

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.340 
freely we decided to kind of make
animations<00:03:15.890> using<00:03:16.160> motion<00:03:17.090> capture<00:03:17.350> enrage

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
animations using motion capture enrage

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.050 
animations using motion capture enrage
we<00:03:18.650> have<00:03:18.860> upwards<00:03:19.190> of<00:03:19.490> six<00:03:19.730> thousand

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
we have upwards of six thousand

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.330 
we have upwards of six thousand
animations<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.900> have<00:03:21.110> been<00:03:21.230> created<00:03:21.410> one

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
animations that have been created one

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.120 
animations that have been created one
type<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.670> character<00:03:23.030> may<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.470> 300<00:03:24.470> 400<00:03:24.650> 500

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
type of character may have 300 400 500

type of character may have 300 400 500
animations<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.330> go<00:03:26.480> with<00:03:26.660> them<00:03:26.780> by<00:03:27.200> applying

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
animations to go with them by applying

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.230 
animations to go with them by applying
those<00:03:27.830> animations<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.820> character<00:03:29.210> is

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
those animations the character is

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.480 
those animations the character is
starting<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.020> look<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.350> lot<00:03:30.530> more<00:03:30.590> interesting

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
starting to look a lot more interesting

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.360 
starting to look a lot more interesting
you<00:03:32.030> also<00:03:32.450> look<00:03:33.110> interesting<00:03:33.980> when<00:03:34.250> you're

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
you also look interesting when you're

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.150 
you also look interesting when you're
actually<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:35.000> combat<00:03:35.900> with<00:03:35.930> an<00:03:36.140> AI<00:03:36.290> they<00:03:36.980> have

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
actually in combat with an AI they have

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.310 
actually in combat with an AI they have
multiple<00:03:37.910> layers<00:03:38.090> themselves<00:03:38.570> when<00:03:39.080> you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
multiple layers themselves when you

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.320 
multiple layers themselves when you
shoot<00:03:40.010> at<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.280> enemy<00:03:40.310> they'll<00:03:41.120> actually

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
shoot at the enemy they'll actually

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.410 
shoot at the enemy they'll actually
react<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:43.160> shot<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:43.910> they'll<00:03:44.120> freak<00:03:44.330> out

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
react to the shot so they'll freak out

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.880 
react to the shot so they'll freak out
and<00:03:44.660> they<00:03:44.750> gain<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.080> this<00:03:45.200> scramble<00:03:45.740> mode

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
and they gain to this scramble mode

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.430 
and they gain to this scramble mode
where<00:03:46.459> he's<00:03:46.850> running<00:03:47.150> around<00:03:47.390> trying<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.780> save

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
where he's running around trying to save

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.740 
where he's running around trying to save
his<00:03:48.560> life<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.010> then<00:03:49.190> dive<00:03:49.730> into<00:03:49.910> cover<00:03:50.180> and

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
his life and then dive into cover and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.540 
his life and then dive into cover and
this<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.140> not<00:03:51.410> really<00:03:51.530> scripted<00:03:52.100> it's<00:03:52.280> just

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
this is not really scripted it's just

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.150 
this is not really scripted it's just
based<00:03:52.910> on<00:03:53.150> or<00:03:53.750> what<00:03:54.050> you've<00:03:54.230> done<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:55.040> the

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
based on or what you've done to the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.280 
based on or what you've done to the
enemy<00:03:55.430> which<00:03:55.760> will<00:03:56.030> change<00:03:56.270> AI<00:03:56.630> state<00:03:57.050> and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
enemy which will change AI state and

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.020 
enemy which will change AI state and
then<00:03:57.709> they<00:03:57.860> will<00:03:58.010> play<00:03:58.220> these<00:03:58.370> different

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
then they will play these different

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.449 
then they will play these different
state<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.450> animations<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:01.130> can<00:04:01.250> interact

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
state of animations and you can interact

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.920 
state of animations and you can interact
with<00:04:01.760> them<00:04:01.940> at<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.150> time<00:04:02.270> they're<00:04:02.510> doing<00:04:02.750> that

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
with them at the time they're doing that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.410 
with them at the time they're doing that
so<00:04:03.140> it's<00:04:03.650> not<00:04:03.800> like<00:04:04.040> they're<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:04.580> stuck<00:04:05.180> in

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
so it's not like they're just stuck in

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.030 
so it's not like they're just stuck in
that<00:04:05.510> particular<00:04:05.780> animation<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.709> can<00:04:06.739> shoot

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
that particular animation you can shoot

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.320 
that particular animation you can shoot
them<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.400> kill<00:04:07.850> them<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.120> everything

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
them and kill them and everything

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.060 
them and kill them and everything
happens<00:04:08.810> as<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.050> would<00:04:09.140> expect<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.920> all

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
happens as you would expect and all

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.979 
happens as you would expect and all
these<00:04:10.190> things<00:04:10.250> work<00:04:10.640> seamlessly<00:04:10.910> together<00:04:11.239> to

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
these things work seamlessly together to

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.350
