00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.969 
issues that you may have at health risk
assessment<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.600> then<00:02:10.020> develop<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.500> plan<00:02:10.770> I

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
assessment and then develop a plan I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.190 
assessment and then develop a plan I
know<00:02:11.069> myself<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.760> took<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.360> started<00:02:13.020> ten

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
know myself I took it I started ten

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900 
know myself I took it I started ten
years<00:02:13.230> ago<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.860> first<00:02:14.040> couple<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.490> years<00:02:14.580> that

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
years ago the first couple of years that

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.480 
years ago the first couple of years that
I<00:02:14.940> did<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.930> assessments<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.770> skeptical<00:02:17.280> I

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
I did the assessments I was skeptical I

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.220 
I did the assessments I was skeptical I
thought<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.030> know<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.330> don't<00:02:18.630> believe<00:02:18.990> this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
thought you know I don't believe this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.800 
thought you know I don't believe this
I'm<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.160> tune<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.580> after<00:02:21.390> about<00:02:21.600> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
I'm not in tune to it after about the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.680 
I'm not in tune to it after about the
third<00:02:21.840> year<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> finally<00:02:22.800> realized<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.270> had

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
third year I finally realized that I had

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.750 
third year I finally realized that I had
issues<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:25.200> had<00:02:25.530> personal<00:02:26.040> health<00:02:26.190> issues<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
issues I had personal health issues and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.330 
issues I had personal health issues and
I<00:02:27.240> did<00:02:27.480> consult<00:02:27.930> with<00:02:28.050> my<00:02:28.260> physician<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:28.950> I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
I did consult with my physician and I

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.100 
I did consult with my physician and I
got<00:02:29.550> on<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> path<00:02:30.060> toward<00:02:30.420> dealing<00:02:30.810> with<00:02:30.959> those

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
got on a path toward dealing with those

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.449 
got on a path toward dealing with those
issues<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.940> think<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> broader

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
issues so I think it's in the broader

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.800 
issues so I think it's in the broader
context<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:36.209> health<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.660> wellness

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
context of this health and wellness

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.960 
context of this health and wellness
program<00:02:37.349> there<00:02:37.500> are<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.650> lot<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.010> questions<00:02:38.700> on

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
program there are a lot of questions on

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
program there are a lot of questions on
the<00:02:39.360> health<00:02:39.510> risk<00:02:39.810> assessment<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.620> tries

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
the health risk assessment and it tries

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.070 
the health risk assessment and it tries
to<00:02:40.890> establish<00:02:41.220> two<00:02:42.150> things<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:42.959> are

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
to establish two things what are

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.440 
to establish two things what are
potential<00:02:43.650> risks<00:02:44.069> that<00:02:44.550> an<00:02:44.730> individual<00:02:45.240> has

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
potential risks that an individual has

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.050 
potential risks that an individual has
so<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.930> there<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.110> be<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.770> program<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
so that there can be a program and a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.900 
so that there can be a program and a
plan<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.569> action<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.170> help<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.560> person

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
plan of action to help that person

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.010 
plan of action to help that person
improve<00:02:50.910> their<00:02:51.090> health<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.510> wellness<00:02:51.690> and

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
improve their health and wellness and

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.720 
improve their health and wellness and
their<00:02:52.140> health<00:02:52.319> outcome<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.310> us<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:53.610> is

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
their health outcome and to us what is

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.790 
their health outcome and to us what is
their<00:02:53.910> willingness<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.540> change<00:02:54.810> again<00:02:55.560> that

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
their willingness to change again that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.130 
their willingness to change again that
is<00:02:55.980> one<00:02:56.340> piece<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.420> broader<00:02:57.780> program

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
is one piece of this broader program

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.690 
is one piece of this broader program
that

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
that
