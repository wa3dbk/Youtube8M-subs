00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.890
 hello very good to all your trex image and 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.480
 today I bring you a new video of the series 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.509
 of the interests of easter games 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.389
 Well today I'll show you how to do the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.389
 easter egg from the mercy map 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.110
 and for this first of all we will have to 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.960
 wait for the bells that sound 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.050
 more or less in the middle of the game 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.590
 start to sound and once they start 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.320
 sounded as 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.210
 will appear magically wherever 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.050
 pointing right now a photo in which 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.360
 zoom out and Maria 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.730
 and good 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.570
 if we shoot those photos until 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.890
 it breaks then it will be heard to dunn 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:59.160
 as i said there is love you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 and well then start sighing I do not know 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 it would be the interest 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.970
 I'm going to cut the video so it does not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.760
 I 'm going to put it too long 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.450
 just at the moment they start to sound 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.450
 The bells 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.409
 Y 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.450
 Y 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.650

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.580
