 we developed that channel 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.589
 thirty times basil filipovich 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.199
 among the guests loses had 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.909
 in his estimation, if correlated to the note 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:16.820
 hand si 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.720
 and switch to the assumption that it is 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.310
 couldnâ€™t often render like 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.440
 Irina Gumenny

 the second assumption is that in this connection with 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.170
 by this 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.520

 three sounding were around snacking 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 expensive actually gkrch 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.220

 There are two tours that really allows 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.040
 get these project options 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 steps
