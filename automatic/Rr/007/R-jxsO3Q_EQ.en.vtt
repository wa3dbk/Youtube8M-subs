00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello how good a taste is 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.960
 to be able to greet them one more time and good 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.400
 here I am with a new video for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.260
 you in truth I stayed very 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 impressed with a material that a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.620
 friend is giving free in his 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.020
 page 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.520
 He's called mister Jorge and I'm going to give him 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.439
 information on where they can be downloaded 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.630
 this plugin that precisely what 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.949
 let's talk it seems incredible to me all 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.560
 the amount of work you have invested 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.029
 in this plugin and especially that is 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.240
 gratuitous 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.270
 it's great it makes me when I saw it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.540
 I was impressed to see that it has 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 more than 80 animation prices and they know 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.690
 what is incredible about this that these 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.290
 countries not only encourage texts because the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.230
 Most people who give presets 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 they are only to animate texts but you 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.120
 that if you have for example your 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.129
 own logo other an icon of something that you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 you want to cheer you can bring it to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.780
 after effects and encourage them only by applying 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.550
 in a simple plugin but good while 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.800
 I'm talking, I can show you the page 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 of him is this 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 as you can see here mister hearts tv and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 good 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.770
 this is the this is the first this is what 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.210
 that they will see when they are going to be downloaded 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 the plugin here has a demo video 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 of what the plugin can 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.159
 do and good is really impressive 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.900
 I 'm going to put you a demo of 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.220
 background while I keep talking so it's 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.350
 more or less in an idea of ​​what it is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.110
 this plugin does and the good thing about this from 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.270
 this plugin with these presents that you 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.369
 you can animate your own logo or an icon 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.320
 what you want as you are seeing in 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.170
 the demonstration right now just 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.140
 you have to choose the pri set and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.140
 I would drag you cheer up and something something that 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 I find it simply terrific 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.950
 this plugin is that as you can see you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.700
 you can be watching the demo live 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.280
 what you do before deciding if you're going to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.570
 apply not in your text in your logo in your 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.210
 icon in what you want to animate 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.130
 so I think it's very good 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.560
 small box here where you can go 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.050
 seeing 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.360
 if you like animation for the wolf or 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.330
 if you like the animation for the lyrics 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.030
 the truth that brings a very rich content 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.069
 and I found it very interesting to share it 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.370
 with you and as I mentioned later what 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.069
 best of all this is that it's free 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.380
 nothing that I'm going to give a crack to 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.920
 that they use it that none of that is 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.380
 free and this and good to me it seems 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.060
 which is very good, I recommend you 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.099
 download it and I'll install it 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.010
 after efe and I 'm going to show you something 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.530
 quickie around here when you download it 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.500
 you are going to find something like this and go 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.040
 to find here these three files the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.040
 quick guides for how to install it on 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.280
 plugin and here it brings a project of 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.860
 example 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.780
 where you can explore it so that you 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.880
 locate more than you can do 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.970
 I already drag the plugin out here 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.390
 as you can see I have it here just 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.690
 double click 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.450
 read that if it 's your computer and here 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.700
 They will also give yes and here brings and 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.190
 he knows a license that he agrees 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.150
 and all that gives you to accept and here the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.400
 plugin automatically detects what to do 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.220
 effect that you have and if for what you 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.430
 they ask is compatible with the c4 so if 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.260
 it is in fact 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.409
 It is compatible with all after efe 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.900
 clear from the cc 3 and the good you 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.750
 identify and if you have installed by 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.079

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.599
 the cc because here you will appear and you will 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.939

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.359

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.760
 to show right now and here in after 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.819
 effects 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.280
 I will give them as a kind of a 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.959
 intro of this quickie but he has 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.849
 factual tutorials there on your page like this 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.220
 that you can go explore with more 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.739
 calm and see what is good 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.599
 let's click on composition I'll 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.480
 create a new composition I'm going to 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.340
 leave it that size and I will give it ok and 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.190
 here in this part where it says windows 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.560
 I'm going to click here where it says 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.680
 animation composer that is the name of the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.280
 plugin and well we have it here and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.560
 I'm going to write something here, for example 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.710
 I'm going to write I do not know what I know I'm going to 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.710
 to write 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:39.169
 and now for example I'm going here where it says 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.249
 Text 2 of the here by animation of 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.360
 characters let's see what we find 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:47.330
 around here he went to see what this is 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.559
 basic that we see what this is if only you 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.919
 click here you will see that here 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:54.830
 automatically starts the preview of 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.129
 what you will achieve in your text here 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.979
 there is another one is very well let's see this 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:04.009
 which says basic position and rotation does not 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.779
 know what it is about very well is very 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:09.740
 well and you know there's something interesting 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:12.880
 I really like this plugin that 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.070
 that not only not only 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.080
 not only there is a lot of intelligence invested 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.210
 here but there is also something fun 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.060
 for example if I want 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.100
 apply this prince to my new text that 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.449
 finished creating here for example what 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.550
 we always do is to shade what 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.250
 drag it and we want to crawl the 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.660
 text but good here seems this 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.310
 small animation on the left where 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.560
 it tells us that we have to drag it 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.720
 right here 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.330
 I made heaven already 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.980
 and I see it because I just reduced this and I 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.990
 I give item render they will see that my text 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.130
 already has exactly the same animation 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.730
 that you can see here so it's very 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.070
 interesting I recommend them a lot and 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.720
 I hope it is very useful for 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.840
 you I'm sure it's going to be 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.420
 very useful because the truth I 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.520
 it seems incredible yet I myself do not 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.470
 I finish exploring it completely but 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.210
