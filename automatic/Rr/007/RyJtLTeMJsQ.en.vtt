it out hopefully you reading the article

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
it out hopefully you reading the article
right<00:00:14.460> now<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.880> joytokey<00:00:15.719> how<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> use<00:00:16.379> your

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
right now on joytokey how to use your

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.429 
right now on joytokey how to use your
how<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> use<00:00:17.850> joytokey<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.539> turn<00:00:19.230> your

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
how to use joytokey to turn your

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.910 
how to use joytokey to turn your
controller<00:00:19.890> into<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> mouse<00:00:21.000> clicks<00:00:21.920> stuff

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
controller into a mouse clicks stuff

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
controller into a mouse clicks stuff
like<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.519> basically<00:00:23.730> use<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.380> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
like that so you can basically use it to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830 
like that so you can basically use it to
to<00:00:26.130> play<00:00:26.340> games<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.910> order<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.420> things<00:00:27.660> on

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

is<00:01:33.420> number<00:01:33.689> six<00:01:34.369> my<00:01:35.369> left<00:01:35.579> bumper<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.150> number

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
is number six my left bumper is number

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.890 
is number six my left bumper is number
five<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.829> gives<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.189> example<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.900> back

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
five so it gives you an example my back

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.410 
five so it gives you an example my back
key<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.560> what<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.460> normally<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.270> call

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
key or what is normally I like to call

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.780 
key or what is normally I like to call
the<00:01:42.540> Select<00:01:42.810> key<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.170> number<00:01:43.470> seven<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.520> what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the Select key is number seven so what

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
the Select key is number seven so what
you're<00:01:44.939> using<00:01:45.180> your<00:01:45.720> controller<00:01:46.200> properties

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you're using your controller properties

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
you're using your controller properties
for<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.579> show<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:48.149> number<00:01:48.899> or

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
for is to just show you what number or

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.830 
for is to just show you what number or
what<00:01:50.070> corresponds<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.509> other<00:01:51.630> words

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
what corresponds to what in other words

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.139 
what corresponds to what in other words
so<00:01:52.560> whenever<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.920> start<00:01:53.159> joytokey<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
so whenever you start joytokey what you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.789 
so whenever you start joytokey what you
want<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.390> first<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.140> others<00:01:55.439> tab

your is what makes the part of the
character<00:02:55.230> turn<00:02:55.410> left<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.100> actually<00:02:56.370> just

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
character turn left so I actually just

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.250 
character turn left so I actually just
hit<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> key<00:02:57.510> or<00:02:57.690> if<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> let's<00:02:57.989> say<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.170> was

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
hit the a key or if it let's say it was

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.610 
hit the a key or if it let's say it was
W<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.650> hit<00:02:58.800> W<00:02:59.160> let's<00:03:00.060> say<00:03:00.269> if<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.350> know

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
W I hit W let's say if it was you know

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.340 
W I hit W let's say if it was you know
left<00:03:02.400> was<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:03.120> X<00:03:03.300> key<00:03:03.630> or<00:03:03.750> whatever<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.140> just

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
left was the X key or whatever you just

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.070 
left was the X key or whatever you just
hit<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.650> little<00:03:04.950> particular<00:03:05.720> key<00:03:06.720> in<00:03:06.900> there

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
hit this little particular key in there

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.840 
hit this little particular key in there
so<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.440> case<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:07.980> left<00:03:08.190> I'd<00:03:08.400> hit<00:03:08.580> a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
so in this case to go left I'd hit a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.320 
so in this case to go left I'd hit a
then<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:09.989> hit<00:03:10.140> okay<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.920> then<00:03:11.430> now<00:03:12.030> my

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
then I just hit okay and then now my

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.360 
then I just hit okay and then now my
left<00:03:12.569> whenever<00:03:13.319> I<00:03:13.410> hit<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> joystick<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
left whenever I hit the joystick to the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.390 
left whenever I hit the joystick to the
left<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:15.090> would<00:03:15.360> actually<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:16.739> like<00:03:16.769> pressing

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
left it would actually be like pressing

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.840 
left it would actually be like pressing
a<00:03:17.550> in<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> game<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.320> POV<00:03:19.650> buttons<00:03:20.190> POV<00:03:20.610> one

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
about I usually dude I was doing it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.770 
about I usually dude I was doing it
about<00:03:46.109> 65<00:03:46.890> somewhere<00:03:47.430> around<00:03:47.489> there<00:03:47.820> let's<00:03:48.570> do

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
about 65 somewhere around there let's do

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.530 
about 65 somewhere around there let's do
65<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.000> adjust<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.480> for

65 and you can adjust that for

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.020 
65 and you can adjust that for
sensitivity<00:03:52.170> essentially<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.070> hit<00:03:53.640> okay<00:03:53.970> so

actually<00:04:57.000> select<00:04:57.540> I'm<00:04:58.110> going<00:04:58.169> to<00:04:58.290> move<00:04:58.440> my

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
actually select I'm going to move my

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.140 
actually select I'm going to move my
mouse<00:04:58.770> cursor<00:04:59.070> but<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.580> can<00:04:59.729> actually<00:04:59.880> select

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
mouse cursor but I can actually select

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.879 
mouse cursor but I can actually select
now<00:05:00.419> the<00:05:00.479> a<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:01.199> essentially<00:05:01.590> all<00:05:01.740> you're

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
now the a so essentially all you're

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.830 
now the a so essentially all you're
doing<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.460> your<00:05:02.940> you're<00:05:03.270> using<00:05:03.539> your

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
doing is you your you're using your

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.300 
doing is you your you're using your
properties<00:05:04.410> to<00:05:04.560> see<00:05:04.770> what<00:05:05.010> buttons

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
properties to see what buttons

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.670 
properties to see what buttons
correspond<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.940> what<00:05:06.150> numbers<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.840> then<00:05:07.470> over

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
correspond to what numbers and then over

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.570 
correspond to what numbers and then over
here<00:05:08.130> you're<00:05:09.020> assigning<00:05:10.020> those<00:05:10.139> buttons<00:05:10.710> to

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
here you're assigning those buttons to

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.390 
here you're assigning those buttons to
particular<00:05:12.539> keyboard<00:05:13.080> or<00:05:13.530> mouse<00:05:13.710> or<00:05:14.010> command

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
particular keyboard or mouse or command

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.090 
particular keyboard or mouse or command
functions<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.750> far<00:05:16.020> all<00:05:16.169> I've<00:05:16.199> done<00:05:16.590> is<00:05:16.650> for

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
functions so far all I've done is for

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.000 
functions so far all I've done is for
example<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.550> memos<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:18.090> use<00:05:18.300> my<00:05:18.830> my<00:05:19.830> left

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
example in memos I use my my left

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.120 
example in memos I use my my left
joystick<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.780> drive<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.990> character<00:05:22.440> and<00:05:22.650> then

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
joystick to drive the character and then

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.779 
joystick to drive the character and then
-<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:24.090> made<00:05:24.660> my<00:05:24.840> right<00:05:25.110> bumper<00:05:25.470> which<00:05:26.250> is<00:05:26.430> button

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
- I made my right bumper which is button

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.500 
- I made my right bumper which is button
number<00:05:26.940> six<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.889> made<00:05:28.889> right<00:05:29.280> button<00:05:29.610> the<00:05:29.729> my

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
number six I made right button the my

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570 
number six I made right button the my
right<00:05:30.750> bumper<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.530> right<00:05:31.740> button<00:05:32.250> on<00:05:32.460> the

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
right bumper the right button on the

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.730 
right bumper the right button on the
mouse<00:05:33.090> so<00:05:33.630> what<00:05:33.750> that<00:05:33.870> means<00:05:34.139> is<00:05:34.320> that<00:05:34.349> I<00:05:34.470> can

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
mouse so what that means is that I can

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.640 
mouse so what that means is that I can
actually<00:05:35.000> hold<00:05:36.000> down<00:05:36.300> my<00:05:36.330> right<00:05:36.720> bumper<00:05:37.470> as

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
actually hold down my right bumper as

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.529 
actually hold down my right bumper as
though<00:05:38.010> I'm<00:05:38.160> holding<00:05:38.490> down<00:05:38.639> right<00:05:38.880> click<00:05:39.210> on

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
though I'm holding down right click on

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.540 
though I'm holding down right click on
the<00:05:39.810> mouse<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:39.990> then<00:05:40.229> I<00:05:40.380> can<00:05:40.560> use<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:40.710> to<00:05:41.310> pan

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
the mouse and then I can use that to pan

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.250 
the mouse and then I can use that to pan
the<00:05:41.700> camera<00:05:41.729> around<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.330> let's<00:05:42.870> say<00:05:43.110> I'm

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
the camera around so let's say I'm

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.170 
the camera around so let's say I'm
driving<00:05:43.680> along<00:05:43.889> in<00:05:43.950> Mill<00:05:44.280> mo<00:05:44.400> whatever<00:05:44.760> and

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
driving along in Mill mo whatever and

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.600 
driving along in Mill mo whatever and
then<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:46.020> want<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.530> look<00:05:46.680> over<00:05:46.919> at<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.370> edge<00:05:47.490> of

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
then I want to look over at the edge of

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.190 
then I want to look over at the edge of
a<00:05:47.700> cliff<00:05:47.849> like<00:05:48.180> tilt<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.539> camera<00:05:48.810> down<00:05:48.900> I<00:05:48.960> just

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
a cliff like tilt the camera down I just

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.140 
a cliff like tilt the camera down I just
hold<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.410> right<00:05:49.590> button<00:05:49.860> down<00:05:49.979> and<00:05:50.190> use<00:05:51.000> the

hold the right button down and use the
directional<00:05:51.630> pad<00:05:51.690> like<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.050> mouse<00:05:52.349> and<00:05:52.710> that

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
directional pad like a mouse and that

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.350 
directional pad like a mouse and that
will<00:05:53.070> actually<00:05:53.280> tilt<00:05:53.729> the<00:05:53.849> camera<00:05:54.030> typing

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
will actually tilt the camera typing

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.129 
will actually tilt the camera typing
there's<00:05:54.780> also<00:05:55.169> you<00:05:55.229> can<00:05:55.440> also<00:05:55.560> zoom<00:05:55.710> as<00:05:56.340> well

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
wheel middle button here if you just use

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:04.490 
wheel middle button here if you just use
that<00:06:03.360> you<00:06:03.599> can<00:06:03.720> actually<00:06:04.020> click<00:06:04.199> on<00:06:04.349> which

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
rotation you want it to like if you

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.879 
rotation you want it to like if you
wanted<00:06:06.060> to<00:06:06.120> go<00:06:06.210> up<00:06:06.240> or<00:06:06.750> inter<00:06:07.289> out<00:06:07.440> so<00:06:07.620> that<00:06:07.770> you

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
wanted to go up or inter out so that you

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.689 
wanted to go up or inter out so that you
can<00:06:08.010> use<00:06:08.130> that<00:06:08.400> one<00:06:08.580> for<00:06:08.610> uh<00:06:09.320> for<00:06:10.320> um<00:06:10.699> zooming

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
can use that one for uh for um zooming

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.100 
can use that one for uh for um zooming
in<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:11.910> out<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.210> you<00:06:12.270> can<00:06:12.419> assign<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:12.750> couple

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
in and out so you can assign a couple

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.230 
in and out so you can assign a couple
keys<00:06:13.320> for<00:06:13.590> that<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:13.740> think<00:06:14.099> I<00:06:14.220> used<00:06:14.520> I<00:06:15.000> can't

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
keys for that I think I used I can't

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.370 
keys for that I think I used I can't
remember<00:06:15.389> what<00:06:15.599> I<00:06:15.660> used<00:06:15.690> on<00:06:15.960> that<00:06:16.110> one<00:06:16.260> but<00:06:16.349> I

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
remember what I used on that one but I

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.980 
remember what I used on that one but I
had<00:06:16.560> one<00:06:16.710> where<00:06:16.860> it'll<00:06:17.010> actually<00:06:17.130> zoom<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.990> my

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
had one where it'll actually zoom I my

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.510 
had one where it'll actually zoom I my
camera<00:06:19.380> in<00:06:19.530> and<00:06:19.680> out<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.010> I<00:06:20.039> can<00:06:20.220> do<00:06:20.340> pretty

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
camera in and out so I can do pretty

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.640 
camera in and out so I can do pretty
much<00:06:20.669> everything<00:06:21.180> from<00:06:21.900> the<00:06:22.169> controller<00:06:22.560> I

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
much everything from the controller I

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.409 
much everything from the controller I
just<00:06:22.919> can't<00:06:23.160> you<00:06:23.310> can't<00:06:23.340> really<00:06:23.760> do<00:06:23.880> too<00:06:23.910> many

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
just can't you can't really do too many

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.540 
just can't you can't really do too many
things<00:06:24.780> now<00:06:25.710> you<00:06:25.770> there<00:06:25.979> is<00:06:26.099> a<00:06:26.130> way<00:06:26.280> for<00:06:26.460> you<00:06:26.520> to

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
things now you there is a way for you to

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.719 
things now you there is a way for you to
combine<00:06:27.530> commands<00:06:28.530> and<00:06:28.740> stuff<00:06:28.919> like<00:06:29.099> that<00:06:29.400> and

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
combine commands and stuff like that and

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.330 
combine commands and stuff like that and
then<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.330> can<00:06:30.570> um<00:06:30.919> you<00:06:31.919> know<00:06:32.039> you<00:06:32.099> can

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
then you can um you know you can

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.500 
then you can um you know you can
actually<00:06:32.460> kind<00:06:32.729> of<00:06:32.820> make<00:06:33.000> it<00:06:33.030> a<00:06:33.180> little<00:06:33.300> bit

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
actually kind of make it a little bit

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.510

necessarily going to want to use it for

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.140 
necessarily going to want to use it for
that<00:06:45.350> because<00:06:46.160> there's<00:06:46.280> just<00:06:46.370> too<00:06:46.550> many<00:06:46.910> now

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
generally I'm using it for

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.820 
generally I'm using it for
mostly<00:06:54.440> for<00:06:54.680> games<00:06:54.830> like<00:06:54.920> Mill<00:06:55.280> MO<00:06:55.490> or<00:06:56.830> you

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
mostly for games like Mill MO or you

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.800 
mostly for games like Mill MO or you
know<00:06:57.920> games<00:06:58.220> like<00:06:58.430> that<00:06:58.460> that<00:06:58.760> are<00:06:58.880> really

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
know games like that that are really

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.050 
know games like that that are really
kind<00:07:00.050> of<00:07:00.110> action<00:07:00.560> in<00:07:00.710> stuff<00:07:01.070> for<00:07:02.000> example

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
kind of action in stuff for example

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.790 
kind of action in stuff for example
Dragon<00:07:02.720> Nest<00:07:02.840> I<00:07:03.050> can't<00:07:03.290> really<00:07:03.440> get<00:07:03.620> it<00:07:03.710> to

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
Dragon Nest I can't really get it to

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.050 
Dragon Nest I can't really get it to
work<00:07:03.950> too<00:07:04.160> well<00:07:04.250> because<00:07:04.310> you<00:07:04.610> also<00:07:04.730> have<00:07:04.850> the

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
work too well because you also have the

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.730 
work too well because you also have the
controller<00:07:05.390> camera<00:07:05.780> all<00:07:05.930> the<00:07:05.960> time<00:07:06.200> so<00:07:06.680> I'm

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
controller camera all the time so I'm

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.560 
controller camera all the time so I'm
kind<00:07:06.950> of<00:07:07.040> working<00:07:07.340> on<00:07:07.460> that<00:07:07.700> but<00:07:08.300> there<00:07:08.420> is<00:07:08.450> a

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:08.570 
kind of working on that but there is a

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.020 
kind of working on that but there is a
way<00:07:08.780> to<00:07:08.840> do<00:07:09.050> it<00:07:09.080> it<00:07:09.920> works<00:07:10.040> of<00:07:10.400> course<00:07:10.430> for<00:07:11.000> a

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030 
way to do it it works of course for a

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.060 
way to do it it works of course for a
game<00:07:11.180> like<00:07:11.210> DC<00:07:11.930> you<00:07:12.020> want<00:07:12.230> a<00:07:12.260> DC<00:07:12.710> Universe

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
game like DC you want a DC Universe

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.770 
game like DC you want a DC Universe
Online<00:07:13.310> it<00:07:13.880> works<00:07:14.030> automatically<00:07:14.630> it

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
Online it works automatically it

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.750 
Online it works automatically it
automatically<00:07:15.200> has<00:07:15.410> that<00:07:15.620> built<00:07:15.860> in<00:07:16.100> so<00:07:16.670> you

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:16.760 
automatically has that built in so you

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.590 
automatically has that built in so you
don't<00:07:16.910> have<00:07:17.000> to<00:07:17.090> worry<00:07:17.240> about<00:07:17.330> it<00:07:17.510> with

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
don't have to worry about it with

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.700 
don't have to worry about it with
certain<00:07:17.810> for<00:07:17.960> certain<00:07:18.230> games<00:07:18.410> but<00:07:18.590> it's

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 
certain for certain games but it's

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.410 
certain for certain games but it's
