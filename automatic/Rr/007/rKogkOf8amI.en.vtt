00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.629
 Today I want another one 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.970
 alternative to the original nespresso 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.730
 I test the capsules today 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.759
 coffee capsules from esprimo or even the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.830
 Vinegar coffee company acted here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.780
 around identical coffee capsules in the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.150
 consumer electronics stores are the esprimo 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 Capsules mostly in packaging of vinegar oil 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.000
 to find coffee company 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.080
 the capsules are completely identical 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 priced lie the coffee capsules 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 between two euro 99 and three euro 30 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.059
 for a pack in a pack 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.090
 contained 10 encapsulate the coffee 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.770
 makes a price per capsule of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.969
 30 or 33 cents are sold the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.010
 coffee pods in a rectangular 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.399
 black packaging it is the respectively 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.500
 kind the intensity the armor body 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.030
 and the aroma on the pack 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.949
 imprinted on the pack of esprimo 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.680
 capsule is an expression to find 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 suitable for many nespresso machines 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 Here are from the manufacturer seemingly 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.120
 already some nespresso machines 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.729
 excluded with which not coffee 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.740
 capsules are not compatible 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.439
 at other kassel alternatives is me 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.420
 not noticed this 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.610
 after opening the pack comes in 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.159
 small deny to the fore 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
 on which the coffee capsules are 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.369
 This is again in foil 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.380
 welded on the packaging is a 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.939
 expression to find the capsules 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.170
 the opening of the film as soon as possible 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 to be consumed 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.799
 In addition, a small guide with on 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.049
 the film will be printed on it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.689
 a total of seven different varieties 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.909
 offered there is also 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.409
 a lung variant and an ent 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.409
 coordinated tappe variation 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.250
 some coffee varieties even carry that 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.189
 space symbol this is very positive too 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.110
 assess 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.509
 the coffee capsules themselves consist of 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.700
 vegetable fibers and cornstarch and are 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.700
 according to manufacturer biodegradable 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.459
 on the bottom is a 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.190
 small soft foil the capsule itself 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.170
 finds himself very much the capsule of 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.920
 nespresso the capsules have all 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.930
 we have different colors here 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.560
 once the original nespresso capsule for 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.560
 comparison 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 Stiftung Warentest has tested whether the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.609
 capsules of esprimo really organic 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.739
 are degradable 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.599
 This was tested by the foundation 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.120
 denied the capsules contain traces 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.829
 of aluminum and are therefore not 100 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.139
 percent biodegradable 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.780
 the capsules are therefore not in the 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:49.299
 Although bio-waste dissolves the capsule 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.129
 a little bit on the earth, however 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.540
 it does not provide any nutrients and is 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.670
 thus we are worthless for the environment 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.079
 now to the compatibility of the coffee capsules 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.659
 in the machine 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.579
 I have the coffee capsules again 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.239
 the espresso pixi machine from krups 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.939
 tested right here and with the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.680
 nespresso lattissima plus machine from 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:16.060
 de'longhi here in the picture on the left 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.400
 closure lever is particularly suitable 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.709
 at the lattissima plus clearly 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.480
 push down harder this speaks 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.659
 not for a good compatibility of 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.030
 coffee capsules I press again each 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.930
 the press and let both machines 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.930
 run parallel 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.000
 at the coffee outlet can be seen at 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.670
 the nespresso flexi machine of coffee 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.660
 but runs much slower than 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.870
 this at the original nespresso 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.459
 capsules the case is also dripping 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.709
 any coffee there from the very 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.860
 coffee spout and the letter process 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.989
 takes a very very long time overall is the 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.630
 Compatibility of coffee capsules with 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.220
 both machines average too 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.140
 if the coffee at the lattissima plus 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.550
 not spotted in this case settled 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.489
 the shutter lever too heavy 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.620
 Let's look at it 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.799
 Result once it is an easy one 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.850
 Chandler recognizable on the coffee 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.850
 This is actually very positive 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.549
 Let's see if the coffee capsules 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.100
 Reasonably ejected at first 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.030
 the espresso pixi we hear the 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.590
 Coffee capsules ends up in the bin 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.600
 also with the de'longhi lattissima course 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.900
 learn the coffee capsule in the collector's picture 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.850
 for the coffee capsules a deformation 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.169
 the coffee capsule did not occur in any of the 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.760
 Both machines are on the internet 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.590
 However, many reports about it 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.120
 read those are capsules in the machine 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.760
 have jammed and the shutter 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.350
 rule no longer open at my 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.350
 test this, however, not the case 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.450
 we come now to the taste of 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.270
 coffee capsules that have coffee capsules 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.410
 We did not taste good overall 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.250
 The varieties really could 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.650
 to convince 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.800
 The coffee was partly very watery 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.400
 and really not tasty the cream on 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.870
 The coffee is fine there 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.080
 the capsules are not really good 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.700
 are compatible and priced too 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.010
 only a little bit of the original capsules 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.880
 I can put the coffee capsules off 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.100
 esprimo not recommend if you the 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:31.850
 Test liked then visited
