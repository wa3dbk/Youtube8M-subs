together<00:00:05.819> each<00:00:11.129> so<00:00:12.129> just<00:00:12.400> a<00:00:12.490> little<00:00:12.760> word

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
together each so just a little word

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.590 
together each so just a little word
about<00:00:13.059> Kelly

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
about Kelly

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.600 
about Kelly
we've<00:00:13.959> decided<00:00:14.320> that<00:00:14.440> this<00:00:14.920> looks<00:00:15.250> like<00:00:15.400> about

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
we've decided that this looks like about

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.700 
we've decided that this looks like about
ten<00:00:15.850> inches<00:00:16.119> so<00:00:16.360> we<00:00:16.390> should<00:00:16.690> try<00:00:16.900> to<00:00:16.930> save<00:00:17.560> as

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
ten inches so we should try to save as

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.390 
ten inches so we should try to save as
much<00:00:17.890> of<00:00:18.039> it<00:00:18.130> as<00:00:18.160> we<00:00:18.250> can<00:00:18.520> see<00:00:18.640> we<00:00:18.730> don't<00:00:19.090> need

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
much of it as we can see we don't need

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.600 
much of it as we can see we don't need
retail<00:00:24.960> take<00:00:25.960> sections<00:00:26.350> as<00:00:26.470> we<00:00:26.620> go<00:00:26.740> but<00:00:27.460> it's

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
retail take sections as we go but it's

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.310 
retail take sections as we go but it's
just<00:00:27.760> a<00:00:27.850> little<00:00:28.120> bit<00:00:28.240> about<00:00:28.420> her<00:00:28.600> haircut<00:00:28.960> she

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
just a little bit about her haircut she

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.249 
just a little bit about her haircut she
has<00:00:29.590> one<00:00:29.950> side<00:00:30.220> that's<00:00:30.460> going<00:00:30.670> to<00:00:30.730> be<00:00:31.259> pretty

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
has one side that's going to be pretty

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.860 
has one side that's going to be pretty
concave<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.280> just<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:34.059> idea<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.539> to<00:00:34.690> get<00:00:34.809> a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
concave and just the idea is to get a

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.640 
concave and just the idea is to get a
really<00:00:35.289> really<00:00:35.560> nice<00:00:35.710> straight<00:00:36.190> line<00:00:36.579> on<00:00:36.970> her

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
really really nice straight line on her

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.560 
really really nice straight line on her
and<00:00:38.650> then<00:00:39.489> she's<00:00:40.000> going<00:00:40.150> to<00:00:40.210> have<00:00:40.270> another

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
and then she's going to have another

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.670 
and then she's going to have another
side<00:00:40.780> that's<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.050> looking<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.410> be<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.500> little

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
side that's a looking to be a little

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.260 
side that's a looking to be a little
more<00:00:41.860> graduated<00:00:42.340> difficult<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.790> wait<00:00:43.000> here

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
more graduated difficult to wait here

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.840 
more graduated difficult to wait here
and<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.960> tops<00:00:44.290> going<00:00:44.560> to<00:00:44.649> be<00:00:44.710> able<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.980> flip<00:00:45.550> to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
and the tops going to be able to flip to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:56.540 
and the tops going to be able to flip to
expose<00:00:46.360> that<00:00:46.390> side

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.860 

we<00:00:57.550> deliver<00:00:58.450> ears<00:00:58.720> of<00:00:58.990> the<00:00:59.170> heads<00:00:59.350> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we deliver ears of the heads really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:48.230 
we deliver ears of the heads really
different

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.420 

it<00:01:49.240> is<00:01:49.450> that<00:01:49.630> decision<00:01:50.229> on<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.500> layering<00:01:50.740> kind

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
it is that decision on the layering kind

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.520 
it is that decision on the layering kind
of<00:01:51.520> normal<00:01:51.940> when<00:01:52.600> you're<00:01:52.780> looking<00:01:53.200> at<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> long

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
of normal when you're looking at a long

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.620 
of normal when you're looking at a long
layer<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.190> you're<00:01:54.340> trying<00:01:54.550> to<00:01:54.580> decide<00:01:54.729> how

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
layer and you're trying to decide how

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.960 
layer and you're trying to decide how
much<00:01:56.020> layer<00:01:56.710> is<00:01:56.920> going<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.190> happen<00:01:57.550> on<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.729> top

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
much layer is going to happen on the top

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.060 
much layer is going to happen on the top
and<00:01:58.180> on<00:01:58.270> that<00:01:58.479> inside<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.410> do<00:01:59.920> you<00:01:59.979> be

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
and on that inside of that do you be

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.620 
and on that inside of that do you be
like<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.340> can't<00:02:00.550> decide<00:02:00.790> like<00:02:01.000> maybe<00:02:01.240> my<00:02:01.390> takes

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
like I can't decide like maybe my takes

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.870 
like I can't decide like maybe my takes
them<00:02:01.780> off<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.170> app<00:02:02.290> correct<00:02:03.070> yeah<00:02:03.340> yeah

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
them off of that app correct yeah yeah

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.280 
them off of that app correct yeah yeah
good<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.450> think<00:02:04.510> that's<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.900> kind<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.110> thing

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
good I think that's the kind of thing

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.900 
good I think that's the kind of thing
that<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.500> think<00:02:05.530> about<00:02:05.860> too<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.520> if<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.729> were

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
that I think about too that if I were

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.730 
that I think about too that if I were
just<00:02:07.119> learning<00:02:07.330> how<00:02:07.510> to<00:02:07.630> compare<00:02:08.050> I'd<00:02:08.170> say<00:02:08.350> is

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
just learning how to compare I'd say is

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.160 
just learning how to compare I'd say is
there<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.100> faster<00:02:09.369> way<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:10.000> deciding<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.750> and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
there a faster way of deciding that and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.800 
there a faster way of deciding that and
the<00:02:11.530> answer<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.920> probably<00:02:12.100> no<00:02:12.810> everybody's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the answer is probably no everybody's

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:14.970 
the answer is probably no everybody's
different<00:02:14.020> everybody<00:02:14.620> has<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.770> different

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
different everybody has a different

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.060 
different everybody has a different
amount<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:16.510> moment<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.380> photographer

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
amount of that moment the photographer

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.680 
amount of that moment the photographer
and<00:02:18.250> them<00:02:18.430> all<00:02:18.640> coming<00:02:18.880> together<00:02:19.090> at<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> same

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
and them all coming together at the same

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.790 
and them all coming together at the same
time<00:02:19.959> it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
time it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.770 
time it
how<00:02:21.400> many<00:02:21.550> people<00:02:21.820> here<00:02:21.940> thought<00:02:22.210> about<00:02:22.510> gee<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
how many people here thought about gee I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.140 
how many people here thought about gee I
think<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> close<00:02:23.500> recipe<00:02:23.950> but<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:25.060> know

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
think to a close recipe but you know

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.540 
think to a close recipe but you know
interesting<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.410> having<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.220> keep<00:02:27.370> it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
interesting it's like having to keep it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.210 
interesting it's like having to keep it
here<00:02:27.820> so<00:02:28.540> it's<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.530> really<00:02:29.830> good<00:02:30.010> thing<00:02:30.190> to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
here so it's a really good thing to

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.060 
here so it's a really good thing to
start<00:02:30.580> studying<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:31.270> know<00:02:31.440> from<00:02:32.440> probably

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
start studying you know from probably

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.890 
start studying you know from probably
where<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.400> start<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:33.790> by<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.150> love<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
where you start is just by the love of

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.570 
where you start is just by the love of
magazines<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.830> looking<00:02:36.220> great

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
magazines and looking great

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.880 
magazines and looking great
photographs<00:02:37.330> deciding<00:02:38.320> what<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.620> think

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
photographs deciding what you think

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.240 
photographs deciding what you think
looks<00:02:39.070> really<00:02:39.250> good<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.180> then<00:02:40.510> now<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
looks really good and then now that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.380 
looks really good and then now that
everything<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.370> digital<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.940> can<00:02:43.000> take<00:02:43.270> your

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
everything is digital you can take your

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.270 
everything is digital you can take your
own<00:02:43.510> digital<00:02:43.690> pictures<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.830> should<00:02:45.070> really

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
own digital pictures you should really

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.700 
own digital pictures you should really
be<00:02:45.460> thinking<00:02:45.940> about<00:02:46.060> at<00:02:46.480> least<00:02:46.810> starting<00:02:47.530> to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
be thinking about at least starting to

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.960 
be thinking about at least starting to
get<00:02:47.830> some<00:02:48.100> sense<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.460> taking<00:02:48.670> digital

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
get some sense of taking digital

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.670 
get some sense of taking digital
pictures<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.600> your<00:02:49.750> work<00:02:49.870> or<00:02:50.140> things<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.470> you

those are three completely different

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.640 
those are three completely different
things

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
things

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
in that world of photography you have to

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.620 
in that world of photography you have to
learn<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:13.930> see<00:03:14.470> things<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.160> sort<00:03:15.520> of

learn to see things and sort of
emotionally<00:03:16.630> translate<00:03:17.110> into<00:03:17.380> what<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.710> might

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
emotionally translate into what it might

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:29.250 
emotionally translate into what it might
look<00:03:18.040> like<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.250> picture<00:03:27.930> did<00:03:28.930> you<00:03:29.050> talk<00:03:29.230> to

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260

look like a picture did you talk to
today<00:03:29.500> about<00:03:29.590> what<00:03:30.010> our<00:03:30.040> inspiration<00:03:30.610> was<00:03:30.640> for

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
today about what our inspiration was for

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.170 
today about what our inspiration was for
this<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:32.650> caption<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.700> when<00:03:33.880> you<00:03:33.970> might

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
this really caption so when you might

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:46.119 
this really caption so when you might
tell<00:03:34.510> what<00:03:35.350> do<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.500> think<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:36.040> was<00:03:37.680> texture

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:46.129 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.210 

color<00:03:47.090> yeah<00:03:47.750> it<00:03:48.439> was<00:03:48.620> really<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:49.010> mean

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
color yeah it was really I mean

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.550 
color yeah it was really I mean
sometimes<00:03:49.730> it's<00:03:49.939> like<00:03:50.150> we<00:03:50.599> talked<00:03:51.140> about<00:03:51.260> last

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
sometimes it's like we talked about last

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.589 
sometimes it's like we talked about last
time<00:03:51.709> where<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.129> a<00:03:52.220> lot<00:03:52.519> of<00:03:52.670> really<00:03:53.030> specific

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
time where it's a lot of really specific

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.619 
time where it's a lot of really specific
things<00:03:53.780> like<00:03:54.049> photography<00:03:54.560> or<00:03:55.400> like<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.120> band

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
things like photography or like a band

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.229 
things like photography or like a band
or<00:03:57.140> something<00:03:57.379> really<00:03:57.829> specific<00:03:58.370> some<00:03:59.030> kind

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
or something really specific some kind

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.809 
or something really specific some kind
of<00:03:59.299> art<00:03:59.510> something<00:04:00.019> in<00:04:00.110> nature<00:04:00.370> but<00:04:01.370> sometimes

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
of art something in nature but sometimes

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.850 
of art something in nature but sometimes
it's<00:04:02.000> really<00:04:02.390> just<00:04:03.019> kind<00:04:03.200> of<00:04:03.290> more<00:04:03.440> obvious

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
it's really just kind of more obvious

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.610 
it's really just kind of more obvious
and<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.129> think<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.610> was<00:04:04.790> we<00:04:05.659> knew<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:06.019> wanted<00:04:06.200> a

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
and I think it was we knew we wanted a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.789 
and I think it was we knew we wanted a
it<00:04:07.400> was<00:04:07.549> a<00:04:07.579> spring<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.450> what's<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.959> most<00:04:09.140> what

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
it was a spring so what's the most what

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.210 
it was a spring so what's the most what
do<00:04:09.859> you<00:04:09.920> like<00:04:10.280> nuts<00:04:10.519> right<00:04:10.730> like<00:04:11.420> spring

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
do you like nuts right like spring

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.880 
do you like nuts right like spring
flower

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:26.570 

flowers<00:04:16.890> what<00:04:17.280> else<00:04:17.400> I<00:04:24.740> think<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:26.010> spring

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
flowers what else I think that spring

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.450 
flowers what else I think that spring
always<00:04:26.850> reminds<00:04:27.540> us<00:04:27.630> of<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.990> color<00:04:28.280> winter<00:04:29.280> is

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
always reminds us of the color winter is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.490 
always reminds us of the color winter is
always<00:04:29.820> kind<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.270> a<00:04:30.390> dark<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.840> not<00:04:31.110> colorful

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
always kind of a dark and not colorful

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.000 
always kind of a dark and not colorful
time<00:04:31.860> especially<00:04:32.760> here<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:34.200> we<00:04:34.410> always<00:04:34.680> start

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
time especially here so we always start

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.980 
time especially here so we always start
thinking<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.580> color<00:04:35.820> when<00:04:36.240> we<00:04:36.419> think<00:04:36.870> about

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
thinking of color when we think about

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.770 
thinking of color when we think about
spring<00:04:37.669> so<00:04:38.669> we<00:04:38.700> kind<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.120> did<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.360> same<00:04:39.390> thing

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
spring so we kind of did the same thing

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.360 
spring so we kind of did the same thing
we<00:04:39.900> sat<00:04:40.110> down<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.440> was<00:04:40.890> the<00:04:41.010> first<00:04:41.220> thing<00:04:41.310> that

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
we sat down it was the first thing that

00:04:41.370 --> 00:05:03.050 
we sat down it was the first thing that
came<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.790> us<00:04:41.820> color<00:04:43.730> for<00:04:44.730> the<00:05:01.640> spring<00:05:02.640> is

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
came to us color for the spring is

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.980 
came to us color for the spring is
cheerful<00:05:03.660> and<00:05:03.900> happy<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:05.010> sunny<00:05:05.750> so<00:05:06.750> we

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
cheerful and happy and sunny so we

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.360 
cheerful and happy and sunny so we
wanted<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.440> have<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.950> bunch<00:05:08.100> of<00:05:08.250> different

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
wanted to have a bunch of different

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.090 
wanted to have a bunch of different
saturations<00:05:08.730> of<00:05:09.240> orange<00:05:09.650> doing<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.710> unrest

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
saturations of orange doing it unrest

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.520 
saturations of orange doing it unrest
because<00:05:11.790> there's<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.090> bug<00:05:12.330> because<00:05:12.690> really<00:05:13.080> red

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
because there's a bug because really red

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.190 
because there's a bug because really red
at<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.830> roots<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.580> muddy<00:05:15.390> on<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.810> antigen

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
at the roots and muddy on the antigen

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.170 
at the roots and muddy on the antigen
you're<00:05:16.350> supposed<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.710> say<00:05:16.980> that's<00:05:17.850> really

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
you're supposed to say that's really

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:29.520 
you're supposed to say that's really
ugly<00:05:20.660> so<00:05:21.660> why<00:05:21.900> does<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.110> happen

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:38.149 

you<00:05:30.530> get<00:05:30.680> hundreds<00:05:31.070> but<00:05:31.310> why

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.219 

so<00:05:38.459> you<00:05:38.550> lived<00:05:38.819> it<00:05:38.969> too<00:05:39.149> much<00:05:39.300> of<00:05:39.509> the<00:05:39.689> ribs<00:05:39.929> and

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
so you lived it too much of the ribs and

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.499 
so you lived it too much of the ribs and
got<00:05:40.439> warmer<00:05:41.309> charisma<00:05:41.819> not<00:05:42.029> enough<00:05:42.300> of<00:05:42.419> the

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
got warmer charisma not enough of the

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.109
