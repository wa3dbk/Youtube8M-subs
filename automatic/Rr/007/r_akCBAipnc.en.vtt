00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.090
 humble cottage 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.550

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.000
 I found singing and happy working 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.720
 in the land where few were born 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.960
 trees 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.600
 Jaimito full of curiosity approached 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.880
 ask what he was doing 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.670

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.180
 the trees and plants are not only for 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.580

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.049
 the fairy sing and fly from here to there 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.990
 sowing seeds in the ground 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.390
 taking note of everything he did and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.880
 so the hours went by so fast that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.650
 he realized how late it was when 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.960
 I saw that she was hiding the sun 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.240
 jaimito ran as fast as he could 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.750
 home your mom was already waiting for you 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.489

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.580
 list 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860
 jaimito took advantage and took out the little seeds 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.660
 that the fairy gave him along with a 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.700
 paper where I had the list of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.980
 things that I had to do to carry 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.680
 out your help plan find a place 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.290
 suitable for planting your vegetables 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.570
 flower pots planters plastic trays 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.380
 to objects that seem unnecessary 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.610
 They can serve as yogurt containers 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.610
 select the vegetables that you most 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.590
 like but a lot of eye to be born 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.270
 it has to depend on the seasons of 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.760
 year and where do you live 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.840
 Spring and summer are perfect for 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.200
 sow everywhere 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.120
 prepare your compost with poles when 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.610
 some living beings like worms 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.819
 bacteria and fungi decompose the garbage 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.680
 and convert it into land is very easy 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.900
 you just have to separate the garbage 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.750
 organic that are the waste of fruits 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.459
 vegetable or egg shells and put it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.320
 in a place of your garden stirred with 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.780
 fallen leaves of trees 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.040
 Remember you should not have plastics cardboard 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.740
 glass or paper 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.930

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.900
 cover those with soil waters and apply 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.579
 compost usually with a hose 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.040
 or a sprayer so that the water does not 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.829
 come out squirts water frequently and with 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.389

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.430
 compost over the land of your 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.480
 pot that will help the earth 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.480
 feed and germinate 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.990
 collect your vegetables for this 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.970

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.810
 of wood to prepare your vegetables 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.330
 I look for plastic containers that 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.420
 serve as pots began to gather 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.550
 in a bag pasture leaves of trees and 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.050

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.600
 mix them with the earth 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.150
 jaimito created his own compost with 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.790
 organic things and let her rest 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.980
 days with a bit of land in the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.620
 plastic containers and there he put the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.320
 little seeds after a few days 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.440
 little seeds began to germinate giving 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.360
 life to some small plants 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.000
