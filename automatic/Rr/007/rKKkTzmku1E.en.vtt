00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
ask for a lift and bs is case I've been

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.050 
ask for a lift and bs is case I've been
waiting<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.290> ages<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:59.130> can't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
waiting for this for ages I can't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.459 
waiting for this for ages I can't
remember<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.360> specs<00:02:00.659> right<00:02:01.020> off<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> top<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
remember the specs right off the top of

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.840 
remember the specs right off the top of
my<00:02:01.560> head<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.950> i'll<00:02:02.340> probably<00:02:02.549> do<00:02:02.820> another

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
my head but i'll probably do another

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.600 
my head but i'll probably do another
video<00:02:03.270> explaining<00:02:04.049> specs<00:02:05.040> probably<00:02:05.520> each

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
video explaining specs probably each

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
video explaining specs probably each
component<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.540> goes<00:02:06.659> along<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.930> think<00:02:07.200> I'd

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
component as it goes along I think I'd

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.919 
component as it goes along I think I'd
be<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> better<00:02:07.590> thing<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> yeah<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> got

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
be a better thing to do so yeah I got

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.070 
be a better thing to do so yeah I got
the<00:02:10.170> sharkoon<00:02:11.069> t9<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:12.000> value<00:02:12.360> case<00:02:12.599> which<00:02:12.930> is

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the sharkoon t9 of value case which is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.570 
the sharkoon t9 of value case which is
the<00:02:13.230> green

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
the green

don't have a camera which side go has a
camera<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.650> not<00:02:36.710> going<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.010> be

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
camera but it's just not going to be

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.800 
camera but it's just not going to be
able<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.310> record<00:02:37.580> easily<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.690> no

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
able to record easily and I have no

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.390 
able to record easily and I have no
battery<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.320> my<00:02:39.350> camera<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:39.950> costs<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.280> lot

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
battery for my camera and it costs a lot

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.960 
battery for my camera and it costs a lot
to<00:02:40.520> buy<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> new<00:02:40.880> one<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.800> so<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:43.100> could<00:02:43.700> use<00:02:43.730> my

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
to buy a new one and so I could use my

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.200 
to buy a new one and so I could use my
phone<00:02:44.300> but<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.960> crappy<00:02:45.200> Nokia<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.210> that's

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.210 
phone but it's a crappy Nokia and that's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.260 
phone but it's a crappy Nokia and that's
not<00:02:47.390> going<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.630> be<00:02:47.660> able<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.170> record<00:02:48.470> well<00:02:48.740> and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
not going to be able to record well and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.430 
not going to be able to record well and
so<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.330> will<00:02:50.600> try<00:02:50.720> my<00:02:50.810> best<00:02:50.960> guess<00:02:51.410> some

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
so I will try my best guess some

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.680 
so I will try my best guess some
unboxings<00:02:52.100> or<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> PC<00:02:52.790> building<00:02:53.150> video<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:53.600> I'd

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
unboxings or a PC building video but I'd

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.060 
unboxings or a PC building video but I'd
really<00:02:53.840> like<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.110> do<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.350> pc<00:02:54.620> building<00:02:54.980> why

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
really like to do the pc building why

samsung<00:03:04.459> harddrive<00:03:04.850> i<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.030> believe<00:03:05.260> which<00:03:06.260> is

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
samsung harddrive i do believe which is

SATA 2 3 gigabytes per second but i was

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.830 
SATA 2 3 gigabytes per second but i was

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
going to go for SATA free but because

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.170 
going to go for SATA free but because
it's<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.050> mechanical<00:03:12.200> drive<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:13.190> won't<00:03:13.520> use<00:03:14.000> up

frustrated<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:35.870> his<00:03:35.959> hard<00:03:36.140> drives<00:03:36.350> anyway

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
frustrated of his hard drives anyway

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.140 
frustrated of his hard drives anyway
it's<00:03:38.989> got<00:03:39.290> 50<00:03:39.739> megabytes<00:03:40.130> of<00:03:40.340> cash<00:03:40.610> read<00:03:40.910> write

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
it's got 50 megabytes of cash read write

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.229 
it's got 50 megabytes of cash read write
speed<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.170> runs<00:03:42.410> at<00:03:42.760> 7200<00:03:43.760> revolutions

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
speed and it runs at 7200 revolutions

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.259 
speed and it runs at 7200 revolutions
per<00:03:44.330> minute<00:03:44.860> so<00:03:45.860> it<00:03:46.280> isn't<00:03:46.640> about<00:03:46.790> hard<00:03:47.060> drive

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
per minute so it isn't about hard drive

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.080 
per minute so it isn't about hard drive
and<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:48.230> case<00:03:48.410> i<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.860> has<00:03:49.670> these<00:03:49.970> little

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
and the case i have has these little

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.030 
and the case i have has these little
rubber<00:03:50.269> mounts<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.080> it<00:03:51.380> cancels<00:03:51.680> out<00:03:51.950> any

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
rubber mounts so it cancels out any

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.400 
rubber mounts so it cancels out any
vibration<00:03:52.670> created<00:03:53.390> by<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.690> hard<00:03:53.959> drives<00:03:54.200> and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
vibration created by the hard drives and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.410 
vibration created by the hard drives and
no<00:03:54.500> noise<00:03:54.700> which<00:03:55.700> isn't<00:03:55.970> bad<00:03:56.000> i've<00:03:56.269> been
