00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 here is a small beach 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.300
 heaped up and there I will soon 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.100

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.500
 Yesterday I got my pinpoint 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.579
 actually found a cent and 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:58.370

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:02.550

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:37.119

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.720
 look what else is so right 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:45.970

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.850
 surface the crude so no wonder there 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.250

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.830

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.440
 Under water I would like to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 go in but have a problem 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.200
