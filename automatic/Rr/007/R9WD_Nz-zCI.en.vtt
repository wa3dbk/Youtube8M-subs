showing you that in the video ahead

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.470 
showing you that in the video ahead
so<00:02:09.920> let's<00:02:10.100> see<00:02:10.280> what<00:02:10.459> we<00:02:10.610> have<00:02:10.759> in<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.150> startup

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
so let's see what we have in the startup

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480 
so let's see what we have in the startup
guide<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.290> here<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.620> some<00:02:12.800> important

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
guide so here you see some important

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.550 
guide so here you see some important
information<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> power<00:02:14.510> output<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.440> they

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
information the power output so they

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.930 
information the power output so they
have<00:02:15.650> mentioned<00:02:16.040> here<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.220> for<00:02:16.700> about

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
have mentioned here that for about

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.850 
have mentioned here that for about
pora's<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.630> can<00:02:17.780> give<00:02:17.959> an<00:02:18.080> output<00:02:18.290> of<00:02:18.680> one

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
pora's it can give an output of one

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.920 
pora's it can give an output of one
point<00:02:19.069> five<00:02:19.310> amperes<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.540> eight<00:02:20.690> hours

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
point five amperes and for eight hours

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.720 
point five amperes and for eight hours
it<00:02:21.080> will<00:02:21.230> give<00:02:21.380> an<00:02:21.500> output<00:02:21.620> of<00:02:22.040> five<00:02:22.550> hundred

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
it will give an output of five hundred

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.660 
it will give an output of five hundred
milli<00:02:23.150> ampere<00:02:23.540> so<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.500> will<00:02:24.740> determine<00:02:25.160> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
milli ampere so that will determine the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.790 
milli ampere so that will determine the
volume<00:02:26.060> in<00:02:26.180> which<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.540> operates<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.620> thing

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
volume in which it operates so one thing

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.710 
volume in which it operates so one thing
to<00:02:27.830> consider<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:28.790> keeping<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.209> simple<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.600> I

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
to consider so keeping it simple if I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.660 
to consider so keeping it simple if I
have<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.959> explain<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.680> can<00:02:30.890> say<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.250> for

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
have to explain this I can say that for

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.729 
have to explain this I can say that for
for<00:02:31.880> ours<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.300> will<00:02:32.480> operate<00:02:32.660> on<00:02:33.050> full<00:02:33.380> volumes

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
for ours it will operate on full volumes

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.770 
for ours it will operate on full volumes
and<00:02:33.920> little<00:02:34.670> volume<00:02:34.850> change<00:02:35.239> will<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.540> seen

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
and little volume change will be seen

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.930 
and little volume change will be seen
for<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.350> rest<00:02:36.530> hey<00:02:37.010> tars<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> total

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
for the rest hey tars so the total

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.000 
for the rest hey tars so the total
playback<00:02:38.390> time<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.930> this<00:02:39.110> speaker<00:02:39.800> gives

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
playback time that this speaker gives

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.190 
playback time that this speaker gives
you<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.550> 12<00:02:40.819> hours<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.690> well<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.989> is<00:02:42.080> all

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
you is of 12 hours so well that is all

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.990 
you is of 12 hours so well that is all
you<00:02:42.320> get<00:02:42.470> inside<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.860> box<00:02:43.040> let's<00:02:43.610> keep<00:02:43.850> all

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
you get inside the box let's keep all

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.310 
you get inside the box let's keep all
the<00:02:44.120> things<00:02:44.150> aside<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.780> let's<00:02:45.050> take<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
the things aside and let's take a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.350 
the things aside and let's take a
physical<00:02:45.950> look<00:02:46.130> at<00:02:46.340> how<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.880> build<00:02:47.239> quality

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
physical look at how the build quality

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.840 
physical look at how the build quality
of<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.900> portable<00:02:48.650> speaker<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.519> see

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
makes it very small and compact so I

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.619

read the build quality a 9 out of 10 if

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.990 
read the build quality a 9 out of 10 if
we<00:06:41.930> talk<00:06:42.110> about<00:06:42.229> the<00:06:42.469> sound<00:06:42.710> quality<00:06:43.159> I<00:06:43.400> really

did<00:06:44.180> not<00:06:44.330> like<00:06:44.389> it<00:06:44.840> so<00:06:44.870> much<00:06:45.199> even<00:06:45.830> if<00:06:45.979> it<00:06:46.340> is<00:06:46.520> a

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
did not like it so much even if it is a

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.459 
did not like it so much even if it is a
10<00:06:46.789> watt<00:06:47.030> speaker<00:06:47.479> it<00:06:47.719> does<00:06:47.900> not<00:06:48.080> sound<00:06:48.319> like

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:48.469

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:52.219 
playback with just three hours of

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:53.770 
playback with just three hours of
charging<00:06:52.520> so<00:06:52.729> it<00:06:52.819> will<00:06:52.969> completely<00:06:53.330> charge<00:06:53.659> in

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780
