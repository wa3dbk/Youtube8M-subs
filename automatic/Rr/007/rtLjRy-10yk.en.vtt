00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
those shorter runs where the bulky 20

thing that's great about the soft lask

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
thing that's great about the soft lask
is<00:01:12.710> despite<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> fact<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.130> it's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
is despite the fact that it's

is despite the fact that it's
lightweight<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.240> durable<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:16.220> you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
lightweight it's really durable and you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.830 
lightweight it's really durable and you
can<00:01:17.369> squeeze<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:17.970> compress<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.360> all<00:01:18.659> day

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
can squeeze it and compress it all day

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.440 
can squeeze it and compress it all day
long<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.380> no<00:01:19.619> loss<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> water<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.270> thing

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
long with no loss of water but the thing

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.230 
long with no loss of water but the thing
that's<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.780> nice<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.000> very

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that's really nice is that this is very

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.219 
that's really nice is that this is very
functional<00:01:25.130> quick<00:01:26.130> hands-free<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:28.049> gain

functional quick hands-free way to gain

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.740 
functional quick hands-free way to gain
water<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> despite<00:01:29.400> valve<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.600> see

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
water by a despite valve as you can see

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.969 
water by a despite valve as you can see
right<00:01:30.930> there<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.409> squeeze<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> pipe

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
right there you can squeeze the pipe

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.679 
right there you can squeeze the pipe
valve<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.979> hands-free<00:01:35.689> instant

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
valve and you have hands-free instant

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.940 
valve and you have hands-free instant

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
access to water

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
access to water
despite<00:01:38.820> being<00:01:39.090> able<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.689> compress<00:01:40.020> this

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
despite being able to compress this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.280 
despite being able to compress this
flask<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.579> lose<00:01:41.790> anything<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.990> once

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
flask and not lose anything so once

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.969 
flask and not lose anything so once
again<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.280> nice<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> functional

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
again that is really nice and functional

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
again that is really nice and functional
i'm<00:01:46.979> compared<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> traditional<00:01:47.880> hand<00:01:48.450> out

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
i'm compared to the traditional hand out

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.749 
i'm compared to the traditional hand out
where<00:01:48.899> maybe<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.590> twist<00:01:49.829> twist<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
where maybe you have to twist twist the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.780 
where maybe you have to twist twist the
cap<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.180> pull<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.390> out<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.110> water

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
cap or pull it out to get that water

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.749 
cap or pull it out to get that water
this<00:01:53.790> frees<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:54.689> hands<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.040> did<00:01:56.460> find

this frees up your hands now I did find

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.560 
this frees up your hands now I did find
for<00:01:57.149> me<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:58.399> prefer<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.700> simplicity<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
for me I prefer the simplicity of a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
for me I prefer the simplicity of a
handheld<00:02:00.899> bottle<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:02.189> being<00:02:02.490> able<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.850> fill

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
handheld bottle just being able to fill

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.650 
handheld bottle just being able to fill
it<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.689> slip<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.110> on<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.469> off

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
it up and slip it on and off

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.700 
it up and slip it on and off
and<00:02:05.930> quickly<00:02:06.140> go<00:02:06.670> with<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.150> took<00:02:08.300> some

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
and quickly go with this it took some

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.120 
and quickly go with this it took some
getting<00:02:09.710> used<00:02:09.890> to

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
getting used to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.360 
getting used to
in<00:02:10.760> terms<00:02:11.000> of<00:02:11.270> removing<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.220> securing<00:02:13.220> it
