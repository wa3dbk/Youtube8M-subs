battle so this is fleet 11 before you
start<00:03:05.389> you<00:03:05.569> want<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.870> strategically<00:03:06.430> kind<00:03:07.430> of

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
start you want to strategically kind of

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.990 
start you want to strategically kind of
think<00:03:08.359> about<00:03:08.510> how<00:03:09.380> you're<00:03:09.650> gonna<00:03:09.709> go<00:03:10.069> about<00:03:10.340> to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
think about how you're gonna go about to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.140 
think about how you're gonna go about to
doing<00:03:11.450> this<00:03:14.109> now<00:03:15.109> what<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.350> think<00:03:15.859> is<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.549> think

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
doing this now what I think is I think

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.270 
doing this now what I think is I think
what<00:03:17.540> we<00:03:17.720> should<00:03:17.900> do<00:03:18.049> is<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.650> from<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
what we should do is go in from the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.420 
what we should do is go in from the
bottom<00:03:19.519> down<00:03:20.180> here<00:03:20.620> slide<00:03:21.620> along<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.220> way

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
bottom down here slide along this way

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.270 
bottom down here slide along this way
and<00:03:22.700> then<00:03:22.790> fly<00:03:23.060> up<00:03:23.269> here<00:03:23.630> kill<00:03:24.350> this<00:03:24.650> one<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
and then fly up here kill this one and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.539 
and then fly up here kill this one and
then<00:03:26.269> we'll<00:03:26.480> attack<00:03:26.780> from<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.139> back<00:03:27.549> alright

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
then we'll attack from the back alright

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.720 
then we'll attack from the back alright
sounds<00:03:28.940> like<00:03:28.970> good<00:03:29.150> idea<00:03:29.480> let's<00:03:29.750> try<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.019> out

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
sounds like good idea let's try it out

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.479 
sounds like good idea let's try it out
first<00:03:31.730> of<00:03:31.940> all<00:03:32.090> we're<00:03:32.359> gonna<00:03:32.480> send<00:03:32.870> our

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.559 
first of all we're gonna send our
defense<00:03:36.549> or<00:03:37.549> maybe<00:03:37.790> not<00:03:38.030> all<00:03:38.269> right<00:03:38.359> let's

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
defense or maybe not all right let's

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.160 
defense or maybe not all right let's
zoom<00:03:38.720> out

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
zoom out

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:55.720

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
this is actually a better plan than

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.790 
this is actually a better plan than
before<00:04:03.210> so<00:04:03.480> our<00:04:03.600> dragons<00:04:04.170> kind<00:04:04.530> of<00:04:04.590> knew<00:04:04.680> what

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800
