00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.170
 Hello everyone, I am holding one more in my hands 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.200
 the package that came to me on ebay 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.360
 hose as leisurely days about 50 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.789
 when did the parcel finally start to reach 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.320
 I know the term 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 here I ordered the principle of cute pig it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.580
 capacitors set of 10 pieces to me 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.890
 In principle, only one was needed, but they 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.170
 by the piece were not sold so I had to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.550
 take a whole set 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.589
 cost, in principle, they are only 150 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.839
 rubles can the rest of the day a thing for 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.670
 Nothing useful of course I think maybe 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.839
 it was to find them and in our city but for 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.640
 this one had to go out 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.770
 look for me to do this at all 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.930
 wanted and they were not at all in a hurry 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 so I just ordered them on ebay forgot 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.469
 about them in general, what was needed was not in it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
 in order to replace similar 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.910
 failed condenser in fry 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.680
 for a certain company differ in one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.329
 beautiful day this sub began to ask 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.329
 these sounds now show what 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.860
 I am of course a distant similar technique 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.330
 disassembling it first nothing wrong 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.920
 and did not notice the fact that dota 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.680
 capacitors have been soundly for years 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.430
 some kind of glue but a little clearing it from 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.229
 glue saw that he was blown away 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.140
 okay, I shook the condenser right away 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.729
 I hope that it was all about him 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.830
 the inside of the subwoofer holds just 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.960
 on four screws and presented as 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.880
 small circuit board by the way very 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.220
 Cheap in appearance but in the best traditions 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.570
 Chinese technology on and generally somehow everything 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.520
 does not look very neat 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.310
 Well, actually here is the highest failure 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.200
 capacitor on the board it was soldered here 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.479
 in this place where negative contact 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.069
 shown in white semicircle this is the most 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.340
 large capacitor on the entire dress 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.019
 with a capacity of 25 volts 2200 microfarad 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 you can see that the top is a bit 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.220
 bloated but it doesn't rush so much into 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.920
 eyes even if you compare it again 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.110
 the capacitor is immediately noticeable below 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.880
 not so bombanul bombanulo itself 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.340
 we will change it to a new warder us 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.049
 from a similar capacity yes i know that 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.420
 now do something to dig the eyes but 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.100
 legs immediately bite off for convenience and so 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.799
 as i don't have side cutters have to do 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.140
 like this pliers and the same was 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.400
 not the best idea otcomlyu hands but 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.670
 principle on the service center I and not 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.980
 pretend 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.140
 so it remains not only to solder a new 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.790
 the capacitor in place of the old thing 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.599
 the main thing is to observe the polarity from him 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.599
 once again bombed 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.080
 Well, somehow, so pretty 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.580
 Elementary remains for me only everything 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.250
 back to collect and look at 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.900
 the result of the board is back attached to 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.610
 plastic holder with a nut 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.090
 which is screwed to the mini jack 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.239
 plug in and insert the whole thing in 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.739
 subwoofer housing and screwed back 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.050
 connect the speakers for test 5 to the player 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.580
 reluctance me this move sistemnik so 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.230
 the speakers included all these goals 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.090
 no sound is a good sign 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.290
 turn on the music to make sure 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.290
 their ultimate performance 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.709
 were accepted 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.599
 well everything works fine now and all this 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.400
 I had to replace some capacitor 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.080
 Well, please thank you all for all 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.849
 viewing put your thumbs up 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.390
 comment and subscribe 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.390
