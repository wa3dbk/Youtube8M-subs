what in Jerry Jones is 10 year

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.420 
what in Jerry Jones is 10 year
especially<00:01:51.509> since<00:01:51.930> bill<00:01:52.170> left<00:01:52.470> leads<00:01:53.100> me<00:01:53.310> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
especially since bill left leads me to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.359 
especially since bill left leads me to
believe<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.329> pick<00:01:54.600> 20<00:01:55.140> 35<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.950> 45

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
believe that if they pick 20 35 and 45

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.370 
believe that if they pick 20 35 and 45
that<00:01:56.909> they<00:01:57.030> would<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.299> got<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.540> right<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that they would have got it right so the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.350 
that they would have got it right so the
truth<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> exactly<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.969> with

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
truth is they got it exactly right with

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.660 
truth is they got it exactly right with
this<00:02:00.719> player<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.860> reason<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.340> gallery

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
this player and the reason they gallery

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.300

their particular sides of the field then

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.059 
their particular sides of the field then
that<00:03:06.569> means<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.079> can<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.500> safeties

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that means you can have the safeties

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.130 
that means you can have the safeties
that<00:03:08.489> can<00:03:08.670> concentrate<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.720> middle<00:03:10.019> of

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
that can concentrate on the middle of

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.990 
that can concentrate on the middle of
the<00:03:10.230> field<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.860> that's<00:03:11.370> where<00:03:11.670> we<00:03:11.790> saw

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the field and that's where we saw

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.420 
the field and that's where we saw
Philadelphia<00:03:12.870> tearing<00:03:13.379> us<00:03:13.530> alive<00:03:13.920> that's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
Philadelphia tearing us alive that's

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.670 
Philadelphia tearing us alive that's
where<00:03:14.610> we<00:03:14.730> saw<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:14.970> Giants<00:03:15.510> toasting<00:03:16.410> us<00:03:16.560> to

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
where we saw the Giants toasting us to

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.370 
where we saw the Giants toasting us to
death<00:03:16.920> all<00:03:17.190> last<00:03:18.090> season<00:03:18.389> so<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:18.989> you<00:03:19.049> can

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
death all last season so now you can

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.080 
death all last season so now you can
concentrate<00:03:19.530> your<00:03:20.010> two<00:03:20.160> safeties<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.670> all

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090

your linebackers on the middle of the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.800 
your linebackers on the middle of the
field<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.670> doubling<00:03:24.150> up<00:03:24.329> on<00:03:24.450> slots

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
field not just on doubling up on slots

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.629 
field not just on doubling up on slots
and<00:03:24.989> tight<00:03:25.170> ends<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.650> running<00:03:25.680> backs<00:03:26.160> but

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.900 
also to force the run situation in run
defense<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:31.889> you've<00:03:32.160> got<00:03:32.310> linebackers

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
defense so now you've got linebackers

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.520 
defense so now you've got linebackers

will help inside you've got the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.379 
will help inside you've got the
defensive<00:03:35.130> lineman<00:03:35.579> who<00:03:35.940> don't<00:03:36.209> necessarily

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
defensive lineman who don't necessarily

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.809 
defensive lineman who don't necessarily
have<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> worry<00:03:37.230> about<00:03:37.349> okay<00:03:37.500> should<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.579> get

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
have to worry about okay should I get

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.339 
have to worry about okay should I get
there<00:03:39.030> sooner<00:03:39.329> because<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.810> know<00:03:39.870> these<00:03:40.139> guys

back here are going to be for 30 mins

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.360 
back here are going to be for 30 mins
should<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:43.079> take<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.380> chance<00:03:43.590> now<00:03:43.950> they<00:03:44.099> can<00:03:44.280> be

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
should I take a chance now they can be

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.069 
should I take a chance now they can be
very<00:03:44.400> solid<00:03:45.150> in<00:03:45.269> whether<00:03:45.450> they<00:03:45.569> can<00:03:45.630> do<00:03:45.900> and

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
very solid in whether they can do and

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.009 
very solid in whether they can do and
also<00:03:46.440> Ryan<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.609> kind<00:03:47.849> of<00:03:47.910> slow<00:03:48.180> down<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.720> all

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
also Ryan can kind of slow down on all

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.409 
also Ryan can kind of slow down on all
the<00:03:49.200> gambling<00:03:49.769> as<00:03:49.919> a<00:03:49.950> defensive<00:03:50.489> coach<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:51.329> he

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
the gambling as a defensive coach now he

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.420 
the gambling as a defensive coach now he
can<00:03:51.690> look<00:03:51.840> be<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.019> little<00:03:52.380> bit<00:03:52.560> more<00:03:52.739> solid<00:03:53.250> as

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
can look be a little bit more solid as

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.849 
can look be a little bit more solid as
far<00:03:53.790> as<00:03:53.880> his<00:03:54.030> scheme<00:03:54.389> is<00:03:54.660> concerned<00:03:55.139> and<00:03:55.349> maybe

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
far as his scheme is concerned and maybe

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.640 
far as his scheme is concerned and maybe
a<00:03:56.190> little<00:03:56.250> less<00:03:56.910> confusion<00:03:57.690> in<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.230> second<00:03:58.560> a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
a little less confusion in the second a

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.920 
a little less confusion in the second a

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
position if the defense can be better

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.580 
position if the defense can be better
they<00:05:45.849> give<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.539> offense<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.990> ball<00:05:47.169> in<00:05:47.349> better

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
they give the offense the ball in better

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.050 
they give the offense the ball in better
places<00:05:47.949> on<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.430> field<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.699> that<00:05:48.759> makes<00:05:48.970> it

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
places on the field and that makes it

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.370 
places on the field and that makes it
different<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.419> makes<00:05:49.659> a<00:05:49.780> difference<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.229> you

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
different that makes a difference if you

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.620 
different that makes a difference if you
look<00:05:50.590> at<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.830> new<00:05:50.979> york<00:05:51.220> giants<00:05:51.430> eli<00:05:52.030> manning

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
look at the new york giants eli manning

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.480 
look at the new york giants eli manning
it<00:05:52.780> took<00:05:52.990> him<00:05:53.139> a<00:05:53.199> while<00:05:53.349> to<00:05:53.409> learn<00:05:53.740> this<00:05:54.039> first

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
it took him a while to learn this first

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.890 
it took him a while to learn this first
of<00:05:54.610> all<00:05:54.639> he<00:05:54.759> had<00:05:54.849> great<00:05:55.030> wide<00:05:55.240> receivers<00:05:55.750> right

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
of all he had great wide receivers right

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.120 
of all he had great wide receivers right
so<00:05:56.020> he<00:05:56.080> didn't<00:05:56.320> have<00:05:56.349> to<00:05:56.470> force<00:05:56.800> anything

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
so he didn't have to force anything

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.159 
so he didn't have to force anything
anywhere<00:05:57.639> he<00:05:57.970> didn't<00:05:58.180> have<00:05:58.300> to<00:05:58.330> force<00:05:58.750> because

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
anywhere he didn't have to force because

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.740 
anywhere he didn't have to force because
he<00:05:59.380> knows<00:05:59.650> his<00:06:00.220> defense<00:06:00.729> has<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.090> ability<00:06:01.570> to

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
he knows his defense has the ability to
