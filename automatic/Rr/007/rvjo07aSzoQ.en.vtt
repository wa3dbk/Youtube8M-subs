00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.640
 on 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.680
 the guys come to a new video 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.020
 on a canal 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.860
 This time I want you one so to speak 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.320
 cod postfix was fix for the pc 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.210
 imagine 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.260
 there is a program for that there 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.560
 Is there really more or who? 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.910
 but I take this program unix 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.410
 or how to pronounce it no idea 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.410
 download link is of course in the video 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 description 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.210
 there you can his on the one hand you can 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 I can overclock its graphics card 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.610
 I just let a bit overclockers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.200
 slightly higher in the two at the number 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.710
 from a graphic has a bit more 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.390
 draufgepackt 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.350
 Well, and then there is such a value for you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.229
 easy framerate targets there it can be 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.770
 you can get his maximum fps how much the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.600
 select graphics card to select and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.580
 that is also the crucial point 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.740
 I found out that myself 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.580
 So I was always a maximum of sps 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.740
 leaf theo the big bank me between 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:34.890
 50 fps so 50 60 fps share some map 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 the fps went to 20 30 round 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.990
 since there is no idea I can not do it myself 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 to explain 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.310
 That's why I have a little bit 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.950
 have tested there 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.990
 this hook made and have to 45 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.979
 posed that way and then the sps stays 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.560
 permanently at 45 so even if I turn on 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.929
 this particular share on the map in 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.950
 where always so 20 30 ps train if I go there 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.600
 10 45 you can try it yourself 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.149
 creates meat with a graphics card 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.459
 those on 60 or something but 45 I think 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.930
 I still manageable 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.360
 only one thing is that it still is 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.880
 not this menu was if you have it 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.010
 So fix a bit already 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:28.280
 it stopped so it is not so 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.290
 extreme but is still annoying now 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.459
 yes as I said is the download link from 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.440
 This program is in the video 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.569
 description and I use it too 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.670
 still here this fps nonsense ev changer 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.040
 I can also start maniche because 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.950
 you always at 100 1 is still in the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.829
 video description plus my fps 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.380
 unlocker so then you have up to 125 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.350
 fps I use that too though I do 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.970
 not at the apps but then come it 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.010
 Something seems to work anyway 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.170
 That's why I use a performance 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.930
 I'll show you that then 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.489
 my ingame graphics settings so 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.410
 I 'm actually here on role models 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.709
 but now I do not have it to follow 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.239
 therefore there is my recording program 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.340
 I think that can not absorb 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.299
 So I'm actually 1080p so stand 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.190
 and full screen so now in the blind 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.299
 filter I have disabled brightness 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.430
 I was so relaxed but the 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.450
 I have graphics settings here on 16 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.880
 09 set a refresh rate 60 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.090
 hertz bissigen situations very important 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.630
 on make out then you more fps 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.609
 get picture quality high so i want 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.100
 yes not so with his schott quali 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:45.220
 At the moment we are not so average 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.530
 That's why I'm playing high 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.480
 depth of focus no screen space ambit 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.960
 no idea what it means from terrain 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.360
 partly also from anisotropic filtering 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.390
 I succeed BewegungsungsunschÃ¤rfen 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.890
 a distortion no-part of a bad one 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.960
 here I have shade from the can 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.870
 but you can lower on channel one can 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.710
 not on joker texture quality manually 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.130
 put 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.440
 now I have just a trailer the 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.010
 I meant it 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.180
 So here is texture quality 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.060
 manual I have already said one 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.570
 texture resolution normal normal 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.910
 map and also on normal 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:39.490
 mccollough resolution of the thing was 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:41.110
 Resolution also went as I said the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.430
 whole left in the video description 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.240
 and then please write me in the 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.810
 comments to 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.380
 whether it worked for you or too 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.510
 Not 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.160
 I would then at 1 on one 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.160
 like so rejoice skin
