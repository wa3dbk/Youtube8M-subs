00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:30.480 

those<00:03:02.260> are<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.530> best

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.820 

the<00:03:31.490> edges<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:33.020> that's<00:03:33.350> why<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.710> to

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
the edges here so that's why I have to

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.540 
the edges here so that's why I have to
stop<00:03:34.130> my<00:03:34.700> first<00:03:35.000> pan<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:35.960> do<00:03:36.830> this<00:03:37.040> bit<00:03:37.340> by<00:03:37.520> bit

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550
