there<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.780> several<00:02:51.959> factors<00:02:52.110> contributing

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
there are several factors contributing

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.660 
there are several factors contributing
to that<00:02:53.220> increase<00:02:53.819> in<00:02:54.090> volume<00:02:54.780> at<00:02:55.739> first<00:02:56.280> is

to that increase in volume at first is

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.600 
to that increase in volume at first is
that<00:02:56.700> Seton<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.980> seeking<00:02:58.980> level<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.370> trauma

that Seton is seeking level one trauma

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.160 
that Seton is seeking level one trauma
status<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:00.540> there's<00:03:00.720> been<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> large

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.830

in<00:03:17.220> addition<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.819> think<00:03:18.000> probably<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.299> biggest

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
difference is bringing the research and

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.789 
difference is bringing the research and

education center at Breckenridge was a
hospital<00:03:40.769> environment<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.790> converted

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
hospital environment so we converted

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.390 
hospital environment so we converted
that<00:03:42.629> hospital<00:03:43.109> environment<00:03:43.440> into<00:03:44.370> a

real patient care area it does resemble

real patient care area it does resemble
more<00:03:49.889> realistically<00:03:50.579> than<00:03:51.090> some<00:03:51.389> other<00:03:51.540> sim

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.289 
more realistically than some other sim
centers<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.919> country<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.790> we<00:03:53.880> have<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> wide

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
centers in the country so we have a wide

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.530 
centers in the country so we have a wide
variety<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:55.130> mannequins<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.430> very<00:03:57.299> dynamic

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
variety of mannequins a very dynamic

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.080 
variety of mannequins a very dynamic
space<00:03:58.169> that<00:03:58.410> can<00:03:58.739> be<00:03:58.919> converted<00:03:59.340> into<00:03:59.700> any

space that can be converted into any

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.360 
space that can be converted into any
type<00:04:00.389> of<00:04:00.419> clinical<00:04:01.319> area<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.919> feels<00:04:02.130> like<00:04:02.340> a

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
type of clinical area it feels like a

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.729 
type of clinical area it feels like a
hospital<00:04:02.660> because<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.590> so

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
hospital because it really is and so

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.309 
hospital because it really is and so
it's<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:05.040> great<00:04:05.250> place<00:04:05.579> for<00:04:06.120> training<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.139> next

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
it's a great place for training the next

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.190 
it's a great place for training the next
generation<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:08.250> physicians<00:04:09.200> nurses

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200

pharmacists<00:04:11.099> and<00:04:11.160> social<00:04:11.519> workers<00:04:11.880> and<00:04:11.910> we

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
pharmacists and social workers and we

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.520 
pharmacists and social workers and we
actually<00:04:12.299> bring<00:04:12.690> those<00:04:12.870> individuals

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
actually bring those individuals

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.250 
actually bring those individuals
together<00:04:13.940> in<00:04:14.940> learning<00:04:15.480> activities<00:04:16.049> at<00:04:16.229> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.530 

I<00:04:29.780> think<00:04:31.130> brackenridge<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.490> health<00:04:32.940> care<00:04:33.240> in

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
I think brackenridge in health care in

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.870 
I think brackenridge in health care in
this<00:04:33.600> town<00:04:34.170> is<00:04:34.890> where<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.280> rubber<00:04:35.400> meets<00:04:35.610> the

this town is where the rubber meets the

provide when we're involved in an

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.330 
provide when we're involved in an

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
academic environment in the Austin area

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.370 
academic environment in the Austin area
was<00:04:41.670> really<00:04:41.910> one<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.240> big<00:04:42.480> draws<00:04:42.990> for<00:04:43.050> me

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
was really one of the big draws for me

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.720 
was really one of the big draws for me
to<00:04:43.470> come<00:04:43.650> home<00:04:43.800> and<00:04:44.040> practice<00:04:44.430> here<00:04:44.610> at

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
to come home and practice here at

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.440 
to come home and practice here at
brackenridge<00:04:46.130> it's<00:04:47.130> certainly<00:04:47.400> our<00:04:47.460> hope<00:04:47.610> to
