a<00:00:54.329> true<00:00:54.539> track<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.770> considered<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
a true track it's considered to be a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.400 
a true track it's considered to be a
locker<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> very<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:58.170> good

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
locker because it's a very very good

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.000 
locker because it's a very very good
design<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.530> limited-slip<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
design but it's really a limited-slip it

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.880 
design but it's really a limited-slip it
does<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> ability<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:03.090> unlock<00:01:03.359> itself

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
does have the ability to unlock itself

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.109 
does have the ability to unlock itself
for<00:01:04.890> road<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.610> drive<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
for road when you do drive it on the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
for road when you do drive it on the
