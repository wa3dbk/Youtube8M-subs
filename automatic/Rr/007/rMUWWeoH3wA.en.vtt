then call logging for some reason having
from<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.880> slow

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
from this one to this one it's slow

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.749 
from this one to this one it's slow
again<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:02.189> officially<00:02:02.579> really

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
again this is a not officially really

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.880 
again this is a not officially really
software<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.750> no<00:02:04.320> call<00:02:04.530> log<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.799> my

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
software but a no call log with my

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.670 
software but a no call log with my
brother<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.250> moment<00:02:06.229> hop<00:02:07.229> back<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
brother at the moment hop back and you

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.999 
brother at the moment hop back and you
can<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.429> where<00:02:08.610> there<00:02:08.789> might<00:02:08.879> be<00:02:08.940> more

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
can see one where there might be more

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.270
