Namaskar!
Welcome to Nishmadhulika.com

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.811
Today we will make Grated cauliflower pakoda.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.693
Grated cauliflower pakoda is very crispy and tasty.

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:21.891
Let’s start making Grated cauliflower pakoda.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:28.160
Cauliflower - 250-300 grams.

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:30.558
Gram flour - 1 cup.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.489
Rice flour - 2 tbsp.

00:00:33.927 --> 00:00:36.878
Chopped green coriander - 2-3 tbsp.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:40.637
Fenugreek leaves - 2 tsp.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.103
Red chilly powder - ¼ tsp.

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:50.853
Ginger paste - 1 tsp (1 inch piece grated ginger)

00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:55.887
Salt - ¾ tsp (according to your taste)

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.183
Green chillies - 2 (minced)

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.860
Oil - to fry the pakoda’s.

00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:07.972
Firstly we need to grate the cauliflower.

00:01:08.074 --> 00:01:16.775
We have removed the stalk from the cauliflower, removed the leaves and washed it properly.

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:21.819
Check it properly, before grating it.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.514
Now let’s grate it.

00:01:23.827 --> 00:01:29.147
You can also cut it in a chopping blade and take chopped pieces.

00:01:29.338 --> 00:01:32.033
But it should be finely chopped.

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:37.096
Take out gram flour in a big bowl.

00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:52.198
Now add water from time to time and prepare a nice and smooth batter.

00:01:52.594 --> 00:01:55.631
There shouldn’t be any lumps in the batter

00:01:55.841 --> 00:02:00.450
Make the batter same as we make for making pakoda’s.

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:07.301
Add rice flour and mix it well.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:13.427
If you don’t have rice flour then add 2 tbsp sooji instead.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:17.087
This will make the pakoda’s crispy.

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:21.023
We have prepared a smooth batter.

00:02:21.172 --> 00:02:23.589
Now we will add the spices.

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:27.333
Add salt, fenugreek leaves,
green coriander, green

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:40.479
chillies, ginger paste
and red chilly powder.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.172
Mix everything well for 2 -3 minutes.

00:02:53.133 --> 00:02:56.937
Now add the grated cauliflower and mix it.

00:03:00.352 --> 00:03:02.512
Mix it well.

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:08.391
The cauliflower turned into about 1 cup grated cauliflower.

00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:12.159
We have mixed everything nicely.

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:16.368
The batter looks thick, so add more water.

00:03:23.744 --> 00:03:33.168
The batter is ready, the batter shouldn’t be too thin or too thick.

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:40.514
The batter is ready now.

00:03:40.852 --> 00:03:47.270
It took 3/4 cup water to make this much batter.

00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:51.693
We have heated the oil.

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:56.943
Let’s check if the oil has heated or not.

00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.161
For that we will put a little batter to check.

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:02.576
The oil has heated!

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:04.842
Start making the pakoda's.

00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:14.589
Take 1 tsp each of the batter and put it in the oil to fry.

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:38.360
Fry as much pakoda’s that fit in the frying pan, maybe 8-10.

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:44.529
The pakoda’s are floating now, flip it.

00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:57.573
We need to flip it from time to time and make them golden brown.

00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:03.498
They’re golden brown now.

00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:05.162
Take them out.

00:05:13.647 --> 00:05:17.431
Do the same with the rest.

00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:27.321
These have also turned golden brown.

00:05:27.376 --> 00:05:29.055
Take them out now.

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:36.783
Grated cauliflowers crispy pakoda’s are ready.

00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:40.987
You can serve with mustard
sauce, dried fenugreek leaves chutney,

00:05:41.013 --> 00:05:46.335
green coriander or with
fresh mint leaves chutney.

00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:49.983
You can make your Grated cauliflower pakoda, eat it and enjoy it.
