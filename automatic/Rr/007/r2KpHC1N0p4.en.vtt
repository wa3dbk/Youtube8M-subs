00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello today I'm going to show you my version 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.560
 fried rice 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:16.030
 first we need to beat 2 eggs 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.030
 beat them very well 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.400
 and we are going to add pepper 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.790
 and we beat again 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.210
 This recipe is very easy and besides him 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.050
 It gives like another touch to the rice not the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 Same mistake as always 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.260
 and we're going to add soy sauce , not what 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.329
 let's add salt soy sauce and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.789
 it contains a lot of salt 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.829
 here I will add approximately 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.179
 half a tablespoon of soy sauce 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.179
 and we are going to beat very well 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 see how to hold coffee color 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.530
 we put our egg very well 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.340
 and now in a hot pan we're going to 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 add oil and let's make our 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.000
 game like this and we are paying an egg 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.660
 scrambled 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660
 very well 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.790
 and we're not going to let it cook 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.159
 it has to be damp enough wet 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.020
 still because we are going to sew it again 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.020
 we speak very well and we withdraw 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.200
 in the same pan we will add more 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.200
 oil 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.909
 here I put it like a spoonful but 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.130
 really need a little more 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.359
 like all, the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.359
 amount of rice are doing 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.560
 how hot is our 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.390
 we are going to add the rice of the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.670
 rice that I'm using is boiled rice 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.680
 robbie simply not procedural 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.739
 I did not put it in anything 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.900
 if they do not have or if they have rice for a day 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.650
 before it can also be occupied by nothing else 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.930
 you have to be applying salt because the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.430
 soy sauce contains a lot of salt you 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.359
 let's put all the soy sauce and 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.359
 it can be salty 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.659
 and here we are going to fry our rice for 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.989
 a few minutes if you need oil 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.989
 I added 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.160
 I said it like three minutes laughing 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.130
 and I'm going to add soy sauce 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.460
 and I added two tablespoons and stir 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.460
 very good the temperature is medium-high 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.090
 you have to integrate very well all the 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.090
 soy sauce with rice 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.570
 I do not think soy sauce is necessary 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.260
 because you can not see it is the coffee color 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:37.460
 even then I'm going to add another 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.460
 spoonful of soy sauce 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.180
 and we are going to stir very well integrate 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.580
 all the soy sauce and it was to stay 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.720
 that color 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.720
 nice coffee 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.290
 once it is integrated we are going to 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.290
 add the game 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.450
 and we will give it back very well 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.410
 can occupy more eggs if they like I do not 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.410
 I'm saying two but 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.810
 we can give more 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.810
 It serves very well for a breakfast 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.510
 we stir very well 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.540
 and I'm going to add onion originally 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.150
 they take onion tails but did not have 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.120
 then I put onion can use 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.190
 also purple onion 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.760
 good 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.760
 and why 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.470
 I did not put much on it because they did not like it 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.720
 a lot in the house 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:23.320
 once it is well stirred it has already 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.900
 integrated the egg the rice and the onion 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.900
 we paid it and it's ready to be 2 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.760
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.310
 try it 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.310
 and if you try to tell me that such 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.310
 Thank you
