00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
that on over here 35 millimeter beams

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.260 
that on over here 35 millimeter beams
into<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> 70<00:00:25.930> millimeter<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:27.760> there<00:00:27.970> on<00:00:28.180> the

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
into a 70 millimeter see there on the

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.220 
into a 70 millimeter see there on the
front<00:00:30.180> go<00:00:31.180> through<00:00:31.360> the<00:00:31.450> menu<00:00:31.720> here<00:00:31.930> show<00:00:32.169> you

front go through the menu here show you
all<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.529> features<00:00:32.710> this<00:00:33.100> guy<00:00:33.280> has<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.840> there's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
all the features this guy has so there's

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.850 
all the features this guy has so there's
a<00:00:35.110> timer<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:36.730> here<00:00:36.970> ten-second<00:00:37.780> timer<00:00:37.990> now

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
a timer right here ten-second timer now

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.820 
a timer right here ten-second timer now
I'll<00:00:39.010> just<00:00:39.040> count<00:00:39.280> down<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.880> take<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.120> picture

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
I'll just count down and take a picture

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.140 
I'll just count down and take a picture
so<00:00:41.830> when<00:00:42.220> you<00:00:42.280> first<00:00:42.460> turn<00:00:42.610> it<00:00:42.760> on<00:00:42.850> it's<00:00:43.030> in

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
so when you first turn it on it's in

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.020 
so when you first turn it on it's in
full<00:00:43.420> auto<00:00:43.630> mode<00:00:43.750> and<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:45.280> can<00:00:45.370> go<00:00:45.460> from<00:00:45.670> here

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
full auto mode and you can go from here

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.240 
full auto mode and you can go from here
let's<00:00:46.300> see<00:00:46.480> mode<00:00:46.810> so<00:00:47.500> this<00:00:47.590> will<00:00:47.770> do<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:47.980> two

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
let's see mode so this will do the two

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.460 
let's see mode so this will do the two
flash<00:00:48.579> so<00:00:48.940> it's<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.240> red<00:00:49.510> eye<00:00:49.540> reduction<00:00:49.870> on<00:00:50.380> the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
flash so it's a red eye reduction on the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.560 
flash so it's a red eye reduction on the
flash<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.170> plus<00:00:53.500> two<00:00:53.829> exposure<00:00:54.340> value<00:00:54.850> on

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
flash it's a plus two exposure value on

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.790 
flash it's a plus two exposure value on
this<00:00:56.110> for<00:00:56.410> backlight<00:00:56.829> compensation<00:00:58.800> this

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
this for backlight compensation this

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.010 
this for backlight compensation this
just<00:01:00.070> automatically<00:01:00.700> makes<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.030> flash<00:01:01.270> go<00:01:01.840> on

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
just automatically makes the flash go on

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.460 
just automatically makes the flash go on
every<00:01:02.620> shot<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.449> same<00:01:04.449> thing<00:01:04.659> but<00:01:04.870> with<00:01:05.140> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
every shot and same thing but with the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
every shot and same thing but with the
redeye<00:01:05.830> reduction

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
redeye reduction

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.370 
redeye reduction
this<00:01:07.960> option<00:01:08.610> will<00:01:09.610> keep<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.150> flash<00:01:10.360> off<00:01:10.600> so

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
this option will keep the flash off so

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.780 
this option will keep the flash off so
if<00:01:11.560> you're<00:01:11.620> trying<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:11.979> just<00:01:12.070> shoot<00:01:12.400> natural

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:13.409 
size and feel and weight of that camera
I'm<00:02:10.749> not<00:02:10.810> sure<00:02:11.230> if<00:02:11.859> the<00:02:12.400> optics<00:02:12.849> are<00:02:12.999> similar

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:13.419 
I'm not sure if the optics are similar

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.550 
I'm not sure if the optics are similar
but<00:02:13.569> I'm<00:02:13.689> guessing

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
but I'm guessing

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.300 
but I'm guessing
they're<00:02:14.800> made<00:02:15.010> around<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.280> same<00:02:15.550> time

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
they're made around the same time

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.580 
they're made around the same time
they're<00:02:18.310> probably<00:02:18.610> pretty<00:02:19.120> similar<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:20.170> feel

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
they're probably pretty similar I feel

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.020 
they're probably pretty similar I feel
like<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.830> autofocus<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:21.700> one<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
like the autofocus on this one is a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.750 
like the autofocus on this one is a
little<00:02:22.360> slower<00:02:22.720> than<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.350> auto<00:02:24.130> focus<00:02:24.400> on

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
little slower than the auto focus on

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.080 
little slower than the auto focus on
that<00:02:25.030> Yashica<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> quick<00:02:27.640> look<00:02:27.850> at

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
that Yashica and that is a quick look at

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.620 
that Yashica and that is a quick look at
the<00:02:28.540> Leica<00:02:28.930> Minnie<00:02:29.410> zoom<00:02:30.120> if<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.209> like<00:02:31.390> seeing
