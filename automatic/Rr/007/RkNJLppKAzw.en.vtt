welcome back to how to build an f-14
Tomcat<00:00:04.069> probably<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.130> first<00:00:05.310> thing<00:00:05.520> you

Tomcat probably the first thing you
notice<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.060> it's<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.330> whole<00:00:06.600> lot<00:00:07.049> brighter<00:00:07.319> in

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
notice is it's a whole lot brighter in

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.879 
notice is it's a whole lot brighter in
here<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.429> all<00:00:08.460> our<00:00:08.610> whites<00:00:08.940> in<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.740> total<00:00:10.740> of

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
here we got all our whites in a total of

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.970 
here we got all our whites in a total of
eight<00:00:11.099> bulbs<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:12.019> four<00:00:13.019> for<00:00:13.200> fluorescent

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
eight bulbs and four for fluorescent

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.420 
eight bulbs and four for fluorescent
holders<00:00:14.400> so<00:00:15.389> definitely<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> lot<00:00:16.109> brighter

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
holders so definitely a lot brighter

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.849 
holders so definitely a lot brighter

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
some would say but you can see the f-14

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.870 
some would say but you can see the f-14
we<00:00:22.410> got<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.650> back<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> bench<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
we got it back on the bench we got the

we got it back on the bench we got the
both<00:00:24.300> verticals<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.199> horizontals<00:00:25.740> employees

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
both verticals the horizontals employees

can<00:00:31.529> appear<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> windscreen<00:00:32.489> I'm<00:00:32.700> getting

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
can appear in the windscreen I'm getting

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
can appear in the windscreen I'm getting
getting<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:33.989> ready<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.530> start<00:00:34.710> painting

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920

getting it ready so I can start painting
that<00:00:35.070> windscreen<00:00:35.489> area<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.210> pull<00:00:36.750> some

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that windscreen area so I can pull some

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.590 
that windscreen area so I can pull some
molds<00:00:37.230> off<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.239> start<00:00:39.239> popping

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
molds off of that so I can start popping

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.250 
molds off of that so I can start popping
out<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.930> plugs<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.719> the<00:00:42.719> windscreen<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
the canopy lenses and everything so
that's<00:00:48.059> pretty<00:00:48.180> much<00:00:48.239> where<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> fuselage<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
that's pretty much where the fuselage is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
that's pretty much where the fuselage is
right<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.010> done<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> whole<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.640> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
right now have it done a whole lot to it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
right now have it done a whole lot to it
I've<00:00:50.850> been<00:00:50.910> working<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> little<00:00:51.899> f-16<00:00:52.820> but

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
I've been working on the little f-16 but

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
I've been working on the little f-16 but
you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.030> see<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:55.440> gets<00:00:55.710> bigger<00:00:56.010> as<00:00:56.340> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you can see it's it gets bigger as you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.500 
you can see it's it gets bigger as you
start<00:00:56.820> putting<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.449> stuff<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.340> so<00:00:59.510> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
start putting more stuff on to it so the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.349 
start putting more stuff on to it so the
span<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> fuselage<00:01:01.379> between<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:03.059> point

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
span of the fuselage between this point

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.420 
span of the fuselage between this point
and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.439> other<00:01:04.559> edge<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.360> about<00:01:06.360> 39<00:01:07.040> 39<00:01:08.040> inches

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
and the other edge is about 39 39 inches

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640 
and the other edge is about 39 39 inches
or<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:09.180> around<00:01:09.390> there<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.439> stabbed

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
or so right around there and the stabbed

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
or so right around there and the stabbed
span<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> believe<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.850> 50<00:01:12.689> inches<00:01:12.720> or

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
span I believe is right at 50 inches or

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380 
span I believe is right at 50 inches or
so<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> pretty<00:01:14.700> big<00:01:14.880> airplane<00:01:15.240> even

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so so it's a pretty big airplane even

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.740 
so so it's a pretty big airplane even
without<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> wings<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.360> table<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
without the wings on it the table it

without the wings on it the table it
sits<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> 38<00:01:19.650> 30<00:01:20.040> inches<00:01:20.280> wide<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> exactly

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.810 
also got the nose gear installed as far
as<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> mounts<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.439> everything<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
as the mounts and everything so you can

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
as the mounts and everything so you can
see<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.060> 14<00:01:57.509> wings<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.560> out<00:01:58.680> on

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
see that 14 wings are way back out on

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.039 
see that 14 wings are way back out on
the<00:01:58.950> bench<00:01:59.630> that's<00:02:01.790> that<00:02:02.790> bench<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.149> about<00:02:03.390> 10

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the bench that's that bench is about 10

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
the bench that's that bench is about 10
about<00:02:04.860> 9<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.100> 10<00:02:05.250> foot<00:02:05.549> wide

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
about 9 or 10 foot wide

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.029 
about 9 or 10 foot wide
I<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:06.689> about<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.350> under<00:02:07.500> 10<00:02:07.799> foot<00:02:08.009> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I think it's about just under 10 foot a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
I think it's about just under 10 foot a
little<00:02:08.250> over<00:02:08.610> 9<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.390> nine<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.599> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
little over 9 so it's about nine and a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.530 
little over 9 so it's about nine and a
half<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> there's<00:02:12.150> wings<00:02:12.420> take

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
half and you see the there's wings take

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.949 
half and you see the there's wings take
up<00:02:12.690> pretty<00:02:12.870> much<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.170> entire

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
up pretty much the entire

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.890 
up pretty much the entire
tired<00:02:14.590> bench<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.489> they're<00:02:15.610> about<00:02:15.900> thinking

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
tired bench so they're about thinking

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.899 
tired bench so they're about thinking
about<00:02:17.019> 45<00:02:17.560> inches<00:02:17.890> per<00:02:18.040> panels<00:02:18.400> there's<00:02:18.640> 90

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
about 45 inches per panels there's 90

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.910 
about 45 inches per panels there's 90
inches<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.269> wings<00:02:19.450> right<00:02:19.690> there<00:02:19.900> plus<00:02:20.739> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
inches of wings right there plus the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.339 
inches of wings right there plus the
fuselage<00:02:21.310> add<00:02:21.519> up<00:02:21.670> another<00:02:21.940> 30<00:02:22.720> inches<00:02:23.049> or<00:02:23.200> so

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
fuselage add up another 30 inches or so

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.750 
fuselage add up another 30 inches or so
and<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.860> see<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.099> gets<00:02:24.220> pretty<00:02:24.430> big<00:02:24.580> pretty

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
and you see it gets pretty big pretty

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.229 
and you see it gets pretty big pretty
quick<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:26.620> I<00:02:26.650> got<00:02:26.890> some<00:02:27.040> more<00:02:27.239> organization

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
quick but I got some more organization

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.670 
quick but I got some more organization

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
it's about 60 degrees outside so it's

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.649

I'll just take the insulation off the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.819 
I'll just take the insulation off the
roof<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.569> gets<00:03:16.780> about<00:03:16.900> 30<00:03:17.140> degrees<00:03:17.290> warmer<00:03:17.769> in

the<00:03:40.840> end<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.139> week<00:03:41.669> or<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.790> middle<00:03:43.030> of

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
the end of the week or the middle of

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.670 
the end of the week or the middle of
next<00:03:43.239> week<00:03:43.419> we'll<00:03:43.840> see<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.019> got<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.379> get<00:03:44.470> some

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
next week we'll see I got to get some

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.159 
next week we'll see I got to get some
mold<00:03:45.160> release<00:03:45.489> wax<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.090> some<00:03:46.419> PVA<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.959> stuff

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.740 
mold release wax and some PVA and stuff
for<00:03:47.290> all<00:03:47.379> that<00:03:47.699> but<00:03:48.699> hopefully<00:03:49.299> once<00:03:49.569> I<00:03:49.629> get

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
for all that but hopefully once I get

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.000

all<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.930> done<00:03:50.139> things<00:03:50.739> will<00:03:50.859> start

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
all that done things will start

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.220 
all that done things will start
progressing<00:03:51.519> pretty<00:03:51.699> quickly<00:03:52.000> I<00:03:52.299> still<00:03:53.109> got

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
progressing pretty quickly I still got

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.900 
progressing pretty quickly I still got
to<00:03:53.319> figure<00:03:53.500> out<00:03:53.560> how<00:03:53.829> exactly<00:03:54.099> I'm<00:03:54.579> gonna<00:03:54.730> do

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
to figure out how exactly I'm gonna do

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.449 
to figure out how exactly I'm gonna do
the<00:03:55.090> wings<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.449> haven't<00:03:55.690> decided<00:03:55.900> if<00:03:56.049> I'm<00:03:56.169> gonna

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
the wings I haven't decided if I'm gonna

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.369 
the wings I haven't decided if I'm gonna
go<00:03:57.459> with<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.760> primer<00:03:58.269> route<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:58.989> just<00:03:59.260> have

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
go with the primer route and just have

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.050 
go with the primer route and just have
although<00:03:59.590> the<00:04:00.160> panel<00:04:00.400> ons<00:04:00.549> put<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.910> wing

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
although the panel ons put in the wing

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.759 
although the panel ons put in the wing
panels<00:04:01.389> it<00:04:01.930> seems<00:04:02.169> to<00:04:02.260> work<00:04:02.290> out<00:04:02.470> pretty<00:04:02.650> well

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
panels it seems to work out pretty well

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.599 
panels it seems to work out pretty well
for<00:04:02.889> Bob<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.840> these<00:04:04.840> panels<00:04:05.199> they<00:04:05.290> take<00:04:05.609> takes

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
for Bob and these panels they take takes

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.259 
for Bob and these panels they take takes
a<00:04:06.699> pretty<00:04:06.849> big<00:04:07.230> piece<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.260> a<00:04:09.000> little<00:04:10.000> plate<00:04:10.150> to

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
a pretty big piece of a little plate to

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.089 
a pretty big piece of a little plate to
do<00:04:10.389> it<00:04:10.540> which<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.470> don't<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.829> in<00:04:11.980> the

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
do it which I just don't have in the

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.369 
do it which I just don't have in the
aluminum<00:04:12.549> order<00:04:13.359> to<00:04:13.480> do<00:04:13.599> it's<00:04:13.870> just<00:04:13.900> too<00:04:14.169> soft

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
aluminum order to do it's just too soft

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.219 
aluminum order to do it's just too soft
and<00:04:14.680> it<00:04:14.769> shows<00:04:15.190> all<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.690> one<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
and it shows all the one of the the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.259 
and it shows all the one of the the
weave<00:04:17.440> pattern<00:04:17.829> in<00:04:17.979> there<00:04:18.130> so<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.000> think<00:04:19.090> I'm

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
weave pattern in there so I think I'm

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.599 
weave pattern in there so I think I'm
gonna<00:04:19.389> most<00:04:19.750> likely<00:04:19.840> go<00:04:20.139> with<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.320> paint

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
gonna most likely go with the paint

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.640 
gonna most likely go with the paint
pretty<00:04:21.609> much<00:04:21.760> from<00:04:22.120> here<00:04:22.630> all<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.200> way<00:04:23.409> this

whole<00:04:23.860> edge<00:04:24.150> down<00:04:25.150> here<00:04:25.210> has<00:04:25.599> to<00:04:25.690> be<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:26.020> solid

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
whole edge down here has to be one solid

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.450 
whole edge down here has to be one solid
panel
