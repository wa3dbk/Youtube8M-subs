games and yes he clipped firstly puts
him<00:01:32.909> smashing<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> ball<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.049> see<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
him smashing the ball you see one in a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
him smashing the ball you see one in a
second<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> grew<00:01:35.220> door<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> order<00:01:36.000> goals

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
second it grew door just to order goals

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.490 
second it grew door just to order goals
I<00:01:36.479> think<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:37.020> he<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.259> smashed

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
I think in this where he just smashed

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
I think in this where he just smashed
the<00:01:37.650> ball<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.700> great<00:01:39.000> finishes<00:01:39.509> as

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
the ball and they are great finishes as

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
the ball and they are great finishes as
well<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.470> know<00:01:40.590> maybe<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:41.070> hard

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
well and you know maybe very hard

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.889 
well and you know maybe very hard
actually<00:01:41.850> smashing<00:01:42.299> about<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> would've

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
actually smashing about more it would've

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.749 
actually smashing about more it would've
got<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.079> couple<00:01:43.380> more<00:01:43.619> goals<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> was

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
got a couple more goals well I was

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.280 
got a couple more goals well I was
fairly<00:01:44.939> satisfied<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> money<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.049> paid

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
fairly satisfied with the money I paid

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.740 
fairly satisfied with the money I paid
for<00:01:46.320> him<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.460> fairly<00:01:47.729> satisfied<00:01:48.240> as<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.570> said

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
for him I was fairly satisfied as I said

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.830 
for him I was fairly satisfied as I said
again<00:01:48.990> maybe<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> was<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.189> steep<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.180> got

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
again maybe it was a bit steep but I got

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
again maybe it was a bit steep but I got
great<00:01:52.610> value<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:53.820> money<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.240> terms<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
great value for my money in terms of

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.319 
great value for my money in terms of
goals<00:01:54.869> /<00:01:55.079> games<00:01:55.290> ratio<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.460> really

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
goals / games ratio and I just really

chip there and I can't recommend them
highly<00:02:02.670> enough<00:02:03.060> maybe<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:04.079> he<00:02:04.229> goes<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.560> on

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
highly enough maybe if he goes down on

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.990 
highly enough maybe if he goes down on
the<00:02:04.710> price<00:02:04.829> eventually<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.520> go<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.880> him

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
the price eventually then go for him

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
the price eventually then go for him
right<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.180> probably<00:02:06.600> wouldn't<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.229> mean

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
