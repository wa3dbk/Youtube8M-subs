00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:11.060 
going to be a super quick build because

show<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.340> some<00:00:11.580> sample<00:00:11.910> footage<00:00:12.030> first<00:00:12.780> of

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
show you some sample footage first of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.299 
show you some sample footage first of
all<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> got<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.380> GoPro<00:00:13.800> in<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.040> frame

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
all you got your GoPro in the frame

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
all you got your GoPro in the frame
mount<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:15.059> could<00:00:15.269> use<00:00:15.510> the<00:00:15.720> waterproof<00:00:16.170> case

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
mount you could use the waterproof case

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.520 
mount you could use the waterproof case
but<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.699> frame<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.180> much<00:00:18.600> smaller<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.380> would

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:19.530 
but the frame is much smaller so I would

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.870 
but the frame is much smaller so I would
recommend<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.010> then<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.760> need<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.940> strap<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
recommend that then you need a strap and

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.430 
recommend that then you need a strap and
then<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.210> need<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> thumb<00:00:24.900> screw<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.289> comes

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
then you need a thumb screw that comes

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.000 
then you need a thumb screw that comes
to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> GoPro<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> wingnut<00:00:28.010> that

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
to the GoPro and this is a wingnut that

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.110 
to the GoPro and this is a wingnut that
is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> 10<00:00:30.000> -<00:00:30.330> 32<00:00:30.960> thread<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.730> super<00:00:33.090> easy

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
is a 10 - 32 thread so it's super easy

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.069 
is a 10 - 32 thread so it's super easy
just<00:00:33.710> put<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> ring<00:00:35.040> between<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.300> two<00:00:36.510> pieces

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
just put the ring between the two pieces

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.450 
just put the ring between the two pieces
on<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> frame<00:00:37.880> and<00:00:38.930> stick<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.410> thumb<00:00:41.190> screw

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
on the frame and stick the thumb screw
through<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:43.399> thread<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> wingnut<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
through and thread on the wingnut you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
through and thread on the wingnut you
could<00:00:45.899> use<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> regular<00:00:46.530> nut<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> want<00:00:47.190> but

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
could use a regular nut if you want but

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
could use a regular nut if you want but
the<00:00:47.910> wing<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.090> lets<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.570> hold<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.050> without

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

any tools

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.630 
any tools
regular<00:00:51.719> nut<00:00:51.899> would<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.649> less<00:00:52.860> noticeable<00:00:53.250> but

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
regular nut would be less noticeable but

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.299 
regular nut would be less noticeable but
it<00:00:53.969> works<00:00:54.149> well<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.539> way<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.410> that's<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.739> now

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639 
paracord if you want to do that this is

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.519 
paracord if you want to do that this is
just<00:01:17.819> something<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.149> looks<00:01:19.139> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.349> bit

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:19.529 
just something that looks a little bit

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:21.440 
just something that looks a little bit
better<00:01:19.679> after<00:01:20.549> you've<00:01:20.670> got<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:20.819> on<00:01:20.999> the<00:01:21.149> strap

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
better after you've got it on the strap

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.870 
better after you've got it on the strap
just<00:01:21.479> set<00:01:21.990> your<00:01:22.139> GoPro<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> upside<00:01:23.279> down<00:01:23.520> mode

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
just set your GoPro to upside down mode

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.539 
just set your GoPro to upside down mode
and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:25.079> film<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.099> around

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and then you can film with it around

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.459 
and then you can film with it around
your<00:01:26.729> neck<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.689> makes<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.929> pretty<00:01:28.139> steady

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
your neck it makes a pretty steady

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.249 
your neck it makes a pretty steady
platform<00:01:29.099> I<00:01:29.520> would<00:01:30.119> recommend<00:01:30.719> using<00:01:31.109> two

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
platform I would recommend using two

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.370 
platform I would recommend using two
hands<00:01:31.649> on<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.799> camera<00:01:32.279> and<00:01:32.630> press<00:01:33.630> down<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
hands on the camera and press down just

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.129 
hands on the camera and press down just
slightly<00:01:34.709> so<00:01:35.099> it<00:01:35.249> stretches<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.999> strap<00:01:36.749> tight

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:37.139 
slightly so it stretches the strap tight

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:39.109 
slightly so it stretches the strap tight
around<00:01:37.349> your<00:01:37.649> neck<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:38.159> adds<00:01:38.369> more<00:01:38.579> stability

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
around your neck and adds more stability

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.959 
around your neck and adds more stability
it's<00:01:39.869> not<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.289> steady<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> Steadicam<00:01:41.819> or

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
it's not as steady as a Steadicam or

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.559 
it's not as steady as a Steadicam or
anything<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:43.469> it<00:01:43.679> is<00:01:43.829> helpful

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
anything like that but it is helpful

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.179 
anything like that but it is helpful
it's<00:01:45.569> also<00:01:45.779> easy<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> take<00:01:46.409> pictures<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.979> way

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
it's also easy to take pictures this way

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.999 
it's also easy to take pictures this way
and<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.299> fast<00:01:48.539> real<00:01:48.929> easy<00:01:49.139> access<00:01:49.709> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and just really fast real easy access I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.459 
and just really fast real easy access I
would<00:01:50.549> recommend<00:01:50.969> that<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:51.419> a<00:01:51.450> lens<00:01:52.200> cap

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
would recommend that you use a lens cap

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.889 
would recommend that you use a lens cap
or<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> clear<00:01:53.249> lens<00:01:53.520> cap<00:01:53.849> with<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.359> because

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
or a clear lens cap with this because

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.080 
or a clear lens cap with this because
the<00:01:55.139> lens<00:01:55.409> is<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.249> exposed<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the lens is out there and exposed and
