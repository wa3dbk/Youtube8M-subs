00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
I don't know where's review cases but

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.930 
I don't know where's review cases but
the<00:00:07.049> cases<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.980> like<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.400> use<00:00:08.429> myself

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
the cases that I like to use myself

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.490 
the cases that I like to use myself
personally<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.420> think<00:00:09.450> it's<00:00:09.660> worth<00:00:09.870> showcased

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
personally I think it's worth showcased

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.410 
personally I think it's worth showcased
on<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> channel<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.219> mean<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.000> case<00:00:12.269> we're

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
on the channel I mean this case we're

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.180 
on the channel I mean this case we're
looking<00:00:12.480> at<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> cooler<00:00:13.080> master<00:00:13.710> aluminium

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
looking at the cooler master aluminium

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.519 
looking at the cooler master aluminium
bumper<00:00:14.969> which<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.839> actually<00:00:15.960> really<00:00:16.260> nice

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
bumper which is actually really nice

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.380 
bumper which is actually really nice
chassis<00:00:16.800> or<00:00:17.250> case<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.760> I've<00:00:17.850> been<00:00:17.970> using<00:00:18.029> for

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
chassis or case that I've been using for

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.359 
chassis or case that I've been using for
a<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:18.510> while<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.350> protects<00:00:19.680> my<00:00:19.890> iPhone

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
a little while that protects my iPhone

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.160 
a little while that protects my iPhone
so<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.090> way<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.420> installs<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.960> pretty

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so the way it installs is pretty

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529 
so the way it installs is pretty
straightforward<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> iphone<00:00:24.210> actually

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
straightforward the iphone actually

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.070 
straightforward the iphone actually
slides<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.199> through<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.269> case<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
slides in through the case like this and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.349 
slides in through the case like this and
as<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.039> slide<00:00:29.279> it<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:29.789> just<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.029> careful

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
as you slide it on there just be careful

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.939 
as you slide it on there just be careful
not<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.539> scratch<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.810> because<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> case<00:00:31.890> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
not to scratch it because the case is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.770 
not to scratch it because the case is
made<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.489> aluminium<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.390> obviously

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
made out of aluminium so obviously

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.209 
made out of aluminium so obviously
aluminium<00:00:34.110> touching<00:00:34.559> aluminium<00:00:34.829> could

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
aluminium touching aluminium could

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
aluminium touching aluminium could
possibly<00:00:35.550> scratch<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.809> then<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> slide<00:00:37.530> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
possibly scratch and then you slide on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.260 
possibly scratch and then you slide on
this<00:00:37.800> back<00:00:38.010> panel<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.820> keeps<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.210> all

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
this back panel here that keeps it all

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.450 
this back panel here that keeps it all
together<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.770> looks<00:00:41.010> quite<00:00:41.219> nice

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
together and it looks quite nice

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.459 
together and it looks quite nice
actually<00:00:41.700> leaves<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.149> hole<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.079> center

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
actually leaves a hole in the center

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.240 
actually leaves a hole in the center
that<00:00:43.500> allows<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.809> iphone<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.960> breathe

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
that allows the iphone to breathe

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.529 
that allows the iphone to breathe
especially<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.430> you're<00:00:47.550> running<00:00:47.730> games<00:00:48.329> on

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
especially when you're running games on

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
here can't get a bit hot so that whole

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.060 
here can't get a bit hot so that whole
actually<00:00:50.430> leaves<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.940> loser<00:00:51.420> air<00:00:51.840> hole<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
actually leaves a loser air hole as you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
actually leaves a loser air hole as you
can<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.390> high
