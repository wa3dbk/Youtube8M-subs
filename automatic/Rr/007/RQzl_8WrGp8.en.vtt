the<00:00:39.420> only<00:00:39.690> problem<00:00:40.110> was<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> because<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the only problem was that because of the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.160 
the only problem was that because of the
way<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> suit<00:00:41.550> fits<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.120> barely<00:00:42.510> noticed<00:00:43.020> any

way the suit fits we barely noticed any

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.200 
way the suit fits we barely noticed any
of<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> extra<00:00:43.770> movement<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.820> wasn't<00:00:45.030> a

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
of the extra movement and it wasn't a

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.790 
of the extra movement and it wasn't a
very<00:00:45.239> good<00:00:45.450> payoff<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> work<00:00:46.590> he

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
very good payoff for all of the work he

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220 
very good payoff for all of the work he
was<00:00:46.829> putting<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> simulate<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.940> shots<00:00:48.230> so

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
was putting in to simulate the shots so

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.529 
was putting in to simulate the shots so
instead<00:00:49.710> we<00:00:50.039> decided<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.610> bind<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> cloth<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
instead we decided to bind the cloth to

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.840 
instead we decided to bind the cloth to
the<00:00:51.570> skeleton<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> old-fashioned<00:00:52.890> way<00:00:53.070> now

the skeleton the old-fashioned way now
usually<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.840> by<00:00:55.110> painting<00:00:55.590> weights

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
usually you do this by painting weights

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
usually you do this by painting weights
or<00:00:56.100> using<00:00:56.430> lattices<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.420> did<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.930> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
or using lattices but we did it with a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
or using lattices but we did it with a
bunch<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> extra<00:00:58.890> bones<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.430> nulls<00:00:59.640> that

bunch of extra bones and nulls that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
bunch of extra bones and nulls that
gives<00:01:00.149> us<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.539> more<00:01:00.780> control<00:01:01.230> over<00:01:01.260> how

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
gives us a little more control over how

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
gives us a little more control over how
it<00:01:01.710> moves<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:03.030> instance<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.629> bend

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and makes the jacket hang loose this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
and makes the jacket hang loose this
same<00:01:20.430> technique<00:01:20.820> also<00:01:21.060> works<00:01:21.210> really<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.900> on

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
same technique also works really well on

the bellies of fat characters a similar
trick<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.830> build<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.220> series<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.580> nulls<00:01:26.970> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
trick is to build a series of nulls that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
trick is to build a series of nulls that
are<00:01:27.330> constrained<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.900> two<00:01:28.110> ends<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.829> however

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
are constrained to two ends but however

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.280 
are constrained to two ends but however
you<00:01:29.250> move<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> ends<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.509> nulls<00:01:30.780> will<00:01:31.110> stay

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
you move the ends the nulls will stay

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.569 
you move the ends the nulls will stay

this<00:01:33.240> works<00:01:33.509> wherever<00:01:33.750> you've<00:01:34.079> got<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> piece

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
this works wherever you've got a piece

approach<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> certain<00:01:52.470> point<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
approach is that at a certain point you

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.920 
approach is that at a certain point you
can<00:01:53.130> no<00:01:53.280> longer<00:01:53.549> paint<00:01:54.060> weights<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
can no longer paint weights because it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.709 
can no longer paint weights because it's
just<00:01:55.140> too<00:01:55.409> complex<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.759> only<00:01:57.000> way<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> control

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
just too complex the only way to control

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.200 
just too complex the only way to control
how<00:01:58.110> much<00:01:58.259> effect<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.770> bone<00:01:58.979> has<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.579> by<00:01:59.820> moving

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
how much effect a bone has is by moving

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
how much effect a bone has is by moving
it<00:02:00.299> deeper<00:02:00.630> into<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> math<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.409> tone<00:02:01.590> down<00:02:01.619> its

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it deeper into the math to tone down its

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.340 
it deeper into the math to tone down its
influence<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.360> adding<00:02:03.570> more<00:02:03.840> nulls

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
influence or just adding more nulls

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.010 
influence or just adding more nulls
I<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:05.399> tweaked<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.030> few<00:02:06.060> things<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.719> blend

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I also tweaked a few things with blend

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.260 
I also tweaked a few things with blend
shapes<00:02:07.350> when<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.099> bends<00:02:08.399> his<00:02:08.580> arm<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.209> is

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
shapes when he bends his arm this is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
shapes when he bends his arm this is
what<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> looks<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
what it looks like with just the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
what it looks like with just the
envelope<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.910> also<00:02:12.270> made<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> little<00:02:12.840> blend

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
envelope but I also made a little blend

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
envelope but I also made a little blend
shape<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
shape and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.530 
shape and
hooked<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.430> elbow<00:02:14.820> rotation<00:02:15.360> so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
hooked it up to the elbow rotation so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
hooked it up to the elbow rotation so
that<00:02:15.690> we<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.140> nice<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:16.410> crease<00:02:17.100> as

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that we get this nice little crease as

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.180 
that we get this nice little crease as
his<00:02:17.580> arm<00:02:17.760> bends<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:19.170> no<00:02:19.560> simulation

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
his arm bends this no simulation

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.740 
his arm bends this no simulation
approach<00:02:20.520> was<00:02:20.730> what<00:02:20.880> we<00:02:20.970> ended<00:02:21.180> up<00:02:21.300> using<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
approach was what we ended up using and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500 
approach was what we ended up using and
about<00:02:21.960> 90%<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> shots<00:02:23.160> however<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.480> of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
about 90% of the shots however all of

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.180 
about 90% of the shots however all of
that<00:02:24.750> work<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:24.990> tad<00:02:25.380> did<00:02:25.650> setting<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
that work that tad did setting up the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.550 
that work that tad did setting up the
cloth<00:02:26.460> wasn't<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.940> waste<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.320> things

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
cloth wasn't a waste one of the things

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.230 
cloth wasn't a waste one of the things
we<00:02:28.710> found<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.100> worked<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.520> well<00:02:29.670> was

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
we found that worked really well was

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.090 
we found that worked really well was
just<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.720> simulate<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.350> parts<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.830> cloth

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
just to simulate the parts of the cloth

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.880 
just to simulate the parts of the cloth
that<00:02:32.370> are<00:02:32.460> easy<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.880> do<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.390> Walter<00:02:34.230> these<00:02:34.560> are

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
that are easy to do on Walter these are

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740 
that are easy to do on Walter these are
the<00:02:35.190> loose<00:02:35.370> sections<00:02:35.820> at<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> bottoms<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.630> his

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
the loose sections at the bottoms of his

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.110 
the loose sections at the bottoms of his
pants<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.500> base<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.830> his<00:02:37.920> jacket<00:02:38.460> so<00:02:39.000> if

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
pants and the base of his jacket so if

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.390 
pants and the base of his jacket so if
you<00:02:39.270> turn<00:02:39.510> just<00:02:39.900> those<00:02:40.110> isolated<00:02:40.830> areas<00:02:41.190> into

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
you turn just those isolated areas into

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.250 
you turn just those isolated areas into
a<00:02:41.490> cloth<00:02:41.760> clusters<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.540> get<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> really<00:02:43.140> nice

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
a cloth clusters you get a really nice

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.780 
a cloth clusters you get a really nice
compromise<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.190> not<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.430> whole<00:02:44.610> lot<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
compromise with not a whole lot of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.380 
compromise with not a whole lot of
effort

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390

the<00:02:46.170> last<00:02:46.530> cloth<00:02:46.890> trick<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.340> did<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.850> for<00:02:48.210> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
the last cloth trick we did is for the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.210 
the last cloth trick we did is for the
end<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.690> movie<00:02:49.020> when<00:02:49.200> Walter<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.770> flying

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
end of the movie when Walter is flying

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.190 
end of the movie when Walter is flying
through<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.520> air<00:02:50.550> we<00:02:51.540> really<00:02:51.870> needed<00:02:52.110> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
through the air we really needed the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.870 
through the air we really needed the
whole<00:02:52.350> suit<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.860> feel<00:02:53.100> like<00:02:53.310> there's<00:02:53.550> wind

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
whole suit to feel like there's wind

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.030 
whole suit to feel like there's wind
rushing<00:02:54.330> past<00:02:54.600> him<00:02:54.840> so<00:02:55.140> tag<00:02:55.440> did<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.770> really

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
rushing past him so tag did a really

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.100 
rushing past him so tag did a really
long<00:02:56.220> simulation<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.120> Walter<00:02:57.450> just<00:02:57.720> standing

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
long simulation of Walter just standing

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.440 
long simulation of Walter just standing
still<00:02:58.410> with<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.340> strong<00:02:59.700> wind<00:03:00.180> blowing

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
still with the strong wind blowing

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.870 
still with the strong wind blowing
against<00:03:00.900> him<00:03:01.050> then<00:03:01.950> we<00:03:02.280> baked<00:03:02.670> that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
against him then we baked that

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.090 
against him then we baked that
simulation<00:03:03.480> into<00:03:03.870> an<00:03:04.110> animated<00:03:04.590> blend<00:03:04.860> shape

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
simulation into an animated blend shape

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.860 
simulation into an animated blend shape
and<00:03:05.370> type<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.910> into<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> rig<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and type it into the rig so that the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.200 
and type it into the rig so that the
animator<00:03:07.350> can<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.860> use<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.190> slider<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.970> turn

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
animator can just use a slider to turn

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.020 
animator can just use a slider to turn
on<00:03:09.480> our<00:03:09.780> pre-built<00:03:10.290> windy<00:03:10.830> animation<00:03:11.400> but

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
on our pre-built windy animation but

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.060 
on our pre-built windy animation but
then<00:03:12.180> he<00:03:12.330> can<00:03:12.450> still<00:03:12.720> pose<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.230> character<00:03:13.440> on

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
then he can still pose the character on

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.040 
then he can still pose the character on
top<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.820> normal<00:03:15.240> it's<00:03:15.810> not

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
top of it like normal it's not

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.870 
top of it like normal it's not
technically<00:03:16.620> accurate<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.310> how<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.490> cloth

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
technically accurate to how the cloth

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.760 
technically accurate to how the cloth
would<00:03:18.180> move<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.840> each<00:03:19.050> of<00:03:19.230> those<00:03:19.350> different

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
would move in each of those different

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.160 
would move in each of those different
poses<00:03:19.980> but<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:21.030> gets<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.360> job<00:03:21.390> done<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.870> it

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
poses but it gets the job done and it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.900 
poses but it gets the job done and it
only<00:03:22.320> took<00:03:22.560> about<00:03:22.620> an<00:03:22.950> hour<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.310> do<00:03:23.640> one

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
only took about an hour to do one

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.060 
only took about an hour to do one
simulation<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:25.020> could<00:03:25.230> reuse<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.770> 20
