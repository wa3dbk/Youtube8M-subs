00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.560
 the cat without eyes 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.140
 what happened is so bizarre paranormal 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.660
 illogical that I could not imagine that much 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.160
 people believe what I am about to tell I am 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.460
 a writer of a very editorial 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.100
 demanding just had finished a good 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
 self-improvement book but I had 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.239
 mistakes he was not forced to correct 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 to deliver them back to a week 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.040
 after I was always a lover of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.540
 animals and I 'm not in my hometown 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.699
 come because in this city is the 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.650
 main campus of the editorial only 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.870
 I'm traveling and I come from far away I could not 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.880
 bring my pets along the trip 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.890
 I'm in a small apartment without 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.479
 company went straight to shop 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.549
 pets to get a companion 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.350
 temporary and not feel alone while 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.530
 I was locked up fixing the little ones 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.859
 free-rices rice to help me 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.710
 I came across a cat that did not have eyes 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.140
 I was scared 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.799
 it even comes to me so I decided to take it 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.909
 right now I repeat myself of having done it 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.909
 I took him to check with a veterinarian 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.409
 for because they had something serious only 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.320
 I had a small infection in my leg 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.720
 but I was just emerging so 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.580
 It was easy to eradicate it in the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.080
 veterinarian it was easy to notice that I was 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.050
 the only one you did not give him with 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.360
 taco citation 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.040
 I never named him so much because I did not 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.220
 it gave me time that I still do not 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.680
 they wanted to change so much with him 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.780
 once at home do not let that play free 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.430
 for the department despite being 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.040
 blind man seemed to know exactly where 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.810
 I was and how to move around the game I did not 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.910
 it seemed strange I just thought about what 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.490
 worrying that he would feel the 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.960
 poor animal while he played 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.210
 I started to correct the first mistakes 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.310
 of the book on my laptop 20,000 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.170
 I immediately went to sleep all normal 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.500
 it was the next morning when everything 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.500
 started 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.080
 creating great 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.400
 when I woke up there was facing me 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.569
 they turn directly a man 20 - eyes 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.049
 to give them my bed or that I thought that way 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.090
 Well, that man did not have eyes or green tea 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.189
 I only saw a couple of empty bills I screamed 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.799
 as any lady would 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.260
 I was paralyzed in that man if he leaves 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.120
 that the use to walk on all fours is 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.879
 snuggle in a corner pull out a bag 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.470
 from a notebook with a pen and we take 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.870
 to write 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.030
 I had the strength to raise my head on 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.460
 man has not reacted little by little me 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.290
 I raised taking advantage of the concentrated 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.120
 was the lion felipe is more towards the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.060
 door and I tried to open it 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.459
 I had something down that I adored him try 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.040
 take it out each time with more desperation 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.080
 it's no positive effect I went to 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.319
 the window was covered upholstered 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.489
 a lot of dietary paper was the basis that the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.069
 I had started writing my book 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.270
 just few rays of light entering the 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.520
 enough to illuminate 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.230
 but try to remove room 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.240
 they seem to be perfectly attached to 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.030
 the lake window at the foot without a good 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.190
 result flips and from its corner the 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.840
 man was staring at me 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.700
 with the strong internal darkness in their 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.000
 eyes with a lot of fear and trembling 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.490
 it's much better to ask 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.940
 what do you want from me received a strong 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.400
 mewling in return made me think a little and 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.140
 look a little the room to a rich subject 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.450
 to his non-existent gaze fixed and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.610
 penetrating on top of me I did not see the cat 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.040
 blind to nowhere then I noticed it 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.500
 what I did not observe so much was my 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.020
 Cat noticing that I had noticed 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.090
 of what was happening and approached and I have 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.390
 desperate I tried to get away from him in 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.890
 in vain and it ran with me purring 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.720
 those heights I was about to cry 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.760
 when I saw that they nominate themselves I tried to think 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.950
 in some solution at that time no 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.620
 I could do nothing because we did and I moved 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.700
 sure he would wake up without knowing how 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.620
 or why fallen friend 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.790
 I woke up and he was back in his 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.160
 corner writing on your little 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.109
 notepad this time turning towards me 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.419
 several times to then continue or 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.160
 continue writing in your notebook 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.080
 I raised this time with more confidence 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.990
 because I noticed that he did not plan to make me 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.880
 environmental damage cesc returned the 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.919
 panic again I was locked up my 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.710
 own room could not leave the 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.660
 kitchen you did not have to eat while 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.120
 I thought this heard a little crunch 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.770
 in the stomach of the cat the two 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.169
 we turn to the same point in his belly 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.520
 then he saw me again with nothing 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.620
 what to do and I with the nerves 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:51.230
 for his dark gaze so penetrating 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:54.080
 I said a little I can not go out to the kitchen 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.940
 just let me out we can eat at 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.670
 hear this watch me for two more seconds 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.980
 and he went back to his notebook I thought and 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.250
 search for solutions there was no 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.950
 installed locked up and eating I could only 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.900
 think of one thing in a single plan that 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.490
 they rescued me in less than a week 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.380
 the editorial material that I thought 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.570
 who would try to contact me 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.880
 would respond to Bryant to the police 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.130
 would break in here if the cat could 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.320
 human humanoids become what you want 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.240
 that may be that you can go back to what you used to 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.370
 it was then seem that simply not 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.440
 it is only entangled here and the cat will come out 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.120
 innocent and catch someone else in this 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.070
 moment with your writing this so that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.840
 when they find here and they see me dead 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.430
 of hunger read this and take care of 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.260
 damn cat 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.900

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.790

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.250
 he too but was born nothing follows 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.450
 writing keeps watching me 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.120
 it seems that I analyze that 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.670
 experiment I am your test dummy that 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.650

 I want to get out of here I want that data 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.940
 It comes out different I can not do anything not 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.790

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.760
 cospedal leave it at the end of 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.400

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:22.870
 text found next to the game inside 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.940
 of the apartment the body was found in 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.680
 the bed on him a black cat and without 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.249
 eyes that were missing parts of his 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.379
 skin under the hands 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.359
 there were carlos remains and most 

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.639
 creepy to say that someone 

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:36.679
 had ripped the eyes of the policemen 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.869
 before reading this they believe that this is 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:40.579
 has brought the writer to the edge of 

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:43.579
 madness to lock yourself to the ground and 

00:06:40.579 --> 00:06:46.249
 Feed your cat and the same with focus 

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:47.689
 of meat can pick up the newspaper 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.579
 found on one side of each slope 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.079
 of diego laborious as to the 

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:52.459
 feed entered the cat room 

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:54.780
 I turn the example with the deep 

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:56.610
 darkness of their empty sockets 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.220
 He stared at one of the policemen 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:02.760
 present and strangely that was the 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.870
 only to which the panic did not continue took 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.670
 the cat in his arms while 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.740
 they searched the place when everything went well 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.840
 that policeman went straight to his house with 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.960
 the risk 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.389
 for four days you have news 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.600
 there is no news of him or his 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:18.600
 family
