playing through this game so you kind of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.910 
playing through this game so you kind of

around you pick up money you get to the

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
around you pick up money you get to the
end<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.860> level<00:02:02.070> boss<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.760> have<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
end of level boss and you have to have a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.969 
end of level boss and you have to have a
game<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.890> rock-paper-scissors

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.469 

rock-paper-scissors<00:02:08.000> yeah<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> one

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
rock-paper-scissors yeah that's the one

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240 
rock-paper-scissors yeah that's the one
I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.659> is<00:02:09.959> he<00:02:10.110> ganking<00:02:10.590> as

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
I think is he ganking as

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.630 
I think is he ganking as
in<00:02:11.490> Japan<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.010> game<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.550> like

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
in Japan and the the game kind of like

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.700 
in Japan and the the game kind of like
it<00:02:14.910> does<00:02:15.120> get<00:02:15.300> perilously<00:02:15.960> difficult<00:02:16.560> in

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
it does get perilously difficult in

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.460 
it does get perilously difficult in
later<00:02:16.950> levels<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.990> there's<00:02:18.990> all<00:02:19.110> sorts<00:02:19.410> of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
later levels and there's all sorts of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.660 
later levels and there's all sorts of
achievements<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.070> quite<00:02:20.280> looking<00:02:20.490> forward

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
achievements I'm quite looking forward

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.430 
achievements I'm quite looking forward
to<00:02:20.910> seeing<00:02:21.150> what<00:02:21.330> achievements<00:02:21.840> they've<00:02:22.200> got

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
to seeing what achievements they've got

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.860 
to seeing what achievements they've got
in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.740> game<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.970> kind<00:02:24.240> of<00:02:24.330> assuming<00:02:24.690> there's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
in the game I'm kind of assuming there's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660 
in the game I'm kind of assuming there's
gonna<00:02:24.990> be<00:02:25.140> kind<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.560> boss<00:02:25.920> achievements

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
gonna be kind of like boss achievements

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.490 
gonna be kind of like boss achievements
I<00:02:26.790> already<00:02:27.090> had<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> sneak<00:02:27.600> peek<00:02:27.870> at<00:02:28.020> one<00:02:28.260> which

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I already had a sneak peek at one which

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400 
I already had a sneak peek at one which
was<00:02:29.000> killing<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.270> octopuses<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.200> these

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
was killing the octopuses in these

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.500 
was killing the octopuses in these
underwater<00:02:32.010> levels<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:32.820> if<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.240> killed

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
underwater levels I think if you killed

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.570 
underwater levels I think if you killed
two<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.230> octopuses<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.740> underwater<00:02:35.250> level

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
two of the octopuses in underwater level

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.100 
two of the octopuses in underwater level
you<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:35.820> an<00:02:35.880> achievement<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.570> which<00:02:37.080> is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
you get an achievement for that which is

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.750 
you get an achievement for that which is
perilously<00:02:37.680> hard<00:02:37.980> because<00:02:38.250> you've<00:02:38.490> got<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
perilously hard because you've got to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.120 
perilously hard because you've got to
kind<00:02:38.970> of<00:02:39.030> like<00:02:39.209> edge<00:02:39.450> closer<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.650> closer<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
kind of like edge closer and closer to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040 
kind of like edge closer and closer to
their<00:02:41.280> tentacle<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.000> take<00:02:42.180> out<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.780> one

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
their tentacle and take out like one

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.440 
their tentacle and take out like one
little<00:02:43.320> bit<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.739> time<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.250> that's<00:02:44.940> Alex<00:02:45.239> Kidd

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
little bit at a time so that's Alex Kidd

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.060 
little bit at a time so that's Alex Kidd
were<00:02:45.630> jumping<00:02:45.959> straight<00:02:46.110> into<00:02:46.230> revenge<00:02:46.950> of

were jumping straight into revenge of
shinobi<00:02:47.130> which<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:47.880> my<00:02:48.209> humble<00:02:48.540> opinion<00:02:48.810> is

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
shinobi which in my humble opinion is

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.050 
shinobi which in my humble opinion is
the<00:02:49.560> greatest<00:02:50.070> shinobi<00:02:50.459> game<00:02:50.640> that's<00:02:50.880> ever

was initially caught off guard with with
this<00:05:42.440> because<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:42.830> was<00:05:43.010> on<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.520> very<00:05:44.510> first

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
this because I was on the very first

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.779 
this because I was on the very first
game<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.140> was<00:05:45.260> a<00:05:45.410> comic<00:05:46.039> played<00:05:46.280> I<00:05:46.310> was<00:05:46.490> sitting

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
game I was a comic played I was sitting

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:47.950 
game I was a comic played I was sitting
there<00:05:46.820> pressing<00:05:47.210> the<00:05:47.270> buttons<00:05:47.539> and<00:05:47.690> nothing

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
there pressing the buttons and nothing

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.420 
there pressing the buttons and nothing
happened<00:05:48.350> and<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:48.919> actually<00:05:49.070> have<00:05:49.400> to

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
happened and you actually have to

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.400 
happened and you actually have to
control<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.030> acceleration<00:05:50.630> with<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.169> right

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
control the acceleration with the right

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.950 
control the acceleration with the right
stick<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:52.669> kind<00:05:52.910> of<00:05:53.030> it's<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.660> bit<00:05:53.810> like

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
stick so you kind of it's a bit like

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.840 
stick so you kind of it's a bit like
controlling<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.530> warthog<00:05:55.010> from<00:05:55.220> Halo<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:55.729> have

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
controlling a warthog from Halo you have

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.920 
controlling a warthog from Halo you have
to<00:05:55.940> kind<00:05:56.120> of<00:05:56.150> accelerate<00:05:56.479> and<00:05:56.810> decelerate

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
to kind of accelerate and decelerate

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.159 
to kind of accelerate and decelerate
with<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.590> right<00:05:57.770> stick<00:05:58.100> and<00:05:58.280> steer<00:05:58.550> with<00:05:58.580> the

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
with the right stick and steer with the

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.930 
with the right stick and steer with the
left<00:06:00.169> it's<00:06:01.130> probably<00:06:01.430> going<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.610> take<00:06:01.729> a<00:06:01.760> bit

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
left it's probably going to take a bit

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.029 
left it's probably going to take a bit
of<00:06:01.970> getting<00:06:02.150> used<00:06:02.300> to<00:06:02.539> but<00:06:02.630> it's<00:06:02.870> it<00:06:03.020> is<00:06:03.320> pretty

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
of getting used to but it's it is pretty

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.100 
of getting used to but it's it is pretty
much<00:06:04.250> a<00:06:04.280> good<00:06:04.970> control<00:06:05.419> method<00:06:05.840> you<00:06:05.990> know

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
much a good control method you know

much a good control method you know
you've<00:06:06.260> got<00:06:06.440> complete<00:06:06.890> analog<00:06:07.250> control<00:06:07.669> which

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
you've got complete analog control which

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.960 
you've got complete analog control which
replicates<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.630> kind<00:06:08.810> of<00:06:08.960> M<00:06:09.760> accelerator<00:06:10.760> on

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
replicates the kind of M accelerator on

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.190 
replicates the kind of M accelerator on
