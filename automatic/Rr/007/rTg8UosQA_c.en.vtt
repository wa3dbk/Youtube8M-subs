00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
but they sound pretty good two tones
volume<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> there's<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.030> toggle

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
volume and there's this little toggle

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.959 
volume and there's this little toggle
switch<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.840> believe<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.229> splits<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.959 --> 00:01:58.969 
switch I believe which splits the

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.270 
switch I believe which splits the
humbucker<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:01.110> something<00:02:01.710> ice<00:02:01.950> cube<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
humbucker or does something ice cube on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
humbucker or does something ice cube on
the<00:02:02.310> out<00:02:02.490> position<00:02:03.030> because<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.240> couldn't<00:02:03.600> ask

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the out position because I couldn't ask

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.230 
the out position because I couldn't ask
