right<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.949> membrane<00:00:02.179> this<00:00:03.179> is

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
right this is the membrane this is

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.530 
right this is the membrane this is
coenzyme<00:00:03.840> q<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:05.100> I've<00:00:05.190> given<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.609> coenzyme<00:00:06.060> q

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
coenzyme q and I've given the coenzyme q

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.960 
coenzyme q and I've given the coenzyme q
different<00:00:06.990> symbols<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.950> we<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.250> track

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
different symbols so that we can track

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.070 
different symbols so that we can track
which<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:09.269> which<00:00:09.510> ones<00:00:09.750> which

taking<00:01:04.049> too<00:01:04.140> complex<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> now<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> new

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
taking too complex for so now a new

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.820 
taking too complex for so now a new
coenzyme<00:01:08.820> q<00:01:09.030> comes<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:10.260> complex<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:10.740> or

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
coenzyme q comes in from complex one or

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
coenzyme q comes in from complex one or
two<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:12.900> delivers<00:01:13.080> another<00:01:13.439> electron<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.939> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
two it delivers another electron so this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
two it delivers another electron so this
comings<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.509> Q<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.439> got<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.979> other

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
comings on Q so that's got to the other

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
comings on Q so that's got to the other
electron<00:01:20.520> goes<00:01:20.670> off<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> new<00:01:21.420> cytochrome<00:01:21.900> C

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
electron goes off to a new cytochrome C

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.810 
electron goes off to a new cytochrome C
that's<00:01:22.350> stopped<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.400> take<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.670> off

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that's stopped so that can take that off

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.450 
that's stopped so that can take that off
too<00:01:23.850> complex<00:01:24.390> cool<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.770> protons<00:01:26.189> again

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
too complex cool and the protons again

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
too complex cool and the protons again
I'll<00:01:26.640> point<00:01:26.909> out<00:01:27.119> into<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> intermembrane

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
I'll point out into the intermembrane

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
I'll point out into the intermembrane
space<00:01:30.020> now<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.070> takes<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:32.670> protons

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
space now this one takes two protons

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.420 
space now this one takes two protons
from<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> matrix<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:34.590> make<00:01:34.770> itself<00:01:35.100> fully

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
from the matrix to make itself fully

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.480 
from the matrix to make itself fully
reduced<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.460> back<00:01:39.799> into<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
reduced so now that can go back into the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
reduced so now that can go back into the
Q<00:01:42.000> pool<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> membrane<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:45.530> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
Q pool in the in the membrane and this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.100 
Q pool in the in the membrane and this
one<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.890> now<00:01:47.009> fully<00:01:47.340> oxidized<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.869> can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
one is now fully oxidized so that can

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.139 
one is now fully oxidized so that can
either<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.409> back<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.280> collect<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.640> electrons

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
either go back to collect more electrons

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.980 
either go back to collect more electrons
or<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> join<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.649> Q<00:01:52.860> ball<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.990> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
or it can join the Q ball to come in to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.399 
or it can join the Q ball to come in to
start<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.290> cycle<00:01:55.439> again<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:57.409> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
start the cycle again and that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.990 
start the cycle again and that
