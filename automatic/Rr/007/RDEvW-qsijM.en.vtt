with a little poorly still blush which
I've<00:04:08.480> never<00:04:08.510> tried<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.320> I<00:04:09.350> kind<00:04:09.620> of<00:04:09.650> wanted<00:04:09.830> to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
I've never tried so I kind of wanted to

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.250 
I've never tried so I kind of wanted to
try<00:04:10.100> that<00:04:10.330> another<00:04:11.330> benefit<00:04:11.660> high<00:04:11.870> beam<00:04:12.110> which

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
try that another benefit high beam which

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.860 
try that another benefit high beam which
I<00:04:12.380> like<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:12.920> it's<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.190> little<00:04:13.310> mini<00:04:13.519> sample<00:04:14.060> this

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
I like so it's a little mini sample this

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.320 
I like so it's a little mini sample this
is<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.140> guess<00:04:15.320> of<00:04:15.500> corlee<00:04:15.950> Serena<00:04:16.549> this<00:04:17.000> is<00:04:17.060> a

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
is I guess of corlee Serena this is a

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.380 
is I guess of corlee Serena this is a
juicy<00:04:17.900> coral<00:04:18.380> lip<00:04:18.950> gloss<00:04:19.190> I'm<00:04:20.120> not<00:04:20.239> really

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
juicy coral lip gloss I'm not really

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.969 
juicy coral lip gloss I'm not really
that<00:04:20.630> into<00:04:20.780> coral<00:04:21.229> but<00:04:21.350> I<00:04:21.410> thought<00:04:21.680> something

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
that into coral but I thought something

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.270 
that into coral but I thought something
like<00:04:22.160> this<00:04:22.220> would<00:04:22.400> be<00:04:22.610> nice<00:04:22.760> because

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
like this would be nice because

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.340 
like this would be nice because
kind<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.490> do<00:04:23.639> a<00:04:23.670> whole<00:04:23.880> look<00:04:24.090> with<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.660> I

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
kind of do a whole look with it and I

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.350 
kind of do a whole look with it and I
can<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:25.650> try<00:04:25.920> out<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.280> products<00:04:26.760> co<00:04:26.910> instead

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
can just try out the products co instead

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.420 
can just try out the products co instead
of<00:04:27.450> by<00:04:27.600> each<00:04:27.900> one<00:04:28.110> individually<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.800> then<00:04:28.860> it

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
of by each one individually and then it

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.640 
of by each one individually and then it
comes<00:04:29.610> with<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:29.940> for<00:04:30.510> eyeshadow<00:04:30.900> colors<00:04:31.290> in<00:04:31.560> a

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
comes with the for eyeshadow colors in a

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.890 
comes with the for eyeshadow colors in a
black<00:04:31.889> liner<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:32.610> are<00:04:33.000> we<00:04:33.150> doing<00:04:33.450> probably<00:04:33.840> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
black liner so are we doing probably a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.270 
black liner so are we doing probably a
video<00:04:34.200> on<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:34.500> will<00:04:34.770> probably<00:04:35.010> has<00:04:35.220> a

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
video on this will probably has a

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.210 
video on this will probably has a
tutorial<00:04:35.460> in<00:04:35.700> a<00:04:35.760> review<00:04:36.030> with<00:04:36.210> one<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:37.560> then<00:04:38.130> I

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
tutorial in a review with one and then I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.070 
tutorial in a review with one and then I
got<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.639> make<00:04:38.850> up<00:04:38.970> for<00:04:39.000> ever<00:04:39.210> high<00:04:39.600> definition

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
got the make up for ever high definition

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.510 
got the make up for ever high definition
blush<00:04:40.470> which<00:04:40.710> I'm<00:04:40.860> really<00:04:40.950> excited<00:04:41.100> about

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
blush which I'm really excited about

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.580 
blush which I'm really excited about
these<00:04:42.000> are<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.450> little<00:04:42.930> like<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.320> thought<00:04:43.500> this

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
these are so little like I thought this

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.140 
these are so little like I thought this
would<00:04:43.770> be<00:04:43.800> a<00:04:43.889> lot<00:04:44.100> bigger<00:04:44.280> but<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.030> actually

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
would be a lot bigger but it's actually

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.720 
would be a lot bigger but it's actually
really<00:04:45.510> small<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.860> is<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.040> number<00:04:47.280> for

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
really small and this is a number for

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.590 
really small and this is a number for
its<00:04:48.120> kind<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.510> um<00:04:49.280> kind<00:04:50.280> of<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.580> night<00:04:51.270> like

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
its kind of um kind of a night like

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.600 
its kind of um kind of a night like
pinks<00:04:52.260> normally<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:52.889> wear<00:04:53.070> something<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.460> little

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
pinks normally I wear something a little

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.120 
pinks normally I wear something a little
bit<00:04:53.820> more<00:04:54.060> like<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.419> reddish<00:04:54.780> color<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:55.770> that's

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
bit more like a reddish color but that's

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.760 
bit more like a reddish color but that's
that<00:04:56.430> so<00:04:56.820> it's<00:04:57.660> an<00:04:57.720> ice<00:04:57.840> cream<00:04:58.140> blush<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.560> love

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
that so it's an ice cream blush I love

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.080 
that so it's an ice cream blush I love
makeup<00:04:59.010> rubber<00:04:59.340> products<00:04:59.790> I<00:04:59.880> use<00:05:00.060> a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
makeup rubber products I use a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.480 
makeup rubber products I use a
foundation<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.290> thought<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.980> blush<00:05:02.220> would

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
foundation so I thought the blush would

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.920 
foundation so I thought the blush would
probably<00:05:02.820> be<00:05:02.940> nice<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.390> i<00:05:03.419> like<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:03.750> so<00:05:03.780> far

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
probably be nice and i like it so far

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.460 
probably be nice and i like it so far
and<00:05:04.550> then<00:05:05.550> for<00:05:05.940> another<00:05:06.450> tutorial<00:05:06.840> thing<00:05:07.320> i'm

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470
