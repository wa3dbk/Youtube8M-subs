00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
coin on top of the trough so now you you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.649 
coin on top of the trough so now you you
can<00:02:05.189> use<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:06.619> for<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.679> scenario<00:02:08.489> where<00:02:08.909> maybe

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
can use this for a scenario where maybe

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.950 
can use this for a scenario where maybe
the<00:02:10.379> butter<00:02:10.799> breaks<00:02:11.459> troughs<00:02:11.939> so

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
the butter breaks troughs so

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.810 
the butter breaks troughs so
now<00:02:13.260> he<00:02:13.320> can't<00:02:13.740> break<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.100> trough<00:02:14.400> because

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
now he can't break that trough because

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.820 
now he can't break that trough because
there's<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.090> gold<00:02:15.330> clone<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.720> top<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.170> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
there's a gold clone on top of it you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.450 
there's a gold clone on top of it you
know<00:02:16.920> there's<00:02:17.160> there's<00:02:18.120> no<00:02:18.330> way<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:20.160> a

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
know there's there's no way so it's a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.940 
know there's there's no way so it's a
good<00:02:20.910> trick<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.140> trap<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.620> bata

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
good trick if you want to trap a bata

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.670 
good trick if you want to trap a bata
and<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.430> keep<00:02:23.610> them<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.420> where<00:02:24.680> he's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
and just keep them there to where he's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.060 
and just keep them there to where he's
not<00:02:25.860> able<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.550> out<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> just

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
not able to get out if you want to just

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.330 
not able to get out if you want to just
move<00:02:29.400> them<00:02:29.580> out<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.700> your<00:02:29.820> way<00:02:30.030> or<00:02:30.270> whatever

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
move them out of your way or whatever

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.420 
move them out of your way or whatever

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
trough you got to be insanely fast

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.980 
trough you got to be insanely fast
especially<00:03:04.470> if<00:03:04.920> it's<00:03:05.070> a<00:03:05.100> higher<00:03:05.280> level<00:03:05.640> water

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
you just have to be so so fast or you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.960 
you just have to be so so fast or you
can<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.620> someone<00:03:11.040> help<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.880> have

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
easier because then I can just rope up

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.690 
easier because then I can just rope up
and<00:03:16.260> you<00:03:16.590> don't<00:03:16.710> have<00:03:16.770> to<00:03:16.890> worry<00:03:17.070> about<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.400> but

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and you don't have to worry about it but

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.640 
and you don't have to worry about it but
see<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.240> position<00:03:18.750> there's<00:03:19.080> nothing<00:03:19.500> he

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
see in this position there's nothing he

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.050 
see in this position there's nothing he
can<00:03:19.860> do<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.010> leave<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.490> can<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.760> keep<00:03:20.880> on

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
can do to leave I can just keep on

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.480 
can do to leave I can just keep on
roping<00:03:21.450> them<00:03:21.570> indefinitely<00:03:22.280> even<00:03:23.280> if<00:03:23.400> he

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
roping them indefinitely even if he

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.570 
roping them indefinitely even if he
keeps<00:03:23.640> going<00:03:24.030> down<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:28.580> something

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
keeps going down so this is something

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.360 
keeps going down so this is something
that<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:29.880> did<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.420> while<00:03:30.810> back<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
that I did a while back it's in the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.140 
that I did a while back it's in the
yellow<00:03:32.940> hard<00:03:33.210> dragons<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:35.850> just<00:03:36.000> need

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
yellow hard dragons and you just need

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.660 
yellow hard dragons and you just need
one<00:03:36.360> trough<00:03:36.630> for<00:03:37.020> this<00:03:37.170> or<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.560> got<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> locker<00:03:38.400> in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
one trough for this or I got a locker in

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.320 
one trough for this or I got a locker in
this<00:03:38.700> case<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.870> lure<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:41.670> baader<00:03:41.850> with<00:03:42.210> an

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
this case you lure the baader with an

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.170 
this case you lure the baader with an
Arcanist<00:03:42.780> inside<00:03:43.410> these<00:03:43.590> crystals<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.940> so

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
Arcanist inside these crystals and so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.420 
Arcanist inside these crystals and so
see<00:03:45.660> now<00:03:45.930> he's<00:03:46.350> completely<00:03:46.680> trapped<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.310> he

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
see now he's completely trapped and he

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.330 
see now he's completely trapped and he
can't<00:03:47.670> get<00:03:47.820> out<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.090> those<00:03:48.180> crystals<00:03:48.720> he's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
can't get out of those crystals he's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.560 
can't get out of those crystals he's
he's<00:03:50.340> totally<00:03:50.820> trapped<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:53.250> then<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:54.510> you

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
he's totally trapped and so then now you

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.650 
he's totally trapped and so then now you
can<00:03:55.020> go<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.560> get<00:03:56.100> as<00:03:56.340> many<00:03:56.550> arcanists<00:03:57.120> as<00:03:57.450> you

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
can go and get as many arcanists as you

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.020 
can go and get as many arcanists as you
can<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:59.120> think<00:04:00.120> there's<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.800> maybe<00:04:01.800> six<00:04:02.430> or<00:04:02.760> so

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
can I think there's a maybe six or so

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.360 
can I think there's a maybe six or so
that<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.360> could<00:04:03.540> possibly<00:04:04.260> get<00:04:04.740> on<00:04:04.980> him

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
that you could possibly get on him
