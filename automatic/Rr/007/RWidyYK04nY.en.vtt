there's more steps to this checker than
the<00:02:25.080> other<00:02:25.230> ones<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.620> was<00:02:25.740> seen<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.640> at

the other ones that I was seen now at

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
the other ones that I was seen now at
first<00:02:27.030> time<00:02:27.210> was<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> little<00:02:27.480> bit<00:02:27.660> intimidating

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
first time was a little bit intimidating

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.750 
first time was a little bit intimidating
and<00:02:28.500> honestly<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.670> bit

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
and honestly I was a little bit

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.980 
and honestly I was a little bit
disappointed<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.480> was<00:02:30.600> hoping<00:02:30.840> that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
disappointed that I was hoping that

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.930 
disappointed that I was hoping that
would<00:02:31.080> be<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:32.100> two<00:02:32.220> steps<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:32.760> be

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
would be one or two steps and then be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.730 
would be one or two steps and then be
done<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.750> after<00:02:34.020> talking<00:02:34.230> with<00:02:34.350> Hannah<00:02:34.650> and

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
done but after talking with Hannah and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.050 
done but after talking with Hannah and
understanding<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> chemistry<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
understanding the chemistry that it

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.180 
understanding the chemistry that it
takes<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.390> run<00:02:36.540> an<00:02:36.690> accurate<00:02:37.140> calcium<00:02:37.620> test<00:02:37.890> I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
takes to run an accurate calcium test I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.100 
takes to run an accurate calcium test I
understood<00:02:38.970> why<00:02:39.390> they<00:02:39.510> had<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.720> include<00:02:39.900> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
understood why they had to include the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.080 
understood why they had to include the
steps<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.530> did<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:41.220> Hannah<00:02:41.880> did<00:02:42.030> a

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
steps that they did and Hannah did a

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.460 
steps that they did and Hannah did a
good<00:02:42.210> job<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.570> giving<00:02:42.660> us<00:02:42.840> syringes<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.320> are

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
good job of giving us syringes that are

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.020 
good job of giving us syringes that are
easy<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.830> use<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.040> instructions<00:02:44.850> that<00:02:44.940> are

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
easy to use and instructions that are

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.270 
easy to use and instructions that are
easy<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.390> use<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.680> steps<00:02:46.950> exactly

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
easy to use to get the steps exactly

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
easy to use to get the steps exactly
right<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.300> I'm<00:02:48.600> okay<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.170> there<00:02:49.320> are<00:02:49.440> more

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
right so I'm okay that there are more

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.860 
right so I'm okay that there are more
steps<00:02:49.920> for<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.280> test<00:02:50.580> especially<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.690> was

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
steps for this test especially it was

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
steps for this test especially it was
gonna<00:02:52.050> make<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> test<00:02:52.560> more<00:02:52.650> accurate<00:02:53.130> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
gonna make the test more accurate and

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.070 
gonna make the test more accurate and
speaking<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.210> accuracy<00:02:54.570> here's<00:02:54.870> another

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
speaking of accuracy here's another

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.360 
speaking of accuracy here's another
thing<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.410> jumped<00:02:55.710> out<00:02:55.800> at<00:02:55.860> me<00:02:55.980> about<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
thing that jumped out at me about the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.520 
thing that jumped out at me about the
Hannah<00:02:56.550> checker<00:02:56.850> Haines<00:02:57.810> advertised<00:02:58.260> at<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
Hannah checker Haines advertised at the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
Hannah checker Haines advertised at the

checker as an accuracy of plus or minus
six<00:03:00.630> percent<00:03:01.020> now<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.920> stock<00:03:02.280> solution

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
six percent now I have a stock solution

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.490 
six percent now I have a stock solution
of<00:03:02.820> calcium<00:03:02.970> where<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.570> exactly<00:03:04.110> what<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
of calcium where I know exactly what the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
of calcium where I know exactly what the
calcium<00:03:04.890> reading<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.580> that<00:03:05.700> solution<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.720> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
calcium reading is of that solution so I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.240 
calcium reading is of that solution so I
popped<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.230> solution<00:03:07.740> into<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.010> Hannah

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
popped that solution into the Hannah

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.160 
popped that solution into the Hannah
checker<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:09.000> found<00:03:09.270> that<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> accuracy<00:03:09.810> was

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
checker and found that the accuracy was

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.230 
checker and found that the accuracy was
even<00:03:10.410> better<00:03:10.620> than<00:03:10.860> advertised<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.940> was<00:03:12.060> down

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
even better than advertised it was down

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.570 
even better than advertised it was down
around<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.630> three<00:03:12.990> percent<00:03:13.380> range<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.190> props

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
around the three percent range so props

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.370 
around the three percent range so props
to<00:03:14.700> Hannah<00:03:14.940> I'm<00:03:15.540> very<00:03:15.870> impressed<00:03:16.050> that<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
to Hannah I'm very impressed that the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.050 
to Hannah I'm very impressed that the
checker<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.800> more<00:03:17.130> accurate<00:03:17.489> than<00:03:17.520> advertised

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
checker is more accurate than advertised

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.390 
checker is more accurate than advertised
as<00:03:18.270> well<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:19.110> lastly<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.010> say<00:03:20.190> if<00:03:20.310> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
as well and lastly I have to say if I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.949 
as well and lastly I have to say if I
had<00:03:20.520> a<00:03:20.550> complaint<00:03:20.910> about<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.270> checker<00:03:21.480> it

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
had a complaint about the checker it

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.990 
had a complaint about the checker it
would<00:03:22.080> be<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.739> don't<00:03:23.040> know<00:03:23.220> about<00:03:23.370> red<00:03:23.730> I

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
would be that I don't know about red I

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.610 
would be that I don't know about red I
mean<00:03:24.270> red<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.600> my<00:03:24.720> favorite<00:03:24.959> color<00:03:25.140> but<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
mean red is my favorite color but I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.930

think<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.950> would<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.190> saved<00:03:26.340> red<00:03:26.640> for<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
think I would have saved red for the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.940 
think I would have saved red for the

are<00:03:29.130> really<00:03:29.340> high<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:30.000> checker<00:03:30.209> would<00:03:30.450> glow

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
