getting<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.059> bracket<00:00:39.840> off<00:00:41.059> however<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
getting this bracket off however it

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.119 
getting this bracket off however it
would<00:00:42.390> make<00:00:42.570> life<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.050> whole<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.350> easier<00:00:43.530> if

would make life a whole lot easier if

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.569 
would make life a whole lot easier if
you<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:46.160> that<00:00:47.160> way<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.370> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you do because that that way you can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.729 
you do because that that way you can
skip<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> step<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> removing<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> exhaust

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
skip the step of removing the exhaust

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
skip the step of removing the exhaust
mid<00:00:50.070> pipe<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> before<00:00:54.030> any<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.510> try<00:00:54.750> to

just wanted to warn you that from the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
just wanted to warn you that from the
factory<00:01:00.770> Kawasaki<00:01:01.770> put<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.850> lot<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.860> thread

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
factory Kawasaki put a lot of thread

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
factory Kawasaki put a lot of thread
lock<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:06.869> bolts<00:01:07.939> these<00:01:08.939> bolts<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:10.140> made

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
lock in the bolts these bolts are made

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.870 
lock in the bolts these bolts are made
of<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.369> soft<00:01:11.670> material<00:01:12.110> so<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.250> thread

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
of very soft material so once the thread

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
of very soft material so once the thread
lock<00:01:15.090> has<00:01:15.299> set<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.439> makes<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.100> very<00:01:17.310> difficult

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
lock has set it makes it very difficult

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.080 
lock has set it makes it very difficult
to<00:01:17.939> remove<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:20.430> particular<00:01:20.850> swing<00:01:21.659> arm<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
to remove in this particular swing arm I

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
to remove in this particular swing arm I
wasn't<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.299> lucky<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:25.530> able<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:26.040> these

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
wasn't so lucky I was able to get these

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.039 
wasn't so lucky I was able to get these
two<00:01:26.700> bolts<00:01:27.060> out<00:01:28.340> normally<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.810> these<00:01:30.810> two

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
two bolts out normally and these two

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
two bolts out normally and these two
bolts<00:01:31.500> were<00:01:32.479> stuck<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.060> did<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.619> I<00:01:41.000> had

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
bolts were stuck so what I did was I had

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.280 
bolts were stuck so what I did was I had
to<00:01:42.470> well<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.890> boat<00:01:44.189> stripped<00:01:44.610> out

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
to well this boat stripped out

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
to well this boat stripped out
eventually<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.159> material<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.820> soft

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
eventually because the material so soft

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
eventually because the material so soft
so<00:01:48.869> what<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.590> was<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.920> had<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.280> drill

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
so what I had to do was I had to drill

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.190 
so what I had to do was I had to drill
the<00:01:52.110> head<00:01:52.290> off<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.950> both<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> bolts<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.340 

the<00:01:58.250> plate<00:01:59.250> comes<00:01:59.490> right<00:01:59.670> off<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.200> then<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the plate comes right off and then that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.530 
the plate comes right off and then that
just<00:02:01.619> leaves<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> stud<00:02:03.119> stuck

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
just leaves you with the stud stuck

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
just leaves you with the stud stuck
inside<00:02:04.670> and<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.039> stud<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.459> here

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
inside and this is the stud right here

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.840 
inside and this is the stud right here
as<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.750> top<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.200> pretty<00:02:10.619> mangled

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.730 

the<00:02:14.850> next<00:02:15.090> step<00:02:15.300> would<00:02:15.480> be<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> use<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> pair<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
the next step would be to use a pair of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.090 
the next step would be to use a pair of
vise<00:02:16.890> grips<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:19.260> know<00:02:19.290> brute<00:02:19.740> force

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
vise grips and just you know brute force

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.660 
vise grips and just you know brute force
to<00:02:21.110> take<00:02:22.110> them<00:02:22.290> off<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.310> see<00:02:23.550> the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
to take them off and you can see the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.530 
to take them off and you can see the
kind<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.060> scratched<00:02:24.720> up<00:02:24.960> es<00:02:25.350> wing<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.800> there

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
kind of scratched up es wing on there

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.610 
kind of scratched up es wing on there
now<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.780> why<00:02:27.900> ultimately<00:02:28.050> normal<00:02:28.560> I'm

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
now this is why ultimately normal I'm

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.970 
now this is why ultimately normal I'm
not<00:02:28.740> gonna<00:02:28.890> I'm<00:02:29.490> not<00:02:29.520> gonna<00:02:29.820> reuse<00:02:30.240> this<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:31.530> it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
not gonna I'm not gonna reuse this so it

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.680 
not gonna I'm not gonna reuse this so it
didn't<00:02:32.250> really<00:02:32.370> matter<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.790> was<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.270> trying

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
didn't really matter I was just trying

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.710 
didn't really matter I was just trying
to<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.990> bracket<00:02:34.350> off<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:36.180> see<00:02:36.360> how<00:02:36.480> tough

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
to get the bracket off to see how tough

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.890 
to get the bracket off to see how tough
it<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:39.620> another<00:02:40.620> tip<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.540> before<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.690> try

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
it was another tip is to before you try

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.720 
it was another tip is to before you try
to<00:02:42.930> remove<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.440> bolts<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.550> heat<00:02:45.000> up<00:02:46.730> heat

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
to remove the bolts is to heat up heat

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.440 
to remove the bolts is to heat up heat
up<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> bolt<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.450> try<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.720> melt<00:02:49.590> off<00:02:49.770> or

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
up the bolt and try to melt off or

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.400 
up the bolt and try to melt off or
loosen<00:02:51.450> up<00:02:51.570> by<00:02:52.500> heat<00:02:52.800> as<00:02:53.040> much<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:55.080> loosen

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
loosen up by heat as much as or loosen

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.410 
loosen up by heat as much as or loosen
up<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.000> thread<00:02:57.000> lock<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.330> much<00:02:57.510> as<00:02:57.630> possible

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
up the thread lock as much as possible

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.780 
up the thread lock as much as possible
so<00:03:00.420> with<00:03:00.540> my<00:03:00.690> new<00:03:00.720> swing<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.560> what<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
so with my new swing on this is what I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.680 
so with my new swing on this is what I
used<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.150> is<00:03:03.620> just<00:03:04.620> sufficient<00:03:05.570> if<00:03:06.570> I

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
used and this is just sufficient if I

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.449 
used and this is just sufficient if I
were<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.110> again<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.650> would<00:03:07.850> buy<00:03:08.850> a

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
were to do it again I would buy a

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:17.800 
were to do it again I would buy a
propane<00:03:11.459> torch<00:03:12.020> for<00:03:14.720> for<00:03:15.720> soldering<00:03:16.610> copper

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
propane torch for for soldering copper

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.120 
propane torch for for soldering copper
copper<00:03:18.810> piping<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.600> has<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.800> one<00:03:22.980> I've

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
copper piping this one has this one I've

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.449 
copper piping this one has this one I've
I've<00:03:23.250> using<00:03:23.610> has<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> heat<00:03:24.739> blower<00:03:25.739> attachment

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
I've using has a heat blower attachment

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.880 
I've using has a heat blower attachment
as<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.700> see<00:03:26.910> right<00:03:26.940> there<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.769> can

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
as you see right there and and it can

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.780 
as you see right there and and it can
get<00:03:29.040> up<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.400> pretty<00:03:29.840> hot<00:03:30.920> temperature<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.730> I

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
get up to a pretty hot temperature so I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.860 
get up to a pretty hot temperature so I
just<00:03:33.000> left<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.360> there<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.320> bolt<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:35.130> a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
just left it there on the bolt for a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.620 
just left it there on the bolt for a
couple<00:03:36.870> couple<00:03:37.500> minutes<00:03:38.090> which<00:03:39.090> heated<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.540> up

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
couple couple minutes which heated it up

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.920 
couple couple minutes which heated it up
sufficiently<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.920> was<00:03:41.250> able<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.810> get<00:03:42.810> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
sufficiently and I was able to get the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.570 
sufficiently and I was able to get the
bolts<00:03:43.230> off<00:03:44.840> quite<00:03:45.840> successfully<00:03:46.820> although<00:03:49.580> on

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
bolts off quite successfully although on

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.540 
bolts off quite successfully although on
the<00:03:50.910> new<00:03:51.030> swing<00:03:51.300> arm<00:03:51.769> one<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.010> four<00:03:53.190> bolts

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
the new swing arm one of the four bolts

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.840 
the new swing arm one of the four bolts
didn't<00:03:54.300> want<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.600> come<00:03:54.720> off<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.140> had<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.590> use

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
didn't want to come off so I had to use

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.900 
didn't want to come off so I had to use
the<00:03:56.850> vise<00:03:57.300> grip<00:03:57.570> method<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.610> wanted<00:03:59.820> to

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the vise grip method so I just wanted to

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.850 
the vise grip method so I just wanted to
give<00:04:00.060> anyone<00:04:00.540> a<00:04:00.660> heads<00:04:00.900> up<00:04:01.080> who<00:04:01.230> has<00:04:01.440> this<00:04:01.620> bike

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
use the the hex keys that come with the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.459 
use the the hex keys that come with the
ratchets<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.389> use<00:04:32.539> on<00:04:32.719> a<00:04:32.750> ratchet<00:04:33.289> set

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469 
ratchets that you use on a ratchet set

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.559 
ratchets that you use on a ratchet set
but<00:04:34.370> that'll<00:04:34.639> make<00:04:34.819> it<00:04:34.879> a<00:04:34.939> lot<00:04:35.090> more<00:04:35.240> easier

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
but that'll make it a lot more easier

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.409 
but that'll make it a lot more easier
you<00:04:35.659> get<00:04:35.780> more<00:04:35.990> torque<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:36.949> leverage<00:04:37.419> with

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
you get more torque and leverage with

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.980 
you get more torque and leverage with
those<00:04:38.629> as<00:04:38.990> well<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.360> concludes<00:04:41.569> it<00:04:41.840> for

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
those as well so that concludes it for

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.249 
those as well so that concludes it for
