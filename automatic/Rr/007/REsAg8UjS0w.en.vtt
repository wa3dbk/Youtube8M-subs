00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:08.929

 is not skins I do not know why 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.650
 there is less game that did not want I am 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.219
 can display my skin see it I 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.820
 am below 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.840
 there I am in vision is not normal 1 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:25.070
 I'm supposed to see me there but I'm 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.050
 see not because I do not know enough I 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.460
 wanted to make a joke like l'oréal 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.500
 because I play well with my skin 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.559
 clodo it would have gone from gags but that's it 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.610
 I have a little problem I can not handle 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:41.089
 cut my game and handed several times 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.640
 it still shows me not my face at 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:49.129
 worse shit here is this house has 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.019
 been done by ben kelvin or banica late 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.890
 as you do the flight on planet bike 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.879
 race you have the links of 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.199
 download the map in the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.510
 description of the video as at each 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.930
 times and in fact this house she is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.730
 hyper little already and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.890
 and rather well done despite its size 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.370
 that 's what I wanted to show you on 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.290
 this video 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.550
 so here I went around the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.910
 home and it's almost already over the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.680
 visit 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.390
 so it's going to be extremely fast 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.590
 climbs top chrono and we arrive here 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.300
 on a small boat completely 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.860
 shit because it looks more like 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.840
 to a fruit crate when you go to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.210
 supermarket that a real boat I am 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.280
 sorry that's disgusting it deserves 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.350
 just to be fooled at once 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.510
 of tnt so we arrive on our 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.700
 small terrace of the house with so 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.740
 seats here I think it's 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 seats there is there as with my 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.050
 capucci species of pillars antwerp 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.090
 is pretty cool know because it's 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.409
 this is a 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.869
 it's a sofa it's a bell 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.189
 very weird to be a task 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.770
 short so suddenly I'm not too and 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.659
 extended on the outside at the level of the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.880
 structure it's a roof that's everything 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.890
 flat and that sticks glue on the side of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.649
 the house posed on a species of 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.490
 platforms both connected by 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.640
 kind of stuff like that 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.420
 see here cubes that allow to 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.179
 connect the wall roof with the platform and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.989
 the allied of wall two pillars in 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.209
 glass 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.910
 so here it is very simple a 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.940
 structure including all connected with a 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.579
 little bit of something very simple 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.519
 if there too individuals and no 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.500
 geometric and structural properties 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.879
 particularly notable aside from 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 this is the little thing I had you 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.319
 shown just now so here I have this 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.340
 block that are trying to stick to each other 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.319
 to others by wooden junctions 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.690
 So here we have a small living room 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.430
 side of a terrace that overlooks the sea 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.980
 which is completely buggy at the level of 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.540
 junk by my shaders 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.010
 I would have to put too small fine 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.079
 for it's better I do not have 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 still had time to put it 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.319
 since the state nor filming our video 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.139
 so that's what it's a dj table 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:59.710
 I feel like waiting is throwing 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:02.490
 all a terrace 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.490
 this is simply 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.599
 so inside we have a kind of 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:17.970
 door here with a bed a little girl 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.610
 suri if the story of giving a little 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.849
 sea ​​air well here is even if it is 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.250
 big opening on the sides a species 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.660
 of pillars towards her will really melt 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.440
 that I use it is also and then antwerp 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.569
 is super classy 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.020
 a small kitchen is not a small 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.180
 cousin 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.410
 a little carpet that goes well the wall in 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.910
 ravioles and small bathrooms 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.630
 it's almost like camping 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.630
 because its so small 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.629
 to geese what is this delirium slipped 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.549
 of earl you saw the sign as 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.000
 she moves they have effects of the 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.109
 tecktonik but bourricot version ah yes 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.670
 you are tectonic if the game will be 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.870
 as good here it is roughly 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.609
 everything they had shown so here 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.099
 with the ladder napkins and 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.659
 then that's about it's all 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.430
 true very small everything tiny and small 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.910
 I wanted to show you anyway because 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.919
 that despite its low and stylish size I 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.620
 find how I really like it 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:27.910
 stylus so that's how I forgot 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.930
 to get in the habit of doing that then 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.009
 you know exactly what I'm going 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.190
 do a obviously because here at 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.849
 every time I forget to fart 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.759
 sagan the tnt 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.699
 I only do times and not 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.750
 cold lol me I do close I 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.800
 make jokes with my own nickname 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.160
 stuck up 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.650
 I got to the legends so it's 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.990
 really stylish the fact that I break the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.409
 next booth in the end does not mean 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.690
 I do not like building 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.600
 far from these styles and all 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.360
 manners 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.530
 and here we go 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:12.540
 very good game to all good sailors and 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.540
 see you
