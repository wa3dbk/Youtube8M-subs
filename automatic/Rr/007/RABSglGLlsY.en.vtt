00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.200
 since I like to rehabilitate a little 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.350
 the image of animals that do not enjoy 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.110
 properly a good reputation 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.910
 this time I'll take care of the bats if 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.559
 you have a few minutes of patience vi 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.250
 you will realize that all the hatred there is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 people going towards them are absurd 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.890
 first the bats are 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.230
 mammals belonging to the order of gods 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.910
 bats in turn divided into 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 under orders mega chiroptera and micro 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.949
 bats are the only ones 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.689
 mammals capable of active flying e 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.210
 constitute the order of most mammals 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.770
 numerous after rodents 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.000
 I would also like to point out that though 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.399
 many ignorant call them with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 disdain flying mice from a point of 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.910
 genetic and systematic view of tracks 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.100
 real have nothing to do with i 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.960
 mice 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.070
 the flight is made possible by the passage 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.480
 a vascularized skin membrane 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 practically it is skin that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.110
 supported by the arms from the fingers 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.329
 modified to become very thin 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.940
 elongated goes to form a true e 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 own wing the passage extends up 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 on the sides and often is also present 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.689
 so-called uropean tortoise an extension 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.369
 of the membrane presents between the legs and 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.619
 which also incorporates the queue where you are 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.780
 present the two under orders are 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.860
 quite different from each other so there is 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.860
 we will deal individually 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 we start from the micro bats 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 numerous present practically in all 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.680
 the world with many families e 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.390
 many kinds are absent only 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.640
 in areas near the poles a 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.189
 because of extreme cold or in islands 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.079
 remote ocean as their name implies 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.570
 these are species with dimensions for 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.180
 the most average small though most 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.759
 large of them are larger than the mega 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.189
 the smaller bats the tail is always 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.880
 present even if they pass sometimes 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.460
 no 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.439
 in these cases and you are free in the micro 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.500
 bats the second finger of the hand e 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.930
 attached it is bound to the third but without 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.369
 bore you with anatomical issues la 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.329
 most obvious aesthetic difference 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:02.880
 concerns muzzle and ears generally 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.520
 muzzle a complex shape in relation 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.530
 to the diet of the species in question i 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 noses can have very curious shapes 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.330
 not to mention the ears but in 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.590
 nature all things to its why and if 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.140
 ears of micro bats 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.480
 so surprising shapes is because hearing 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.800
 and their main sense is the micro 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.110
 bats are able to issue 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.330
 ultrasound sounds inaudible 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.860
 from the human ear 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.019
 these impulses are continuously emitted 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.110
 during the flight and bouncing on 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.129
 objects and the surrounding landscape 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.470
 return to the ear of the district 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.180
 where they are processed according to 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.099
 return times 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.930
 a matter of thousandths of a second and 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.970
 thanks to his highly wanted brain 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.580
 the animal manages to recreate an image 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.980
 three - dimensional of its surroundings 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.590
 in his mind it is just like sites 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.799
 beast rally saw with ears 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.360
 absolutely wonderful often use 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.160
 the same method to identify also 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.829
 their prey in this case 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.540
 insectivore that's explained why theirs 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.510
 ears are so large and evolved 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.890
 complex but eye because it does not want 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.280
 by no means to say that of pistels are 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.650
 blind 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.209
 in fact they see us even if in the case 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.879
 of the chiroptera the view is not of 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.530
 some of them make this way more developed 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.450
 animals are often crepuscular or 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.209
 nightlife and many species live in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.160
 day colonies usually rest 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.410
 holed up in caves and ravines caves 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.639
 natural happens in trees or even 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.170
 attics and garage 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.389
 clinging to the walls or hanging from the head 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.489
 down most of the micro 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.889
 insect bats, for example, lo 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.630
 they are all our own in one night 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.160
 devour hundreds or so on the fly 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.799
 thousands of small insects like 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.690
 gnats and mosquitoes or moths every year 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.340
 make it out of tons 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.639
 if we think about it for a moment the service 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.650
 made to humans and great micro 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.840
 bats are not only very important 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.579
 purposes of natural balance but without 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.790
 of them we will be invaded by mosquitoes 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.260
 do a little you make the case to hate them 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.780
 other species can be carnivorous 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.669
 pisci vole or frugivori ie they can 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.880
 eat small, respectively 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:04.980
 several prey fish or fruit some 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.319
 species are even menarini vr and yes 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.730
 that is, they nectar and travel by 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.950
 one flower to another contribute 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.290
 enormously to pollination and to 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.430
 plant reproduction 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.410
 in the vast majority of cases 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.450
 follow food regime highly 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.079
 specialized and difficult to find 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.669
 finally some omnivorous species 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.820
 like the vampires of central and south america 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.090
 they feed on blood but it is one 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.810
 spa 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.490
 a minority we now move to the mega 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.720
 bats so named for the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.630
 medium to large size 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.540
 although the smaller species are more 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.040
 small of the larger micro bats 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.110
 in the mega-bats the second finger e 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.389
 independent not strictly related to 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.240
 third the queue is always free or 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.889
 even the mega bats are missing 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.930
 contrary to the many micro 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.150
 bats are widespread alone 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.919
 family of hetero podiums in the area 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.500
 tropical of the old world which 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.169
 means in sub-Saharan Africa in 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.729
 South East Asia and the ocean 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.220
 the largest species I have, however, tus 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.139
 vampirus can reach while chin of 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.580
 wingspan 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.380
 don't worry though because these are there 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.770
 distracts and feeds exclusively on 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.110
 fruit and nectar are said 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.270
 vulgarly flying foxes because they 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.880
 use is often elongated and recalls that 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.800
 precisely the ears of a fox 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.720
 they are small and never as complex as those 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.699
 micro-bats and this is why 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.740
 since it is a matter of recording them of screaming the 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.930
 their main sense is the view really 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.570
 rather acute another sense 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.490
 Only very few olives are important 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.919
 species and present a rudimentary e 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.229
 location not at all comparable to 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.789
 that of the imega micro bats 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.620
 bats often live in colonies 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.000
 very numerous and love to pass the 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.220
 days all hanging from the branches of the 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.979
 trees upside down scratches dossier 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.240
 ventilating both micro-bats and 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.460
 mega bats give birth 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.539
 generally a little at a time 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.160
 stay for almost all the time 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.229
 clinging to her mother's fur 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.419
 when the mother has to leave the 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.830
 small to go hunting on the way back 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.289
 always recognizes its appeal among 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.880
 thousand 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.610
 the average life span of 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.889
 bats depends on their species 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.360
 Natural predators are innumerable but 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.090
 it is obviously the man who causes the 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.190
 most damage these wonderful little animals 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.479
 like many other creatures of liszt rally 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.940
 have been subject to shock and 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.610
 superstitions their appearance a little 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.650
 the shape of their wings is strange to them 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.599
 night habits meant that in 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.570
 past were associated with ghosts 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.010
 witches or even to hell with that 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.660
 is translated into killings and hatred 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.219
 unjustified 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.140
 today fortunately there is a greater 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:38.700
 awareness and studies more 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.790
 recent have taught us how much 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.730
 bats are useful 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.570
 the ecosystem and man himself 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.820
 many species are rightly 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.190
 protected so if you have the good fortune of 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.440
 see someone don't be afraid but 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:53.010
 respect it there is still too many people that 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.010
 he hates them
