crews<00:00:21.920> blast<00:00:22.920> would<00:00:23.189> imply<00:00:23.930> you<00:00:24.930> take<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
crews blast would imply you take a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.810 
crews blast would imply you take a
multiple<00:00:25.470> steroids<00:00:26.039> stack<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> certain

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
multiple steroids stack for a certain

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.769 
multiple steroids stack for a certain
period<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> time<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.449> let's<00:00:27.570> say<00:00:27.630> you're

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
period of time so let's say you're

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.240 
period of time so let's say you're
taking<00:00:27.900> five<00:00:28.349> different<00:00:28.560> steroids<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
taking five different steroids that

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
taking five different steroids that
would<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> blast<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.650> crews<00:00:31.890> would

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
would be the blast and the crews would

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.700 
would be the blast and the crews would
be<00:00:32.369> let's<00:00:32.550> say<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.730> take<00:00:32.969> an<00:00:33.270> HRT<00:00:34.079> dose<00:00:34.320> or

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
be let's say you take an HRT dose or

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.850 
be let's say you take an HRT dose or
hormone<00:00:35.430> replacement<00:00:35.940> dose<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.710> let's<00:00:37.710> say

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
hormone replacement dose of let's say

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.470 
hormone replacement dose of let's say
testosterone<00:00:38.550> for<00:00:38.760> like<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.329> two

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
testosterone for like a one or two

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.330 
testosterone for like a one or two
hundred<00:00:39.629> milligrams<00:00:40.100> for<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> prolonged

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
hundred milligrams for a prolonged

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.319 
hundred milligrams for a prolonged
period<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.850> time

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
period of time

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
period of time
so<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.780> essentially<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.350> completely

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so that essentially you are completely

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.310 
so that essentially you are completely
on<00:00:44.480> some<00:00:45.480> type<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.750> drug<00:00:46.260> steroid<00:00:47.160> stack

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
on some type of drug steroid stack

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.270 
on some type of drug steroid stack
constantly<00:00:49.320> year<00:00:49.559> round<00:00:49.770> all<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.010> time

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
constantly year round all the time

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.350 
constantly year round all the time
you're<00:00:50.460> never<00:00:50.610> coming<00:00:50.820> off<00:00:50.969> okay<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:54.059> I

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you're never coming off okay and this I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.119 
you're never coming off okay and this I
guess<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> wasn't<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.410> followed<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
guess this wasn't really followed in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.119 
guess this wasn't really followed in
like<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> 70's<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.090> 80's<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like this 70's and 80's this was you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.590 
like this 70's and 80's this was you
know<00:00:59.160> back<00:00:59.430> then<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.940> was<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.449> could

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
know back then there was you could

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.420 
know back then there was you could
definitely<00:01:01.079> see<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> guys<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:02.010> bigger<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
definitely see the guys get bigger and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
definitely see the guys get bigger and
smaller<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> keep<00:01:03.059> seeing<00:01:03.239> pictures<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
smaller and I keep seeing pictures and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.170 
smaller and I keep seeing pictures and
videos<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.049> Arnold<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:05.159> inference<00:01:05.939> when<00:01:06.060> he

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
videos of Arnold like inference when he

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
videos of Arnold like inference when he
walked<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.689> pumping<00:01:07.320> iron<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> gym<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
walked into pumping iron in the gym it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.179 
walked into pumping iron in the gym it
was<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.340> lot<00:01:08.580> smaller<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.950> five<00:01:10.950> weeks

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
was a lot smaller than it was five weeks

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
was a lot smaller than it was five weeks
later<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.570> was<00:01:12.689> finally<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.020> their

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
later when he was finally in their

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.270 
later when he was finally in their
training<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> tank<00:01:13.650> top<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> stuff<00:01:14.159> you

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
training in a tank top and stuff you

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
training in a tank top and stuff you
could<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.610> him<00:01:14.790> grow<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.780> pros<00:01:16.020> back

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
could see him grow and all the pros back

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.460 
could see him grow and all the pros back
then<00:01:16.439> used<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:18.110> probably<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
then used to go off probably I think the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
then used to go off probably I think the
rule<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.979> thumb<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.880> 12

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
rule of thumb was if you're on for 12

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.490 
rule of thumb was if you're on for 12
weeks<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.270> offer<00:01:21.570> 12<00:01:21.930> weeks<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.350> what

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
weeks you offer 12 weeks and that's what

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
weeks you offer 12 weeks and that's what
they<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> 80s<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
they would do and then in the 80s is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
they would do and then in the 80s is
very<00:01:24.869> similar<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.860> know<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.130> would<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
very similar you know they would go on

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.999 
very similar you know they would go on
in<00:01:26.670> often<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.150> pictures<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.630> guys<00:01:28.009> Bob

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.940 
then the 90s hit and it assured in that
new<00:01:44.270> size<00:01:45.270> game<00:01:46.049> where<00:01:46.320> everybody<00:01:46.649> tried<00:01:46.860> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
new size game where everybody tried to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
new size game where everybody tried to
be<00:01:47.040> bigger<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> they<00:01:48.210> realized<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:48.990> were

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
be bigger and they realized if they were

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.870 
be bigger and they realized if they were
going<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> steroid<00:01:50.159> cycle<00:01:50.520> then<00:01:50.640> they<00:01:50.729> came

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
going on a steroid cycle then they came

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
going on a steroid cycle then they came
off<00:01:51.180> for<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> certain<00:01:52.259> period<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.560> time<00:01:52.619> when<00:01:52.829> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
off for a certain period of time when I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.499 
off for a certain period of time when I
went<00:01:53.040> back<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.850> were<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.149> trying<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
went back on they were just trying to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.510 
went back on they were just trying to
catch<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> where<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.229> were<00:01:55.290> when<00:01:55.770> they

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
catch up to where they were when they

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.889 
catch up to where they were when they
left<00:01:56.549> off<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.270> they'll<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:57.750> little

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
left off so now they'll have very little

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.959 
left off so now they'll have very little
time<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.290> building<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.740> top<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.579> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
time for building on top of it so you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.490 
time for building on top of it so you
notice<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> guys<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> 70s<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.409> 80s

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
notice that the guys in the 70s and 80s

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
notice that the guys in the 70s and 80s
they<00:02:01.710> never<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.100> any<00:02:02.219> bigger<00:02:02.490> lead<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
they never really any bigger lead to a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
they never really any bigger lead to a
certain<00:02:03.149> size<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.079> stay<00:02:04.229> there<00:02:04.409> there

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
certain size they just stay there there

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
certain size they just stay there there
was<00:02:04.649> no<00:02:04.740> 10<00:02:04.950> pound<00:02:05.189> jumpsuit<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.729> five<00:02:05.939> pound

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
was no 10 pound jumpsuit on five pound

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
was no 10 pound jumpsuit on five pound
jumps<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:07.020> pretty<00:02:07.259> much<00:02:07.409> stayed<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.799> size

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
jumps they pretty much stayed that size

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.089 
jumps they pretty much stayed that size
in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.300> 90s<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.170> they<00:02:10.259> realized<00:02:10.440> if

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
in the 90s that's when they realized if

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.950 
in the 90s that's when they realized if
they<00:02:11.550> had<00:02:11.700> stayed<00:02:12.030> on

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
they had stayed on

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.420 
they had stayed on
but<00:02:13.230> couldn't<00:02:13.380> stand<00:02:13.590> massive<00:02:14.010> dosages

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
but couldn't stand massive dosages

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.850 
but couldn't stand massive dosages
because<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.760> would<00:02:14.850> fryer<00:02:15.180> your<00:02:16.170> antigen

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
because it would fryer your antigen

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.230 
because it would fryer your antigen
receptors<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:17.580> things<00:02:17.820> wouldn't<00:02:18.090> work

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
receptors and then things wouldn't work

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.520 
receptors and then things wouldn't work
at<00:02:18.390> all<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.570> you<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> side<00:02:19.080> effects<00:02:19.380> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
at all and you get the side effects that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.590 
at all and you get the side effects that
were<00:02:19.650> even<00:02:19.800> worse<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.240> would<00:02:21.360> get<00:02:21.510> them

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
were even worse then you would get them

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.530 
were even worse then you would get them
if<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> normally<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.380> them<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.770> if<00:02:23.010> you're

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
if you normally got them so if you're

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.610 
if you normally got them so if you're
interested<00:02:24.540> receptors<00:02:25.080> are<00:02:25.200> fried<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.440> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
interested receptors are fried and you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.930 
interested receptors are fried and you
kept<00:02:25.860> pumping<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.310> drugs<00:02:26.490> through<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.760> body

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
kept pumping the drugs through your body

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.260 
kept pumping the drugs through your body
hair<00:02:27.930> loss<00:02:28.250> acne<00:02:29.250> all<00:02:29.610> these<00:02:29.880> things<00:02:30.120> that

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
hair loss acne all these things that

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.040 
hair loss acne all these things that
would<00:02:30.360> happen<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:32.270> to<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.450> much<00:02:33.600> lesser

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
would happen you know to a much lesser

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.620 
would happen you know to a much lesser
level<00:02:34.310> what<00:02:35.310> happened<00:02:35.640> really<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.030> bad<00:02:36.390> if

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
level what happened really really bad if

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.180 
level what happened really really bad if
they<00:02:36.780> kept<00:02:36.990> on<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.350> drug<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:37.860> figured

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
they kept on the drug so they figured

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.570 
they kept on the drug so they figured
what<00:02:39.030> do<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.180> do<00:02:39.240> now<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.830> they<00:02:40.830> would<00:02:40.950> pull

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
what do I do now and they would pull

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.160 
what do I do now and they would pull
back<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.030> throttle<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> little<00:02:42.720> bit<00:02:42.840> go<00:02:43.050> on

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
back the throttle a little bit go on

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.260 
back the throttle a little bit go on
their<00:02:43.320> cruise<00:02:43.500> dose<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.730> that<00:02:44.850> way<00:02:44.910> they<00:02:45.060> would

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
their cruise dose so that way they would

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.030 
their cruise dose so that way they would
maintain<00:02:45.450> most<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.170> what<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.410> gained<00:02:46.710> and

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
maintain most of what they gained and

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.250 
maintain most of what they gained and
then<00:02:47.850> when<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.060> came<00:02:48.180> time<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.600> blast<00:02:48.810> again

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
then when it came time to blast again

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.750 
then when it came time to blast again
they<00:02:49.560> would<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.920> increasing<00:02:50.310> the

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
they would up to increasing the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.110 
they would up to increasing the
intensity<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.420> workouts<00:02:52.400> up<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.610> dosages

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
intensity of the workouts up the dosages

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.240 
intensity of the workouts up the dosages
up<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> food<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.650> another<00:02:55.920> successful

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
up the food and have another successful

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.630 
up the food and have another successful
blast<00:02:56.910> cycle<00:02:57.570> or<00:02:57.840> blast<00:02:58.200> section<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.310> cycle

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
blast cycle or blast section of a cycle

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.060 
blast cycle or blast section of a cycle
and<00:02:59.790> this<00:03:00.510> went<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.140> mean<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.680> am

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
and this went on for I mean I am

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.650 
and this went on for I mean I am
assuming<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.580> goes<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.850> nowadays<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.270> lot<00:03:03.450> too

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
assuming it goes on nowadays a lot too

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.610 
assuming it goes on nowadays a lot too
because<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.840> hear<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:03.990> lot<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.200> people<00:03:04.410> talking

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
because I hear a lot of people talking

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.830 
because I hear a lot of people talking
about<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:05.040> it<00:03:05.670> just<00:03:05.730> back<00:03:06.180> then<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.570> didn't

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
about it it just back then it didn't

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.720 
about it it just back then it didn't
have<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.960> name<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.890> go<00:03:07.980> with<00:03:08.010> its<00:03:08.250> face<00:03:08.490> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
have a name to go with its face it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.130 
have a name to go with its face it
wasn't<00:03:09.000> called<00:03:09.120> blast<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:09.660> cruise<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.050> was

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
wasn't called blast and cruise it was

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.380 
wasn't called blast and cruise it was
called<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:11.730> stay<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:11.910> until<00:03:12.300> your

body goo and careers done I actually had

really<00:04:51.540> have<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.750> work<00:04:51.930> so<00:04:52.170> that's<00:04:52.260> not<00:04:52.470> smart

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
really have to work so that's not smart

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.900 
really have to work so that's not smart
so<00:04:53.610> you<00:04:54.390> know<00:04:54.510> what's<00:04:55.230> one<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.650> do<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:56.130> mean<00:04:56.640> if

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
so you know what's one to do I mean if

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.550 
so you know what's one to do I mean if
you<00:04:57.240> go<00:04:57.420> on<00:04:57.570> your<00:04:57.750> cycle<00:04:58.110> when<00:04:58.200> you're<00:04:58.350> younger

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
you go on your cycle when you're younger

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.030 
you go on your cycle when you're younger
guy

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
guy

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.350 
guy
your<00:04:59.400> body's<00:04:59.670> probably<00:04:59.820> going<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.120> recover

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
your body's probably going to recover

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.970 
your body's probably going to recover
faster<00:05:00.840> than<00:05:00.960> it<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.200> if<00:05:01.350> you're<00:05:01.470> 40<00:05:01.740> years<00:05:01.830> old

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
faster than it is if you're 40 years old

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.920 
faster than it is if you're 40 years old
then<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.640> get<00:05:02.760> all<00:05:02.910> that's<00:05:03.120> genetic<00:05:03.630> -<00:05:03.750> you

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
then you get all that's genetic - you

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.450 
then you get all that's genetic - you
can<00:05:04.080> go<00:05:04.170> on<00:05:04.200> a<00:05:04.320> 19<00:05:04.770> years<00:05:04.920> only<00:05:05.070> body<00:05:05.250> could

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
can go on a 19 years only body could

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.390 
can go on a 19 years only body could
take<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.990> know<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.110> year<00:05:07.590> recover<00:05:08.040> or<00:05:08.280> could

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
take you know a year recover or could

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.620 
take you know a year recover or could
take<00:05:08.520> a<00:05:08.550> month<00:05:08.790> to<00:05:08.850> recover<00:05:09.030> then<00:05:09.390> again<00:05:09.600> I

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
take a month to recover then again I

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.100 
take a month to recover then again I
know<00:05:09.750> some<00:05:10.110> 50<00:05:10.440> year<00:05:10.560> olds<00:05:11.540> who<00:05:12.540> go<00:05:12.690> on<00:05:12.870> and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
know some 50 year olds who go on and

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.900 
know some 50 year olds who go on and
their<00:05:13.350> body<00:05:13.530> recent<00:05:13.830> recover<00:05:14.070> fast<00:05:14.430> or<00:05:14.700> they

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
their body recent recover fast or they

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.270 
their body recent recover fast or they
recover<00:05:15.390> slow<00:05:15.630> -<00:05:15.810> so<00:05:15.990> it's<00:05:16.110> really<00:05:16.230> no<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.770> guess

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
recover slow - so it's really no I guess

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.280 
recover slow - so it's really no I guess
it's<00:05:17.430> not<00:05:17.490> age<00:05:17.790> dependent<00:05:18.420> it's<00:05:18.540> more<00:05:18.750> genetic

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
it's not age dependent it's more genetic

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.560 
it's not age dependent it's more genetic
dependent<00:05:19.740> but<00:05:19.890> more<00:05:20.700> than<00:05:20.850> likely<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.300> older

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
dependent but more than likely the older

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.560 
dependent but more than likely the older
guys<00:05:21.720> have<00:05:22.080> a<00:05:22.490> harder<00:05:23.490> time<00:05:23.520> recovering<00:05:24.000> the

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
guys have a harder time recovering the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.140 
guys have a harder time recovering the
younger<00:05:24.990> guys<00:05:25.170> and<00:05:25.490> even<00:05:26.490> the<00:05:26.580> life-extension

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
younger guys and even the life-extension

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.040 
younger guys and even the life-extension
foundation<00:05:27.870> type<00:05:29.210> doctors<00:05:30.210> wouldn't<00:05:30.900> want<00:05:31.020> to

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
foundation type doctors wouldn't want to

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.880 
foundation type doctors wouldn't want to
calm<00:05:31.260> they're<00:05:31.440> just<00:05:31.560> kind<00:05:31.740> of<00:05:31.770> like

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
calm they're just kind of like

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.910 
calm they're just kind of like
endocrinologists<00:05:32.700> or<00:05:32.820> whatever<00:05:33.690> even<00:05:33.960> they

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
endocrinologists or whatever even they

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.500 
endocrinologists or whatever even they
have<00:05:35.070> their<00:05:35.190> own<00:05:35.220> version<00:05:35.340> of<00:05:35.730> blasting<00:05:36.270> crews

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
have their own version of blasting crews

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.060 
have their own version of blasting crews
so<00:05:37.170> what<00:05:37.290> they<00:05:37.410> do<00:05:37.470> is<00:05:37.680> they<00:05:37.740> prescribe

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
so what they do is they prescribe

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.160 
so what they do is they prescribe
testosterone<00:05:38.700> treatment<00:05:39.090> for<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:39.360> for<00:05:40.140> a

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
testosterone treatment for you for a

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.480 
testosterone treatment for you for a
certain<00:05:40.500> amount<00:05:40.560> of<00:05:40.710> time<00:05:40.890> and<00:05:41.160> they<00:05:41.250> get<00:05:41.370> your

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
certain amount of time and they get your

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.400 
certain amount of time and they get your
testosterone<00:05:41.670> level<00:05:42.240> cranked<00:05:42.630> up<00:05:42.750> so<00:05:43.320> now

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
testosterone level cranked up so now

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.780 
testosterone level cranked up so now
that<00:05:43.470> let's<00:05:43.890> say<00:05:44.010> they<00:05:44.130> get<00:05:44.250> your<00:05:44.370> levels<00:05:44.670> up

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
that let's say they get your levels up

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.660 
that let's say they get your levels up
to<00:05:45.020> 800<00:05:46.020> you're<00:05:46.710> telling<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.010> doctor<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.340> feel

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670

whatever it is you're taking is

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.900 
whatever it is you're taking is
testosterone<00:05:56.130> therapy<00:05:56.280> you<00:05:56.520> take<00:05:56.700> and<00:05:56.850> you

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
testosterone therapy you take and you

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.550 
testosterone therapy you take and you
take<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.120> take<00:05:57.390> it<00:05:57.510> all<00:05:57.900> of<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:58.260> sudden<00:05:58.500> the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
take and take it all of a sudden the

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.650 
take and take it all of a sudden the
doctor<00:05:58.860> says<00:05:59.040> okay<00:05:59.160> it's<00:05:59.820> time<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.090> switch<00:06:00.480> and

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
doctor says okay it's time to switch and

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.300 
doctor says okay it's time to switch and
then<00:06:00.780> what<00:06:00.990> they'll<00:06:01.110> do<00:06:01.230> is<00:06:01.350> they'll<00:06:01.500> run<00:06:01.710> I've

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
then what they'll do is they'll run I've

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.890 
then what they'll do is they'll run I've
seen<00:06:02.580> up<00:06:02.700> to<00:06:02.850> a<00:06:02.880> year<00:06:03.360> long<00:06:03.950> cycles<00:06:04.950> of<00:06:05.070> HCG<00:06:05.900> so

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
seen up to a year long cycles of HCG so

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.850 
seen up to a year long cycles of HCG so
where<00:06:07.050> they're<00:06:07.200> actually<00:06:07.530> making<00:06:07.680> your

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
where they're actually making your

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.980 
where they're actually making your
body's<00:06:08.220> body<00:06:08.940> kick<00:06:09.210> back<00:06:09.390> into<00:06:09.660> making<00:06:09.780> your

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
body's body kick back into making your

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.440 
body's body kick back into making your
testicles<00:06:10.320> work<00:06:10.470> again<00:06:10.820> using<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.910> HTTP<00:06:12.360> but

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
testicles work again using the HTTP but

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.090 
testicles work again using the HTTP but
they'll<00:06:12.600> use<00:06:12.720> it<00:06:12.750> for<00:06:13.020> prolonged<00:06:13.470> periods<00:06:14.010> of

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
they'll use it for prolonged periods of

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.890 
they'll use it for prolonged periods of
time<00:06:14.160> so<00:06:14.640> your<00:06:14.850> body<00:06:15.030> is<00:06:15.120> working<00:06:15.240> in<00:06:15.570> and

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
time so your body is working in and

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.170 
time so your body is working in and
never<00:06:16.170> really<00:06:16.440> come<00:06:16.590> off<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:16.800> HCG<00:06:17.340> and<00:06:17.550> then

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
never really come off the HCG and then

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.670 
never really come off the HCG and then
when<00:06:18.300> you<00:06:18.390> to<00:06:18.540> a<00:06:18.570> certain<00:06:18.870> point<00:06:18.990> of<00:06:19.110> the<00:06:19.200> HCG

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
when you to a certain point of the HCG

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.840 
when you to a certain point of the HCG
they're<00:06:19.860> doing<00:06:20.040> the<00:06:20.130> blood<00:06:20.250> work<00:06:20.310> and<00:06:20.490> stuff

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850
