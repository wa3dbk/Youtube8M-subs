00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there is to create a line all you need

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.369 
there is to create a line all you need
is<00:00:55.739> an<00:00:56.070> unstable<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.629> your<00:00:57.780> inventory<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
default it requires two gunpowder to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
default it requires two gunpowder to
create<00:01:04.440> in<00:01:04.500> mine<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.460> i<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.550> right<00:01:05.940> click

create in mine so if i just right click

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.410 
create in mine so if i just right click
on<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> block<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.950> will<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.300> you

for it you can see that that is in fact

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.719 
for it you can see that that is in fact
a<00:01:14.670> live<00:01:15.119> landline<00:01:16.039> now<00:01:17.039> if<00:01:17.459> you<00:01:17.580> have

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
a live landline now if you have

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.620 
a live landline now if you have
economies<00:01:18.030> toward<00:01:18.539> it<00:01:19.200> will<00:01:19.289> cost<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.619> 100

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and you'll see why in a second we can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240 
and you'll see why in a second we can
disable<00:01:23.910> that<00:01:24.149> again<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.690> config<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.250> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
on it what you like okay so that's how a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.949 
on it what you like okay so that's how a
land<00:01:31.410> mine<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.709> created<00:01:32.630> obviously<00:01:33.630> if<00:01:33.720> i<00:01:33.810> run

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
land mine is created obviously if i run

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.479 
land mine is created obviously if i run
over<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.289> there<00:01:34.830> would<00:01:34.920> be<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.039> big<00:01:35.280> explosion

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:35.489 
over it there would be a big explosion

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:38.540 
over it there would be a big explosion
and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.479> what<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.660> can<00:01:36.929> also<00:01:37.050> disable<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.280> by

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
and then what I can also disable it by

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.320 
and then what I can also disable it by
using<00:01:38.789> Cheers<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.830> say<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> planted<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.270> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.999 
can actually just say with the landline
so<00:01:57.179> this<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.509> where<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.899> park<00:01:58.200> effects<00:01:58.590> have

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
so this is where the park effects have

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.630 
so this is where the park effects have
an<00:01:59.160> effect<00:01:59.520> because<00:01:59.849> players<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.929> see<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
an effect because players can see the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.139 
an effect because players can see the
particles<00:02:03.679> above<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:05.129> land<00:02:05.459> mine<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.970> so

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
particles above the land mine and so

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.760 
particles above the land mine and so
they<00:02:06.300> will<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.509> able<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.349> disable

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
they will be able to see it and disable

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.800 
they will be able to see it and disable
it<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> guys<00:02:09.149> should<00:02:09.300> disable<00:02:09.509> will

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it but if you guys should disable will

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
it but if you guys should disable will
be<00:02:09.899> part<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.200> effects<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> config<00:02:11.160> then

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
be part of effects in the config then

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.010 
be part of effects in the config then
obviously<00:02:11.910> players<00:02:12.390> won't<00:02:12.540> be<00:02:12.690> able<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.870> see

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
obviously players won't be able to see

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.910 
obviously players won't be able to see
it<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:13.830> run<00:02:14.010> over<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.490> die

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
it and they can just run over it and die

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.570 
it and they can just run over it and die
but<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.550> they<00:02:17.730> do<00:02:17.790> decide

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
but you know if they do decide

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.390 
but you know if they do decide
then<00:02:19.300> that's<00:02:19.660> quite<00:02:19.900> some<00:02:20.560> skill<00:02:20.920> so<00:02:21.160> if<00:02:21.280> you

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
then that's quite some skill so if you

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.220 
then that's quite some skill so if you
don't<00:02:21.520> want<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:22.210> you<00:02:22.240> want<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.780> very<00:02:22.870> more

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
don't want it you want it very more

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.460 
don't want it you want it very more
tricky<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.590> guess<00:02:24.240> then<00:02:25.240> saying<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.170> config

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
tricky I guess then saying the config

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.040 
tricky I guess then saying the config
did<00:02:26.650> not<00:02:26.800> have<00:02:26.980> particle<00:02:27.400> effects<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.870> also

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
did not have particle effects we also

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.840 
did not have particle effects we also
notice<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.560> received<00:02:29.920> 50<00:02:30.280> for<00:02:30.430> June<00:02:30.580> fuse

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
notice that I received 50 for June fuse

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.030 
notice that I received 50 for June fuse
another<00:02:31.150> month<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:31.930> get<00:02:32.080> half<00:02:32.350> back<00:02:32.710> what

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
another month so you get half back what

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.880 
another month so you get half back what
you<00:02:33.130> paid<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.570> cost<00:02:34.810> me<00:02:35.020> oh<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:38.140> cost<00:02:38.380> me<00:02:38.500> 100

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
you paid so it cost me oh it cost me 100

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.330 
you paid so it cost me oh it cost me 100
to<00:02:39.730> create<00:02:40.030> another<00:02:40.180> mine<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:41.710> cost<00:02:41.860> me<00:02:41.920> 50

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
to create another mine and it cost me 50

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.000 
to create another mine and it cost me 50
to<00:02:42.580> defuse<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.630> lose<00:02:43.930> money<00:02:44.230> by<00:02:44.590> if<00:02:44.860> I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
to defuse it so I do lose money by if I

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.220 
to defuse it so I do lose money by if I
place<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.610> wrong<00:02:45.730> place<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:46.870> where<00:02:47.020> do

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
place it in the wrong place but where do

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.840 
place it in the wrong place but where do
get<00:02:47.410> money<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.770> if<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.100> find<00:02:48.340> another<00:02:48.580> player's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
get money is if I find another player's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.270 
get money is if I find another player's
land<00:02:49.120> mine<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:49.570> can<00:02:49.750> potentially<00:02:50.710> diffuse

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
land mine and I can potentially diffuse

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.040 
land mine and I can potentially diffuse
all<00:02:51.460> their<00:02:51.640> land<00:02:51.850> mines<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:52.300> gain<00:02:52.540> money<00:02:52.780> from

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
all their land mines and gain money from

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.050 
all their land mines and gain money from
it<00:02:53.170> which<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.770> quite<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.040> nice<00:02:54.280> little<00:02:54.880> way<00:02:55.030> of

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
it which is quite a nice little way of

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.980 
it which is quite a nice little way of
doing<00:02:55.330> it<00:02:56.190> okay<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.880> that's<00:02:58.300> how<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.540> create

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
doing it okay so that's how to create

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.490 
doing it okay so that's how to create
the<00:02:59.560> land<00:02:59.800> mines<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.400> diffusion<00:03:01.230> using<00:03:02.230> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the land mines and diffusion using the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.770 
the land mines and diffusion using the
items<00:03:03.070> but<00:03:03.850> you<00:03:03.910> also<00:03:04.060> do<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.390> same<00:03:04.420> thing

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
items but you also do the same thing

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.980 
items but you also do the same thing
using<00:03:05.050> commands<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.610> if<00:03:07.030> i<00:03:07.209> go<00:03:07.240> over<00:03:07.390> here<00:03:07.720> and

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
using commands so if i go over here and

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.740 
using commands so if i go over here and
i<00:03:08.200> use<00:03:08.680> LMK<00:03:09.670> create<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.860> will<00:03:12.040> create<00:03:12.370> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
i use LMK create that will create a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.110 
i use LMK create that will create a
landline<00:03:13.750> without<00:03:14.320> having<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.770> right-click

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
landline without having to right-click

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.400 
landline without having to right-click
with<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:17.010> shovel<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:19.060> can<00:03:19.240> do<00:03:19.360> LMK<00:03:19.840> list

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
with the shovel and I can do LMK list

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.160 
with the shovel and I can do LMK list
and<00:03:20.770> that<00:03:20.800> list<00:03:21.100> all<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.610> locations<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and that list all the locations of the

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.170 
and that list all the locations of the
current<00:03:23.530> landlines<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.730> can<00:03:24.820> see<00:03:24.970> there's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
current landlines so you can see there's

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.150 
current landlines so you can see there's
only<00:03:25.360> one<00:03:25.540> at<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.690> moment<00:03:25.840> at<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.830> location

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
only one at the moment at that location

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.340 
only one at the moment at that location
I<00:03:27.580> then<00:03:28.540> do<00:03:28.840> LMK<00:03:29.350> diffuse<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.900> diffuse<00:03:32.320> a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
I then do LMK diffuse and all diffuse a

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.920 
I then do LMK diffuse and all diffuse a
low<00:03:32.980> moan<00:03:33.220> without<00:03:33.850> having<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.330> use<00:03:34.600> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
low moan without having to use the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.199 
low moan without having to use the
shears<00:03:35.700> what's<00:03:36.700> cool<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.300> that<00:03:37.330> you<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.140> give

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
shears what's cool is that you can give

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.460 
shears what's cool is that you can give
both<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.480> permission<00:03:40.959> command<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:43.470> item

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
both the permission command and the item

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.790 
both the permission command and the item
per<00:03:44.560> month<00:03:44.739> separately<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:47.410> know<00:03:47.530> if<00:03:47.680> you

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
per month separately so you know if you

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.650 
per month separately so you know if you
want<00:03:48.010> your<00:03:48.190> players<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.700> use<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.120> items<00:03:49.420> only

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
want your players to use the items only

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.660 
want your players to use the items only
and<00:03:49.989> not<00:03:50.050> use<00:03:50.230> commands<00:03:50.590> then<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.459> just

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
and not use commands then you can just

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.180 
and not use commands then you can just
give<00:03:51.820> them<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.330> permission<00:03:53.230> nodes<00:03:53.650> which

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
give them the permission nodes which

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.460 
give them the permission nodes which
will<00:03:54.310> just<00:03:54.430> using<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.970> items<00:03:55.390> and<00:03:55.570> they<00:03:56.290> won't

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
will just using the items and they won't

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.020 
will just using the items and they won't
be<00:03:56.590> able<00:03:56.709> to<00:03:56.800> use<00:03:56.830> commands<00:03:57.250> which<00:03:57.489> is<00:03:57.610> quite<00:03:57.970> a
