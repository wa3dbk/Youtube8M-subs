 immense collection and I neither google nor my 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.600
 dream of life was a barbie and clear 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.790
 of course beyond being is like 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.479

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.490
 pink car I said that everything 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.040
 is the barbie lifestyle is a whole world 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.960
 of a concept that so now so 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 we take up inspirations 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.710
 and how did it occur to you because we had already 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.180
 gone to your show to see the collaboration that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.670
 you had disney in addition to your designs 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.370
 beautiful and now because you did darby 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.900
 it was quite a unique process because to me 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.500
 I came up with the truth is that it was 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.020
 a collaboration that emerged this gesture 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.040
 an initiative of mattel they already bring 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.810
 as a strategy at a 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.180
 international at a physical level 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.770
 Latin America is to identify a first 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 level already as the ideal brand to be able to 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.200
 need to barbie in a production and 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.960
 it was really something very interesting this 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.630
 at a creative level and that we art villa 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.700
 that talks about the chin and 50 then 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.160
 a Barbie you going to talk much 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.959
 elegance much like before and if this one 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.020
 obviously many glitters and all this 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:25.610
 pin payment of light candy all this is going 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:26.930
 captured and something very very interesting what 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.790
 more important that you also have the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.410
 Distinctive stamp of pink light magnolia 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.930
 if in this case what we did was 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.019
 obviously to pick up on inspiration but 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 we see classic silhouettes of barbie with the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.780
 touch ping 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.070
 and the peak classic with the touch 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.410
 barbie then now like that 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.010
 we made a very interesting mix 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.290
 then we see how very conical camps of 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 pink magnolia but reinterpreted at 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.010
 Barbie style or rather this dress 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.630
 they are very iconic of neighborhood and 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.520
 reinterpreted I am with the pints 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.840

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.840

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.920

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.750
 These sandals seem very flirty 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.890
 and originals if they are going to choose something 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.959

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.280

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.120
 color combination 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.630

 these are a bit more classic and also 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.710
 unisex combine them with everything and although 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.110
 for me they have even a touch of voice 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.640
 I like to see her with casual looks and 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.660
 even with maxi dresses you can see 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.660
