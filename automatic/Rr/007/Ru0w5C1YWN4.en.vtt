00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.619
 many false videos have arisen such false as to say that zulma lobato 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.510
 ex-wife xd xd xd xd xd xd psdb 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.310
 these videos some must surely bolt 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.220
 Let's start talking about the subject because if I do not leave the language xd but before they put 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.010
 music you play 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.730
 much better jejeje 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.380
 when will the next gp to five 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.460
 they say it would come out in this year I want to have it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.380
 In what city will the characters be brad? 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.280
 perhaps there will be new adepts aircraft helicopters and ships 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.690
 and how much will be its value 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.540
 I do not have all the answers for everything but a web page if xd is the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.380
 read 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.440
 in which city will be set jeter 5 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.610
 many are the options that are considered san andreas says city but now there is a 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.540
 that resonates with force london 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.790
 according to published chema antÃ³n well-known editor in videogame magazines 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.830
 the British government is thinking about what games should subsidize is 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.820
 tell 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 although to facilitate its development 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.970
 alistair darling the treasury minister of the english labor party pointed 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.070
 yesterday how these grants would be given and who could be given talking about 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.960
 that these games that received the financial aid would have to comply 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 a series of requirements 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.090
 the idea is very good since it would boost the videogame industry 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.370
 in the British country generating more jobs for example but 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.570
 although the requirements that these games will have 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.860
 that a model similar to the one they follow in the film industry will be followed 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 the content of the games must be very British 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.630
 rockstar surely sees these helps with very good eyes starting from the fact 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.710
 of which he executed four cost about 100 million dollars any help is 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.050
 very welcome 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.600
 gt5 probably use the same graphics engine that manages four and that will be 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.650
 a great savings for the company that could concentrate directly on the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.500
 development of the game itself although they were about 11 million pounds what 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.550
 your request well this amount would be more than grateful for the company 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.139
 rockstar games 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.819
 the game itself once finished would be a great standard-bearer of the country 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.650
 British, since everyone knows the great capacity of those who 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.059
 had to be sold in the market 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.219
 Ultimately the rumors are echoing in society the government 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.099
 British could try to buy the company rockstar games so that the 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.449
 next target was in london will be the city of gt5 facing 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:47.619
 We'll see
