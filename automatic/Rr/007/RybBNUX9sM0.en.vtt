a boat I want to go for that let's see

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.249 
a boat I want to go for that let's see
what<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> show<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.689> strength<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
what I can do is to show the strength of

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.450 
what I can do is to show the strength of
green<00:02:08.069> engines

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.890 

I'm<00:02:14.460> there<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.820> prove<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:15.480> done<00:02:15.660> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
I'm there to prove it can be done and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.930 
I'm there to prove it can be done and
then<00:02:16.230> I'm<00:02:16.350> more<00:02:17.160> than<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.460> i'm<00:02:17.580> willing<00:02:17.880> to

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
then I'm more than that i'm willing to

then I'm more than that i'm willing to
show<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.150> how<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.660> can<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.930> done<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.880> not<00:02:20.880> just

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
show you how it can be done and not just

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.790 
show you how it can be done and not just
talk<00:02:21.300> cheap<00:02:21.540> words<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.080> back<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.440> my<00:02:22.590> words

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800

with<00:02:23.040> proof<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:24.120> i<00:02:24.180> think<00:02:24.390> that's<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> only

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
with proof and i think that's the only

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.270 
with proof and i think that's the only
way<00:02:24.870> we<00:02:24.990> can<00:02:25.110> change<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.500> world<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.040> and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
way we can change the world in that and
