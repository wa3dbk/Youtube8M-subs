would like to present you our new

would like to present you our new
compact<00:00:11.969> zoom<00:00:12.269> lens<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.809> 70<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.340> 200<00:00:14.940> millimeter

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
compact zoom lens a 70 to 200 millimeter

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.859 
compact zoom lens a 70 to 200 millimeter
soon<00:00:15.750> within<00:00:16.379> t<00:00:16.830> stop<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.430> 2.9<00:00:18.090> i<00:00:19.100> think<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.340> a

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
soon within t stop of 2.9 i think it's a

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.380 
soon within t stop of 2.9 i think it's a
revolution<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.410> cinestar<00:00:22.920> zoom<00:00:23.910> market

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
revolution in the cinestar zoom market

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.349 
revolution in the cinestar zoom market
because<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.289> zoom<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.189> first<00:00:26.519> which<00:00:27.119> two

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
because this zoom is the first which two

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.740 
because this zoom is the first which two
covers<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.289> real<00:00:28.470> full<00:00:29.250> frame<00:00:29.609> sensor<00:00:29.910> size

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
covers the real full frame sensor size

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.740 
covers the real full frame sensor size
of<00:00:31.140> 24<00:00:32.070> x<00:00:32.369> 36<00:00:33.000> millimeter<00:00:33.540> ii<00:00:34.309> also<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:36.360> has

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
of 24 x 36 millimeter ii also it it has

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.680 
of 24 x 36 millimeter ii also it it has
the<00:00:36.780> interchangeable<00:00:37.739> mount<00:00:37.950> system<00:00:38.250> our<00:00:39.030> our

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the interchangeable mount system our our

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.470 
the interchangeable mount system our our
customers<00:00:40.469> know<00:00:41.160> from<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.910> compact<00:00:42.270> Prime

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
customers know from the compact Prime

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
customers know from the compact Prime
family<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.980> actually<00:00:44.360> expands<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:46.289> range

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
family so it actually expands the range

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
family so it actually expands the range
of<00:00:46.770> focal<00:00:47.760> length<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.890> 15<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.100> 135<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.390> we

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of focal length of 15 to 135 which we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.529 
of focal length of 15 to 135 which we
have<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.469> prime<00:00:52.910> system<00:00:53.910> up<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
have in the in the prime system up to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
have in the in the prime system up to
200<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.640> and<00:00:57.410> yeah<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.980> real<00:00:59.329> zoom

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
200 now and yeah it's it's a real zoom

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.319 
200 now and yeah it's it's a real zoom
lens<00:01:00.629> without<00:01:01.370> focus<00:01:02.370> shift<00:01:02.609> which

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
lens without focus shift which

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
lens without focus shift which
distinguishes<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.799> lens<00:01:05.070> from<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.460> photo

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
distinguishes this lens from a photo

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.910 
distinguishes this lens from a photo
zoom<00:01:06.720> lens<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.320> say<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.750> first

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
zoom lens I would say and it's the first

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.000 
zoom lens I would say and it's the first
lens<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> new<00:01:12.450> compact<00:01:13.080> zoom<00:01:13.439> family

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
lens in a in a new compact zoom family

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.690 
lens in a in a new compact zoom family
so<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:14.960> be<00:01:15.960> following<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:17.130> zooms<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
so they will be following more zooms in

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
so they will be following more zooms in
this<00:01:17.970> family<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.049> also<00:01:19.409> cover<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this family which will also cover the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
this family which will also cover the
full<00:01:19.979> frame<00:01:20.220> sensor<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.299> think<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
full frame sensor so I think it's a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620 
full frame sensor so I think it's a
pretty<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.159> future<00:01:23.159> proofed<00:01:23.909> investment

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
pretty good future proofed investment

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050 
pretty good future proofed investment
because<00:01:25.350> whatever<00:01:25.799> camera<00:01:26.400> comes<00:01:26.700> into<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because whatever camera comes into the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.880 
because whatever camera comes into the
market<00:01:27.619> which<00:01:28.619> ever<00:01:29.490> sensor<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.720> be<00:01:30.869> used<00:01:31.229> we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
market which ever sensor will be used we

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620 
market which ever sensor will be used we
will<00:01:32.070> cover<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
will cover it and you have the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590 
will cover it and you have the
possibility<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> user<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> different

innovations<00:01:54.900> from<00:01:55.050> Karzai's<00:01:55.620> so<00:01:56.610> after<00:01:56.910> we

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
innovations from Karzai's so after we

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.810 
innovations from Karzai's so after we
have<00:01:57.150> seen<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> compact<00:01:57.990> tomb<00:01:58.520> we<00:01:59.520> have

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have seen the compact tomb we have

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.810 
have seen the compact tomb we have
expanded<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.200> range<00:02:01.410> of<00:02:01.800> compact<00:02:02.520> prime

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
expanded the range of compact prime

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.080 
expanded the range of compact prime
lenses<00:02:03.330> now<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.800> 15<00:02:05.340> millimeter<00:02:05.670> lens

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
lenses now down to a 15 millimeter lens

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.340 
lenses now down to a 15 millimeter lens
and<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:07.050> to<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> 100<00:02:07.770> 35<00:02:08.760> millimeter<00:02:09.240> lens<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
and up to a 100 35 millimeter lens the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:21.720 
and up to a 100 35 millimeter lens the
135<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.090> e<00:02:12.380> 2.1<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.940> 15<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:15.660> at<00:02:16.140> e<00:02:16.350> 2.9

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:30.440 

so<00:02:23.099> no<00:02:24.099> again<00:02:25.200> this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.260 

so<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.170> total<00:02:31.349> we<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.830> six<00:02:32.489> new<00:02:32.700> lenses<00:02:33.090> from

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
so in total we have six new lenses from

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.270 
so in total we have six new lenses from
