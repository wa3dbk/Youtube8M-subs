perform a lens exchange now we're going

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.979 
perform a lens exchange now we're going
to<00:03:45.860> let<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.250> air<00:03:46.489> purifying<00:03:47.030> unit<00:03:47.420> do<00:03:47.570> its<00:03:47.750> job

to let the air purifying unit do its job

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.770 
to let the air purifying unit do its job
for<00:03:48.260> about<00:03:48.440> 30-40<00:03:49.040> seconds<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:49.670> that<00:03:50.450> should

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
for about 30-40 seconds and that should

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.960 
for about 30-40 seconds and that should
create<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.560> dust<00:03:51.860> free<00:03:52.130> environment<00:03:52.160> inside

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
create a dust free environment inside

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.789 
create a dust free environment inside
the<00:03:53.180> bag<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.720> do<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.769> lens<00:03:54.980> exchange<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:56.799> so

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
the bag to do the lens exchange and so

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.580 
the bag to do the lens exchange and so
wait<00:03:58.700> about<00:03:58.940> 30-40<00:03:59.570> seconds<00:03:59.989> i<00:04:00.109> think<00:04:00.350> that's

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
wait about 30-40 seconds i think that's

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.170 
wait about 30-40 seconds i think that's
about<00:04:01.269> 34<00:04:02.269> sec<00:04:02.510> 30<00:04:02.870> or<00:04:03.019> 40<00:04:03.260> seconds<00:04:03.680> now<00:04:07.180> open

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
about 34 sec 30 or 40 seconds now open

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.610 
about 34 sec 30 or 40 seconds now open
the<00:04:08.269> arm<00:04:08.510> ports<00:04:08.959> up
