today<00:00:00.299> I'm<00:00:00.359> going<00:00:00.450> to<00:00:00.539> demonstrate<00:00:00.659> the

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.140 
today I'm going to demonstrate the

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.899 
today I'm going to demonstrate the
effectiveness<00:00:01.530> of<00:00:01.829> piranha<00:00:02.159> descaler<00:00:02.730> on

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
effectiveness of piranha descaler on

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.050 
effectiveness of piranha descaler on
calcium<00:00:03.570> veins<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.589> grout<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.370> also<00:00:05.850> on

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
calcium veins in the grout and also on

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.960 
calcium veins in the grout and also on
calcium<00:00:06.509> deposits<00:00:06.990> on<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> pool<00:00:07.580> you<00:00:08.580> can<00:00:08.730> see

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
calcium deposits on the pool you can see

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.850 
calcium deposits on the pool you can see
that<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> foam<00:00:09.510> foaming<00:00:10.410> action<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.769> the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
that the foam foaming action of the

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.100 
that the foam foaming action of the
action<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.700> acid<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.240> attacking<00:00:12.960> that

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
action of the acid it's attacking that

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.350 
action of the acid it's attacking that
and<00:00:13.469> again<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.219> only<00:00:14.370> attacking<00:00:14.880> even

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
and again it's only attacking even

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689 
and again it's only attacking even
though<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:15.570> attacking<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.740> some<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
though it's attacking the some of the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.769 
though it's attacking the some of the
grout<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.600> really<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.289> after<00:00:20.779> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
grout it's really going after the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.170 
grout it's really going after the
calcium<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> white<00:00:22.859> fang<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.000> take<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
calcium the white fang you can take a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.080 
calcium the white fang you can take a
little<00:00:24.449> wire<00:00:24.600> brush<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.519> you<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.699> work<00:00:26.849> some

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
little wire brush and you can work some

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.910 
little wire brush and you can work some
of<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:28.289> keep<00:00:28.500> spraying<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
of that and just keep spraying it a

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.170 
of that and just keep spraying it a
little<00:00:31.920> tougher<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.430> vertical<00:00:32.700> wall<00:00:33.030> we

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
little tougher on a vertical wall we

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.729 
little tougher on a vertical wall we
have<00:00:33.270> another<00:00:33.480> product<00:00:33.809> on<00:00:34.050> vertical<00:00:34.500> wall<00:00:36.739> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
have another product on vertical wall of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.639 
have another product on vertical wall of
piranha<00:00:38.219> descaler<00:00:38.700> gel<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.780> sometimes<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
piranha descaler gel and sometimes that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.650 
piranha descaler gel and sometimes that
is<00:00:40.920> good<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> done<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.120> light<00:00:42.300> scale

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is good but the done for light scale

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.350 
is good but the done for light scale
like<00:00:42.989> fine<00:00:43.260> veins<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.149> if<00:00:45.149> you're

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
like fine veins like this if you're

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.060 
like fine veins like this if you're
willing<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.660> spray<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.320> bit<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.770> let<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
willing to spray a little bit and let it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.729 
willing to spray a little bit and let it
continue<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.550> run<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.170> come<00:00:49.379> it'll

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
continue to run over it will come it'll

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
continue to run over it will come it'll
it'll<00:00:50.039> completely<00:00:50.489> dissolve<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
it'll completely dissolve and take it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:18.080 
it'll completely dissolve and take it
right<00:00:51.600> out

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.880 

and<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.740> fad<00:01:20.490> gone<00:01:21.710> get<00:01:22.710> those

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
and it's just a fad gone get those

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
and it's just a fad gone get those
little<00:01:23.159> pieces<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.579> are<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.880> fine<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.360> Kenny

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
little pieces that are so fine and Kenny

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.749 
little pieces that are so fine and Kenny
gets<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.079> the<00:01:25.140> brush<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:28.520> your<00:01:29.520> calcium

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
gets with the brush and your calcium

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.980 
gets with the brush and your calcium
vein<00:01:30.149> is<00:01:30.270> gone<00:01:31.729> we<00:01:32.729> simply<00:01:33.060> spray<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> Piranha

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
vein is gone we simply spray the Piranha

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.080 
vein is gone we simply spray the Piranha
descaler<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.679> white<00:01:34.860> scale<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.789> calcium

immediately<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.520> starting<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> foam

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
immediately you see it starting to foam

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:49.700 
immediately you see it starting to foam
up<00:01:46.250> as<00:01:47.250> long<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.600> acid<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.140> etching<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
up as long as the acid is etching it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
up as long as the acid is etching it
you'll<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.039> continue<00:01:50.459> see<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> foam<00:01:51.030> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you'll see continue see it foam and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.680 
you'll see continue see it foam and
bubble<00:01:51.569> as<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:53.369> acid<00:01:53.789> becomes<00:01:53.909> neutralized

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
bubble as the acid becomes neutralized

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.529 
bubble as the acid becomes neutralized
by<00:01:55.080> developing<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.799> calcium<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:58.280> can

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
by developing the calcium you can

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.529 
by developing the calcium you can
continue<00:02:00.539> to<00:02:00.630> spray<00:02:01.459> notice<00:02:02.459> it's<00:02:02.670> only<00:02:03.179> going

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
continue to spray notice it's only going

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.960 
continue to spray notice it's only going
after<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:04.080> calcium<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.099> bubbles<00:02:05.520> are<00:02:05.670> just

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
after the calcium the bubbles are just

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.139 
after the calcium the bubbles are just
along<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> calcium<00:02:06.929> vein<00:02:07.489> the<00:02:08.489> grout<00:02:08.789> though

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
after the calcium you can even see right

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.699 
after the calcium you can even see right
right<00:02:15.630> there<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:16.019> one<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.349> pieces<00:02:16.560> of

you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:24.989> see<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.410> pull<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.190> vein<00:02:26.459> right

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can see it just pull that vein right

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.729 
you can see it just pull that vein right
out<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.239> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:28.019> have<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> little<00:02:28.500> brush

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
out of there if you have a little brush

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.099 
out of there if you have a little brush
wire<00:02:28.980> brush<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.910> don't<00:02:30.060> need<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.420> but<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.019> you

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
wire brush you don't need to but if you

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:36.080 
wire brush you don't need to but if you
have<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.290> little<00:02:31.560> brush<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:35.340> would<00:02:35.519> also<00:02:35.670> help

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
have a little brush that would also help

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.009 
have a little brush that would also help
maybe<00:02:36.780> expedite<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.530> little<00:02:37.680> bit<00:02:38.840> but<00:02:39.840> it's

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019
