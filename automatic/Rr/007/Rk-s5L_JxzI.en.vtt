were in wants now only two are so issues
with<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.579> very<00:00:59.640> easy<00:00:59.969> one<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> guess

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
with this and it's very easy one a guess

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.970 
with this and it's very easy one a guess
up<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.079> something<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.469> such<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> high

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
up for something with such a high

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.200 
up for something with such a high
performance<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.670> considered<00:01:03.180> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
performance that is considered a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.539 
performance that is considered a
off-road<00:01:03.690> vehicle<00:01:04.080> suffers<00:01:04.830> little<00:01:05.250> bits<00:01:05.430> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
spin-out such as compared to the brita

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
spin-out such as compared to the brita
meaning<00:01:08.040> highly<00:01:08.250> prone<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.640> spin<00:01:08.850> outs<00:01:09.030> even

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
meaning highly prone to spin outs even

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.270 
meaning highly prone to spin outs even
at<00:01:09.510> medium<00:01:09.810> speeds<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.500> sometimes<00:01:10.920> suffers

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
at medium speeds as it sometimes suffers

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.440 
at medium speeds as it sometimes suffers
from<00:01:11.369> traction<00:01:11.880> line<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.119> now<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
from traction line and now for the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300 
from traction line and now for the
second<00:01:12.780> issue<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.439> brakes<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.040> huge

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
second issue is the brakes it's a huge

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
second issue is the brakes it's a huge
weakness<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> comes<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.299> start<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.900> know

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
weakness when it comes to start you know

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.179 
weakness when it comes to start you know
let's<00:01:16.350> say<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.619> trying<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> drive<00:01:17.009> around

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
let's say you're trying to drive around

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
let's say you're trying to drive around
and<00:01:17.430> try<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.670> cut<00:01:17.909> them<00:01:18.030> corners<00:01:18.390> even<00:01:18.720> try<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and try to cut them corners even try to

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.179 
and try to cut them corners even try to
stop<00:01:19.259> from<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> head-on<00:01:19.619> collision

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
stop from a head-on collision

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
stop from a head-on collision
but<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> honestly<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> used<00:01:21.720> benefit<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.320> sort

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
but the honestly I used benefit to sort

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
but the honestly I used benefit to sort
of<00:01:22.619> clearing<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.159> would<00:01:23.310> be<00:01:23.430> easily<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
of clearing that it would be easily you

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.460 
of clearing that it would be easily you
know<00:01:24.299> getting<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.659> upgrade<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.229> brakes

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
know getting that upgrade on your brakes

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
know getting that upgrade on your brakes
so<00:01:26.159> overall<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.759> view<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.450> vehicle<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so overall in my view this vehicle is a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
so overall in my view this vehicle is a
beast<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.979> definitely<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.670> cool<00:01:29.820> things

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
with this bad boy it's a fair price

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.050
