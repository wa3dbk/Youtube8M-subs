00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 future of SMEs cepyme tarancón fixed and cellular 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.740
 several were the surprises 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.740
 the five finalists kosovo shone with her australia dress for her angelic 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.320
 face and Dominican republic the most complete let itself be dominated by the media 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 before the question of the jury 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.039
 this value carefully - we can not lose life and that is what 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.970
 it costs us 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.820
 before the disbelief of all these years fernandez received the crown 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 in the hands of his country alan garcía lamented 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.420
 the delegate also served who always healthy among the favorites 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.700
 was left with a bitter taste after the verdict of the jury we talked to her 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 minutes after the end of the contest 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.140
 not appear on the list of 15 ended with the elimination in the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.320
 competition would retire that the stables 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.690
 while the track has something definitely very good to appear 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.380
 she knows that the reflectors were following the cpi the comments of the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.590
 international press were positive but that led him to join the group 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.000
 of the favorites 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Colombians have their minds and for those who are aware of their 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.480
 performance for knowing it but that is always very high 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.360
 and the opinion about the new miss universe that will be again but good 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.229
 granderson in houston 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.619
 reasons why Colombia was very far from the court 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.269
 after knowing the name of the winner the question of all is that 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.720
 was what happened with missiles 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.720
 who from the beginning was perceived as a strong candidate 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.209
 extension or the crown was closer to Colombia geographically than in the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.830
 large convention room 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.830
 and who should we be in which of the great weaknesses 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.899
 little more experience 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:39.809
 although I feel very happy 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:41.589
 the precedents 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.489
 p the lack of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.829
 the mclaren feel very intense 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.969
 I think the effect 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:53.159
 but he says he has a better attitude for the podium to be between ten 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.789
 while the sun was developing on the stage in the country auditorium 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.529
 Colombians witnessed the fleeting step of mercy 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.309
 it's not fair what 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.749
 create a control post and foreign 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.859
 he had nothing to do there left on the road to the Colombian 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.599
 the truth is that see 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.109
 that dissents a total delivery 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.979
 and he made a great paper 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.969
 here in the morning he pointed 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.109
 I think I can tell the Colombians 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.749
 perseverance 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.879
 perseverance 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.330
 As they say, Andalusia is no longer worth 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
 and there will be a new opportunity in 2000 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.519
 why this time venezuela is owed the crown of miss universe 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.860
 and for the first time in the history of the contest next to it the director 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 consecutively flattery for nothing 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.209
 one 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.489
 a young woman from the words of stefanía fernández the new miss universe were 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.059
 to explain if a few days ago the families of your country 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.819
 the categories will be only us ourselves 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.969
 that we are heading other person heroes are always very polluting and that's what 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:59.179
 that reaches the people 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.669
 the fact that a franklin compatriot 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.099
 did not hinder his fight for the title 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.489
 he deserved it 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.889
 It is not the Venezuela has many crowns and the current Venezuelan Miss Universe 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.279
 Let's give chance to another non-Stephanie started with her agenda 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.519
 I was chasing oracle racing 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.140
 a greeting element for between colombia 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.410
 a kiss you want her
