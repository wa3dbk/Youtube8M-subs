made active y'all control the split in

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.910 
made active y'all control the split in
the<00:00:36.390> torque<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.690> horsepower<00:00:36.800> it'll<00:00:37.800> actually

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the torque and horsepower it'll actually

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.700 
the torque and horsepower it'll actually
show<00:00:38.280> where<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.059> what<00:00:39.239> wheel<00:00:39.449> it's<00:00:40.260> putting<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
show where on what wheel it's putting it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.040 
show where on what wheel it's putting it
and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.699> middle<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.150> ball<00:00:42.300> relaxing

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and then the middle that ball relaxing

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.079 
and then the middle that ball relaxing
come<00:00:43.199> three<00:00:43.470> bars<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> turbo<00:00:44.220> spools<00:00:44.610> up<00:00:44.850> and

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
come three bars and turbo spools up and

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.640 
come three bars and turbo spools up and
it's<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:45.570> starting<00:00:46.019> that<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.440> ready

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
it's you know starting that it's ready

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's you know starting that it's ready
to<00:00:46.860> split<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> end<00:00:48.059> up<00:00:48.150> making<00:00:48.540> an

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to split if you end up making an

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.920 
to split if you end up making an
invasive<00:00:49.050> maneuver<00:00:51.320> we're<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:52.649> got<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
invasive maneuver we're here we got the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.930 
invasive maneuver we're here we got the
seat<00:00:54.930> i<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.470> the<00:00:55.710> AC<00:00:56.160> off<00:00:56.399> button<00:00:57.379> which

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
seat i think in the AC off button which

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.419 
seat i think in the AC off button which
you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.390> came<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:01.429> there's

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
you can see that came up there's

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.650 
you can see that came up there's
actually<00:01:02.640> three<00:01:02.670> settings<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.269> that<00:01:03.420> that's

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually three settings for that that's

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.380 
actually three settings for that that's
the<00:01:03.809> first<00:01:04.050> off<00:01:04.289> there's<00:01:05.039> another<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.429> hold

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the first off there's another one hold

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.650 
the first off there's another one hold
it<00:01:06.570> down<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.910> the<00:01:08.910> active<00:01:09.210> y'all<00:01:09.330> control

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.660 
it down and the active y'all control

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.749 
it down and the active y'all control
comes<00:01:09.869> completely<00:01:10.259> off<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.039> this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.310> if<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
comes completely off so this is if you

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.980 
comes completely off so this is if you
haven't<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.179> mode<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.899> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
haven't in this mode it's really the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.240 
haven't in this mode it's really the
only<00:01:13.050> one<00:01:13.320> that's<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.679> really<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.100> you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.830 
only one that's going to really get you
sideways<00:01:14.509> other<00:01:15.509> than<00:01:15.660> that<00:01:17.030> you<00:01:18.030> probably

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
sideways other than that you probably

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.900 
sideways other than that you probably
just<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.410> deal<00:01:19.649> in<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.280> mode<00:01:20.490> it'll

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
just this deal in this mode it'll

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.630 
just this deal in this mode it'll
actually<00:01:21.030> correct<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.990> wheel<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.710> like
