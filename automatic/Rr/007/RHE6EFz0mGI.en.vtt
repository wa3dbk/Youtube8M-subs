how awesome is that so you not only do
you<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.350> more<00:01:10.530> probability<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.189> guess<00:01:11.460> it's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you get more probability i guess it's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.359 
you get more probability i guess it's
almost<00:01:11.909> automatic<00:01:12.119> i'm<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.869> sure<00:01:13.130> how<00:01:14.130> i<00:01:14.159> was

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369
