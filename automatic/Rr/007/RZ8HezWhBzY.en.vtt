foods<00:00:34.650> we've<00:00:35.100> got<00:00:35.310> the<00:00:35.700> jams<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.480> canned

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
foods we've got the jams the canned

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.340 
foods we've got the jams the canned
tomato<00:00:37.350> juice<00:00:37.830> and<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.970> fermented<00:00:39.720> food

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
tomato juice and we have fermented food

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.890 
tomato juice and we have fermented food
I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.550> fermentation<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.540> really

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
I think that the fermentation is really

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.570 
I think that the fermentation is really
interesting<00:00:43.380> because<00:00:43.470> it's<00:00:43.770> not<00:00:43.830> usually<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
interesting because it's not usually the

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.490 
interesting because it's not usually the
first<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:45.090> people<00:00:45.270> think<00:00:45.750> about<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.440> they

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
first thing people think about when they

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
first thing people think about when they
think<00:00:46.590> about<00:00:46.830> preserving<00:00:47.490> food<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.420> from

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
think about preserving food but from

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.870 
think about preserving food but from
what<00:00:49.080> you<00:00:49.200> say<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.860> really<00:00:50.070> easy<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> very

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
what you say it's really easy and very

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.640 
what you say it's really easy and very
healthy<00:00:51.360> -<00:00:51.630> absolutely

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
healthy - absolutely

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.230 
healthy - absolutely
the<00:00:52.890> health<00:00:53.070> benefits<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.520> enormous<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
the health benefits are enormous the

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.850 
the health benefits are enormous the
fermented<00:00:54.780> foods<00:00:54.990> are<00:00:55.110> actually<00:00:55.230> healthier

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
fermented foods are actually healthier

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.410 
fermented foods are actually healthier
than<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.190> raw<00:00:56.370> foods<00:00:56.700> well<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.240> of<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
than the raw foods well because of the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.940 
than the raw foods well because of the
bacterial<00:00:57.990> action<00:00:58.470> that<00:00:58.650> does<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
bacterial action that does the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.250 
bacterial action that does the
fermentation<00:00:59.310> the<00:01:00.060> bacteria<00:01:00.540> are<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.690> only

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
fermentation the bacteria are not only

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.319 
fermentation the bacteria are not only
preserving<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.010> food<00:01:02.220> but<00:01:02.760> they're<00:01:02.910> creating

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
preserving the food but they're creating

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
preserving the food but they're creating
vitamins<00:01:04.079> they're<00:01:04.589> pre<00:01:04.769> digesting<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> food

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
vitamins they're pre digesting the food

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.859 
vitamins they're pre digesting the food
and<00:01:05.789> making<00:01:06.030> some<00:01:06.179> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.329> nutrients<00:01:06.719> more

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and making some of the nutrients more

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.510 
and making some of the nutrients more
readily<00:01:07.170> available<00:01:07.319> to<00:01:07.710> our<00:01:07.920> bodies

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
readily available to our bodies

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.279 
readily available to our bodies
very<00:01:08.759> cool<00:01:08.999> so<00:01:09.329> today<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:10.020> gonna<00:01:10.109> start

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
very cool so today we're gonna start

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.770 
very cool so today we're gonna start
with<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.649> simple<00:01:11.030> fermentation<00:01:12.030> recipe<00:01:12.600> which

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
with a simple fermentation recipe which

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.569 
with a simple fermentation recipe which
is<00:01:12.810> sauerkraut<00:01:13.499> well<00:01:13.890> there's<00:01:14.100> only<00:01:14.159> three

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
ingredients for any lacto fermentation

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.300 
ingredients for any lacto fermentation
okay<00:01:16.829> salt<00:01:17.639> water<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.170> vegetable<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:20.249> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to go ahead and very finely cut the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.849 
to go ahead and very finely cut the
cabbage<00:01:24.990> we're<00:01:25.079> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> take<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.499> core<00:01:25.829> of

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
cabbage we're going to take the core of

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.649 
cabbage we're going to take the core of
the<00:01:26.189> cabbage<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.639> and<00:01:26.999> then<00:01:27.450> we're<00:01:27.539> gonna

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
so we've shredded our cabbage okay we're

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:32.959 
so we've shredded our cabbage okay we're
gonna<00:01:31.740> wait<00:01:32.069> it<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.609> weigh<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
gonna wait it and then weigh out the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.819 
gonna wait it and then weigh out the
salt<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.929> add<00:01:34.109> to<00:01:34.139> it<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:34.679> I've

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
salt that we add to it which I've

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.429 
salt that we add to it which I've
already<00:01:34.979> done<00:01:35.359> and<00:01:36.359> just<00:01:36.869> sprinkle<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> salt

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
already done and just sprinkle the salt

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.349 
already done and just sprinkle the salt
right<00:01:37.679> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> cabbage<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.209> add<00:01:39.329> some

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
right on the cabbage I like to add some

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.440 
right on the cabbage I like to add some
caraway<00:01:40.049> seed<00:01:40.369> some<00:01:41.369> celery<00:01:41.850> seed<00:01:42.179> and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
