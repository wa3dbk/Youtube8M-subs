00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.949 

today<00:00:00.989> we're<00:00:01.439> going<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:01.800> install<00:00:02.159> dd-wrt<00:00:03.149> and

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
today we're going to install dd-wrt and

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.410 
today we're going to install dd-wrt and
this<00:00:04.920> is<00:00:05.100> really<00:00:05.370> one<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.910> more<00:00:06.120> easy

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
this is really one of the more easy

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.629 
this is really one of the more easy
firmwares<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.649> install<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.550> router<00:00:08.730> and

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
firmwares to install on the router and

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.669 
firmwares to install on the router and
but<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.570> most<00:00:12.690> frustrating<00:00:13.410> for<00:00:13.559> me

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
but it was the most frustrating for me

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.950 
but it was the most frustrating for me
because<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.370> was<00:00:14.400> nearly<00:00:14.730> impossible<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.660> find

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
because it was nearly impossible to find

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.510 
because it was nearly impossible to find
a<00:00:16.260> working<00:00:16.800> file<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:18.260> there's<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.520> hundreds

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
a working file the there's a hundreds

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.279 
a working file the there's a hundreds
and<00:00:20.640> hundreds<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.029> builds<00:00:21.449> every<00:00:21.750> month<00:00:22.170> we

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and hundreds of builds every month we

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.259 
and hundreds of builds every month we
have<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> new<00:00:22.590> build<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> they<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.119> it

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
have a new build and and they have it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.169 
have a new build and and they have it
for<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.890> RT<00:00:27.230> 66<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.699> course<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
for the the RT 66 you of course this is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.999 
for the the RT 66 you of course this is
the<00:00:30.240> RT<00:00:30.570> 66<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.410> maybe<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.830> something

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the RT 66 are maybe they have something

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310 
the RT 66 are maybe they have something
to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.420> shouldn't<00:00:33.870> they're

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to do with it but it shouldn't they're

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.799 
to do with it but it shouldn't they're
identical<00:00:34.649> routers<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.460> nothing<00:00:36.270> worked<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
identical routers but nothing worked and

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.080 
identical routers but nothing worked and
it<00:00:37.649> would<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.950> sit<00:00:38.160> there<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.700> reboot

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
it would just sit there and reboot

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.080 
it would just sit there and reboot
you're<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.050> every<00:00:40.399> 30<00:00:41.399> seconds<00:00:41.879> of

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you're going like every 30 seconds of

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.850 
you're going like every 30 seconds of
the<00:00:42.210> router<00:00:42.390> reboot<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> was<00:00:43.530> just

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the router reboot you know it was just

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.889 
the router reboot you know it was just
some<00:00:44.070> sort<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.460> major<00:00:44.940> screw-up<00:00:45.570> but<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
some sort of a major screw-up but I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.700 
some sort of a major screw-up but I
found<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.350> old<00:00:46.590> version<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.700> brain<00:00:47.969> Slayer

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
found an old version the brain Slayer

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
found an old version the brain Slayer
firmware<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:50.160> works<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.449> I'm<00:00:51.600> going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:53.360> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
firmware that works so I'm going to to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.240 
firmware that works so I'm going to to
get<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.110> by<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.559> even<00:00:55.860> tried<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
get that and by the way I even tried the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
get that and by the way I even tried the
newer<00:00:56.399> version<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.969> brain<00:00:57.149> Slayer<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.989> got

six seven six this is the one I found
that<00:01:05.970> works<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.570> both<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.380> big<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.890> mega

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that works and both the big in the mega

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
that works and both the big in the mega
work<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:09.240> big<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.140> reason<00:01:10.470> much

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
work the big is for some reason much

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.340 
work the big is for some reason much
bigger<00:01:11.040> than<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> mega<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.570> we'll<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:13.110> here

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
bigger than the mega and we'll see here

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.719 
bigger than the mega and we'll see here
we'll<00:01:13.500> select<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.020> we'll<00:01:16.020> select<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> mega

we'll select that we'll select the mega
oops<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:23.450> anyway<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:25.229> using<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> stock

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
oops and anyway the I'm using the stock

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.289 
oops and anyway the I'm using the stock
firmware<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.549> by<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> stock

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
firmware here and by the way the stock

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.730 
firmware here and by the way the stock
firmware<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> very<00:01:28.110> very<00:01:28.350> good<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> don't

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
firmware is very very good I don't

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.370 
firmware is very very good I don't
really<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.369> any<00:01:29.490> reason<00:01:29.689> to<00:01:30.689> upgrade<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
really see any reason to upgrade to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.569 
really see any reason to upgrade to
dd-wrt<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> stock<00:01:33.150> firmer<00:01:33.540> but<00:01:34.579> some

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
dd-wrt over the stock firmer but some

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
dd-wrt over the stock firmer but some
people<00:01:35.850> might<00:01:36.030> want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:37.350> gonna<00:01:37.500> go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
people might want to and I'm gonna go

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
people might want to and I'm gonna go
ahead<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:40.040> I'll<00:01:41.299> keep<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> going

ahead and do it and I'll keep you going
on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> progress<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.500> usually<00:01:43.799> takes

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
on the progress here this usually takes

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.340 
on the progress here this usually takes
a<00:01:44.189> while<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.579> I'm<00:01:44.640> gonna<00:01:44.820> pause<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:46.320> was

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a while so I'm gonna pause that was

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.469 
a while so I'm gonna pause that was
quick<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.950> only<00:01:47.250> took<00:01:47.460> two<00:01:47.790> minutes<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
quick this only took two minutes and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
quick this only took two minutes and
like<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.590> say<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.490> whole<00:01:50.610> thing<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.970> about

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
like I say the whole thing is about

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.310 
like I say the whole thing is about
getting<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> right<00:01:51.450> firmware<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.079> I'm<00:01:52.170> gonna

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
getting the right firmware and I'm gonna

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
getting the right firmware and I'm gonna
post<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.829> link<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:53.549> firmware<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
post a link to the right firmware in the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.289 
post a link to the right firmware in the
descriptions<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.680> video<00:01:56.040> I've<00:01:57.000> also

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
descriptions on this video I've also

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.660 
descriptions on this video I've also
found<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.380> use<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.890> recovery<00:01:59.460> mode

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
found that you can use the recovery mode

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.069 
found that you can use the recovery mode
and<00:01:59.939> there's<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> web<00:02:00.540> browser<00:02:00.719> that

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
and there's like a web browser that

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.050 
and there's like a web browser that
comes<00:02:01.259> up<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> recovery<00:02:01.740> mode<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> I'll

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
comes up in the recovery mode and I'll

the rest of don't work look like open

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.780 
the rest of don't work look like open
and<00:04:15.570> then<00:04:16.570> we'll<00:04:16.780> just<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.560> can<00:04:17.739> also<00:04:18.220> we

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
and then we'll just and you can also we

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.520 
and then we'll just and you can also we
can<00:04:18.970> reboot<00:04:19.269> here<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:19.870> we<00:04:19.989> can<00:04:20.109> restore<00:04:20.260> the

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
can reboot here and we can restore the

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.030 
can reboot here and we can restore the
NB<00:04:20.890> Ram<00:04:21.400> here<00:04:22.360> so<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:22.900> doing<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.169> WPS<00:04:23.710> or

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
NB Ram here so it's so doing the WPS or

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.100 
NB Ram here so it's so doing the WPS or
some<00:04:24.910> other<00:04:25.030> way<00:04:25.270> there's<00:04:25.540> nothing<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.990> there

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
some other way there's nothing is there

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.650 
some other way there's nothing is there
two<00:04:26.320> other<00:04:26.410> ways<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.890> clear<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.370> NVRAM<00:04:27.880> so<00:04:28.570> I'm

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
two other ways to clear the NVRAM so I'm

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.090 
two other ways to clear the NVRAM so I'm
gonna<00:04:28.780> click<00:04:29.020> upload<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:31.710> it'll<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:32.860> take<00:04:33.040> a

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
gonna click upload and it'll just take a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.270 
gonna click upload and it'll just take a
minute<00:04:33.570> after<00:04:34.570> it's<00:04:34.690> done<00:04:34.870> uploading<00:04:35.280> it'll

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
minute after it's done uploading it'll

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.330 
minute after it's done uploading it'll
show<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.750> now<00:04:38.260> we<00:04:38.680> just<00:04:38.800> gotta<00:04:39.100> wait<00:04:39.280> a

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
show this and now we just gotta wait a

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.850 
show this and now we just gotta wait a
little<00:04:39.520> while<00:04:39.700> for<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.150> router<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.200> do<00:04:41.710> its

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
little while for the router to do its

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.890 
little while for the router to do its
thing<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.310> transfer<00:04:43.090> stuff<00:04:43.330> around<00:04:43.570> and

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
thing and transfer stuff around and

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.320 
thing and transfer stuff around and
restart<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.560> actually<00:04:44.950> takes<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.370> fairly<00:04:46.180> long

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
restart it actually takes a fairly long

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.320 
restart it actually takes a fairly long
time<00:04:46.390> for<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.169> router<00:04:47.380> to<00:04:47.650> get<00:04:47.800> ready<00:04:48.040> but<00:04:48.970> you

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
time for the router to get ready but you

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.780 
time for the router to get ready but you
have<00:04:49.450> to<00:04:49.540> be<00:04:49.630> patient<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:51.430> we're<00:04:51.550> still

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
have to be patient so we're still

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.030 
have to be patient so we're still
waiting<00:04:52.180> like<00:04:52.660> I<00:04:52.780> say<00:04:52.960> takes<00:04:53.229> a<00:04:53.320> long<00:04:53.620> time

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
waiting like I say takes a long time

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.190 
waiting like I say takes a long time
when<00:04:54.820> you<00:04:54.940> use<00:04:55.120> either<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.600> restoration

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
when you use either the restoration

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.159 
when you use either the restoration
utility<00:04:56.830> or<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.220> web<00:04:57.370> interface<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.750> the

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
utility or the web interface and the

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.500 
utility or the web interface and the
restoration<00:04:59.770> Foley<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.400> probably<00:05:00.729> even<00:05:01.060> even

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
restoration Foley is probably even even

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.780 
restoration Foley is probably even even
better<00:05:01.540> they<00:05:01.870> just<00:05:02.340> firm<00:05:03.340> or<00:05:03.460> restoration

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
better they just firm or restoration

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.380 
better they just firm or restoration
utility<00:05:04.450> but<00:05:05.410> we<00:05:06.010> just<00:05:06.220> gotta<00:05:06.430> wait<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:06.940> I'm

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
utility but we just gotta wait and I'm

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.870 
utility but we just gotta wait and I'm
gonna<00:05:07.540> time<00:05:07.900> it<00:05:07.930> with<00:05:08.919> other<00:05:09.100> firmware<00:05:09.640> as<00:05:09.760> it

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
gonna time it with other firmware as it

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.390 
gonna time it with other firmware as it
takes<00:05:10.120> more<00:05:10.360> than<00:05:10.419> 30<00:05:10.750> minutes<00:05:11.020> sometimes<00:05:11.400> so

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
takes more than 30 minutes sometimes so

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.460 
takes more than 30 minutes sometimes so
I<00:05:13.060> was<00:05:13.510> having<00:05:13.690> a<00:05:13.780> lot<00:05:13.840> of<00:05:13.900> problems<00:05:14.169> cuz

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
I was having a lot of problems cuz

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
would reset the the router and and you

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.100 
would reset the the router and and you
know<00:05:20.020> cuz<00:05:20.200> I<00:05:20.260> you<00:05:21.250> know<00:05:21.720> found<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.930> if<00:05:23.020> you

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
work except for this one I found that

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.439 
work except for this one I found that
good<00:05:57.949> luck

00:05:59.439 --> 00:05:59.449 
good luck

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.119 
good luck

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
that we had to do before we get started

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.589 
that we had to do before we get started
here<00:06:03.289> that<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:03.979> have<00:06:04.069> to<00:06:04.189> do<00:06:04.279> so<00:06:04.489> uh<00:06:04.519> we'll<00:06:05.479> go

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
here that you have to do so uh we'll go
