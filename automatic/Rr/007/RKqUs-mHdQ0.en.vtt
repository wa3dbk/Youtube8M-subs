let's<00:00:14.580> start<00:00:14.820> off<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.030> Yoshi<00:00:15.590> this<00:00:16.590> kind<00:00:16.829> of

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
let's start off with Yoshi this kind of

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.249 
let's start off with Yoshi this kind of
cart<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.249> get<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.579> the<00:00:17.730> standard<00:00:18.480> building

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
cart you get in the standard building

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.089 
cart you get in the standard building
set<00:00:19.499> the<00:00:19.739> starting<00:00:20.249> line<00:00:20.429> with<00:00:20.640> Mario<00:00:21.150> and

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
Mario also comes with this car this car

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.679 
Mario also comes with this car this car
is<00:00:25.319> the<00:00:25.589> slowest<00:00:25.980> car<00:00:26.269> however<00:00:27.269> when<00:00:27.569> you're

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
is the slowest car however when you're

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.790 
is the slowest car however when you're
doing<00:00:28.199> tracks<00:00:28.649> with<00:00:29.489> narrow<00:00:29.939> roads<00:00:30.329> it's<00:00:30.800> no

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
doing tracks with narrow roads it's no

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.740 
doing tracks with narrow roads it's no
roads<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.250> least<00:00:32.399> an<00:00:32.579> opening<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.870> everything

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
roads at least an opening in everything

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.860 
roads at least an opening in everything
anyways<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:38.460> good<00:00:38.850> because<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.600> doesn't

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
anyways it's good because it doesn't

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.100 
anyways it's good because it doesn't
slow<00:00:40.080> down<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.700> slow<00:00:41.910> car<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
slow down but it's a slow car kind of a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.850 
slow down but it's a slow car kind of a
contradiction<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:44.420> the<00:00:45.420> next<00:00:45.630> card<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
contradiction there the next card is the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.650 
contradiction there the next card is the
standard<00:00:47.370> cart<00:00:47.640> oh<00:00:47.820> by<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.090> way<00:00:48.240> this<00:00:48.420> was<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
standard cart oh by the way this was the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.050 
standard cart oh by the way this was the
wild<00:00:48.870> winged<00:00:49.080> one<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.280> one's<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> standard

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
wild winged one this one's the standard

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.069 
wild winged one this one's the standard
cart<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.470> second<00:00:52.910> fastest<00:00:53.910> one<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.569 

personally<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.290> this<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.040> haven't<00:00:59.310> tried

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
personally like this one I haven't tried

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.420 
personally like this one I haven't tried
out<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.329> next<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.140> comparison<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.310> I'm

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
out the next one comparison but I'm

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.890 
out the next one comparison but I'm
pretty<00:01:02.640> sure<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.880> next<00:01:03.000> one's<00:01:03.239> faster<00:01:03.750> from

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
pretty sure the next one's faster from

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.270 
pretty sure the next one's faster from
what<00:01:04.049> I've<00:01:04.170> seen<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:05.129> test<00:01:05.549> runs<00:01:07.009> this<00:01:08.009> one

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
what I've seen from test runs this one

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.709 
what I've seen from test runs this one
