didn't pick up on the fight it was
another<00:06:35.630> fight<00:06:35.870> I'm<00:06:35.900> sure<00:06:36.140> they<00:06:36.230> would<00:06:36.440> have

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
another fight I'm sure they would have

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.950 
another fight I'm sure they would have
baby<00:06:37.610> pick<00:06:37.850> up<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.120> fight<00:06:38.330> but<00:06:38.540> it's<00:06:38.600> mostly

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
baby pick up the fight but it's mostly

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.810 
baby pick up the fight but it's mostly
because<00:06:39.140> HBO<00:06:40.240> is<00:06:41.240> has<00:06:42.230> been<00:06:42.440> very<00:06:42.650> stern<00:06:43.070> what

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:43.820 
because HBO is has been very stern what

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.310 
because HBO is has been very stern what
