00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
want to continue with my Emeril energy

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.980 
want to continue with my Emeril energy
review<00:00:04.940> reviews<00:00:05.940> with<00:00:06.410> the<00:00:07.410> spiral<00:00:07.890> beam

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
review reviews with the spiral beam

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.249 
review reviews with the spiral beam
let's<00:00:09.990> go<00:00:10.139> ahead<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:11.450> haha<00:00:12.450> how

here's<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.929> second<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> set<00:00:17.000> this<00:00:18.000> one<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
here's the second in the set this one is

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.040 
here's the second in the set this one is
the<00:00:19.730> spiral<00:00:20.730> being<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> emeril<00:00:21.720> energy

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the spiral being the emeril energy

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.450 
the spiral being the emeril energy
spiral<00:00:22.350> beam<00:00:22.699> this<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.800> like<00:00:25.800> it's

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
spiral beam this one is just like it's

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.410 
spiral beam this one is just like it's
obvious<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> small<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:28.160> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:30.179> it's

like its spiral and that's just like and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
like its spiral and that's just like and
it<00:00:42.690> comes<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.140> an<00:00:43.410> energy<00:00:43.620> top<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> tip<00:00:44.640> like

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it comes like an energy top a tip like

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.209 
it comes like an energy top a tip like
it's<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> my<00:00:46.230> kids<00:00:46.260> something<00:00:47.070> or

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
kind of beams with the Rings and how

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.940 
kind of beams with the Rings and how
doing<00:01:41.130> especially<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.820> mean<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.899> flat<00:01:43.680> beam

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
doing especially I mean the flat beam

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.520 
doing especially I mean the flat beam
that<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.079> reviewing<00:01:46.079> next<00:01:46.409> that's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that want to be a reviewing next that's

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
that want to be a reviewing next that's
like<00:01:47.240> it's<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.829> what<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> wanted

like it's like what are what I wanted
there<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> Hal<00:01:52.229> Jordan<00:01:52.590> figure

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
there to be with the Hal Jordan figure

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.260 
there to be with the Hal Jordan figure
this<00:01:54.420> thing<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:55.340> but<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.490> spiral<00:01:56.939> beam<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
this thing is but this spiral beam it's

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.249 
this thing is but this spiral beam it's
amazing<00:01:58.009> unfortunately<00:01:59.009> though<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.460> talked<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
amazing unfortunately though I talked to

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.899 
amazing unfortunately though I talked to
oh<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:03.240> really<00:02:04.170> hoping<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.219> he<00:02:05.490> could<00:02:05.700> do

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
oh I was really hoping that he could do

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.969 
oh I was really hoping that he could do
something<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.540> yellow<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.770> make

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
something with the yellow like make

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.320 
something with the yellow like make
yellow<00:02:08.340> beams<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.610> only<00:02:11.610> problem<00:02:12.030> with

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
yellow beams but the only problem with

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.400 
yellow beams but the only problem with
that<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.900> hands<00:02:13.200> are

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
that is the hands are

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920 
that is the hands are
so<00:02:13.530> much<00:02:13.680> different<00:02:14.130> see<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.150> Hal<00:02:15.450> Jordan

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
so much different see because Hal Jordan

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.980 
so much different see because Hal Jordan
