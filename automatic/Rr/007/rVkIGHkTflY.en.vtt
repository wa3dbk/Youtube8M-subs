00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.630 
hold it then you go back to the top the
one<00:02:46.110> problem<00:02:46.320> with<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.340> hard<00:02:47.519> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
one problem with this is kind of hard to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640 
one problem with this is kind of hard to
the<00:02:47.790> bone<00:02:47.970> when<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.209> gone<00:02:48.360> still<00:02:49.260> absolute

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the bone when you gone still absolute

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.729 
the bone when you gone still absolute
low<00:02:49.830> cause<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.430> kind<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.670> guess<00:02:50.880> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
low cause you have to kind of guess it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.880 
low cause you have to kind of guess it
let<00:02:52.739> me<00:02:52.860> try<00:02:53.040> again<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> low<00:02:54.590> I'm<00:02:55.590> not<00:02:55.739> too

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
let me try again to the low I'm not too

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.210 
let me try again to the low I'm not too
short<00:02:56.010> way<00:02:57.140> yeah<00:02:58.140> that's<00:02:58.590> absolute<00:02:59.069> lower

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
short way yeah that's absolute lower

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.790 
short way yeah that's absolute lower
think<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.989> if<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.170> want<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.380> quickly<00:03:01.590> go<00:03:01.769> from

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
think and if you want to quickly go from

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.490 
think and if you want to quickly go from
low<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.370> high<00:03:02.519> there<00:03:03.390> isn't<00:03:03.630> much<00:03:03.660> there<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.350> no

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
low to high there isn't much there is no

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
low to high there isn't much there is no
one<00:03:04.650> option<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.280> do<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.640> mean<00:03:05.790> when<00:03:06.480> you

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
one option to do that I mean when you

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.050 
one option to do that I mean when you
turn<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.810> off<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.170> then<00:03:07.620> turn<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:08.010> again<00:03:08.250> it

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
turn it off and then turn it on again it

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.740 
turn it off and then turn it on again it
still<00:03:09.300> stays<00:03:09.480> at<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.720> low<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:12.090> quickest

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
still stays at the low so the quickest

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.050 
still stays at the low so the quickest
way<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.079> is<00:03:13.320> leave<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:13.860> flashback<00:03:14.700> turned

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
way to do is leave the flashback turned

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.280 
way to do is leave the flashback turned
on<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:16.019> then<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.470> unscrew<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.660> once<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
on and then just unscrew it once and the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.750 
on and then just unscrew it once and the
square<00:03:19.530> back<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.049> will<00:03:22.200> go<00:03:22.290> back<00:03:22.470> to

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
square back on and it will go back to

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.470 
square back on and it will go back to
high<00:03:23.760> school<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.670> useful<00:03:27.000> feature<00:03:27.299> is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
high school and on the useful feature is

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.670 
high school and on the useful feature is
um<00:03:27.720> if<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.829> turn<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.989> one<00:03:30.989> slightly

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
um if you just turn this one slightly

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.160 
um if you just turn this one slightly
anti-clockwise<00:03:35.269> the<00:03:36.269> button<00:03:36.900> doesn't<00:03:37.140> work

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
anti-clockwise the button doesn't work

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.319 
anti-clockwise the button doesn't work
anymore<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.070> can't<00:03:38.310> want<00:03:38.760> accident<00:03:39.269> in

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
anymore so you can't want accident in

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.509 
anymore so you can't want accident in

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.090 
know the reason why I'll do this nine
yard<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.209> because<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:52.739> button<00:03:53.040> here

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
yard was because this button here

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.099 
yard was because this button here
especially<00:03:53.760> on<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.390> really<00:03:54.690> hard<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.870> tell
