color I think it's really cute the only

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.920 
color I think it's really cute the only
thing<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.130> don't<00:02:43.190> really<00:02:43.760> like<00:02:44.330> that<00:02:44.360> much<00:02:44.720> is

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
thing I don't really like that much is

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.530 
thing I don't really like that much is
that<00:02:45.140> it's<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.590> pop<00:02:45.950> top<00:02:46.400> another<00:02:46.790> twist<00:02:47.180> chop

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
that it's a pop top another twist chop

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.860 
that it's a pop top another twist chop

because sometimes when you're gonna bind

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.500 
because sometimes when you're gonna bind
it's<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.500> lot<00:02:51.620> easier<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.700> have<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.850> twist<00:02:53.180> tops
