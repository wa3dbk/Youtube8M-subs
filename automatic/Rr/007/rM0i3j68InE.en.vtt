mode

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:48.369

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
come on let's do some semi-automated

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
come on let's do some semi-automated
clipping<00:01:28.020> right

at<00:02:44.030> all<00:02:44.590> no<00:02:45.590> throttle<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> sense<00:02:46.880> of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
at all no throttle this is a sense of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.240 
at all no throttle this is a sense of
working<00:02:47.420> at<00:02:47.540> both<00:02:47.750> no<00:02:47.960> trouble<00:02:48.530> no<00:02:48.770> air<00:02:49.040> we'll

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
working at both no trouble no air we'll

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.640 
working at both no trouble no air we'll
do<00:02:49.370> this<00:02:49.550> let's<00:02:50.510> let<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.750> settle<00:02:51.080> back<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.500> and

do this let's let it settle back in and
we'll<00:02:51.710> do<00:02:51.860> another<00:02:51.890> one<00:02:52.220> all<00:02:52.700> right<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:52.910> you're

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
we'll do another one all right so you're

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.150 
we'll do another one all right so you're
flipping<00:02:53.870> wild<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:54.590> that<00:02:54.770> you<00:02:54.920> don't

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
flipping wild and out that you don't

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
flipping wild and out that you don't
hold<00:02:55.340> any<00:02:55.670> climbs<00:02:56.030> right<00:02:56.390> back<00:02:56.630> where<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:56.990> was

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
hold any climbs right back where it was

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.790 
hold any climbs right back where it was
previously<00:02:59.440> okay<00:03:00.440> okay<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.070> ready<00:03:01.310> okay<00:03:01.780> so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
previously okay okay you ready okay so

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.170 
previously okay okay you ready okay so
flip<00:03:03.800> on<00:03:04.660> it

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
flip on it

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.709 
flip on it
all<00:03:07.659> I'm<00:03:07.810> doing<00:03:07.870> steering<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.239> loses<00:03:10.390> about

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
all I'm doing steering so it loses about

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.140 
all I'm doing steering so it loses about
15<00:03:11.260> feet<00:03:11.530> or<00:03:11.680> something<00:03:11.829> like<00:03:12.159> that<00:03:12.219> but<00:03:12.670> it's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
15 feet or something like that but it's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.550 
15 feet or something like that but it's
recovering<00:03:13.719> though<00:03:13.840> it's<00:03:13.989> off<00:03:14.109> the<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.409> it<00:03:14.469> on

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
recovering though it's off the to it on

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.059 
recovering though it's off the to it on
its<00:03:14.739> own

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.680 

that's<00:03:18.610> pretty<00:03:18.819> good

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.870 

so<00:03:23.230> we'll<00:03:23.440> do<00:03:23.620> some<00:03:23.680> rudder<00:03:24.190> steering<00:03:24.730> with

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
so we'll do some rudder steering with

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.520 
so we'll do some rudder steering with
the<00:03:25.000> altitude<00:03:25.270> height<00:03:25.630> hold<00:03:25.810> engage<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.440> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
the altitude height hold engage with the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.130 
the altitude height hold engage with the
stock<00:03:26.770> transmitter<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.550> little<00:03:28.030> bit

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
stock transmitter a little bit

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.400 
stock transmitter a little bit
these<00:03:29.319> are<00:03:29.470> flashing<00:03:29.950> quickly

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
these are flashing quickly

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.590 
these are flashing quickly
indicating<00:03:32.400> that<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.670> is<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:32.970> altitude<00:03:33.270> hyper

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
indicating that it is in altitude hyper

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.180

mode

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
mode

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.960 
mode
so<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.880> can<00:03:36.150> fly<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.480> around<00:03:37.160> jawing<00:03:38.160> it's<00:03:38.910> a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
so you can fly this around jawing it's a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.130 
so you can fly this around jawing it's a
little<00:03:39.180> tricky<00:03:39.540> takes<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.020> getting

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
little tricky takes a little getting

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.960 
little tricky takes a little getting
used<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.650> your<00:03:40.980> really<00:03:41.220> wait<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
used to your really wait for a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.090 
used to your really wait for a
transmitter<00:03:42.780> elsewhere<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.230> believe<00:03:43.560> this

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
transmitter elsewhere you believe this

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:59.570 
transmitter elsewhere you believe this
is<00:03:45.110> yeah<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:46.470> need<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:58.490> what<00:03:59.490> you're

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
is yeah you just need to what you're

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.740 
is yeah you just need to what you're
going<00:03:59.700> to<00:03:59.730> notice<00:03:59.910> though<00:04:00.240> is<00:04:00.270> you<00:04:00.600> can

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
going to notice though is you can

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.600 
going to notice though is you can
manipulate<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.320> a<00:04:01.500> little<00:04:01.830> bit<00:04:02.010> there's<00:04:02.520> a

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
manipulate that a little bit there's a

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.190 
manipulate that a little bit there's a
little<00:04:02.820> bit<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:03.030> room<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.330> stick<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.720> climb<00:04:03.990> it

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
little bit of room to stick to climb it

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.840 
little bit of room to stick to climb it
a<00:04:04.260> little<00:04:04.470> bit<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.710> room<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.980> descend<00:04:05.400> wiling

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
a little bit of room to descend wiling

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.970 
a little bit of room to descend wiling
out<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.090> do<00:04:06.210> height<00:04:06.420> hold<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.620> notice

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
out to do height hold so if you notice

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.620 
out to do height hold so if you notice
your<00:04:08.130> units<00:04:08.550> climbing<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.090> descending<00:04:09.120> or

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
your units climbing or descending or

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.880 
your units climbing or descending or
something<00:04:09.900> like<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.380> because<00:04:10.710> your

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
something like that it's because your

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.590 
something like that it's because your
your<00:04:11.220> stick<00:04:11.520> isn't<00:04:11.700> in<00:04:11.940> directly<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
your stick isn't in directly in the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.379 
your stick isn't in directly in the
center<00:04:12.900> so<00:04:13.830> this<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.100> pretty<00:04:14.250> close<00:04:14.460> to<00:04:14.820> where

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
center so this is pretty close to where

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:25.790 
center so this is pretty close to where
ship<00:04:16.629> it<00:04:16.780> out<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.289> law

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.950 

so<00:04:26.370> no<00:04:26.639> throttle<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.360> this<00:04:27.539> is<00:04:27.660> all<00:04:27.810> this

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
so no throttle so this is all this

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.980 
so no throttle so this is all this
sensor<00:04:28.849> and<00:04:29.849> it's<00:04:30.030> gonna<00:04:30.180> move<00:04:30.449> around<00:04:30.780> a

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
sensor and it's gonna move around a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.570 
sensor and it's gonna move around a
little<00:04:31.139> bit<00:04:31.289> because<00:04:31.620> you're<00:04:31.919> giving<00:04:32.340> it<00:04:32.460> all

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
little bit because you're giving it all

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.600 
little bit because you're giving it all
these<00:04:32.729> fast<00:04:33.449> commands<00:04:33.900> but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.560 

single<00:04:41.939> feet<00:04:42.300> for<00:04:42.629> 5<00:04:43.080> minute<00:04:43.379> fight

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
single feet for 5 minute fight

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.730 
single feet for 5 minute fight
okay<00:04:46.140> so<00:04:46.200> I'm<00:04:46.350> gonna<00:04:46.500> climb<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.800> little<00:04:46.980> bit

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
okay so I'm gonna climb a little bit

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:58.580 
okay so I'm gonna climb a little bit
still<00:04:49.740> in<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:49.980> altitude<00:04:50.430> height<00:04:50.610> hold

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.409 

and<00:04:58.980> then<00:04:59.160> I<00:04:59.220> bring<00:04:59.400> it<00:04:59.490> back<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.820> center<00:05:00.150> stick

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
and then I bring it back to center stick

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.840 
and then I bring it back to center stick
and<00:05:00.660> now<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:00.990> it's<00:05:01.350> climbed<00:05:01.710> but<00:05:02.520> now<00:05:02.669> it's

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
and now it's it's climbed but now it's

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.340 
and now it's it's climbed but now it's
locked<00:05:03.030> back<00:05:03.300> into<00:05:03.570> altitude<00:05:03.750> hide<00:05:04.139> hold

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
locked back into altitude hide hold

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.450 
locked back into altitude hide hold
again<00:05:04.880> so<00:05:05.880> we'll<00:05:06.000> do<00:05:06.150> another<00:05:06.180> manual<00:05:06.840> flip<00:05:07.460> or

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
again so we'll do another manual flip or

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.290 
again so we'll do another manual flip or
automated<00:05:09.030> flip

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.600 

and<00:05:12.690> that's<00:05:12.930> hands-off<00:05:13.410> with<00:05:13.650> throttle

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.529 

okay<00:05:18.300> I'm<00:05:18.389> gonna<00:05:18.479> break<00:05:18.689> it<00:05:18.720> back<00:05:18.900> down<00:05:19.199> I

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
okay I'm gonna break it back down I

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.730 
okay I'm gonna break it back down I
don't<00:05:21.539> notice<00:05:21.720> any<00:05:22.050> weird<00:05:22.229> tendencies<00:05:22.710> or

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
don't notice any weird tendencies or

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:30.260 
don't notice any weird tendencies or
anything<00:05:23.009> like<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.310> with<00:05:23.639> this<00:05:29.060> expert<00:05:30.060> mode

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
anything like that with this expert mode

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.330 
anything like that with this expert mode
and<00:05:30.509> I'll<00:05:30.870> make<00:05:31.050> sure<00:05:31.229> he's<00:05:31.590> always<00:05:31.860> going<00:05:32.219> to

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
and I'll make sure he's always going to

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.390 
and I'll make sure he's always going to
die<00:05:32.520> so<00:05:32.849> now<00:05:33.000> okay<00:05:33.629> I'm<00:05:34.289> dying<00:05:34.680> get<00:05:35.009> us<00:05:35.099> in<00:05:35.250> last

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
die so now okay I'm dying get us in last

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.189 
die so now okay I'm dying get us in last
I'm<00:05:35.639> gonna<00:05:35.819> dust<00:05:36.000> I'm<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.449> can<00:05:36.629> see<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.930> in<00:05:37.050> one

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
I'm gonna dust I'm you can see it in one

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.820 
I'm gonna dust I'm you can see it in one
piece<00:05:37.409> like<00:05:37.620> this<00:05:37.740> Wow<00:05:38.759> oh<00:05:38.939> we're<00:05:39.150> gonna<00:05:39.240> do

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
piece like this Wow oh we're gonna do

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.709 
piece like this Wow oh we're gonna do
manual<00:05:40.830> flipping<00:05:41.250> expert<00:05:42.240> load<00:05:42.419> with<00:05:42.689> the

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719 
manual flipping expert load with the

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.899 
manual flipping expert load with the
stock<00:05:43.080> transmitter<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.219> people<00:05:44.520> can<00:05:44.669> get<00:05:44.759> an

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
stock transmitter so people can get an

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.929 
stock transmitter so people can get an
idea<00:05:45.180> what<00:05:45.270> to<00:05:45.539> expect<00:05:45.930> so<00:05:46.939> it's

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
idea what to expect so it's

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:49.969 
idea what to expect so it's
significantly<00:05:48.569> slower<00:05:48.870> than<00:05:49.139> it<00:05:49.259> is<00:05:49.409> with<00:05:49.800> the

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
significantly slower than it is with the

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.140 
significantly slower than it is with the
spectrum<00:05:50.370> or<00:05:51.740> like<00:05:52.740> a<00:05:52.770> Futaba<00:05:53.639> transmitter

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
spectrum or like a Futaba transmitter

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.209 
spectrum or like a Futaba transmitter
and<00:05:54.360> it's<00:05:54.479> supposed<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.990> be<00:05:55.080> that<00:05:55.349> way<00:05:55.409> see<00:05:56.190> the

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:56.219 
and it's supposed to be that way see the

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:58.189 
and it's supposed to be that way see the
sticks<00:05:56.699> are<00:05:56.849> significantly<00:05:57.449> shorter<00:05:57.900> on<00:05:58.050> the

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
sticks are significantly shorter on the

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.920 
sticks are significantly shorter on the
stock<00:05:58.440> transmitter<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.250> if<00:05:59.849> we<00:06:00.060> made<00:06:00.539> it<00:06:00.659> flip

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
stock transmitter and if we made it flip

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.420 
stock transmitter and if we made it flip
any<00:06:01.080> faster<00:06:01.560> it<00:06:01.680> would<00:06:01.800> be<00:06:01.919> difficult<00:06:02.159> to

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
any faster it would be difficult to

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.520 
any faster it would be difficult to
control<00:06:02.759> and<00:06:02.879> just<00:06:03.240> standard<00:06:03.840> regular<00:06:04.289> flight

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
control and just standard regular flight

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.070 
control and just standard regular flight
in<00:06:04.680> expert<00:06:05.009> mode<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.819> it<00:06:05.969> has<00:06:06.180> -<00:06:06.389> this<00:06:06.780> is<00:06:06.960> the

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
in expert mode so it has - this is the
