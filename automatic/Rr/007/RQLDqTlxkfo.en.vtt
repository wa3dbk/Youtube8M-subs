00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.910 
of like I'd say it's kind of a GT GT to
GTA<00:01:42.000> 2<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.780> mission<00:01:43.020> as<00:01:43.170> well<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> kind

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
GTA 2 kind of mission as well as to kind

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.039 
GTA 2 kind of mission as well as to kind
of<00:01:43.979> feel<00:01:44.189> about<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.850> GTA<00:01:45.450> 2<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.899> would

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
of feel about it because GTA 2 you would

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.450 
of feel about it because GTA 2 you would
get<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.350> kinds<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.799> missions<00:01:46.979> where<00:01:47.310> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
get these kinds of missions where you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.670 
get these kinds of missions where you
have<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.850> blow<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.720> something<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.439> blow

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
have to like blow up something or blow

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.399 
have to like blow up something or blow
up<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.950> car<00:01:50.159> all<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.670> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> things<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.630> it's

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
up a car all that kind of things so it's

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.600 
up a car all that kind of things so it's
interesting<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.979> they've<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> still

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
interesting that they've kind of still

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.260 
interesting that they've kind of still
in<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.850> mode

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
in that mode

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.730 
in that mode
I<00:01:54.659> guess<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:55.079> they<00:01:55.290> don't<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
I guess because they don't like just

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
I guess because they don't like just
obviously<00:01:56.159> transitioned<00:01:56.790> over<00:01:56.909> from<00:01:57.240> GTA<00:01:57.600> 2

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
obviously transitioned over from GTA 2

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.620 
obviously transitioned over from GTA 2
so<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:59.369> very<00:01:59.670> interesting<00:01:59.909> Dinah's<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so that's very interesting Dinah's to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.139 
so that's very interesting Dinah's to
say<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.219> we<00:02:02.219> go<00:02:02.340> into<00:02:02.520> eight-balls<00:02:02.939> bomb

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
say so we go into eight-balls bomb

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.090 
say so we go into eight-balls bomb
shopping<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.630> fit<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.869> idaho<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> bomb

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
shopping we fit this idaho with a bomb

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
shopping we fit this idaho with a bomb
this<00:02:05.340> idaho<00:02:05.759> right<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> i'd

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
this idaho right here this is the i'd

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260 
this idaho right here this is the i'd
say<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> worst<00:02:08.250> car<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.759> game<00:02:09.030> i

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
say this is the worst car in the game i

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.119 
say this is the worst car in the game i
mean<00:02:09.450> people<00:02:09.959> will<00:02:10.200> obviously<00:02:10.319> point<00:02:10.770> out<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
mean people will obviously point out the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.770 
mean people will obviously point out the
things<00:02:11.370> like<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> trash<00:02:11.940> master<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.510> slower

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
things like the trash master is slower

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
things like the trash master is slower
but<00:02:13.080> i<00:02:13.260> don't<00:02:13.440> count

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
but i don't count

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.890 
but i don't count
trash<00:02:14.040> master<00:02:14.520> because<00:02:14.760> that's<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.690> that's

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
trash master because that's that that's

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
trash master because that's that that's
not<00:02:16.170> really<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.920> proper<00:02:17.520> vehicle<00:02:17.730> it's

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
not really like a proper vehicle it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.970 
not really like a proper vehicle it's
just<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> DOS<00:02:18.780> card<00:02:19.170> or<00:02:19.380> whatever<00:02:19.740> you

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
just like a DOS card or whatever you

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070 
just like a DOS card or whatever you
know<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.520> not<00:02:20.610> all<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.060> big<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> deal

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
know it's it's not all that big a deal

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.650 
know it's it's not all that big a deal
so<00:02:22.470> I'm<00:02:22.860> talking<00:02:23.070> about<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.490> proper<00:02:24.060> cars<00:02:24.360> in

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
so I'm talking about like proper cars in

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660 
so I'm talking about like proper cars in
this<00:02:24.810> game<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.350> Idaho's<00:02:25.860> definitely<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.460> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
this game and Idaho's definitely one the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.780 
this game and Idaho's definitely one the
worst<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.570> that's<00:02:28.500> brown<00:02:28.770> Telus<00:02:29.130> well<00:02:29.340> if<00:02:29.460> IDs

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
worst and that's brown Telus well if IDs

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.400 
worst and that's brown Telus well if IDs

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
Bronto might be just that little bit

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.800 
Bronto might be just that little bit
worse<00:02:31.770> hard<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.820> image<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.450> there<00:02:33.600> are<00:02:33.690> some
