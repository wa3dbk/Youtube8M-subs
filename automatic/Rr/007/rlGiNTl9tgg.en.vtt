00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
like this with the big washer on it in

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.850 
like this with the big washer on it in
there<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:37.170> hold<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.530> keep<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.550> from<00:01:38.640> coming<00:01:38.850> off

that's really all there is to engage one
in<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:45.960> same<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> pulley<00:01:46.770> would<00:01:47.300> you

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
in the same way as a pulley would you

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.890 
in the same way as a pulley would you
get<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.660> slot<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.060> set<00:01:51.270> screw<00:01:51.420> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
goes on it I get push the pressure on

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.410 
goes on it I get push the pressure on
the<00:01:56.220> key<00:01:56.370> with<00:01:56.550> you<00:01:56.640> just<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.880> same<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the key with you just the same as that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
the key with you just the same as that
only<00:01:58.110> difference<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.830> just<00:01:59.040> has<00:01:59.160> one<00:01:59.220> screw

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
only difference is it just has one screw

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.420 
only difference is it just has one screw
whereas<00:02:00.150> that<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.330> 2<00:02:03.140> well<00:02:04.140> that's<00:02:04.470> about<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
whereas that is 2 well that's about it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.680 
whereas that is 2 well that's about it
