00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
because it's kind of flat I'm gonna use

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.660 
because it's kind of flat I'm gonna use
that<00:01:43.439> I'm<00:01:43.560> gonna<00:01:43.649> soak<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.159> vinegar<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that I'm gonna soak that in vinegar and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.170 
that I'm gonna soak that in vinegar and
wrap<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.720> around<00:01:45.990> my<00:01:46.500> my<00:01:47.220> blade<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.790> to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
wrap that around my my blade here to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.660 
wrap that around my my blade here to
kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.420> test<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.810> doing<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> pattern<00:01:50.159> okay

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
kind of test out doing a pattern okay

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.399 
kind of test out doing a pattern okay
because<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.720> lot<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.990> interest<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
because I know a lot of interest was in

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.139 
because I know a lot of interest was in
that<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.799> people<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> patinas<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.060> they

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that to people like the patinas but they

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.760 
that to people like the patinas but they
kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> want<00:01:54.570> something<00:01:54.810> something

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
kind of want something something

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.840 
kind of want something something
different<00:01:56.070> something<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> pattern<00:01:56.729> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
different something with a pattern that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.120 
different something with a pattern that
might<00:01:56.969> look<00:01:57.180> cool<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:58.860> going<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
might look cool so I'm actually going to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.179 
might look cool so I'm actually going to
take<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.540> Victorinox<00:02:00.540> here<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.860> cut

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
take this Victorinox here and just cut

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.529 
take this Victorinox here and just cut
this<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.790> material

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.419 

let's<00:02:09.110> go<00:02:09.229> do<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.470> for<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.860> real<00:02:10.009> quick<00:02:10.190> here

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
let's go do that for you real quick here

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.869 
let's go do that for you real quick here
I<00:02:11.590> just<00:02:12.590> have<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.830> chill<00:02:13.069> here<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.340> can<00:02:13.580> slide

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
I just have the chill here I can slide

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.180 
I just have the chill here I can slide
this<00:02:14.030> out<00:02:14.470> that's<00:02:15.470> why<00:02:15.680> all<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> all<00:02:16.099> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
this out that's why all the all the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.830 
this out that's why all the all the
hardware's<00:02:16.549> separate<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.720> this

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
hardware's separate so now I have this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.729 
hardware's separate so now I have this
nice<00:02:18.019> long<00:02:18.349> piece<00:02:18.379> of<00:02:18.890> flat<00:02:19.790> cord<00:02:20.530> okay<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
nice long piece of flat cord okay so I

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.770 
nice long piece of flat cord okay so I
can<00:02:21.950> wrap<00:02:22.159> this<00:02:22.370> blade<00:02:22.670> up<00:02:22.879> after<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.360> soak<00:02:23.629> this

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
can wrap this blade up after I soak this

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.360 
can wrap this blade up after I soak this
in<00:02:23.930> vinegar<00:02:24.230> so<00:02:24.769> I<00:02:24.830> could<00:02:24.980> see<00:02:25.099> what<00:02:25.220> that's

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
in vinegar so I could see what that's

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.460 
in vinegar so I could see what that's
gonna<00:02:25.610> be<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.750> far<00:02:26.900> as<00:02:27.019> doing<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.260> pattern

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
gonna be like as far as doing a pattern

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.410 
gonna be like as far as doing a pattern
so<00:02:28.280> later<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.700> video<00:02:28.819> I'll<00:02:29.090> show<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.299> how

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
so later in this video I'll show you how

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.750 
so later in this video I'll show you how
that<00:02:29.599> came<00:02:29.780> out<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:31.099> also<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.640> show

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.860 
that came out but also I want to show
you<00:02:31.819> here<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.780> another<00:02:33.140> carbon<00:02:34.069> steel<00:02:34.370> model

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
you here is another carbon steel model

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.569 
you here is another carbon steel model
this<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.019> actually<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:37.549> naturally<00:02:38.450> formed

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
this is actually a naturally formed

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.630 
this is actually a naturally formed
patina<00:02:40.989> it's<00:02:41.989> somewhat<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.739> rusty<00:02:43.400> side

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
patina it's somewhat on the rusty side

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.880 
patina it's somewhat on the rusty side
this<00:02:43.849> does<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.269> be<00:02:44.329> cleaned<00:02:44.829> however<00:02:45.829> I

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
this does have to be cleaned however I

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.930 
this does have to be cleaned however I
just<00:02:45.920> want<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.250> show<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.519> mean<00:02:46.609> I<00:02:46.790> did

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
just want to show you I mean I did

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.130 
just want to show you I mean I did
nothing<00:02:47.180> with<00:02:47.269> this<00:02:47.390> knife<00:02:47.599> I<00:02:47.720> actually<00:02:47.870> use

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
nothing with this knife I actually use

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.160 
nothing with this knife I actually use
this<00:02:48.260> knife<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.590> lot<00:02:48.799> for<00:02:49.400> wood<00:02:49.609> carving<00:02:50.170> and

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
this knife a lot for wood carving and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.630 
this knife a lot for wood carving and
things<00:02:51.410> like<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.040> never<00:02:52.220> really<00:02:52.489> did

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
things like that and I never really did

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.000 
things like that and I never really did
much<00:02:52.700> with<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.239> kind<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.290> experiment<00:02:54.799> on<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
much with it kind of experiment on the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.140 
much with it kind of experiment on the
carbon<00:02:55.310> steel<00:02:55.459> blades<00:02:55.700> but<00:02:55.849> you<00:02:55.910> could<00:02:56.000> see

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
carbon steel blades but you could see

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.490 
carbon steel blades but you could see
how<00:02:56.269> that's<00:02:56.450> could<00:02:56.629> just<00:02:56.810> naturally<00:02:57.230> kind<00:02:57.379> of

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
how that's could just naturally kind of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.039 
how that's could just naturally kind of
coming<00:02:57.739> in<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.819> is<00:02:58.910> kind<00:02:59.150> of<00:02:59.209> rusty<00:02:59.510> however<00:02:59.959> if

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
coming in it is kind of rusty however if

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.210 
coming in it is kind of rusty however if
I<00:03:00.109> wipe<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:00.500> down<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.829> clean<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.099> really

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
I wipe this down and clean it really

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.099 
I wipe this down and clean it really
well<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:02.120> would<00:03:02.299> take<00:03:02.480> kind<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.840> brown

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
well it would take kind of the brown

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.699 
well it would take kind of the brown
away<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.709> just<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.069> gray<00:03:04.430> color<00:03:04.609> I

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
away and you just have that gray color I

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.039 
away and you just have that gray color I
just<00:03:06.709> wanted<00:03:06.859> to<00:03:06.950> show<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.069> that<00:03:07.810> it's<00:03:08.810> kind

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
just wanted to show you that it's kind

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.440 
just wanted to show you that it's kind
of<00:03:09.109> beginnings<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.239> natural<00:03:11.239> law<00:03:11.390> of

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
of beginnings of the natural law of

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.970 
of beginnings of the natural law of
patina<00:03:11.750> coming<00:03:12.079> in<00:03:12.200> now<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.500> can<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.859> it

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
patina coming in now you can see it

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.670 
patina coming in now you can see it
slightly<00:03:13.400> in<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:14.180> one<00:03:14.329> here<00:03:14.630> some<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
slightly in this one here some of the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.199 
slightly in this one here some of the
parts<00:03:16.250> on<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.370> tip<00:03:16.609> there<00:03:16.819> it's<00:03:16.940> starting<00:03:17.150> to

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
parts on the tip there it's starting to

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.300 
parts on the tip there it's starting to
come<00:03:17.299> in<00:03:17.419> just<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.630> little<00:03:17.840> bit<00:03:17.959> again<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.160> one

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
come in just a little bit again this one

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.099 
come in just a little bit again this one
has<00:03:19.400> been<00:03:19.579> used<00:03:19.849> not<00:03:20.239> nearly<00:03:20.480> as<00:03:20.660> much<00:03:20.810> as<00:03:20.870> this

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
has been used not nearly as much as this

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
an hour after sitting in the solution

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.180 
an hour after sitting in the solution
with<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:44.630> nylon<00:03:45.049> strand<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.620> wrapped

with the that nylon strand just wrapped

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.809 
with the that nylon strand just wrapped
around<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.639> and<00:03:47.079> here<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.500> results<00:03:51.819> not

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
around it and here is the results not

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.150 
around it and here is the results not
too<00:03:53.000> shabby

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
too shabby

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.970 
too shabby
as<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.280> see<00:03:55.430> here<00:03:55.639> you<00:03:55.730> definitely<00:03:56.120> have<00:03:56.239> a

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
as you see here you definitely have a

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.610 
as you see here you definitely have a
you<00:03:57.980> know<00:03:58.040> striping<00:03:58.819> pattern<00:03:59.079> on<00:04:00.079> the<00:04:00.230> back<00:04:00.410> it

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
you know striping pattern on the back it

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.690 
you know striping pattern on the back it
was<00:04:00.709> a<00:04:00.739> little<00:04:00.919> more<00:04:01.040> secure<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.489> little

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
was a little more secure a little

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.180 
was a little more secure a little
tighter<00:04:01.910> so<00:04:02.180> you<00:04:02.239> have<00:04:02.389> a<00:04:02.859> little<00:04:03.859> tighter

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
tighter so you have a little tighter

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.390 
tighter so you have a little tighter
strips<00:04:04.579> on<00:04:04.760> there<00:04:05.440> but<00:04:06.440> you<00:04:06.680> know<00:04:07.040> it's<00:04:07.190> it's

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
strips on there but you know it's it's

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.550 
strips on there but you know it's it's
hard<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.790> see<00:04:08.389> this<00:04:08.510> on<00:04:08.660> camera<00:04:09.049> as<00:04:09.109> opposed<00:04:09.410> to

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
hard to see this on camera as opposed to

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.129 
hard to see this on camera as opposed to
in<00:04:10.160> person<00:04:10.579> it's<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:11.449> much<00:04:11.599> nicer<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:12.109> person

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
in person it's so much nicer in person

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:13.960 
in person it's so much nicer in person
although<00:04:13.069> you<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.459> kind<00:04:13.639> of<00:04:13.669> pick<00:04:13.819> up

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
although you can kind of pick up

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.899 
although you can kind of pick up
generally<00:04:14.299> what<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:14.540> is<00:04:14.660> by<00:04:15.349> viewing<00:04:15.590> this

you watch my food video I can attest to
that<00:04:50.810> but<00:04:51.810> overall<00:04:52.320> just<00:04:52.470> a<00:04:52.770> different<00:04:53.100> way<00:04:53.370> of

some of the circles that's where maybe

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.790 
some of the circles that's where maybe
there<00:05:12.780> was<00:05:12.870> some<00:05:13.080> air<00:05:13.500> bubbles<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.650> can

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
kind of see that closer detail let's try

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.090 
kind of see that closer detail let's try
the<00:05:22.080> other<00:05:22.260> side

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.480 

as<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.190> can<00:05:28.250> say<00:05:28.430> it's<00:05:28.580> just<00:05:28.639> a<00:05:28.790> gray<00:05:29.030> in<00:05:29.300> color

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
again certain certain things like

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.780 
again certain certain things like
potatoes<00:05:33.530> will<00:05:33.770> give<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.100> a<00:05:34.190> slight

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
potatoes will give it a slight

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.870 
potatoes will give it a slight
coloration<00:05:35.389> like<00:05:35.540> a<00:05:35.570> blue<00:05:36.100> you<00:05:37.100> just<00:05:37.610> have<00:05:37.760> to

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
coloration like a blue you just have to

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.409 
coloration like a blue you just have to
experiment<00:05:38.150> with<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:41.350> but<00:05:42.350> uh<00:05:42.380> anyway<00:05:43.419> that's

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
experiment with it but uh anyway that's

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:45.640 
experiment with it but uh anyway that's
what<00:05:44.570> it<00:05:44.630> looks<00:05:44.780> like

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
what it looks like

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.080

like I said something different if you
do<00:05:47.210> want<00:05:47.360> to<00:05:47.389> go<00:05:47.510> with<00:05:47.690> something<00:05:48.229> like<00:05:48.320> this

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
do want to go with something like this

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.920 
do want to go with something like this
gives<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:49.729> you<00:05:49.910> know<00:05:50.270> different<00:05:50.630> character

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
gives it you know different character

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.530

good<00:07:07.520> thing<00:07:07.550> you<00:07:07.789> can<00:07:07.910> do<00:07:08.060> instead<00:07:09.050> of<00:07:09.110> doing<00:07:09.199> a

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
good thing you can do instead of doing a

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.950 
good thing you can do instead of doing a
rap<00:07:09.620> like<00:07:09.830> I<00:07:09.979> did<00:07:10.190> you<00:07:10.820> can<00:07:10.849> get<00:07:11.060> some<00:07:11.210> tape<00:07:11.389> you

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
rap like I did you can get some tape you

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.320 
rap like I did you can get some tape you
know<00:07:12.110> any<00:07:12.260> tape<00:07:12.500> you<00:07:12.650> have<00:07:13.150> masking<00:07:14.150> tape

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
know any tape you have masking tape

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.600 
know any tape you have masking tape
would<00:07:14.449> probably<00:07:14.720> work<00:07:14.840> best<00:07:15.080> and<00:07:15.380> tape<00:07:16.370> off<00:07:16.580> a

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
would probably work best and tape off a

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.430 
would probably work best and tape off a
design<00:07:17.030> and<00:07:17.300> then<00:07:17.660> wrap<00:07:18.139> the<00:07:18.289> whole<00:07:18.410> thing

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
design and then wrap the whole thing

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.000 
design and then wrap the whole thing
that<00:07:19.430> way<00:07:19.580> you<00:07:19.639> have<00:07:19.880> a<00:07:19.910> very<00:07:20.090> distinct<00:07:20.750> look

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.010 
that way you have a very distinct look

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.350 
that way you have a very distinct look
so<00:07:22.010> anyway<00:07:22.729> I<00:07:22.760> just<00:07:22.789> want<00:07:23.030> to<00:07:23.090> show<00:07:23.180> you<00:07:23.240> that
