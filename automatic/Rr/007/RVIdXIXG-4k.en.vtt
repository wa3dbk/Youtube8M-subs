00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.770
 or the new one that I bring you a new 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.960
 Basic tutorial is already running out 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.779
 little this issue because it's not that 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.759
 There is so much basic and good to bring 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.290
 now in this case as I think you see in 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.880
 the title and you see me I think that 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.570
 neither should we explain much is the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.820
 loop and is not worth outlined basically 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.910
 false eyelashes red lip 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.590
 Typical typical but I consider it a look 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.170
 basic so I wanted to put it in 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.239
 this section I hope you liked it 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.480
 and that of course I wanted to see the step to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.480
 He passed 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.920
 I start on what by applying a test 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.090
 shadow is I will use the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.460
 enter that is what you are seeing 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.740
 lately in the videos we cover the 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.330
 mobile eyelid with a skin-colored shadow 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.340
 a little bit clearer than our tone 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.530
 natural me how am I using alan and 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.510
 that is going to be using the shadow words and 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.340
 with this shadow we also illuminate the 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.190
 eyebrow arch we blend it towards 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.820
 down with naked shadows 2 and a 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.010
 blending brush let's go creating 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.720
 a basin a little bit so blurred by 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.990
 the external part of the vouchers what is 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.540
 everything that is dark shadow browns go 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.610
 to be only in the external zones and 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.590
 then with a pincelito like this one of psoe 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.590
 is a little more precise and the shadow 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.900
 find let's darken a little bit more the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.420
 most external part of the logo but already 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.400
 I say we just concentrate the part 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.370
 external 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.620
 and we go back to blur to integrate 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.910
 everything better and we went to the delineate 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.730
 you can use whatever you want 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.240
 liquid gel eyeliner whatever you want 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.480
 I always start doing as you see 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.490
 height guides that will have the 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.350
 corner then I start doing the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.070
 triangle a little bit and from there 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.160
 Well, I 'm starting to take it towards what 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.440
 which is the center of the eyelid I make the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.899
 triangle I realized that as a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 is cleaner is doing it from 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.520
 outside in is how it looks 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.070
 right I do not know why at least 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.770
 my eye shape looks like this and as 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.570
 I told you in my video from line two the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.820
 that you have the fallen eyelid do it 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.130
 always with an open eye to what is 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.680
 the inclination so that it is below 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.150
 of the fold fill what is the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.850
 water line superior also so that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.070
 get thicker and then with the shadow 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.140
 find let's give some small touches 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.270
 between the lower lashes is worth 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.240
 simple touches and no longer has the 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.720
 bottom part with a flesh-colored pencil 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.390
 and use this from that forum 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.520
 let's make up the water line so that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.270
 it creates us more doll eyes more 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.510
 open is much more awake 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.220
 we make eyelashes and apply mascara 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.380
 ok because it will also apply tabs 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.360
 you put this on maybe you like it 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.600
 apply the good rhythm the mask 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.760
 after the eyelashes that's already a 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.640
 taste and comfort of each one I go 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.730
 to use the ones my wish asks to burn and 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.230
 already the light of eyes will be finished 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.210
 it is simply to practice the outline 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.900
 because this look after all is very 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.090
 very very very simple very easy and 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.210
 I put a base on my face 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.740
 of makeup quite covering and that 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.840
 is a little bit is Paul bad and is that the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.260
 stay color arrangement because I want that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.230
 finished in perfect powder-coated skin 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.940
 wrist and nothing we are applying for 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.370
 the whole face always being careful 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.580
 that this phase is covering, 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.110
 we stay in plan plasta I put corrector 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.560
 and the stamps masified with some powder 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.349
 translucent 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.050
 we have can also be compact or 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.280
 a powder base even also for 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.260
 seal it 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.819
 then hydrate my lips because I'm going to 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.510
 make up after red with the 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:07.060
 balsam those and I'll define the face 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.220
 I'm going to use the dark one and I'm going to define 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.170
 enough the face is worth to be 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.510
 I already have a cheekbone per se, but for 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.930
 that the cheekbone is still more marked 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.810
 and highlight more 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.120
 and also a little bit by the temple for 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.850
 that sculpting the face a little 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.860
 of colors I'm going to use some reds 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.020
 the scandal usd is lic but I think that 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.550
 they have retired but that to give a 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.990
 effect of are pink so doll 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.760
 natural because even though we fear 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.910
 the rock colors are pretty 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.690
 natural and then illuminating the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:46.000
 human emery is because they are very very 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.520
 illuminated the area and as skin of 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.900
 porcelain and I see also remove the bow 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.340
 of the little one with the shadow 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.740
 venus that comes in the palette in which 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.800
 is base to give a point of light a little 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.289
 more intense then I'm going to outline the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.229
 lips so that they are perfect with the 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.020
 cherry pencil and any other 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.030
 red profiler that you have and that 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.690
 we outline the lips correcting 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:14.169
 our form that is already each one has 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.569
 one way and then fill in the lip 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.029
 with 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:20.009
 the same profiler and then with the 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:23.399
 lipstick i'm going to use the russian red 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.080
 I'm going to make up where I put the 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:27.509
 profiler bramos all over the lip and what 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.159
 it left quite defined and already then if 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.979
 you want to be able to pass a proofreader or 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:35.039
 something to leave it more delimited and more 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:38.309
 perfect and the complete look would already be 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.949
 finished practicing the outlined and ready 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:42.990
 and here the lupine I hope that you 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.669
 I liked it had served if it's like that already 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.409
 You know how to give a little finger up 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.209
 subscribe here below and you can also

 social networks and the products that 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.619
 used and so on so nothing and I 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.969
 dismissal took good care and a kiss 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.969
 huge until then
