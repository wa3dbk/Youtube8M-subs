00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
root and for oracle it was sis so that's

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.090 
root and for oracle it was sis so that's
and<00:03:18.570> we'll<00:03:18.870> come<00:03:19.080> back<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> point<00:03:19.950> is

different in different databases so

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.270 
different in different databases so
we'll<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.170> let<00:03:28.350> let<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:28.799> go<00:03:28.950> ahead<00:03:29.100> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
we'll just let let this go ahead and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.820 
we'll just let let this go ahead and
install<00:03:32.630> okay<00:03:33.630> finally<00:03:34.350> finished<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.130> stolen

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
install okay finally finished and stolen

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.380 
install okay finally finished and stolen
so<00:03:37.970> what<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.209> happened<00:03:39.660> what<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:41.100> on

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
so the feud sewed it so that

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.860 
so the feud sewed it so that
installation<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.299> few<00:03:45.540> different

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
installation is to the few different

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.699 
installation is to the few different
things<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.410> got<00:03:46.530> an<00:03:46.620> exit<00:03:46.950> out<00:03:47.070> this<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:47.489> now

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
things it's got an exit out this for now

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.580 
things it's got an exit out this for now
one<00:03:49.709> of<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.920> first<00:03:50.190> things<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.640> did<00:03:50.910> now

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
one of the first things that did now

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.120 
one of the first things that did now
Oracle<00:03:52.590> they<00:03:53.430> I'll<00:03:54.090> come<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.780> later<00:03:55.140> they

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
Oracle they I'll come to this later they

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.940 
Oracle they I'll come to this later they
have<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> little<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:57.930> interact<00:03:58.290> with<00:03:58.620> the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
have a little way to interact with the

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.460 
have a little way to interact with the
database<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.640> installed<00:04:00.079> but<00:04:01.079> one<00:04:01.350> of

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
database you just installed but one of

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.910 
database you just installed but one of
the<00:04:01.560> things<00:04:01.620> they<00:04:02.070> did<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.400> go<00:04:02.519> to<00:04:02.579> properties

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
the things they did we go to properties

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.970 
the things they did we go to properties
advanced

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
advanced

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:16.939 
advanced
and<00:04:06.550> look<00:04:06.760> at<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.000> system<00:04:07.180> path<00:04:07.629> again<00:04:08.080> Oh

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:24.870 

copy<00:04:17.949> that<00:04:18.370> let's<00:04:18.729> read<00:04:18.910> out<00:04:19.030> notepad<00:04:23.880> they

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
copy that let's read out notepad they

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.939 
copy that let's read out notepad they
went<00:04:25.090> ahead<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.479> they<00:04:25.810> added<00:04:28.350> in<00:04:29.350> the<00:04:29.410> path

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
went ahead and they added in the path

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.730 
went ahead and they added in the path
looks<00:04:30.280> like<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.490> put<00:04:30.669> at<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.790> beginning<00:04:31.270> here

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
looks like I put at the beginning here

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.469 
looks like I put at the beginning here
ignore<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:32.889> other<00:04:33.100> stuff<00:04:33.340> they<00:04:33.880> added<00:04:34.300> the

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
ignore this other stuff they added the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.090 
ignore this other stuff they added the
bin<00:04:34.750> directory<00:04:34.780> or<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.470> binary<00:04:35.919> world

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
bin directory or the binary world

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.080 
bin directory or the binary world
executable<00:04:37.000> code<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.449> to<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.530> system<00:04:38.949> path<00:04:39.220> so

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
executable code is to the system path so

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.360 
executable code is to the system path so
now<00:04:40.300> when<00:04:40.780> we<00:04:40.900> go<00:04:40.930> in<00:04:41.380> let's<00:04:41.979> go<00:04:42.190> ahead<00:04:42.280> and

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
now when we go in let's go ahead and

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.340 
now when we go in let's go ahead and
look<00:04:42.550> at<00:04:42.699> that<00:04:42.820> director<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.389> see<00:04:43.570> all<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.870> new

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
look at that director to see all the new

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.650 
look at that director to see all the new
commands<00:04:44.889> we<00:04:45.039> can<00:04:45.190> now<00:04:45.280> access<00:04:45.580> in<00:04:46.120> command

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
commands we can now access in command

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.279 
commands we can now access in command
prompt<00:04:48.240> see<00:04:49.240> they<00:04:49.419> have<00:04:49.539> all<00:04:49.750> these<00:04:50.020> different

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
prompt see they have all these different

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.460 
prompt see they have all these different
commands<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:53.350> we<00:04:54.250> get<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.610> those<00:04:54.760> in<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:55.120> minute

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
commands and we get to those in a minute

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.409 
commands and we get to those in a minute
so<00:04:56.470> that's<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.770> first<00:04:57.070> thing<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.400> did<00:04:57.610> the

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
so that's the first thing it did the

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.570 
so that's the first thing it did the
second<00:04:59.020> thing<00:04:59.229> it<00:04:59.350> did<00:04:59.530> if<00:04:59.770> we<00:04:59.889> go<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.070> services

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
second thing it did if we go to services

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.640 
second thing it did if we go to services
it<00:05:03.580> installed<00:05:04.120> some<00:05:04.419> services<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.139> system

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
it installed some services on the system

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.439 
it installed some services on the system
which<00:05:05.800> once<00:05:06.070> again<00:05:06.250> are<00:05:06.430> just<00:05:06.610> programs<00:05:07.150> that

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:07.449 
which once again are just programs that

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.650 
which once again are just programs that
just<00:05:08.229> start<00:05:08.500> up<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:08.889> are<00:05:08.979> always<00:05:09.130> running

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.070 

let's<00:05:13.660> go<00:05:13.780> down<00:05:13.990> 2<00:05:14.289> o's<00:05:15.539> refresh<00:05:16.539> this<00:05:16.840> just

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
let's go down 2 o's refresh this just

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.029 
let's go down 2 o's refresh this just
make<00:05:17.349> sure<00:05:17.500> everything's<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:20.500> i<00:05:20.620> believe

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
they put it where they put it there we

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.450 
they put it where they put it there we
go<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:24.250> oracle<00:05:24.910> now<00:05:25.450> mysql<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.440> just<00:05:26.740> started<00:05:27.220> a

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
go so oracle now mysql it just started a

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.210 
go so oracle now mysql it just started a
bunch<00:05:28.180> of<00:05:28.360> them<00:05:28.570> but<00:05:29.380> you<00:05:29.710> can<00:05:29.889> see<00:05:30.070> that

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
bunch of them but you can see that

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.350 
bunch of them but you can see that
oracle<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:33.070> installed<00:05:33.700> quite<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> few

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
oracle it it installed quite a few

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.040 
oracle it it installed quite a few
services<00:05:34.780> like<00:05:35.710> a<00:05:35.919> about<00:05:36.310> five<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.729> them<00:05:37.050> only

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
services like a about five of them only

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.839 
services like a about five of them only
two<00:05:38.320> of<00:05:38.440> them<00:05:38.620> start<00:05:39.130> though<00:05:39.400> there's<00:05:39.760> a

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
two of them start though there's a

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.409 
two of them start though there's a
listener<00:05:40.360> and<00:05:41.310> this<00:05:42.310> other<00:05:42.520> service<00:05:43.120> here<00:05:43.389> I

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
listener and this other service here I

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.560 
listener and this other service here I
blew<00:05:43.690> that's<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.169> website<00:05:44.380> then<00:05:45.450> we're<00:05:46.450> not

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
blew that's the website then we're not

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.640 
blew that's the website then we're not
going<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:46.780> look<00:05:46.840> at<00:05:46.960> that<00:05:47.080> right<00:05:47.260> now<00:05:47.289> the

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
going to look at that right now the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.290 
going to look at that right now the
point<00:05:48.310> is<00:05:48.490> that<00:05:48.550> it<00:05:48.849> installed<00:05:49.270> some<00:05:49.510> services

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
point is that it installed some services

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.170 
point is that it installed some services
okay<00:05:52.300> so<00:05:53.110> back<00:05:53.320> to<00:05:53.590> doing<00:05:54.160> some<00:05:54.340> contrast<00:05:54.940> in

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
okay so back to doing some contrast in

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.120 
okay so back to doing some contrast in
here<00:05:55.389> so<00:05:55.690> in<00:05:56.020> mysql<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.470> command<00:05:59.830> to

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
here so in mysql the the command to

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.400 
here so in mysql the the command to
commend<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.849> log<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.270> command<00:06:02.020> line<00:06:02.229> was

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
commend the log on command line was

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.620 
commend the log on command line was
mysql<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.840> oracle<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:06.010> command<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.520> SQL<00:06:07.120> plus

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
mysql and oracle the command is SQL plus

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.469 
mysql and oracle the command is SQL plus
which<00:06:08.620> and<00:06:08.979> all<00:06:09.190> that's<00:06:09.340> really<00:06:09.610> referring<00:06:10.090> to

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
which and all that's really referring to

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.529 
which and all that's really referring to
is<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:10.900> name<00:06:11.860> of<00:06:11.889> the<00:06:12.280> executable<00:06:13.060> file<00:06:13.300> in

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539 
is the name of the executable file in

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:13.810 
is the name of the executable file in
here

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
here

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.380 
here
see<00:06:14.660> here<00:06:15.070> this<00:06:16.070> is<00:06:16.130> a<00:06:16.370> lot<00:06:16.670> there<00:06:17.210> it<00:06:17.300> is

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
see here this is a lot there it is

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.230 
see here this is a lot there it is
sqlplus<00:06:18.260> they<00:06:19.100> just<00:06:19.280> decided<00:06:19.820> to<00:06:19.940> call<00:06:20.120> it

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
sqlplus they just decided to call it

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.700 
sqlplus they just decided to call it
that<00:06:20.270> for<00:06:20.720> that<00:06:20.900> reason<00:06:22.900> so<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.260> way<00:06:24.290> you<00:06:24.410> get

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
that for that reason so the way you get

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.900 
that for that reason so the way you get
in<00:06:24.890> after<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:26.900> to<00:06:27.110> select<00:06:27.470> this<00:06:27.770> SGO<00:06:28.340> plus<00:06:28.640> as

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
in after you to select this SGO plus as

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.190 
in after you to select this SGO plus as
cysts<00:06:29.600> DBA<00:06:30.110> and<00:06:31.720> you<00:06:32.720> know<00:06:32.810> wait<00:06:32.930> there's<00:06:33.140> a

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
cysts DBA and you know wait there's a

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.530 
cysts DBA and you know wait there's a
lot<00:06:33.380> about<00:06:33.710> logins<00:06:34.370> but<00:06:34.790> we<00:06:35.120> won't<00:06:35.300> get<00:06:35.480> into

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
lot about logins but we won't get into

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.940 
lot about logins but we won't get into
the<00:06:35.750> intricacies<00:06:35.900> of<00:06:36.200> about<00:06:36.380> the<00:06:36.500> differences

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
the intricacies of about the differences

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.490 
the intricacies of about the differences
but<00:06:37.220> in<00:06:37.550> all<00:06:37.940> practical<00:06:38.510> purposes<00:06:39.050> let's<00:06:39.290> go

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
but in all practical purposes let's go

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.390 
but in all practical purposes let's go
ahead<00:06:39.590> and<00:06:39.710> I<00:06:40.280> ass<00:06:41.380> Malone<00:06:42.380> get<00:06:43.160> another

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
ahead and I ass Malone get another

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.070 
ahead and I ass Malone get another
command<00:06:43.790> prompt<00:06:44.150> here<00:06:44.300> so<00:06:44.630> you<00:06:44.690> can<00:06:44.810> kind<00:06:45.050> of

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
command prompt here so you can kind of

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.550 
command prompt here so you can kind of
see<00:06:45.200> the<00:06:45.290> difference<00:06:45.650> I<00:06:46.120> mean<00:06:47.120> do<00:06:47.330> my<00:06:47.600> SQL<00:06:48.320> user

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
see the difference I mean do my SQL user

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:56.200 
see the difference I mean do my SQL user
root<00:06:49.190> and<00:06:51.250> password<00:06:53.590> so<00:06:54.590> in<00:06:54.980> both<00:06:55.250> cases<00:06:55.310> were

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:56.210 
root and password so in both cases were

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.420 
root and password so in both cases were
now<00:06:56.450> logged<00:06:56.750> on<00:06:56.960> to<00:06:56.990> the<00:06:57.200> databases<00:06:57.830> you<00:06:58.370> can

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
now logged on to the databases you can

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.310 
now logged on to the databases you can
see<00:06:58.700> how<00:06:58.790> databases<00:06:59.480> are<00:06:59.630> very<00:06:59.810> similar<00:07:00.110> at

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:00.320 
see how databases are very similar at

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.740 
see how databases are very similar at
least<00:07:00.500> these<00:07:00.680> two<00:07:00.950> are<00:07:01.130> and<00:07:02.770> on<00:07:03.820> this<00:07:04.820> one<00:07:05.060> just

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750 
least these two are and on this one just

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.030 
least these two are and on this one just
in<00:07:05.900> the<00:07:05.930> same<00:07:06.170> way<00:07:06.230> that<00:07:06.620> we<00:07:06.680> were<00:07:07.010> able<00:07:07.520> to

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
in the same way that we were able to

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:15.160 
in the same way that we were able to
create<00:07:10.040> a<00:07:10.160> table<00:07:10.460> in<00:07:10.910> the<00:07:13.240> in<00:07:14.240> the<00:07:14.300> my<00:07:14.660> sequel

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.170 
create a table in the in the my sequel

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.140 
create a table in the in the my sequel
we<00:07:15.380> can<00:07:15.500> also<00:07:15.650> do<00:07:15.920> it<00:07:16.040> here<00:07:16.400> so<00:07:17.300> on<00:07:17.690> this<00:07:18.140> one

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
we can also do it here so on this one

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.410 
we can also do it here so on this one
I'll<00:07:20.150> just<00:07:20.300> see<00:07:20.900> if<00:07:21.020> this<00:07:21.140> works<00:07:21.380> for<00:07:21.770> us<00:07:21.890> here

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.420 
I'll just see if this works for us here

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:28.330 
I'll just see if this works for us here
great<00:07:23.420> table<00:07:25.030> table<00:07:26.030> created<00:07:26.510> now<00:07:27.290> few<00:07:28.010> things

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
great table table created now few things

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.910 
great table table created now few things
here<00:07:28.670> we<00:07:29.030> are<00:07:29.360> logged<00:07:29.570> on<00:07:29.750> the<00:07:29.900> assist<00:07:30.200> DBA<00:07:30.650> and

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:33.950 
we're actually in a tablespace that you

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.710 
we're actually in a tablespace that you
won't<00:07:34.220> ever<00:07:34.400> really<00:07:34.940> do<00:07:35.120> this<00:07:35.330> on<00:07:35.540> in

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
won't ever really do this on in

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.990 
won't ever really do this on in

this<00:07:39.890> works<00:07:43.300> so<00:07:44.300> you<00:07:44.390> can<00:07:44.540> see<00:07:44.780> that<00:07:44.810> sequel

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
this works so you can see that sequel

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.090 
this works so you can see that sequel
the<00:07:47.720> ideas<00:07:48.110> you<00:07:48.230> have<00:07:48.350> the<00:07:48.470> structured<00:07:48.860> query

languages<00:07:51.200> and<00:07:52.390> this<00:07:53.390> is<00:07:53.480> how<00:07:53.600> it<00:07:53.720> works<00:07:53.840> in

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.110 
languages and this is how it works in

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.970 
languages and this is how it works in
both<00:07:54.260> Oracle<00:07:54.950> and<00:07:55.540> SQL<00:07:56.560> so<00:07:57.560> on<00:07:57.620> this<00:07:57.710> one<00:07:57.890> we

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:57.980 
both Oracle and SQL so on this one we

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.410 
both Oracle and SQL so on this one we
can<00:07:58.130> do<00:07:58.390> select<00:07:59.390> star<00:07:59.720> from<00:07:59.750> person<00:08:00.590> and<00:08:01.420> it

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:02.420 
can do select star from person and it

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.880 
can do select star from person and it
displays<00:08:02.870> the<00:08:02.990> table<00:08:03.560> a<00:08:03.590> little<00:08:03.800> bit

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:03.890 
displays the table a little bit

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.020 
displays the table a little bit
differently<00:08:04.250> this<00:08:04.820> one<00:08:05.060> we<00:08:05.210> got<00:08:05.360> use<00:08:05.690> example

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.030 
differently this one we got use example

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.369 
differently this one we got use example
select<00:08:08.030> star

00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:09.379 
select star

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:15.079 
select star
person<00:08:10.909> and<00:08:12.800> there<00:08:13.800> you<00:08:13.979> go<00:08:14.129> so<00:08:14.550> that<00:08:14.849> is

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:15.089 
person and there you go so that is

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:20.209 
person and there you go so that is
running<00:08:15.389> oracle<00:08:16.020> and<00:08:16.559> a<00:08:17.459> mysql<00:08:18.029> database
