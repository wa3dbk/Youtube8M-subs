okay<00:00:03.300> one<00:00:03.450> of<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.600> features<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:03.900> we're

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
okay one of the features that we're

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.830 
okay one of the features that we're
adding<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.620> our<00:00:04.950> G<00:00:05.250> copter<00:00:05.700> 3.1<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.720> the

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 
adding in our G copter 3.1 is the

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.900 
adding in our G copter 3.1 is the
ability<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.200> land<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.920> take<00:00:08.040> off<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.460> also

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
ability to land and take off and also

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.970 
ability to land and take off and also
armed<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.480> loader<00:00:09.780> mode<00:00:10.020> so<00:00:10.680> there's<00:00:10.889> my

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
armed in loader mode so there's my

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.400 
armed in loader mode so there's my
three-year<00:00:11.280> quad<00:00:11.550> over<00:00:11.790> there<00:00:11.990> and<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.380> I

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
three-year quad over there and what I

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.950 
three-year quad over there and what I
have<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:13.980> my<00:00:14.190> top<00:00:14.820> switch<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.840> a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
have is that my top switch this is a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
have is that my top switch this is a
stabilized<00:00:16.619> mode<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> bottom<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.580> told

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
stabilized mode in the bottom all told

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.540 
stabilized mode in the bottom all told
in<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.330> middle<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> loiter<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> top<00:00:19.980> so

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
in the middle and loiter on the top so

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.889 
in the middle and loiter on the top so
it's<00:00:20.700> in<00:00:20.790> loiter<00:00:21.000> mode<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.599> I'm<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:21.899 
it's in loiter mode now and I'm going to

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:26.679 
it's in loiter mode now and I'm going to
arm

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.299 

there<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.020> it's<00:00:28.140> armed<00:00:28.380> another<00:00:29.189> thing

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
there it is so it's armed another thing

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.549 
there it is so it's armed another thing
that<00:00:29.430> we've<00:00:29.520> added<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.239> it<00:00:30.360> spins<00:00:31.290> the

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:31.559 
that we've added is that it spins the

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.880 
that we've added is that it spins the
propellers<00:00:32.040> by<00:00:32.220> default<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.769> when<00:00:34.769> it's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
propellers by default when the when it's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.840 
propellers by default when the when it's
armed<00:00:35.129> so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.570> will<00:00:37.109> now<00:00:37.230> take<00:00:37.440> off<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:40.350> goes<00:00:40.850> I'm

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
armed so I will now take off it goes I'm

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.810 
armed so I will now take off it goes I'm
stop<00:00:42.269> there<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:43.949> I'll<00:00:44.160> land<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> another

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
stop there and then I'll land so another

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.069 
stop there and then I'll land so another
thing<00:00:47.999> that<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> would<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
thing that it would do actually in

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.430 
thing that it would do actually in
previous<00:00:49.469> versions<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.780> if<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.960> land<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.320> in

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
previous versions is if you land it in

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.079 
previous versions is if you land it in
loiter<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.070> would<00:00:53.219> tend<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> bounce<00:00:53.609> around<00:00:53.850> on

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
loiter it would tend to bounce around on

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.700 
loiter it would tend to bounce around on
the<00:00:54.149> ground<00:00:54.359> of<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.109> that's<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.469> gone

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the ground of it so that's that's gone

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520 
the ground of it so that's that's gone
now<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:57.239> also<00:00:57.359> tell<00:00:57.749> that<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.140> landed

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
now you can also tell that it's landed

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.810 
now you can also tell that it's landed
or<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.920> knows<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> landed<00:00:59.699> because

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
or that it knows it it's landed because

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.450 
or that it knows it it's landed because
the<00:01:00.569> motors<00:01:00.899> go<00:01:01.050> quiet<00:01:01.319> so<00:01:01.949> I'll<00:01:02.069> do<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.280> again

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the motors go quiet so I'll do it again

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
the motors go quiet so I'll do it again
I'll<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.179> off<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.629> I'll<00:01:03.749> land<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.350> about<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
I'll take off then I'll land and about a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.770 
I'll take off then I'll land and about a
second<00:01:05.519> after<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.790> land<00:01:06.090> you'll<00:01:06.330> you'll<00:01:06.600> hear

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
second after I land you'll you'll hear

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
second after I land you'll you'll hear
the<00:01:06.899> motor<00:01:07.049> suddenly<00:01:07.500> slow<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.610> means

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the motor suddenly slow down which means

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.719 
the motor suddenly slow down which means
that<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> knows<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.450> landing<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:11.549> we

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that it knows that it's landing so up we

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.020 
that it knows that it's landing so up we
go<00:01:11.939> again<00:01:13.850> I'll<00:01:14.850> stop<00:01:15.149> there

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
go again I'll stop there

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.719 
go again I'll stop there
then<00:01:17.380> land<00:01:18.380> again

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.240 

they're<00:01:23.689> here<00:01:24.110> that<00:01:24.289> I<00:01:24.439> was<00:01:24.619> when<00:01:24.799> it<00:01:24.920> realized

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
they're here that I was when it realized

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.810 
they're here that I was when it realized
that<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.490> landed<00:01:26.170> another<00:01:27.170> fix<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.770> um<00:01:28.159> in

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
that it landed another fix is um in

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.370 
that it landed another fix is um in
previous<00:01:29.360> versions<00:01:29.689> you<00:01:30.020> know<00:01:30.140> you<00:01:30.200> could

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
previous versions you know you could

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.230 
previous versions you know you could
land<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.770> loiter<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.219> was<00:01:31.310> maybe<00:01:31.520> sort

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
land and loiter and that was maybe sort

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.310 
land and loiter and that was maybe sort
of<00:01:32.299> okay<00:01:32.539> that<00:01:32.570> there<00:01:32.840> might<00:01:32.929> bounce<00:01:33.079> around

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
of okay that there might bounce around

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.249 
of okay that there might bounce around
but<00:01:33.880> when<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:34.969> try<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.149> take<00:01:35.390> off<00:01:35.570> again<00:01:35.750> you

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
but when you try to take off again you

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.600 
but when you try to take off again you
would<00:01:36.380> find<00:01:36.619> that<00:01:36.799> there'd<00:01:36.979> be<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.100> delay<00:01:37.460> of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
would find that there'd be a delay of

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.669 
would find that there'd be a delay of
three<00:01:38.450> or<00:01:38.539> four<00:01:38.659> seconds<00:01:38.990> after<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:39.319> lifted

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
three or four seconds after you lifted

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.020 
three or four seconds after you lifted
the<00:01:39.710> throttle<00:01:40.130> before<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.460> actually<00:01:40.700> take<00:01:40.850> off

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
the throttle before it actually take off

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.289 
the throttle before it actually take off
so<00:01:41.840> that's<00:01:41.929> that<00:01:42.200> delay<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.649> gone<00:01:42.799> now<00:01:43.009> so

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
so that's that delay is gone now so

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.789 
so that's that delay is gone now so
you'll<00:01:44.299> see<00:01:44.450> here's<00:01:44.750> my<00:01:44.810> throttle<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:45.619> as

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
you'll see here's my throttle and as

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.289 
you'll see here's my throttle and as
soon<00:01:45.950> as<00:01:46.039> I<00:01:46.100> lift<00:01:46.340> it<00:01:48.729> up<00:01:49.729> it<00:01:49.909> goes

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
soon as I lift it up it goes

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.039 
soon as I lift it up it goes
no<00:01:50.509> no<00:01:51.020> delay<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:56.509> now<00:01:56.630> another<00:01:56.869> interesting

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
no no delay and now another interesting

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.740 
no no delay and now another interesting
thing<00:01:57.319> is<00:01:57.679> uh<00:01:58.209> landing<00:01:59.209> on<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.330> slope<00:01:59.689> so<00:02:00.520> I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
thing is uh landing on a slope so I

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.859 
thing is uh landing on a slope so I
conveniently<00:02:02.750> happen<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.319> have<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> slope<00:02:04.869> over

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
conveniently happen to have a slope over

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.990 
conveniently happen to have a slope over
here<00:02:06.849> and<00:02:07.849> you'll<00:02:08.060> see<00:02:09.640> camera<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.700> also

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
here and you'll see camera is also

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.350 
here and you'll see camera is also
leaning<00:02:11.209> but<00:02:11.860> here's<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.160> slope<00:02:13.519> I'm<00:02:14.269> going

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
leaning but here's the slope I'm going

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.360 
leaning but here's the slope I'm going
to<00:02:14.690> land

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.970 

a<00:02:21.420> few<00:02:22.420> Semak<00:02:22.720> stabilized<00:02:23.170> no<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.560> defuse

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
a few Semak stabilized no to defuse

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.949 
a few Semak stabilized no to defuse
which<00:02:24.220> way<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.900> here<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.379> copter<00:02:26.799> and<00:02:27.959> now

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
which way so here is the copter and now

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.059 
which way so here is the copter and now
I'm<00:02:29.200> going<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.560> land<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.580> slope<00:02:34.860> okay

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
I'm going to land it on this slope okay

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.800 
I'm going to land it on this slope okay
there's<00:02:36.459> little<00:02:36.700> too<00:02:36.790> far<00:02:37.000> away<00:02:37.090> in<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.569> back

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
there's little too far away in the back

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.710 
there's little too far away in the back
of<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:39.000> okay<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.030> now<00:02:40.209> we're<00:02:40.299> gonna<00:02:40.390> land<00:02:40.599> on

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
of it okay and now we're gonna land on

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.690 
of it okay and now we're gonna land on
the<00:02:40.840> slope<00:02:43.829> there<00:02:44.829> it's<00:02:44.980> still<00:02:45.129> managed<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.670> uh

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the slope there it's still managed to uh

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.839 
the slope there it's still managed to uh
no<00:02:46.299> no<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.720> was<00:02:46.780> was<00:02:47.650> landed<00:02:48.040> I'll<00:02:48.700> take

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
no no that it was was landed I'll take

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.890 
no no that it was was landed I'll take
off<00:02:49.000> again<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.269> we'll<00:02:49.450> go<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.569> little<00:02:49.720> bit

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
off again and we'll go a little bit

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.380 
off again and we'll go a little bit
deeper<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.620> slope

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
deeper on the slope

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.780 
deeper on the slope
this<00:02:52.390> means<00:02:52.599> down<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> little<00:02:53.049> bit<00:02:54.690> go<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.959> bit

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
this means down a little bit go up a bit

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:05.630 
this means down a little bit go up a bit
then<00:02:57.790> we'll<00:02:57.940> land<00:02:58.150> here

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.950 

there<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:06.820> that's<00:03:07.120> when<00:03:07.240> I<00:03:07.270> realized<00:03:07.630> again

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
there this that's when I realized again

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.160 
there this that's when I realized again
that<00:03:08.020> it<00:03:08.260> landed<00:03:08.680> take<00:03:09.520> off<00:03:09.670> again

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
that it landed take off again

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.740 
that it landed take off again
now<00:03:11.170> was<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.410> kind<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:12.210> slightly<00:03:13.210> faster

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
now was it kind of a slightly faster

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.250 
now was it kind of a slightly faster
landing

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:31.210 

nope<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:20.670> bounce<00:03:20.849> no<00:03:21.450> problem

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.910 

pull<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.760> back<00:03:31.910> over<00:03:32.120> here

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.400 

right<00:03:40.920> oh<00:03:41.240> yes<00:03:42.240> one<00:03:42.540> thing<00:03:42.720> we've<00:03:42.900> noticed<00:03:43.050> is

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
right oh yes one thing we've noticed is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.500 
right oh yes one thing we've noticed is
that<00:03:43.440> if<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.070> land<00:03:44.430> quite<00:03:45.420> quickly<00:03:47.360> it<00:03:48.360> can

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
that if you land quite quickly it can

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.750 
that if you land quite quickly it can
take<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> while<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.440> realize<00:03:49.830> that<00:03:50.610> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
take a while for it to realize that it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.190 
take a while for it to realize that it
is<00:03:50.790> landed<00:03:51.210> yeah<00:03:52.430> kind<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.490> okay<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.110> also<00:03:55.110> of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
is landed yeah kind of okay so also of

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.900 
is landed yeah kind of okay so also of
course<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.740> disarm<00:03:56.280> while<00:03:56.610> I'm<00:03:56.730> lighter

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
course you can disarm while I'm lighter

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.090 
course you can disarm while I'm lighter
mode<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.590> see<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.740> can<00:03:58.890> do<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.130> secret<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.950> we

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
mode so see if I can do the secret so we

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.590 
mode so see if I can do the secret so we
will<00:04:02.220> disarm<00:04:02.610> here<00:04:06.290> okay<00:04:07.290> that's<00:04:07.440> it
