00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:09.060
 in 2007 to the end 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.240
 Tell me guys, the droid played another one. 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.390
 great kick with the convert mode 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.849
 west where I found it very useful because it is 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.160
 it kind of converts the converts into a 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.200
 wood is the type of our 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.969
 This is very good because 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.460
 sometimes afternoon a giant biome 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:35.500
 thing that mildly denies the attack only 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.260
 sometimes if it was just a pine tree 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.820
 to find in her case of snow and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.620
 we will find you the wood that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.539
 Do you want, for example? 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.010
 I think the pine wood I think 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.960
 This one is more curious, right? 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.520
 and in case you want this one more clear 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.350
 it gets harder to find 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.110
 so this mode basically does it he 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.270
 converts people now have logo blocks 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.130
 to be able to convert coordination 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.570
 wood do not catch you see here the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.970
 motels to do day care for you 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.670
 sert understand long or take a 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.189
 each color here beauty 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.170
 Calm down, I came here to play the game. 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.390
 they are the ones who do something that gives 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.130
 to him a boat for these works will do 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.450
 three more in case I'm going to make one of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.659
 each color of wood 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.180
 I'll do it here, four beauty pegasse 4 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.620

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.479
 what galera with the color of the way that 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.090
 Do you want to get more affection here in the 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.560
 or that the use of conversation will do here 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.549
 I also almost put another deal 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.590
 with this more with the iac iac which is a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.860
 little different than most think 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.290
 angonese wood a misleading name 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.240
 already in commerce even then touched the 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.280
 four blocks here time to run with 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.260
 wood versions and I'll get you 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.220
 See all the blocks of wood here. 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.990
 here 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 Calm down, I saw you now, through 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 My little house, beauty, I'm going to put it here. 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.650
 quiet 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.600
 ok by clicking the direct airport with the 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.150
 wood and will convert all woods 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.530
 of your inventory is as indicated 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.080
 for example pick up here darker 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.769
 public the time you see it has converted 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.569
 four l lot of wood and make it 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.950
 convert all then propose that you 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.230
 being right was just getting more 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.970
 clarinha to but forget that Angola and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.930
 can put type what you want here 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.810
 wooden 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.819
 I talked here and did something 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.860
 Like, whatever you want I found 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.690
 very useful even guys 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.790
 I find him kind 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.760
 I do not know, I can see it, because only you. 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.310
 click and convert everything and I thought the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.680
 tyco could warm the furnace I 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.430
 I have a more special crash but I found 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.010
 cool 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.590
 the rule of the very interesting mod is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.230
 help you a lot, anyone you want 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.220
 stuck in the biome and they change places 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.020
 Your home, right? 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.030
 so it was not basically the mold is that 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.980
 then you will need to spend a year more 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.900
 with the words you download in style 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.450
 your original folder or I know from above 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.490
 The truth is that you know and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.320
 and mod girls who would leave 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.330
 I liked it and also a favorite after 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.670
 disclosure drafting beauty video 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.670
 So that's it, people said
