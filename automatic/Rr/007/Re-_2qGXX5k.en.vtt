00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone so I'll come back to you 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.379
 today to talk to you about a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.679
 mark m As They make up which is a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.210
 natural and organic makeup brand and 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.960
 especially to talk to you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.119
 eyelid parts in guys him 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.789
 I find that there is a good plan in fact 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.760
 I did I bought some makeup 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.349
 eyelids in refills like these game 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.730
 because they make a system that is 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 particularly interesting it is to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.059
 to say that their products no longer red to 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.489
 flashy lips and so the blushes to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.930
 eyelids are in cases for you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.840
 who are also very very pretty 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.460
 recharge can be removed at the end of 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 month logo d once it's empty for 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.059
 put a new refill 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.399
 it's an idea that I find very 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.780
 interesting so had the death to say 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.730
 here is an alternative 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.079
 ecological and economical 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.760
 because I really find it very 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.100
 interesting is that suddenly when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 own for example you are pallet on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.980
 can buy that recharge 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 because it's true that when 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.600
 buy a product obviously the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.520
 containing then represents some 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.640
 part of this premium 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.530
 and then I discovered that the container 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.270
 to represent up to half of 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.030
 price that we pay what is still 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.670
 crazy so I think it's interesting 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.830
 to only buy refills then 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.750
 with us so you have some 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 natural products so that from the bottom of 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.509
 masquerade where I was going with terra here I 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.939
 has three eyeshadow powder 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.040
 and a cream eye shadow so on 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.720
 the eyeshadow powder you have 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.900
 a total of 100% of ingredients 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.100
 of natural origin and of which 10% from 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.710
 biological agriculture 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.170
 you also have the ecocert label at 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.689
 back when you order just a 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.420
 recharge you receive it in a small 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.659
 cardboard like this one in which has for 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.520
 you have a plastic mafia or 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.770
 well lodge the refile so that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.570
 that she does not move and what she 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.920
 does not arrive completely intact in all 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920
 case until today I have not had 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.700
 of worries what I find 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.039
 especially intel 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.769
 and are beyond the economic aspect and 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.980
 ecological is that this recharge 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.470
 cost me only 6 euros 90 charges for 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.680
 conclude then I bought them 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.840
 on libé makes a store that used 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.090
 of them as relays also tell them I 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.400
 you will put the link I find that it's 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.319
 really very interesting at the level of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.519
 size biggest caps scam 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.000
 the public 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:37.739
 Brooklyn is still pretty big 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.989
 here the green it's cold drama fact 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.090
 three grams and also had the label 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.160
 cosmébio just behind and it's a 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.660
 product made in August she but I 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.160
 is still a lot of material and 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.190
 it's mostly a product that I find 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.049
 very well spiced I think he holds 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.360
 well is not powder often in the 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.069
 natural products fg it's a little bit 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.750
 powdery I find that really the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.640
 product is very good very interesting 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.130
 at the level of the lighthouses powder the smell is 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.709
 neutral meets new and makeup 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.040
 super cream and super smells I'm 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.510
 completely fan so they have two 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 ranges of fabre stone powder one 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.760
 maths and the other did crimes in all and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.769
 for all he must have a fortnight 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.389
 of colors that is not huge 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.100
 they are essentially colors 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.889
 neutral but at a very bright and 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.069
 very pretty except maybe a turquoise 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.049
 have surrounded these are neutral colors 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.549
 and so I presented to you what I 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.799
 so I have in math I farioli 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:40.650
 this is again quite in 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:44.480
 a magnitude that reached 205 that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.480
 would invent well spicy very intense 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.050
 I often use external corner I 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.820
 really who is good see just in 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.770
 passing from a comic once and that goes up 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:59.260
 it's happiness I've also achieved 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:05.830
 107 in pearly makeup which is after the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:11.220
 brown gray description it was pretty 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.220
 pale here 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.820
 and still in the anthem created I have the 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:28.509
 108 color is gray-green even 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.410
 quite pronounced is still very limited 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:34.350
 but really nothing to complain about 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.470
 because this color really this cry towards 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.660
 magnificent 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:43.660
 I take a lot and to finish a 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.979
 blush cream that is also natural 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.880
 therefore at 100% and at 20% of origin 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.130
 biological 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:59.759
 it's a word that's the color 253 that 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:02.699
 is still very pale we are not bad 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:04.360
 it is very sweet and very creamy 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:11.530
 really his engine 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:13.690
 I love it is here it would have neither very 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.050
 very nice for the cons for the cream 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.699
 my disappointment is that me when I have to 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.130
 make ambition clearly use 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.960
 the one who will hold his eyelid so 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.669
 in fact if the email is serious is not 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.710
 does not freeze so they require a 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.560
 banana below as a point so powder 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.599
 ordinary that said it's like a 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.710
 interesting product but the games I have 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.419
 still more attractive to 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.580
 headlights powder that I really find 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.380
 complete this is why I wanted 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.300
 you talk about it because finds that 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.490
 it's worth buying a product 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.500
 so without now because the art of 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.509
 nothing my daddy there are garbage etc 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.680
 still ecological approach it seems 

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.070
 the most ecological is nothing 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.449
 buy 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.550
 but well in this case I find when 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.199
 same as it's interesting obviously he 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.909
 must have a failure is maybe not 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.099
 the magnetic public acts or is 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.659
 build myself a pallet can be 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.280
 build a bunk for less 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.520
 no need to deposit it happens 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.349
 like that its metal in the 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.180
 meetic the donkey is a heavy metal in 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.129
 the palette and ethics is impeccable and 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.199
 plus this 100% natural chicken no 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.449
 had so I found that it deserves a 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.159
 little bit of talking about it it's true that I 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:14.970
 suffers a little hears talk and that's 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.830
 Too bad 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.449
 that's if you had the opportunity to 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.770
 test products from this range of 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.330
 lipsticks or whatever do not hesitate 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.370
 especially the blushes I would like 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.419
 know what it's worth and then here I am 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.419
 tell you very soon
