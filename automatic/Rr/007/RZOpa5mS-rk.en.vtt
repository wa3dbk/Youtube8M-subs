00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.750
 Hmm 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:10.230
 o 9 I guess I'll do it 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.230
 zone 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:20.100
 What are you thinking about? Summer comes up 0 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:24.210
 In fact, I have come that you want to listen to Kagetora's 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.539
 What is the story of basketball 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 Yes 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.039
 3 I'd such that at the time of the on-3 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.010
 The person whom I thought about is good 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:42.079
 I have a high probability of skipping myself 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.079
 Of course I know the reason It's simply because I am the easiest to pull out 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.850
 4 so yeah 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:58.100
 When it comes to the Winter Cup, the opponent is only one of the best schools 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:01:03.900
 If it is such a partner , I think that I will definitely miss me who is the team's weakness 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:09.140
 So I'd like to overcome the diagram for the winter cup 4 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.140
 I want to wear a defense roof that can not be overtaken by the man on 1 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:17.990
 That's a pretty difficult story 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:24.740
 But Nenda not mean there is no you matchless skill 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:31.659
 Hey basic one is Tsushika of Tteyuu attitude of when you make a full drive in basketball following 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.659
 Moreover , when you are moving forward with full power , the back is completely unprotected 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:45.460
 It is Kimo of this skill to aim there 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.460
 Of technologies that aim the ball with pinpoint almost to the water on it, but it needs considerable speed 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.220
 Even those who have sense 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.530
 Clearly, it may not be in time for the Windsor cup. 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.200
 Still 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.690
 Yeah either attempt subjected to this technique 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.850
 I'll do it 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:08.740
 I don't want to do anything in the winter cup 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:13.300
 I'm in an environment where there are so many basketball players 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.810
 I think it is a chance to learn oil slick sand rather 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.069
 Certainly I have to deal with those who are here 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.880
 I wonder if even faster for those 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:28.530
 4 was found born'll tell me Well then it 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:33.280
 It is a difficult skill to say many times but to master 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.580
 Even so, let's see it as a rooster by the winter cup 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.580
 Yes
