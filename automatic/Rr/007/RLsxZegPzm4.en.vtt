the concept that nature is intelligent
it<00:01:39.030> speaks<00:01:39.690> to<00:01:39.810> our<00:01:39.840> inadequacy<00:01:40.770> for

to<00:02:30.540> make<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.840> forest<00:02:31.380> resilient<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.459> stresses

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
to make the forest resilient to stresses

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.300 
to make the forest resilient to stresses
that<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.600> coming<00:02:33.989> up<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.590> not<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:34.980> looking

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
that are coming up so not just looking

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.310 
that are coming up so not just looking
at<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.610> fungi<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.239> plants<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.780> isolation

at the fungi and the plants in isolation

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.320
