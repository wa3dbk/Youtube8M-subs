00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.860
 I bring a new callplay gameplay 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.140
 duty black ops' and as I said we are in 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.050
 the map of iu since this map so 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.849
 curious that is the typical boat 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.689
 I have a ship if I have eight 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.250
 boats and the truth that we are in the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.489
 boat says that as you see is composed 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.230
 for a house another house and in the middle a lot 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.880
 people think of that to play well in 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.399
 this map must be controlled the 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.780
 part of the medium to control the part 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.730
 of the medium and the truth is that I do not know 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.949
 have to control the part of the house 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.780
 because because both in a house and the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.309
 another where the enemies appear not in 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.530
 the house but outside the house no'j of 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.910
 the ends of the map therefore I 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.559
 what do I do as you see at the beginning yes 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.879
 I move through the middle but shall bear the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.920
 that when the game progresses 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.690
 what I'm doing is controlling 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.399
 the house as you see in the middle I'm not going to 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.019
 to pass never I say right to not 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.999
 have to go through the middle but catch 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.790
 by the sides and others to try 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.110
 get to the other endorsement because good yo 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.909
 know that for example now we are here 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.850
 all the allies then I have to go 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.270
 to the other side now here as you see 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.290
 it's not a job with the m 12 16 shotgun 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.479
 because he has picked up a gun 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.299
 quiet that you will see what I do not do 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.070
 no low with that m 27 that he took from 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.780
 I just picked it up in case we 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 they came down here as you see me shooting for 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 finish because he had finished killing 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.310
 one and I say fukshima was coming for me and was coming 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.020
 for me or it came for me but for me 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.149
 good surprise and I like I have little to 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.979
 always the same I will put you here as 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.630
 you see always always always lame 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.149
 I always choose here, you have to have 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.680
 controlled that and I see that shot and such and 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.240
 I think they were also going to come for me 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.399
 but I know that they should that the one who had 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.140
 fired and others was my partner that 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.130
 they just killed not here I go back 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.750
 surcharge and as you see wore guardian agr 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.880
 and helicopter evidently the guardian 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.649
 It's not that I like it, it's not that I wear it 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 it's just because he did not have 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.210
 well I wanted to be a guardian challenge 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.710
 that everything no less something flat because the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.780
 streak that is costing me the most 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.009
 I challenge them because it's killing 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.479
 how many while you are giving them the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.920
 guardian to the face and such and clear I 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.260
 I put and the guardian and I leave I do not 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.120
 I'm already waiting to kill people that's a 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.069
 little to camp but not good and I already 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.870
 I'll get it out so good as you see I have the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.610
 shotgun is that as you see from him a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.690
 little bit long and medium 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.580
 distance in does not kill 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.070
 directly novice but that really 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.890
 It's a weapon that I find very funny and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.720
 you can even do to see is not the best 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.030
 Shotgun is obviously burst 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.850
 that for me the best street is 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.230
 very good turning but this shotgun 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.520
 it's really fun that's a 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.050
 comet that I did not know how to use it 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.330
 obviously but like the tri pulling 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.040
 of diamonds in the shotguns this is the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 last shotgun that I needed to take out 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.080
 of the area and as you can see at a short distance 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.900
 It is very good because of course they are strip 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.280
 rafa that has driven the gray r1 farc 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.500
 here I put another guardian that this 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.600
 guard that here is great and good 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.770
 here as you see this shotgun that the 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.890
 I always carry with laser sight 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.830
 long cannon and quick chargers vouchers 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.240
 well and well it was simply this not 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.740
 want to see a gameplay also with this 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.810
 complete a lot I've asked you to use with 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.850
 this complete says it is this weapon is 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.380
 the worst of the game and so on, no, no 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.300
 you think that weapon is the worst 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.460
 game and directly is not the best but 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.590
 I do not think it's the best in the 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.840
 worse it really looks like a pretty weapon 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.010
 good even with the one that has been taken out 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.530
 several games so if you want more 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.510
 games with that shotgun which is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.110
 the last the fourth because it does not give any 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.460
 problem 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.200
 from the truth that the game is 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.820
 very funny with shotguns I want here 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.430
 as you see as the soil remington 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.740
 that basically because I was left without 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.440
 ball I ran out of bullets and can catch 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.480
 the 27 I say good use better lamented that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.520
 although possibly going kill a little 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.290
 least at least the base gameplay 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.170
 whole shotgun not so he does not want 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.940
 use 97 wounds I just wanted to 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.710
 get me a gameplay with a shotgun and with 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.570
 the shotgun 2 but obviously if I 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.490
 I'm without bales of coco jeros otÃ¡lvaro 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.530
 so well wrong in the remington 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.030
 that I love and as you will see I am 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 controlling this house but I see that its 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.530
 responsible I see that he responds enemy 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.330
 change then I say mother of mine to see 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.190
 see how they make theirs towards the other 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.500
 side and this filter catches jumping beard 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.000
 game code chapita chavita badges and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.070
 I go back to take off the helicopter and the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.810
 agr I think it was the third time that I 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.200
 I took it out without dying here it comes from the turkey 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.700
 this I say has died that but here I was going to 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.200
 go there or should have gone up 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.530
 but evidently he had finished 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.030
 kill two under this subsoil and I 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.590
 they were going to kill here I read very well too 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.390
 I answer why I say he replies that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.800
 is changing and as you can see there is in him 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.360
 the minimum to change just the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.650
 respado here I'm lucky but also 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.290
 I have the luck as you see 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.810
 a clear balanti enemy I 'm 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.560
 pointing to the two I crossed that and I 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.720
 killed 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.910
 but good was a failure committed by 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.590
 blame the enemies here as you see 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.720
 I always do the same route I do not land 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.009
 go through there I just hint 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.570
 If there is nobody, I go to the side 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.220
 because if he answers he had to be there 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.199
 here as you can see I have the helicopter 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.280
 well the game is a game that to me 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:00.490
 I personally loved it is not a finished 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.470
 1 4242 I think it was that as you are 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.910
 only three times in all the gameplay so 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.440
 which is a pretty pretty game 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.850
 good to go with this weapon that like 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.530
 I say it's not the best but it's not the 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.620
 worse, I recommend that you try it more 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.180
 especially if you want to take the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.770
 diamond shotguns like I am 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.990
 trying and it's really costing me 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.680
 the same life get me this golden weapon 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.539
 not basically because I have to give 250 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.280
 low of a shot and clear kill of a 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.740
 shot with this shotgun you need 20 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.630
 shots to kill a 1 as it is 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.849
 complicated so I recommend you commit 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.860
 in extremes but well I really 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.599
 has taken out without playing is new because no 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.460
 I like extremes so good the 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.139
 gameplay is going to end because the mode 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.490
 cinema as always subway you have allende 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:41.590
 change the cinema and envelope mode 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.419
 I do not know what this map has that the monkey 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.190
 if you have a courage uncle because all the 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.199
 game that goes with that dad and not the 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.849
 recorded and are in movie mode after no 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.409
 they are recorded whole so as you will see 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.019
 I go here I say 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.089
 opaque this name stays here 

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.979
 caught and as you see I was going 38 points but 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:00.289
 good newbie a lot more I say is a 42 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.789
 of the final result so there are kids 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.759
 I hope you liked the gameplay with 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.499
 with this shotgun that on 12 16 I think 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.909
 that is called so good I hope that 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.860
 have liked law favorites and good 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.569
 airs because yesterday's gameplay that was 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.709
 with the to see the fourth machine gun 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.139
 light and the truth a pretty job 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:17.209
 well so nothing I hope you value and 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.129
 if you do not comply with this shotgun that is a 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:20.449
 bit weird so nothing like I say likes 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.129
 favorites and liked and do not form the 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.129
 next video to god
