that's ever been tested with the masses
and<00:02:17.819> now<00:02:18.480> every<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.680> look<00:02:20.430> at<00:02:20.609> each<00:02:21.030> call

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and now every time I look at each call

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.670 
and now every time I look at each call
of<00:02:21.629> duty<00:02:22.519> it's<00:02:23.519> never<00:02:23.999> been<00:02:24.269> tested<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.930> I

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
of duty it's never been tested and I

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.979 
of duty it's never been tested and I
know<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.459> bad<00:02:26.609> thing<00:02:26.670> because<00:02:27.290> one<00:02:28.290> um

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
know this is a bad thing because one um

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.470 
know this is a bad thing because one um
you<00:02:30.989> know<00:02:31.109> if<00:02:31.590> they<00:02:32.489> let<00:02:32.760> people<00:02:33.060> test<00:02:33.329> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
you know if they let people test the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.449 
you know if they let people test the
game<00:02:33.659> there<00:02:34.349> will<00:02:34.500> be<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> lot<00:02:34.859> of<00:02:35.010> people<00:02:35.129> that

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
game there will be a lot of people that

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.759 
game there will be a lot of people that
will<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.969> buy<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.420> game<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.349> just<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.590> way

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
will not buy the game it's just the way

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.830 
will not buy the game it's just the way
it<00:02:37.859> is<00:02:37.919> you<00:02:38.639> would<00:02:38.760> rather<00:02:38.909> sell<00:02:39.329> somebody<00:02:39.599> on

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
it is you would rather sell somebody on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.809 
it is you would rather sell somebody on
a<00:02:39.870> hype<00:02:40.169> of<00:02:40.439> the<00:02:40.650> name<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:41.159> purchase<00:02:41.489> your<00:02:41.519> game

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
a hype of the name to purchase your game

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.000 
a hype of the name to purchase your game
than<00:02:42.150> giving<00:02:42.359> them<00:02:42.629> a<00:02:42.659> beta<00:02:42.959> for<00:02:43.230> 30<00:02:43.439> days<00:02:43.650> and

then having to go back and fix
everything<00:02:46.579> which<00:02:47.579> they're<00:02:47.909> going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.389> have

everything which they're going to have
to<00:02:48.810> anyway<00:02:49.049> when<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> saw<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.620> thing<00:02:50.549> I<00:02:50.609> mean

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
to anyway when I saw the thing I mean

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.610 
to anyway when I saw the thing I mean
I'll<00:02:51.269> try<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.540> leave<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> at<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.109> end<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.469> this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
I'll try to leave it at the end of this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.629 
I'll try to leave it at the end of this
video<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:54.989> ridiculous<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.919> me<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.489> way

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
video it's just ridiculous to me the way

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.780 
video it's just ridiculous to me the way
I'm<00:02:56.790> looking<00:02:56.939> at<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.480> black<00:02:58.139> ops<00:02:58.349> 2<00:02:58.790> by

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
I'm looking at it is black ops 2 by

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.199 
I'm looking at it is black ops 2 by
January<00:03:00.359> 31st<00:03:00.930> based<00:03:01.829> on<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.519> combination<00:03:02.760> of

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
January 31st based on the combination of

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.959 
January 31st based on the combination of
pick<00:03:03.449> 10<00:03:03.719> and<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.620> score<00:03:04.949> system<00:03:05.159> will

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
pick 10 and the score system will

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.559 
pick 10 and the score system will
probably<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.799> same<00:03:08.040> parallel<00:03:08.639> to

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
probably be in the same parallel to

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.740 
probably be in the same parallel to
modern<00:03:10.379> warfare<00:03:10.620> 2<00:03:11.129> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.609> sense<00:03:11.939> that<00:03:12.120> you

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
modern warfare 2 in the sense that you

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.539 
modern warfare 2 in the sense that you
know<00:03:13.409> modern<00:03:13.739> warfare<00:03:13.980> 2<00:03:14.280> has<00:03:14.430> explosives<00:03:15.419> and

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
know modern warfare 2 has explosives and

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.460 
know modern warfare 2 has explosives and
dust<00:03:17.549> streaks<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.209> really<00:03:19.819> bad<00:03:20.819> stuffing<00:03:21.470> you

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
dust streaks and really bad stuffing you

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.960 
dust streaks and really bad stuffing you
know<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:23.060> detrimental<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.509> the<00:03:24.750> game<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
know that is detrimental to the game and

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.809 
know that is detrimental to the game and
I<00:03:26.970> think<00:03:27.509> that<00:03:27.750> without<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:29.040> testing<00:03:29.519> black

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
I think that without the testing black

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.569 
I think that without the testing black
ops<00:03:30.060> 2<00:03:30.359> with<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.379> pink<00:03:31.769> tent<00:03:31.979> system<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
ops 2 with the pink tent system and the

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.990 
ops 2 with the pink tent system and the
score<00:03:32.819> system<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.629> awareness<00:03:34.409> perd<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.040> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
score system and awareness perd and you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.460 
score system and awareness perd and you
know<00:03:36.090> putting<00:03:36.359> you<00:03:36.659> could<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:36.989> awareness

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
know putting you could take awareness

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.229 
know putting you could take awareness
perk<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.919> then<00:03:38.069> put<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.340> whatever<00:03:38.970> perk

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
perk and then put like whatever perk

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.990 
perk and then put like whatever perk
next<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.629> it<00:03:39.750> from<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.959> same<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:41.519> know<00:03:41.549> slot

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
next to it from the same you know slot

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.689 
next to it from the same you know slot
in<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.359> same<00:03:42.569> color<00:03:42.840> whatever<00:03:43.229> third<00:03:43.620> spot<00:03:43.919> so

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
in the same color whatever third spot so

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.030 
in the same color whatever third spot so
it's<00:03:44.849> messed<00:03:45.090> up<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:45.599> I<00:03:46.439> think<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.799> going<00:03:46.979> to

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
it's messed up and I think it's going to

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.969 
it's messed up and I think it's going to
get<00:03:47.189> exposed<00:03:47.729> really<00:03:48.449> fast<00:03:49.019> because<00:03:49.829> when<00:03:49.919> you

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
get exposed really fast because when you

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.559 
get exposed really fast because when you
got<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.129> masters<00:03:50.579> of<00:03:50.609> people<00:03:50.970> playing<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.359> game

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
got a masters of people playing the game

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.569 
got a masters of people playing the game
it's<00:03:52.229> really<00:03:52.680> gonna<00:03:52.799> get<00:03:52.949> exposed<00:03:53.340> pretty

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
it's really gonna get exposed pretty

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.929 
it's really gonna get exposed pretty
fast<00:03:53.819> but<00:03:53.939> i'll<00:03:54.120> try<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.419> leave<00:03:55.759> tactical<00:03:56.759> nuke

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:56.939 
fast but i'll try to leave tactical nuke

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:01.759 
fast but i'll try to leave tactical nuke
inbound<00:03:58.129> tactical<00:03:59.129> nuke<00:03:59.310> turn<00:03:59.609> the<00:03:59.759> key<00:04:00.769> look

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
inbound tactical nuke turn the key look

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.170 
inbound tactical nuke turn the key look
at<00:04:01.859> that<00:04:01.949> there<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.219> a<00:04:02.310> guitar<00:04:02.639> get<00:04:03.359> some<00:04:03.659> boom

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
at that there is a guitar get some boom

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.170 
at that there is a guitar get some boom
and<00:04:06.379> yeah<00:04:07.379> so<00:04:08.280> i<00:04:08.340> think<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.669> two

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and yeah so i think the two

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.059 
and yeah so i think the two
realistically<00:04:09.750> say<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.439> think<00:04:10.680> call<00:04:10.859> duty

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
realistically say I think call duty

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.159 
realistically say I think call duty
bottom<00:04:11.819> line<00:04:11.969> without<00:04:12.509> a<00:04:12.539> doubt<00:04:12.629> is<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.989> best

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
bottom line without a doubt is the best

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.899 
bottom line without a doubt is the best
call<00:04:13.349> of<00:04:13.439> duty<00:04:13.620> because<00:04:13.739> for<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.579> simple

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
call of duty because for the simple

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.610 
call of duty because for the simple
reason<00:04:14.939> in<00:04:15.269> hindsight<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:16.199> I<00:04:16.229> know<00:04:16.320> this

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
reason in hindsight now that I know this

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.229 
reason in hindsight now that I know this
is<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.219> only<00:04:17.280> game<00:04:17.519> it's<00:04:17.669> been<00:04:17.729> tested<00:04:18.000> for

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
is the only game it's been tested for

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.779 
is the only game it's been tested for
like<00:04:18.479> 30<00:04:18.719> days<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.799> had<00:04:20.070> corrections<00:04:20.579> made

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
like 30 days that had corrections made
