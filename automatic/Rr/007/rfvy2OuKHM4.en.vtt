00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:12.599
 Let's take a closer look at the Iglo maps and find important ones on the left 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.599
 Information the next two driving instructions 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.599
 certain freely selectable driving information 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.189
 Information on the quality of the GPS signal 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.829
 as well as current messages 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 who can shake light into the map they can adjust the presentation 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 they can turn the map view 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.560
 because the presentation but also tend 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.560
 Of course, the map can also be enlarged 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.170
 or reduced in size 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.300
 also 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.250

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.560
 oriented to the north 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.230
 or 3d 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 the route guidance is easy to understand 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.050
 Just follow the fall and the orange trail 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.170
 the Indus holding the names of the cross streets 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.880
 and, if you wish, even read the street names thanks to text-to-speech 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.130
 in 170 meters turn left and if you have missed an announcement 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.320
 Dennis Daube repeats them as often as they want 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.610
 the distances are updated every time in 20 meters they fly 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 turn left 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.470
 go straight 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.520
 Safety is very important at Iglo 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.950
 the lane assistant with Uli is his post rendering showing them on the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.520
 Highway the signs in real time a great help straight to heavy traffic 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.470
 nodes 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.270
 To facilitate navigation, the EU has an automatic 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.870
 Zoom function at intersections 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.609
 Moder roundabouts 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.299
 leave the highway 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.509
 when they turn 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.389
 Cen enlarges the map so that they recognize the driving maneuver accurately 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.389
 can 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.139
 does that mean the BI s signal in the 2 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:33.529
 only lost once 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 the route will still be simulated 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:45.989
 Another highlight are the realistic 3D terrain views the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.989
 even guide them through complex mountain landscapes 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.180
 in 500 meters how to live right for better orientation 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.700
 m supports the idea of ​​using larger cities 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.579
 three-dimensional building views 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.340
 so that they look at the red exactly over the building presentation 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.339
 transparent traffic points 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.209
 as soon as it gets dark outside, the display automatically switches on from day to day 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.579
 Night mode around 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 the colors are then adapted to the night situations

 they have reached their destination 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.649
 what information is available 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:33.869
 one available on the route 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.869
 this field has applied contemporary form 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.979
 but it also serves as a button leading to the "red" information 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.059
 Here you can see your current red including the waypoints 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.739
 and the currently selected route calculation method 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.469
 This panel guides you to the routes and ride data in real time 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.079
 are displayed 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.829
 here you can see the remaining distance of the fast driving time and arrival time 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.919
 a compass 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.919
 and a speedometer for the current speed 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.039
 The ride computer provides them with a compilation of the main dad 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.039
 had 

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:26.249
 for example, their average speed 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.990
 and the real driving time 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.630
 In this menu you can select up to three information on the 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.629
 Navigate will be displayed

 You can also switch to another playback mode, for example 

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:51.610
 Listening to the radio or CD for navigation announcements, the volume of the 

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:56.319
 then another source then automatically reduced in 20 meters turn right 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:57.400
 from 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.819
