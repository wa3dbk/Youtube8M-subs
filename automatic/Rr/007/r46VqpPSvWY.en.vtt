00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.799 
Ninja Turtle mystery box openings I went
ahead<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.490> picked<00:00:08.610> up<00:00:08.820> two<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.179> these<00:00:09.300> they

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
let's have to see how I do let's go

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.369 
let's have to see how I do let's go
ahead<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.520> open<00:00:44.670> these<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.379> what

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
ahead and open these up and see how what

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.260 
ahead and open these up and see how what
I<00:00:49.410> get<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.600> most<00:00:51.780> common<00:00:52.110> figure<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
I get I think the most common figure is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.770 
I get I think the most common figure is
the<00:00:55.340> foot<00:00:56.340> soldier<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.000> think<00:00:57.270> he's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> most

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the foot soldier I think he's the most

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.979 
the foot soldier I think he's the most
common<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.370> will<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.850> happy<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.480> long<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.750> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
common so I will be happy as long as I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.889 
common so I will be happy as long as I
don't<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.530> two<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.280> same<00:01:02.670> figure<00:01:03.600> that's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
don't get two of the same figure that's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.859 
don't get two of the same figure that's
my<00:01:04.589> only<00:01:04.860> goal<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.580> these<00:01:05.820> cousins<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
