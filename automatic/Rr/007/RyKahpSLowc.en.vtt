00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello everyone because 1054 for a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.000
 new series of videos on my channel 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.859
 youtube and we will be interested for this 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 new series at no life 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.570
 but be careful not just any nolife 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.519
 those who are present on the xbox one 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 because I noticed there was a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.750
 unusual novelty on this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 console compared to the 360 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.900
 well when you have on the profile 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.779
 a player 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.570
 and well you can find out how many 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.670
 time he played at his console and how much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 of time he played these games xbox one 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 which can be very interesting if 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 you want to compare your successes with 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 other players if you want you 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.290
 have managed to get more success 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.969
 quickly than other players or if 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.500
 you play online and you 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.600
 do not manage to beat some 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.460
 opponents but you realize that 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.510
 these people played ten times more 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.520
 long or same games 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.780
 inevitably you will have more trouble to them 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.699
 beat since they are more training 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.070
 for this first episode we're going 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.199
 observe in detail the players or rather 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.600
 no life because when you go 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.059
 notice the number of hours they have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.830
 spent on the game this first video 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.270
 that is, there is one who is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.770
 well you will be afraid and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.409
 by the way I had this idea of series 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.570
 when I started to compare my 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.310
 number of hours playing quillan instinct 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 than in relation to the champion or 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.729
 players or I can not even get to them 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 stand up 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.340
 when I confront them online like this 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.229
 when I if I tell myself that me with my 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.909
 number of hours if the opponent world 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.920
 play 10 times have twenty times more 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.240
 for a long time that I say to myself it's normal 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.890
 I can not beat him I'm not 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.270
 quite driven in relation to him on 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.710
 quillan instinct that to find out which 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.689
 are the players who played the most 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.090
 a long time at this game and well it's good 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.659
 simple it was enough for me just to go on 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.640
 league standings and watch 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.130
 who are the people who have the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.479
 more victories and so look 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.649
 who are the people who have the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.960
 more played online 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.070
 it is true that what I think there is 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.829
 other players who played more 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.659
 long time at this game offline but I 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.180
 doubt strongly because the most 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.740
 often the players on whom we have 5 or 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.990
 moreover especially the fighting games 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.229
 play much longer online 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.740
 rather than solo if he wants to tweak 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.410
 their technique and 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.150
 and discover new opponents 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.730
 because we can not play 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.130
 thousands of hours offline still at 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.110
 same opponent if this same game offers 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.700
 an online mode you can face 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.860
 anyone in the world 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.900
 to give you an idea I played at this 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.360
 play over seventy seven hours this 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.720
 which is a very small score was all 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.770
 let's start this top 5 with the 5th 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.450
 position for the player shadow nikos who 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.700
 she played in everything acquired with the instincts 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:47.210
 that 2472 hours what is maddening is 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.390
 more than my time spent on f0x where i 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.280
 had to spend more than 1000 hours 2472 years 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.680
 but it's amazing like time 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.860
 of play and we can notice by doing 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.410
 a brief little case calculates the furrow itself 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.210
 basis compared to the release date of the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.980
 game if we say that all players 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.740
 present in this top plays the game since 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.430
 the beginning the game was released 6 years ago 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.130
 days pretty much and well if we do a 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.830
 brief calculation this player shadow nikos has 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.220
 spent an average of 4 hours + 7 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.110
 minutes a day playing this game ebadi 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.450
 which down after if he has a job and who 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.820
 decides and who decides to play that at this 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.160
 game eh ben he has plenty of time to 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.670
 play enough to this game since the date of 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.430
 his exit 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.960
 and if we look at it a bit 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.640
 gamertag at this shadow nikos 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.100
 we can notice that it's a big 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.260
 fifa player he spent more than 300 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.730
 hours on fifa 14 as well as on fifa 15 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.350
 but it's true there is not that he 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.480
 installs in life the fourth plus 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.690
 big nolife of that there is one who is 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.200
 other than I'm going to his nickname is enough 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.610
 complex 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.020
 cmc 888 case y 4 life so it must be said 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.650
 that they instinct them for life 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.040
 this person has spent 24 hours more 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.720
 that shadow nikos so 2496 hours to 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.390
 play this game which gives us a 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.730
 average of 4 hours + 9 minutes per 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.730
 against if we compare with with shadow 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.290
 nikos this person only plays killer 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.240
 instinct cost as we can see on 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.190
 gamers score is pretty poor 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.690
 the third place of this top with still 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.620
 once a nickname to bite me do not 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.220
 expats at robin hawks who did a 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.870
 total of 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.240
 2745 hours on quillan hastingues for 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.770
 an average of 4 hours and 35 minutes 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.890
 since the day of its release 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.930
 if it turns out that person has played 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.240
 in the game since the day of its release 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.580
 you imagine the average time 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.080
 would be much higher if this 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.250
 person bought began to play 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.980
 this game for a year 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.020
 no we can notice that this person 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.480
 is also a big mortal player 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.640
 kombat 10 with over 300 hours which 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.050
 is limit ten times less than he 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.720
 still worried but hey if we can 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.920
 compare mortal kombat 10 is out there 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.470
 is not that long ago if we 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.840
 compare to quillan instinct case after he 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.120
 makes sense to see some 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.920
 kira instinct players having having 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.170
 played a lot of other fighting games 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.870
 the second place of this top is for 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.169
 my charlie boy nothing to see that mr 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.360
 but a pure math class is born with 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.360
 2850 two hours on the counter on killer 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.450
 instinct an average of 4 hours + 45 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.890
 minutes since the day of its release 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.110
 it starts to do a little too much I 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.669
 find it's unfortunately here I do not know if 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.070
 you agree with me but go 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.830
 as many hours a year, one and the same 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.840
 play his no life limits 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.060
 after maybe I'm wrong but 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.470
 it is she is a personal opinion but 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.440
 to spend as many hours on a single 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.090
 game must go and meyer only plays 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.700
 this game looking at his gamerscore 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.090
 now the first place that is the 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.660
 biggest nolife in the world to play at this 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.810
 game and what is actually magical pyotr 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.260
 who spent almost 3000 hours playing this game 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.570
 more exactly of 1965 hours on 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.690
 quillan average instinct of 4 hours + 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.470
 56 minutes limit five hours a day to 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.360
 play this game every day nonstop 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.310
 and against it is also a big 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.140
 destiny player since he has passed 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.410
 also over 1000 hours on 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.990
 destiny and 450 hours on call of duty 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.419
 ghost so we can say that this taster 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.340
 magic is limited to live gronau the 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.870
 xbox vonn by the way it can be one and 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.930
 two videos that are the biggest 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.480
 nolife of this console so here I have 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.310
 could you quote 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.060
 and five people who spent the most 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.770
 time on this this game after I you 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.960
 recalls that I based myself on the 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.380
 online ranking 2 that there is one left 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.820
 case maybe there are crazy fools that 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.490
 the people I quoted you on 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.200
 this top after bah if you find more 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.300
 furious you put the month to 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.590
 comments the link of or rather the 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.170
 this person's nickname 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:58.760
 it would do me that I would be even more 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:01.320
 amazed at the madness of some players at 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.510
 adulate what is left a case but good 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.720
 it's an excellent game of 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.580
 fight frankly a huge game of 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.220
 fight here I hope that this little 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.590
 video will have pleased you game I already have my 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.980
 little idea for the next game of the no 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.210
 life of the xbox one and I do not know when 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.460
 is what I do hope 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.620
 this new series you liked and will 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.980

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.980
