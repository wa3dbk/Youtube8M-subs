00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
finishing by his Latin Ibrahimovic as

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
finishing by his Latin Ibrahimovic as
he's<00:01:51.930> able<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> smash<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> bottom

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
he's able to smash it into the bottom

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
he's able to smash it into the bottom
corner<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:54.149> he<00:01:54.210> doesn't<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.810> too<00:01:55.020> much<00:01:55.170> pace

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
corner now he doesn't have too much pace

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
corner now he doesn't have too much pace
it's<00:01:55.680> only<00:01:55.920> 78<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.030> doesn't<00:01:57.360> really

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's only 78 but that doesn't really

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
it's only 78 but that doesn't really
matter<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.409> there<00:01:58.560> he<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.860> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
matter as you can see there he can just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.469 
matter as you can see there he can just
hit<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> ball<00:01:59.490> first<00:01:59.790> time<00:02:00.090> without<00:02:00.270> even

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
hit the ball first time without even

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.450 
hit the ball first time without even
having<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.719> move<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.500> other<00:02:01.680> times<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.250> his

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
having to move but other times like his

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
having to move but other times like his
strength<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.119> seems<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.390> push<00:02:03.600> players<00:02:03.869> off

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
strength just seems to push players off

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.480 
strength just seems to push players off
him<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.770> means<00:02:04.950> he<00:02:05.070> doesn't<00:02:05.189> require

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
him and that means he doesn't require

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.130 
him and that means he doesn't require
the<00:02:05.820> pace<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.149> get<00:02:06.270> away<00:02:06.450> but<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the pace to get away but this is the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.719 
the pace to get away but this is the
goal<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.160> best<00:02:08.340> goals<00:02:08.550> I've

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
outside of the box but here's some more

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.500 
outside of the box but here's some more
headers<00:02:38.040> as<00:02:38.160> well<00:02:38.340> as<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.880> said<00:02:39.090> there's<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.330> lot

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
headers as well as I said there's a lot

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.150 
headers as well as I said there's a lot
of<00:02:39.540> headers<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.560> with<00:02:40.800> him<00:02:40.980> and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
of headers that do go on with him and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.030 
of headers that do go on with him and
that's<00:02:41.670> great<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.030> gives<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.510> even<00:02:42.660> more

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
that's great it gives you even more

one<00:02:46.470> problem<00:02:46.710> with<00:02:47.010> him<00:02:47.250> which<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.180> forgot<00:02:48.480> to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
one problem with him which I forgot to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
one problem with him which I forgot to
mention<00:02:48.630> earlier<00:02:48.960> is<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.230> both<00:02:49.590> his<00:02:49.800> work

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
mention earlier is that both his work

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
mention earlier is that both his work
rates<00:02:50.880> are<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.240> fact<00:02:51.420> Lohse<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:52.020> means<00:02:52.170> he

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
rates are in fact Lohse that means he

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.020 
rates are in fact Lohse that means he
won't<00:02:52.410> really<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.830> back<00:02:53.010> too<00:02:53.250> often<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.820> he
