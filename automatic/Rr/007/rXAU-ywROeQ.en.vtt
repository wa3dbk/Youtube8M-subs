00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.010
 common with it 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.940
 That makes it very difficult for you to have difficulties when developing your 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.640
 Socially, work with the youngest focuses on the resolution of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.130
 conflicts and cooperation and is developed through recreational activities 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.429

 serious problem statement 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.580
 I wanted to know what they think 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.660
 we are going to dump in this activity 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.600

 enrique in the workshops 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.180
 these children feel like fish in running water to get to this 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.559
 situation has not been so easy 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.869
 nowadays it is customary that the issue of high capacity in person be 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.629
 child or teenager 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.900
 It is not a question of how it should be done because there is a great 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.430
 really ignorance of what we also do not try from here to make a 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.919
 little of social conscience what that concept does not remain there as they are 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.540
 over all because we can children who are doomed to failure 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.649
 school if they do not have an intervention measure 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:14.369
 the experts insist that these children are different and both parents 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.369
 as teachers have to learn to meet their needs 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.569
 it's like going with a little lawyer 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.229
 everything is discussed 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.019
 all of 100 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.889
 to the point that even how to put on shoes stick to be 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.249
 discussion at home 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.329
 so much fish that having the rules very clear 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.989
 since having the compensations and negatives my works very well as with 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.249
 a positive stimulus I will sell negative pd there will be very clear rules and we will limit 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:43.159
 its moment 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.179
 I need 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.229
 while their children are in the workshops and the parents share 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:49.940
 experiences that what also serves as therapy 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.940
 and they help them with a long task of educating a child with these characteristics 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.430
 min on the side of father 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.019
 of the gifted child 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.870
 there are many times that we do not find a problem you can type what the 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.949
 child feels they question anything that goes cc 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.139
 henos the child easy to convince 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.989
 There are times that it's good that you have to be at an academic level 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.989
 they demand and that you can not always be or not 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.379
 percent and in the school plane can also many do not we find with 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:24.089
 problems of the kind the misfit child boy that the cousins ​​call of 

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:25.020
 phone 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.190
 saying that it is the behavior that has a behavior of the last 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.279
 class 

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:34.299
 nor and simply all this is given because they are not taking care of that 

00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:36.120
 need that they have 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.199
 In some centers, alternative measures are already being taken to make 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.979
 say to pass the cars or higher 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.279
 diaz eleven days without winning the flag blanket area in france 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.319
 so much 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.090
 if you access the area with worked in a father monument 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.870
 then adn to a delivery 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.689
 with the state 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:00.319
 swollen 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.089
 general entrance brown a new era in which they were conceived much in that 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:10.949
 but how can we detect if a normally gifted child these kids from 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.989
 they go to the year or before the year and do not see it 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.270
 if what happen directly to walk 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.199
 another of the things that you do that speak ahead of normal 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.159
 and do not hesitate 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.319
 if they did not want to speak in word 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.759
 for words not 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.919
 a lot of it they learn to read 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.789
 just flying directions of the afternoon the question of the felling of the 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:34.539
 parents 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.180
 the ground certainty although almost all children ask why these are 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.809
 excessively because 

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:42.510
 not to the why of things 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.590
 and at a certain age and normal thing in him 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.870
 what happened of this gravity 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.960
 raise the limits 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.530
 not because the star does not fall to where it reaches the universe because we 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.509
 we die 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.240
 If these symptoms are detected, a psychological evaluation must be requested 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.719
 to clarify whether the child gifted or not 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.379
 I will go that the evolution right now is much more complicated than it is 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.469
 30 years ago, for example, not before, only the quotient was sought 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:15.479
 interacting there tree block that detect in the student what would be the 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:16.570
 creativity 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.190
 a high creativity is asked for a high involvement in the task eye or 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.630
 motivation and a 6 above or equal facing 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.759
 all this within this year in accordance with the raised in that I could 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.249
 having 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:31.189
 capabilities 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:32.439
 the product 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:37.580
 and since last week of the house hand saying that I should have effect ma 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.160
 the z start the test undid the mess 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.710
 because normally the majority of the target class were translated as 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.719
 technology or computer usually not boring and start to passarella 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.479
 why not 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.439
 liver to the approval of the final something about who got bored is 

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.409
 studying the content with his brother 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.500
 from there between 2 and 5 and 5 percent of children with the life of 

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:04.529
 single baghdad there are very few people living in dignity 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.969
 there is talk of a 0 7 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:10.330
 of identifier as a high capacity student 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.479
 there the myth that if a child gifted because he needs help and that 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.889
 I was against these school kids 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.479
 the learning acquired in these workshops and then integrate into their 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.180
 daily classes in addition 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.509
 so they discover that they are not alone 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.860
 given out in acting with the employers do so in cantarrana 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.949
 will be responsible for adapting this 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.099
 work a lot through the debate through the story it 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:42.509
 motivations fell can be useful to connect what is the work that 

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:43.839
 we want to do 

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:46.839
 with the world of their experiences we try to avoid too 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.930
 The visit was not even that many suffer from the gap they have between the 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.439
 intellectual level and the emotional level that is why supplying a little bit 

00:07:57.439 --> 00:08:01.339
 the association of gifted people of Cádiz works throughout the year so that 

00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:03.400
 disability is not a problem 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.620
 without an academic advantage and for these children to feel happy and 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.479
 social integration
