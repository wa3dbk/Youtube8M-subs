long time another thing I'd like to
point<00:00:41.970> out<00:00:42.269> is<00:00:42.479> that<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.079> no<00:00:43.290> point<00:00:43.530> we

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
point out is that there is no point we

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.700 
point out is that there is no point we
take<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.180> normally<00:00:45.690> 90<00:00:46.140> degree<00:00:46.440> point

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
take the the normally 90 degree point

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.009 
take the the normally 90 degree point
that's<00:00:46.979> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.159> corners<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.670> round<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
that's on the corners and round it so

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.450 
that's on the corners and round it so

this makes it more comfortable when you
hold<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.780> finally<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.460> phosphor

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
hold it and finally we use phosphor

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.270 
hold it and finally we use phosphor

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
used over a hundred years is soft it'll

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.749 
used over a hundred years is soft it'll
go<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.630> tune<00:01:06.810> quicker<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.429> do<00:01:08.550> some

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
go out of tune quicker if you do some

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.969 
go out of tune quicker if you do some
research<00:01:09.149> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> internet<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.590> find

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
research on the internet you can find

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.290 
research on the internet you can find
out<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.340> phosphor<00:01:11.820> bronze

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
out that phosphor bronze

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.870 
out that phosphor bronze
is<00:01:12.360> more<00:01:12.899> resilient<00:01:13.470> than<00:01:13.530> brass<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.429> holds<00:01:14.759> up

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is more resilient than brass it holds up

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
is more resilient than brass it holds up
longer<00:01:15.270> stays<00:01:15.539> and<00:01:15.750> too<00:01:15.869> longer<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.440> it<00:01:17.190> bends

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
longer stays and too longer and it bends

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.210 
longer stays and too longer and it bends
easier<00:01:18.179> so<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.170> bending<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.679> something<00:01:20.039> that<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
easier so in bending is something that a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
easier so in bending is something that a
lot<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.399> blues<00:01:20.700> players<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> be
