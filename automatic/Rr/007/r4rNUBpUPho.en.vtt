you<00:00:33.610> very<00:00:33.820> much<00:00:33.999> for<00:00:34.030> joining<00:00:34.359> us<00:00:34.510> first<00:00:34.780> of

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
you very much for joining us first of

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.660 
you very much for joining us first of
all<00:00:34.929> let's<00:00:35.079> talk<00:00:35.140> about<00:00:35.409> what<00:00:35.920> supercritical

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
all let's talk about what supercritical

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.319 
all let's talk about what supercritical
water<00:00:36.969> actually<00:00:37.329> is<00:00:38.909> uh<00:00:39.909> yeah<00:00:40.480> hi<00:00:42.089> let<00:00:43.089> me<00:00:43.179> just

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
water actually is uh yeah hi let me just

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.779 
water actually is uh yeah hi let me just
uh<00:00:43.539> first<00:00:44.260> start<00:00:44.499> with<00:00:44.679> maybe<00:00:45.190> somewhat<00:00:45.609> of<00:00:45.699> an

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
uh first start with maybe somewhat of an

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.860 
uh first start with maybe somewhat of an
unsatisfying<00:00:46.420> answer<00:00:46.719> but<00:00:47.199> simple<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.789> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
unsatisfying answer but simple and that

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.619 
unsatisfying answer but simple and that
supercritical<00:00:49.870> water<00:00:50.140> is<00:00:50.699> simply<00:00:51.699> water

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
supercritical water is simply water

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.629 
supercritical water is simply water
that's<00:00:52.870> taking<00:00:53.229> past<00:00:53.469> it's<00:00:53.769> a<00:00:53.859> critical<00:00:54.489> point

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:54.639 
that's taking past it's a critical point

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.729 
that's taking past it's a critical point
and<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.300> for<00:00:55.539> water<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.929> critical<00:00:56.289> point<00:00:56.499> is

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
and and for water the critical point is

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.419 
and and for water the critical point is
374<00:00:57.729> degrees<00:00:58.089> Celsius<00:00:58.569> or<00:00:59.190> seven<00:01:00.190> hundred<00:01:00.399> and

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
374 degrees Celsius or seven hundred and

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.029 
374 degrees Celsius or seven hundred and
five<00:01:00.519> degrees<00:01:00.909> Fahrenheit<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
five degrees Fahrenheit and it's

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.440 
five degrees Fahrenheit and it's
pressure<00:01:03.429> is<00:01:04.770> 218<00:01:05.770> atmosphere<00:01:06.370> which<00:01:07.330> would

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
pressure is 218 atmosphere which would

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.580 
pressure is 218 atmosphere which would
be<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.990> little<00:01:08.350> over<00:01:08.640> 3,000<00:01:09.690> psi<00:01:10.690> absolute<00:01:11.290> so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
be a little over 3,000 psi absolute so

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.700 
be a little over 3,000 psi absolute so
so<00:01:12.220> that's<00:01:12.400> supercritical<00:01:12.880> water<00:01:13.560> when<00:01:14.560> it's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
so that's supercritical water when it's

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.970 
so that's supercritical water when it's
taken<00:01:14.980> past<00:01:15.220> its<00:01:17.310> critical<00:01:18.310> point<00:01:18.520> and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 
taken past its critical point and

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.170 
taken past its critical point and
probably<00:01:20.980> to<00:01:21.700> give<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.910> a<00:01:21.940> little<00:01:21.970> more

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
probably to give you a little more

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.230 
probably to give you a little more
insight<00:01:22.570> into<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.080> experiment<00:01:23.440> itself<00:01:24.240> might

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
insight into the experiment itself might

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.470 
insight into the experiment itself might
be<00:01:25.420> good<00:01:25.570> if<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.930> if<00:01:26.320> I<00:01:26.440> created<00:01:26.770> a<00:01:26.920> visual<00:01:27.480> if

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
be good if I if I created a visual if

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.390 
be good if I if I created a visual if
you<00:01:28.750> could<00:01:28.870> imagine<00:01:29.080> taking<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.800> pot<00:01:30.070> of<00:01:30.100> water

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
you could imagine taking a pot of water

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.560 
you could imagine taking a pot of water
and<00:01:30.870> we<00:01:31.870> put<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:33.700> fill<00:01:33.910> that<00:01:33.940> pot<00:01:34.450> of

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
and we put that we fill that pot of

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.220 
and we put that we fill that pot of
water<00:01:34.750> with<00:01:35.080> maybe<00:01:35.830> about<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.900> quarter<00:01:37.900> full

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
water with maybe about a quarter full

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.510 
water with maybe about a quarter full
and<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:40.540> end<00:01:41.260> we<00:01:41.470> put<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> lid<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.400> we

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and the end we put a lid on it and we

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.150 
and the end we put a lid on it and we
are<00:01:42.790> heated<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.510> up<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.710> pressure<00:01:44.920> would

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
are heated it up the pressure would

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.590 
are heated it up the pressure would
build<00:01:45.400> up<00:01:45.670> and<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:45.970> pressure<00:01:46.210> would<00:01:46.420> not

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
build up and the pressure would not

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.240 
build up and the pressure would not
build<00:01:46.780> up<00:01:47.020> as<00:01:47.230> fast<00:01:47.500> as<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.800> temperature

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
build up as fast as the temperature

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.340 
build up as fast as the temperature
would<00:01:48.400> it<00:01:48.580> eventually<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.150> develop<00:01:49.630> a<00:01:49.780> vapor

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
would it eventually you develop a vapor

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.850 
would it eventually you develop a vapor
which<00:01:51.130> would<00:01:51.310> then<00:01:51.430> turn<00:01:52.120> to<00:01:52.480> a<00:01:52.510> gas<00:01:53.380> once<00:01:53.740> you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
which would then turn to a gas once you

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.360 
which would then turn to a gas once you
pass<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.390> critical<00:01:55.390> point<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:56.220> then<00:01:57.220> when

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
pass the critical point and then when

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.760 
pass the critical point and then when
you<00:01:57.490> compress<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.000> gas<00:01:58.450> further<00:01:58.900> it<00:01:59.530> would

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
you compress that gas further it would

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.730 
you compress that gas further it would
go<00:02:00.610> into<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.970> supercritical<00:02:01.420> range<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.380> we

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
go into the supercritical range and we

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.260 
go into the supercritical range and we
we<00:02:03.100> have<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.370> same<00:02:03.580> thing<00:02:03.610> on<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.090> other<00:02:04.120> side

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
we have the same thing on the other side

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.130 
we have the same thing on the other side
if<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.780> filled<00:02:05.080> out<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.380> pot<00:02:05.560> with<00:02:06.900> let's<00:02:07.900> say

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
if we filled out the pot with let's say

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.180 
if we filled out the pot with let's say
fifty<00:02:09.099> percent<00:02:09.459> water<00:02:09.789> then<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.950> would

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
fifty percent water then you would

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.120 
fifty percent water then you would
increase<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.810> heated<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.740> up<00:02:15.860> and

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
increase the you heated it up and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.070 
increase the you heated it up and
increase<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.700> pressure<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.780> pressure

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
increase the pressure the the pressure

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.190 
increase the pressure the the pressure
would<00:02:18.410> build<00:02:19.040> up<00:02:19.270> eventually<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.780> pot<00:02:20.990> would

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
would build up eventually the pot would

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280 
would build up eventually the pot would
fill<00:02:21.440> with<00:02:21.650> water<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.960> because<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.110> pressure

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
fill with water and because the pressure

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.020 
fill with water and because the pressure
would<00:02:24.530> condense<00:02:24.860> whatever<00:02:25.280> vapor<00:02:25.580> was<00:02:25.880> in

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
would condense whatever vapor was in

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.750 
would condense whatever vapor was in
there<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.320> would<00:02:27.500> then<00:02:27.710> cross<00:02:28.340> over<00:02:28.730> into

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
there and you would then cross over into

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.020 
there and you would then cross over into
the<00:02:29.090> supercritical<00:02:29.630> range<00:02:30.190> but<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.850> problem

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
the supercritical range but the problem

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.370 
the supercritical range but the problem
with<00:02:32.300> that<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.870> really<00:02:33.080> wouldn't<00:02:33.290> be

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
with that is that you really wouldn't be

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.440 
with that is that you really wouldn't be
able<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.590> see<00:02:33.890> exactly<00:02:34.100> when<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:35.030> crossed

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
able to see exactly when you crossed

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.980 
able to see exactly when you crossed
over<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.170> supercritical<00:02:37.240> regime<00:02:38.240> because

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
over to the supercritical regime because

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.470 
over to the supercritical regime because
the<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:42.080> pot<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.190> those<00:02:43.340> instances<00:02:44.030> would<00:02:44.270> be

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the the pot and those instances would be

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.900 
the the pot and those instances would be
filled<00:02:45.230> either<00:02:45.860> completely<00:02:46.280> with<00:02:46.490> vapor<00:02:46.700> or

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
filled either completely with vapor or

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.630 
filled either completely with vapor or
completely<00:02:47.480> with<00:02:47.810> liquid<00:02:48.800> just<00:02:49.010> because<00:02:49.370> of

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
completely with liquid just because of

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.820 
completely with liquid just because of

the nature of where we are where we

the nature of where we are where we

we<00:02:55.220> try<00:02:55.460> to<00:02:55.490> do<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:56.030> we<00:02:56.210> try<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.630> maintain<00:02:57.620> the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
throughout the heat up period so as

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.230 
throughout the heat up period so as
we're<00:03:04.040> heating<00:03:04.310> up<00:03:04.580> this<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.510> pot<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.930> water

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
we're heating up this this pot of water

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.450 
we're heating up this this pot of water
we<00:03:09.070> actually<00:03:10.070> have<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.560> two<00:03:12.560> phases<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.070> vapor

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
we actually have to two phases of vapor

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.250 
we actually have to two phases of vapor
phase<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.330> liquid<00:03:14.360> phase<00:03:14.900> all<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.140> way

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
phase and the liquid phase all the way

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.780 
phase and the liquid phase all the way
up<00:03:15.440> through<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.950> critical<00:03:16.310> point<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.700> in

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
up through the critical point and in

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.820 
up through the critical point and in
order<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.090> do<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.360> you<00:03:17.420> have<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.690> fill<00:03:18.050> this

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
order to do that you have to fill this

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.390 
order to do that you have to fill this
pot<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.820> water<00:03:20.000> with<00:03:20.350> exactly<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.739> proper

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
pot of water with exactly the proper

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.140 
pot of water with exactly the proper
amount<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.360> vapor<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.989> liquid<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:25.970> that's

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
amount of vapor and liquid and so that's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.900 
amount of vapor and liquid and so that's
roughly<00:03:26.870> about<00:03:27.130> one-third<00:03:28.130> liquid<00:03:28.610> and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
roughly about one-third liquid and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.140 
roughly about one-third liquid and
two-thirds<00:03:29.600> paper<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.430> at<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.580> point<00:03:31.880> then

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
two-thirds paper and at that point then

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.460 
two-thirds paper and at that point then
you<00:03:32.180> cross<00:03:32.510> right<00:03:32.840> through<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.110> critical

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
you cross right through the critical

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.930 
you cross right through the critical
point<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:33.980> can<00:03:34.160> actually<00:03:34.520> visually

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
point and you can actually visually

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.520 
point and you can actually visually
determine<00:03:35.480> when<00:03:35.630> you<00:03:35.750> get<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.170> critical

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
determine when you get to the critical

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.110 
determine when you get to the critical
point<00:03:36.790> by<00:03:37.790> looking<00:03:38.150> at<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:39.940> disappearance<00:03:40.940> of

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
point by looking at the disappearance of

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.750 
point by looking at the disappearance of
the<00:03:41.440> separation<00:03:42.440> between<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.920> vapor<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.670> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the separation between the vapor and the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.870 
the separation between the vapor and the
liquid<00:03:44.180> which<00:03:44.870> should<00:03:45.019> be<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.320> meniscus<00:03:46.070> so

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
liquid which should be the meniscus so

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.479 
liquid which should be the meniscus so
that<00:03:47.420> in<00:03:47.630> essence<00:03:48.530> is<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.769> experiment<00:03:49.340> that

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
that in essence is the experiment that

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.340 
that in essence is the experiment that
was<00:03:49.610> performed<00:03:49.970> about<00:03:50.300> four<00:03:50.540> years<00:03:50.720> ago<00:03:51.019> by

that in solution and we then heat it up
we<00:04:12.709> then<00:04:13.430> look<00:04:13.730> at<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:14.450> then<00:04:14.630> cross<00:04:14.870> the

we then look at we then cross the
critical<00:04:15.440> point<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:15.920> we're<00:04:16.070> looking<00:04:16.280> at<00:04:16.580> when

this critical point shizz because our
critical<00:04:19.070> point<00:04:19.250> will<00:04:19.400> changed<00:04:19.790> a<00:04:19.850> little<00:04:19.940> bit

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
critical point will changed a little bit

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.630 
critical point will changed a little bit
because<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:20.959> presence<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:22.400> salt

and the water so that in essence in a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
and the water so that in essence in a
nutshell<00:04:25.729> is<00:04:26.150> the

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
nutshell is the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.800 
nutshell is the
experiment<00:04:27.080> that<00:04:27.200> we're<00:04:27.350> performing<00:04:28.810> okay

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
experiment that we're performing okay

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.290 
experiment that we're performing okay
let's<00:04:29.990> talk<00:04:30.050> about<00:04:30.200> real-world<00:04:31.300> applications

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
let's talk about real-world applications

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.060 
let's talk about real-world applications
for<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.840> way<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:32.960> understand<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:33.680> that

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
for this the way I understand it is that

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.620 
for this the way I understand it is that
there's<00:04:34.520> actually<00:04:34.610> some<00:04:34.940> cities<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.540> some

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
there's actually some cities and some

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.450 
there's actually some cities and some
also<00:04:35.960> some<00:04:36.350> navy<00:04:36.740> ships<00:04:37.040> that<00:04:37.130> are<00:04:37.220> kind<00:04:37.400> of

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
also some navy ships that are kind of

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.020 
also some navy ships that are kind of
using<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.900> supercritical<00:04:39.320> water<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:40.040> sort<00:04:40.940> of

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
using the supercritical water to sort of

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.240 
using the supercritical water to sort of
you<00:04:41.270> know<00:04:41.360> clean<00:04:41.720> waste<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:42.770> things<00:04:42.980> like<00:04:43.100> I

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
you know clean waste and things like I

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.920 
you know clean waste and things like I
talked<00:04:43.430> about<00:04:43.670> you<00:04:44.360> know<00:04:44.450> real<00:04:44.750> world

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
talked about you know real world

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.510 
talked about you know real world
examples<00:04:45.350> about<00:04:45.560> what<00:04:45.740> this<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.310> know<00:04:46.400> what

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
examples about what this you know what

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.940 
examples about what this you know what
this<00:04:46.610> does<00:04:46.670> for<00:04:46.790> people<00:04:47.000> on<00:04:47.180> earth<00:04:47.710> yeah<00:04:48.710> what

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
this does for people on earth yeah what

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.580 
this does for people on earth yeah what
are<00:04:49.040> they<00:04:49.190> one<00:04:49.760> of<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.000> great<00:04:50.480> advantages<00:04:50.900> of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
are they one of the great advantages of

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.770 
are they one of the great advantages of
supercritical<00:04:52.100> water<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:52.760> that<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.150> becomes<00:04:53.630> a

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
supercritical water is that it becomes a

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.550 
supercritical water is that it becomes a
terrific<00:04:54.470> solvent<00:04:55.010> for<00:04:56.050> organic<00:04:57.050> material

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
terrific solvent for organic material

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.310 
terrific solvent for organic material
organic<00:04:58.280> waste<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.660> this<00:04:59.750> is<00:04:59.870> because<00:05:00.020> of

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
organic waste and this is because of

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.910 
organic waste and this is because of
this<00:05:00.410> change<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:01.930> material<00:05:02.930> properties<00:05:03.410> or

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
this change in material properties or

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.440 
this change in material properties or
thermo<00:05:04.250> physical<00:05:04.430> properties<00:05:04.640> when<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.300> goes

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
thermo physical properties when it goes

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.260 
thermo physical properties when it goes
into<00:05:05.750> its<00:05:06.110> supercritical<00:05:06.560> regime<00:05:07.010> and<00:05:07.700> so

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
into its supercritical regime and so

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.370 
into its supercritical regime and so
there's<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:09.550> there's<00:05:10.550> a<00:05:10.640> facility<00:05:11.150> on<00:05:11.380> that's

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
there's a there's a facility on that's

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.040 
there's a there's a facility on that's
in<00:05:13.250> orlando<00:05:13.940> florida<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.570> was<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:14.900> put

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
in orlando florida that was just put

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.840 
in orlando florida that was just put
online<00:05:15.230> not<00:05:15.710> too<00:05:15.890> long<00:05:16.040> ago<00:05:16.100> the<00:05:16.520> city<00:05:16.670> of

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
online not too long ago the city of

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.400 
online not too long ago the city of
orlando<00:05:17.000> uses<00:05:17.660> supercritical<00:05:18.140> water

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
orlando uses supercritical water

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.080 
orlando uses supercritical water
oxidation<00:05:18.790> technology<00:05:19.790> to<00:05:22.090> basically

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
oxidation technology to basically

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.030 
oxidation technology to basically
convert<00:05:24.020> all<00:05:24.260> their<00:05:24.410> ways<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:26.020> tyler<00:05:27.040> maybe

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
convert all their ways to tyler maybe

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.650 
convert all their ways to tyler maybe
they<00:05:28.220> essentially<00:05:28.670> burned<00:05:29.000> their<00:05:29.180> waste<00:05:29.390> in

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
they essentially burned their waste in

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.640 
they essentially burned their waste in
in<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.560> supercritical<00:05:31.130> water<00:05:31.460> reactor<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.240> the

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
in a supercritical water reactor and the

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.590 
in a supercritical water reactor and the
byproducts<00:05:33.650> are<00:05:33.770> then<00:05:34.100> carbon<00:05:34.790> dioxide<00:05:35.240> and

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
byproducts are then carbon dioxide and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.580 
byproducts are then carbon dioxide and
water<00:05:36.230> so<00:05:37.160> it's<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.370> relatively<00:05:37.700> benign

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
water so it's a relatively benign

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.990 
water so it's a relatively benign
product<00:05:39.590> stream<00:05:39.860> once<00:05:40.130> they<00:05:41.980> take<00:05:42.980> this<00:05:43.190> the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
product stream once they take this the

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000 
product stream once they take this the
supercritical<00:05:44.480> water<00:05:44.780> or<00:05:45.050> waste<00:05:45.380> stream<00:05:45.710> and

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
supercritical water or waste stream and

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.730 
supercritical water or waste stream and
and<00:05:46.520> oxidize<00:05:47.390> it<00:05:49.780> so<00:05:50.780> what's<00:05:50.990> what's<00:05:51.350> next<00:05:51.680> I

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
and oxidize it so what's what's next I

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.410 
and oxidize it so what's what's next I
hear<00:05:51.920> you<00:05:52.100> guys<00:05:52.250> have<00:05:52.490> another<00:05:52.880> run<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.270> this

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
hear you guys have another run of this

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.090 
hear you guys have another run of this
experiment<00:05:53.720> coming<00:05:53.930> up<00:05:54.140> I<00:05:54.200> think<00:05:54.380> in<00:05:54.500> march

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
experiment coming up I think in march

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.770 
experiment coming up I think in march
maybe<00:05:55.640> or<00:05:55.850> whatever<00:05:56.060> it's<00:05:56.180> going<00:05:56.330> to<00:05:56.450> be<00:05:56.540> so

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
maybe or whatever it's going to be so

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.780 
maybe or whatever it's going to be so
what<00:05:57.140> are<00:05:57.230> the<00:05:57.290> next<00:05:57.410> steps<00:05:57.610> well<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.670> next

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
what are the next steps well the next

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.470 
what are the next steps well the next
step<00:05:59.090> would<00:05:59.240> be<00:05:59.300> to<00:06:00.790> basically<00:06:01.790> repeat<00:06:02.270> the

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
step would be to basically repeat the

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.120 
step would be to basically repeat the
the<00:06:02.900> test<00:06:03.140> that<00:06:03.260> we<00:06:03.380> had<00:06:03.500> already<00:06:03.680> done<00:06:03.920> in

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
the test that we had already done in

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.220 
the test that we had already done in
july<00:06:04.430> and<00:06:04.850> that<00:06:05.120> that's<00:06:05.390> coming<00:06:05.720> up<00:06:05.780> in<00:06:05.990> march

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
july and that that's coming up in march

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.160 
july and that that's coming up in march
and<00:06:06.530> so<00:06:07.340> march<00:06:07.790> third<00:06:08.120> were<00:06:08.330> scheduled<00:06:08.720> for<00:06:08.930> an

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
and so march third were scheduled for an

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.410 
and so march third were scheduled for an
18-day<00:06:11.080> test<00:06:12.080> sequence<00:06:12.500> and<00:06:12.830> we'll<00:06:13.700> have

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:14.420 
18-day test sequence and we'll have

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.090 
18-day test sequence and we'll have
another<00:06:14.630> test<00:06:14.930> sequence<00:06:15.290> after<00:06:15.470> that<00:06:15.740> are

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
another test sequence after that are

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.700 
another test sequence after that are
probably<00:06:16.640> in<00:06:16.790> april<00:06:17.150> so<00:06:17.300> starting<00:06:18.230> a<00:06:18.290> Marvel

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
probably in april so starting a Marvel

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.230 
probably in april so starting a Marvel
will<00:06:19.040> become<00:06:19.280> busy<00:06:19.610> again<00:06:19.640> with<00:06:20.060> this

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
will become busy again with this

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.930 
will become busy again with this
