00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.720
 nice guys here it's scott we're back 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.810
 today with another video on black ops 2 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.760
 this time we bring you multiplayer 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.710
 also to vary a little lately there 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.810
 we brought many zombie videos 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.759
 so that anyway I have to say have 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.939
 made a great success so we are 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.550
 very happy carbon suffers a job 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.239
 truly exceptional and veins we will continue 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.750
 in short, to bring both video zombies 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.030
 then gameplay transit tutorial both 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.640
 multiplayer and soon guys vi 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.410
 we also promise fifa 13 which is a bit 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.540
 put aside in other words also 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.750
 time problems said this here 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.910
 next to me there is a great friend the ri is 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.400
 well guys here people sorry if you don't 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.380
 I am made to feel in recent times 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.970
 but there are not a few I go away 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.350
 balls until the end or mrs. 21 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.570
 December because Himalayas say that 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.290
 by December there we all go without 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.060
 great regrets is okay 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.700
 exciting this federation of 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.610
 fantastic cities of optimism are well 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.020
 said now prices 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.030
 we speak in a somewhat technical manner of the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.760
 short game of the class 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.220
 this meanwhile this game will end 60 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.810
 52 therefore an excellent result 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.500
 I don't know if I said it was play 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.650
 however from rave soldier we also talk 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.470
 of the class this class 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.560
 he did not use as a specialty 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.820
 inflexible light then jackal and then 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.620
 dexterity 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.909
 clearly we used the wild card 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.909
 to put a plus in the first one 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.610
 specialty and then had neither grenades 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.940
 tactics in the great lethal short or 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.100
 bim bum bam allowed 3 accessories then 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.130
 using the gunslinger wild card 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.390
 primary and has upgraded the whole weapon 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.710
 primary and therefore did not even have 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.080
 secondary and had a silencer 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 used in this pd to silencer 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.810
 laser sight that is very useful guys 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.970
 in fact, and you will see how much in the game 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.940
 he 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.670
 will be facilitated by this laser sight is 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.810
 very useful scott really 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.390
 awesome 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.470
 and then this fmj which is the bullets 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.300
 perforators said this guys there 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.520
 we brought this game really 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.350
 with suffering in the sense that the 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.910
 Black ops cinema gave us two 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.270
 really many problems 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.820
 what do you think is generated by so many but 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.710
 really many because we have anyway 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.330
 done is not the first for the game that 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.590
 we have made so many is the 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.690
 problem is that cinema doesn't have it 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.090
 registered care recorded only in part 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 and therefore we cannot do anything 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.560
 bring them about it I wanted 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.760
 just sponsor a channel that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.110
 however of our friends who have 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.990
 also made some good matches 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.480
 also with more than 100 kg 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.920
 the problem that they broke so into 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.900
 health cinema and nothing 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.550
 the problem just couldn't 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.310
 register it and I'm sorry for them 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.920
 however they are the outs and nothing 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.250
 will be in description in the channel us 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.890
 guys anyway I say I'm in 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.730
 confident parentheses because I'm noticing 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.250
 I'm noticing anyway that the 3 iarc da 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.880
 very scott both the players and the gamers 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.860
 so listen listen to them 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.530
 requests, however, their needs e 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.840
 then maybe they send some peace for 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.049
 make some changes in 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.090
 black ops 2 effects at the beginning i 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.980
 first days he had so many problems then 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.890
 all the same, guys like that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.670
 like the names like every year anyway in 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.190
 all the cod 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.769
 slowly in these peace you always go 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.320
 improving those details because a 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:05.080
 so I ca n't get out perfect game 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.230
 indeed absolutely and then this year 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.980
 I don't know about you guys but anyway i 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.380
 cinema problems really make matches 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.670
 exciting of a certain level that 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.200
 last year we remember you 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:24.190
 carried triple mob however we dub ab 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.419
 many games in short, very good anyway 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.580
 a certain level 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.159
 this year we hope to bring good 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.379
 many, however, of equally high level 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.840
 but I have to say that it's a little more anyway 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:39.530
 complicated this makes the most beautiful 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.379
 all the more competitive the more fierce the 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.300
 what no yes we say it does enhance some 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:47.030
 the skill of the player and not just the 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.659
 connection or the weapon over power 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.780
 because already mv 3000 crpv maybe four 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:54.169
 notches ronde vast and you could not do us 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.259
 nothing 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.180
 while here it is played more 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.550
 weapons are a little bit a little bit 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.860
 maybe more problematic problems 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.500
 maybe with a higher recoil and then 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.960
 we have devised a strategy to do 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.389
 working and that is for example 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.740
 with Scotland the most is not exaggerated 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.560
 arrival no no no no wait wait 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.330
 I want to make a small introduction for us 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.479
 the best submachine guns 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.080
 I am the pdv this conquest 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.400
 playing ray soldier is the msm chino i am 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.409
 I think the boys say so 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.509
 sorry if I'm wrong and then there's the 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.969
 scorpion ivo that in any case is on paper 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.379
 also a machine gun indeed 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:35.060
 very strong 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.729
 just that he has a little problem 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.710
 the little recoil makes it short, we talked 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:45.139
 they joke about this but the dear one 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:47.979
 people have found a strategy for 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.659
 make this weapon perfect then for 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:53.270
 how to say eliminate this problem of 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:55.490
 recoil just word charisti so 20 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.680
 then it may seem bullshit but not 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.629
 it is because I really tried and 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.159
 I must say that it works put aside 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:05.029
 of accessories that maybe decrease 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:07.039
 recoils so ok but there is a strategy 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:09.289
 if you dedicate them to the enemy too much 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:13.099
 far and looks like bullshit is not true 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.529
 if it is too far you shoot at your feet 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.529
 shoot your feet and see you do a lot of things 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.949
 our jokes pull at the thumbs of the 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:24.889
 really walk this strategy there 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.659
 I was already using the 3 with the 18 g anyway 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.729
 good standing and went very well a 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.669
 po event is true that if the roma a little 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.260
 then recoil a little lower then 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.420
 when 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.670
 when we say it is firing then 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.160
 when then the weapon this a weapon a 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.530
 very high rate of fire therefore tends a 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.390
 so to get up so it's the advice 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.820
 really increased why 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:50.080
 except, however, said so let's say it does a little 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:54.650
 laugh let's say the thing is nice 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.000
 okay guys anyway then in short of 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.150
 let us know what else we can 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.490
 talk about this than that a 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.330
 compensate for exact sachs of this lag 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:08.230
 compensation that we say increases the 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.580
 difficulty of the game down since 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:14.170
 let's say it puts us all on the same 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.030
 plan is the one who has the connection 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.310
 better is the one who has the connection 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.470
 worse then this lag compensation 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.190
 that in black ii sweeps a lot 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.680
 serious 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.480
 unlike m3 which was there but was 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.980
 practically non-existent 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:30.620
 this year we say all the players 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.530
 they are more or less on the same level also 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:36.020
 if unfortunately as I understand it lost is 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.860
 a little random so it doesn't happen 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.930
 that to the best connection but bosses 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.850
 a little bit can happen 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.920
 But guys, we play codes 

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.660
 because we like short and go ahead 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.610
 with con and useful 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.140
 having said that I would say that the game is 

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.030
 come to an end 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.490
 see you last 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:00.010
 coming soon with the other videos and 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.010
 nice agents hello guys
