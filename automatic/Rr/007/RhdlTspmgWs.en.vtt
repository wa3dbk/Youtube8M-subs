00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.530 
like your game saves and stuff have time
stamps<00:04:54.160> on<00:04:54.250> them<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.729> they<00:04:54.940> appear<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.479> the

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
stamps on them so they appear in the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.320 
stamps on them so they appear in the
memory<00:04:55.840> area<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.770> is<00:04:56.830> particularly<00:04:57.820> handy

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
memory area this is particularly handy

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.200 
memory area this is particularly handy
when<00:04:58.810> managing<00:04:59.290> savings<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.460> then

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
when managing savings and then

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.940 
when managing savings and then
friendless<00:05:01.750> sorting<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.169> already<00:05:02.470> show<00:05:02.680> Joe

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
friendless sorting I already show Joe

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.330 
friendless sorting I already show Joe
that<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:04.660> those<00:05:04.900> are<00:05:05.020> basically<00:05:05.620> all<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.190> new

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
that so those are basically all the new

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.520 
that so those are basically all the new
features<00:05:07.229> fairly<00:05:08.229> simple<00:05:08.590> stuff

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
features fairly simple stuff

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.650 
features fairly simple stuff
and<00:05:10.980> uh<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.640> is<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.850> little<00:05:12.090> anything<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.600> think

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
and uh this is a little anything I think
