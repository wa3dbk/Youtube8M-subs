00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.640 
see around me they're all RC helicopters
the<00:02:37.000> second<00:02:37.360> thing<00:02:37.599> I<00:02:37.720> would<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.200> say<00:02:38.409> is

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
the second thing I would like to say is

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.220 
the second thing I would like to say is
that<00:02:38.680> RC<00:02:39.430> helicopters<00:02:40.030> are<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:40.569> exact

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
that RC helicopters are actually exact

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.160 
that RC helicopters are actually exact
replica<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.849> real<00:02:43.000> helicopters<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.900> they

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
replica of the real helicopters and they

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.039 
replica of the real helicopters and they
work<00:02:44.500> or<00:02:44.829> they<00:02:44.860> fly<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.549> the<00:02:45.790> same<00:02:46.150> concepts

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
work or they fly on the same concepts

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.589 
work or they fly on the same concepts
and<00:02:47.230> principles<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.459> rotary<00:02:48.909> flight<00:02:49.209> the

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
and principles of the rotary flight the

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.630 
and principles of the rotary flight the
only<00:02:49.870> thing<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:50.890> different<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:51.459> you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
only thing that is different that you

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.360 
only thing that is different that you
see<00:02:51.879> in<00:02:52.060> normal<00:02:52.329> helicopters<00:02:53.079> is<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:54.190> they

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
see in normal helicopters is that they

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.610 
see in normal helicopters is that they
don't<00:02:54.549> have<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> fly<00:02:55.239> bar<00:02:55.599> while<00:02:56.109> the<00:02:56.260> RC

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
don't have a fly bar while the RC

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.430 
don't have a fly bar while the RC
helicopters<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.640> fly<00:02:58.269> bar<00:02:58.599> okay<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.290> is

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
helicopters have a fly bar okay this is

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.380 
helicopters have a fly bar okay this is
the<00:02:59.590> main<00:02:59.799> blade<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.459> hope<00:03:00.609> you<00:03:00.760> can<00:03:00.970> see<00:03:01.269> it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
the main blade I hope you can see it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.479 
the main blade I hope you can see it
from<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.750> part<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.170> there's<00:03:02.349> a<00:03:02.650> fly<00:03:03.099> bar<00:03:03.370> as

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
from that part and there's a fly bar as

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.640 
from that part and there's a fly bar as
you<00:03:03.609> can<00:03:03.760> see<00:03:03.940> all<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.359> helicopters<00:03:04.930> have<00:03:05.349> fly

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
you can see all the helicopters have fly

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.399 
you can see all the helicopters have fly
bar<00:03:05.890> but<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.609> course<00:03:06.849> they<00:03:07.120> are<00:03:07.209> also<00:03:07.409> making

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
bar but of course they are also making

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:11.360 
bar but of course they are also making
RC<00:03:08.799> helicopters<00:03:09.370> fly<00:03:09.879> barlas<00:03:10.359> which<00:03:10.629> is<00:03:10.870> like

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
RC helicopters fly barlas which is like

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.530 
RC helicopters fly barlas which is like
completely<00:03:12.370> exactly<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.299> real

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
completely exactly like a real

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.089 
completely exactly like a real
helicopter<00:03:13.750> because<00:03:14.379> they<00:03:14.530> don't<00:03:14.709> have<00:03:14.769> flat

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
helicopter because they don't have flat

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.580 
helicopter because they don't have flat
grass<00:03:15.310> okay<00:03:15.940> let's<00:03:16.180> not<00:03:16.299> go<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.109> deep<00:03:17.349> into

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
grass okay let's not go that deep into

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.580 
grass okay let's not go that deep into
that<00:03:17.890> one<00:03:18.510> next<00:03:19.510> thing<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.930> would<00:03:20.109> like<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
that one next thing that I would like to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.319 
that one next thing that I would like to
describe<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.549> how<00:03:22.109> RC<00:03:23.109> helicopters<00:03:23.920> fly<00:03:24.549> for

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
describe is how RC helicopters fly for

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.150 
describe is how RC helicopters fly for
that<00:03:25.450> I<00:03:25.480> need<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.900> pick<00:03:26.049> up<00:03:26.169> my<00:03:26.380> camera<00:03:26.680> so

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
that I need to pick up my camera so

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.190 
that I need to pick up my camera so
let's<00:03:27.430> do<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.730> quickly<00:03:28.060> we<00:03:28.599> are<00:03:28.630> not<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.139> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
let's do it quickly we are not going to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.199 
let's do it quickly we are not going to
talk<00:03:29.470> about<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.099> components<00:03:30.459> at<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:30.910> moment

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
talk about the components at the moment

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.530 
talk about the components at the moment
but<00:03:31.720> what<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.799> basic<00:03:33.220> principle<00:03:33.400> or<00:03:34.090> what

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
but what is the basic principle or what

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.530 
but what is the basic principle or what
is<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.079> concept<00:03:35.919> of<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.700> rotary<00:03:37.090> flight<00:03:37.329> let

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
is the concept of the rotary flight let

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:46.520 
is the concept of the rotary flight let
me<00:03:37.629> quickly<00:03:37.840> describing

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:58.730 

[Music]

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.770 

Oh
