 nor a different opinion one when 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.450
 we thought that the transplant was the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 salvation of the child and that there was 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.430
 put it in a condition to transplant 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.420

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.920
 that I am the best treatment for 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.100
 Short bowel syndrome is the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.890
 conservative treatment because it 's better 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.470
 have little bowel 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.900
 of having a bowel that is not 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.420
 our own nature the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.920
 health authorities assured that everything 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.780

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.320
 an evaluation has been made through 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.060
 neurological studies and it has 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.640
 determined that the child has 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.390
 a brain death in Lisbon 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.909

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.590
 let's disconnect the child 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.960
