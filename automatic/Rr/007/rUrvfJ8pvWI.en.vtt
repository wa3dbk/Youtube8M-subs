00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 living there today there is a new one 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.359
 video of me 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.940
 this time in this video makes 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.410
 cooperation with dear nadine vom 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.500
 canal carpani 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.839
 001 that's such a cute one and me already 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.730
 really right you have to 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.160
 We must visit such a sweet 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500
 kind heart 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.760
 and yes we are doing our five must today 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.859
 have in your handbag 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
 However, I do it in the category 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.830
 beauty and her in the category 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 lifestyle 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.969
 So look again for her 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.040
 over and then I start with no 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.500
 Beauty must have it in your handbag 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.960
 on the one hand it is a lip care here 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.969
 oh my god who does not know how 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
 Corrosive is when you lips brittle 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 has very dry lips and thanks 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.329
 lip care product has it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
 So one of the most annoying thing 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.460
 day can happen to me so beautiful 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.210
 technically and that she only stands now 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.219
 Deputy but I love this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 yes, that too is new from barea in 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 the direction melone above all one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.620
 transparent lips product is whole 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 important that you can always apply it 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.450
 even without a mirror and for everyday life 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.250
 is great and I love those 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.930
 this sticks even better this little one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.750
 buns or so that are much 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.700
 more hygienic and must necessarily in each 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.049
 purse with pure and then I have in 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.119
 my hand, you have just that 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.400
 other product of it namely one 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 toned lip balm that too 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.330
 color leaves as I love such 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 pink tones are available in different colors 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.590
 colors but I do not like to red 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.509
 but rather such a rosé tone and the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.009
 just make the lips so beautiful and that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.049
 I think again looks very good 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.329
 from very well maintained and enters so 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.380
 little skin color without it 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.759
 looks like you have the same 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 exaggerated and a lipstick 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.899
 applied or a glass or something like that 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.479
 gets sticky and annoying then 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.780
 you have to apply more targeted is 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.270
 super simple in the order and still looks 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.829
 somehow fresh out and again 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 a little make-up without it 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.540
 looks too much make- up I hope 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.860
 You understand what I mean , that's me 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 from the must have so one 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.010
 intransparent variants one in such 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.200
 a pink a tone of a bit 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.630
 even more color brings my face 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.540
 next it makes sense this icontrol 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.700
 paper are so super suitable if 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.860
 You start to grow again during the day 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.650
 shine so much in this t zone 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.420
 here and this really great me 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.340
 I had those of essens- and before that I had 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.740
 also patrice and I think both 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.560
 great and you just pull out of it 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 and has her such a small blotting paper 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.940
 cookies I call that and that time 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.800
 you also push your forehead and on 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.350
 the places where it just shines and that 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.900
 Also, just grease it away without losing weight 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.520
 take away a lot of make-up and that 's the one 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.080
 difference to normal paper towels 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.810
 then we also approve the make-up 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.180
 can be the make-up so taken jams 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.770
 so weird and not quite 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.780
 so beautiful and that is me on this 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.340
 to get better in every case and 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.270
 that is why they must also be in the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.550
 his handbag 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.540
 I also have this product very often 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.400
 in my handbag 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.860
 that is a little theo in the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.930
 compressed variant that exists since one 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.760
 Only a few months is just that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.430
 same content but in a smaller one 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.890
 bottle and that I find super handy 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.540
 first time quite normal for the idea and 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.480
 effect if we ease a bit 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.760
 in everyday life or even if something 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.800
 for example, the smell of the shoes is funny 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.930
 greeks like to be uncomfortable if you like 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.690
 is in it all day and that's hot 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.370
 outside or feet in general and me 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.410
 think this is super that sounds really disgusting 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.000
 but it works great if you can 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.620
 somewhere else has my longer 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.030
 on the way and you have the shoes there 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.070
 then you can take that in quickly 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.140
 the shoes or cited spray and 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.790
 it smells so much more pleasant and you 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.830
 does not have such sweaty feet and 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.630
 that is a small allround tip 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.560
 me and definitely for me 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.690
 also in the handbag 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.970
 Finally, I have this beauty 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.519
 product that is a concealer of 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.019
 Maybelline this fit with concealer and 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.730
 that is a very good cover of the 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.470
 concealer I use meanwhile 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.209
 not for the eyes because he 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.860
 Strong enough for me that she is one 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.440
 bit and of course that too 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.209
 not so happy but I like to use 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.980
 if I have so daily what me 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.940
 scary bothers me and where I am 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.590
 do not feel well 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.170
 if the during the day always 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.180
 becomes more visible because concealer and eternal 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.189
 keeps on the skin 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.379
 and then I like to take again a 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.000
 with and dabs very little 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.859
 on it and I just feel then 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.479
 better and it covered that looks for 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.250
 me a beautiful one you have to, of course 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.360
 the transitions so a little bit münchinger 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.490
 you have to blindfold a bit 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.500
 Exercises with that have it pretty good 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.930
 but his concealer looks real 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.639
 a great help and just the one of 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.229
 fog in the paint 10 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.199
 I find ten then better 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.539
 15 that she finds it very bright 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:40.690
 I just kind of skin friendly 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:42.070
 beautiful and yes the katjes highly recommend 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.500
 that is also a must-have that me 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.080
 like in the handbag've the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.539
 my five beauty must have been in the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.520

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.960
 the handbag in the field of beauty and 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.539
 if we feel like watching me 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.910

 curious that she's in there and then 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.729
