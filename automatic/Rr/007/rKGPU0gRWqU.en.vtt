makes it take more like a like a bitter
rather<00:04:54.800> than<00:04:54.950> a<00:04:55.040> lager<00:04:55.400> but<00:04:57.910> that's<00:04:58.910> good<00:05:00.040> and

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
rather than a lager but that's good and

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.370 
rather than a lager but that's good and
because<00:05:02.210> quite<00:05:02.450> frankly<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:03.050> would<00:05:03.170> have<00:05:03.260> been

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
because quite frankly it would have been

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:13.750 
because quite frankly it would have been
stupid<00:05:03.710> for<00:05:04.100> me<00:05:04.130> not<00:05:04.310> to<00:05:05.500> gravy<00:05:12.490> let's<00:05:13.490> be

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
stupid for me not to gravy let's be

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.999 
stupid for me not to gravy let's be
ruthless<00:05:16.030> smells<00:05:17.030> divine

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.920 

and<00:05:24.009> yes<00:05:24.309> before<00:05:24.490> you<00:05:24.639> wonder<00:05:25.059> it<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.360> cold

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
and yes before you wonder it is cold

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:38.059 
and yes before you wonder it is cold
gravy<00:05:26.559> so

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:38.069 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:53.920 

gravy<00:05:39.050> isn't<00:05:40.050> lurking<00:05:42.529> nope<00:05:43.559> oh<00:05:43.770> maybe<00:05:44.279> it<00:05:44.430> is

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.909 

gravy<00:05:54.930> hasn't<00:05:55.379> worked

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
gravy hasn't worked

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.279 
gravy hasn't worked
I'm<00:05:56.039> afraid<00:05:56.250> so<00:05:56.610> I<00:05:56.669> can't<00:05:57.060> try<00:05:57.449> it<00:05:57.509> that's<00:05:57.870> a

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
I'm afraid so I can't try it that's a

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.089 
I'm afraid so I can't try it that's a
shame

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:03.589 

this<00:06:02.099> thing<00:06:02.520> when<00:06:02.789> you<00:06:02.969> use<00:06:03.150> it<00:06:03.300> properly

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:03.599 
this thing when you use it properly

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.740 
this thing when you use it properly
actually<00:06:04.020> works<00:06:04.560> bloody<00:06:05.189> brilliantly<00:06:05.909> I<00:06:06.270> have

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
actually works bloody brilliantly I have

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.140 
actually works bloody brilliantly I have
no<00:06:07.080> idea<00:06:07.560> how<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:07.860> science<00:06:08.370> behind<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:08.849> works

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
no idea how the science behind it works

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.360 
no idea how the science behind it works
but<00:06:09.509> it's<00:06:09.629> incredibly<00:06:10.229> clever<00:06:10.590> if<00:06:11.009> you're<00:06:11.340> a

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
but it's incredibly clever if you're a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.159 
but it's incredibly clever if you're a
fan<00:06:11.669> of<00:06:11.699> slushies<00:06:12.360> but<00:06:12.569> don't<00:06:12.870> have<00:06:13.050> the

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
fan of slushies but don't have the

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.589 
fan of slushies but don't have the
