00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
this it's actually pretty decent on both

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.229 
this it's actually pretty decent on both
sides<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.879> starting<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

fix it and it has some scratches here a
little<00:01:03.329> bit<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> touch<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
little bit but when I have to touch it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.640 
little bit but when I have to touch it
up<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> bell<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> platter<00:01:06.650> it's

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
up on the bell on the platter it's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.910 
up on the bell on the platter it's
actually<00:01:08.220> pretty<00:01:08.490> decent<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.360> lines<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
actually pretty decent the lines on the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.570 
actually pretty decent the lines on the
both<00:01:11.070> sides<00:01:11.750> this<00:01:12.750> one<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.020> nice<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:14.010> looks

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
both sides this one is nice it looks

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
both sides this one is nice it looks
like<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.939> would<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.659> thick<00:01:16.350> grind<00:01:16.799> just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
like it would be pretty thick grind just

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.980 
like it would be pretty thick grind just
because<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> grind<00:01:18.119> doesn't<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.570> very<00:01:18.750> high

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
because the grind doesn't go very high

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
because the grind doesn't go very high
up<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.369> beyond<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.000> hub<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
up just little beyond the hub of the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.870 
up just little beyond the hub of the
height<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.560> blade<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.430> actually<00:01:23.549> is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
height of the blade but it actually is

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
height of the blade but it actually is
really<00:01:24.090> mean<00:01:24.450> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> really<00:01:25.320> nice<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> thin

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
really mean kind of really nice and thin

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
really mean kind of really nice and thin
on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.130> edge<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.030> almost<00:01:27.360> almost

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
on the edge it's like it's almost almost

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.850 
on the edge it's like it's almost almost
zero<00:01:28.799> grind<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> super<00:01:29.759> small<00:01:30.000> bevel<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
zero grind it is super small bevel I

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
zero grind it is super small bevel I
like<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.220> lot<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
like this one a lot on this one I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
like this one a lot on this one I
actually<00:01:33.570> brought<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.259> tape<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.650> slightly

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
actually brought that tape just slightly

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
actually brought that tape just slightly
upwards<00:01:36.030> it's<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.720> quite<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.439> little

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
upwards it's not so quite very little

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.319 
upwards it's not so quite very little
difference<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.220> really<00:01:38.610> would<00:01:38.759> notice<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
difference you really would notice it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.640 
difference you really would notice it
only<00:01:39.479> if<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> put<00:01:39.930> them<00:01:40.079> next<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> each<00:01:40.500> other

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
only if I put them next to each other

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.560 
only if I put them next to each other
but<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:41.970> like<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.740> rounded<00:01:43.740> spine

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
but really like this one rounded spine

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.789 
but really like this one rounded spine
pretty<00:01:45.570> good<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.229> thing<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

like and doesn't screw on screwing and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.880 
like and doesn't screw on screwing and
unscrewing<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.690> sliding<00:03:13.170> simple<00:03:13.500> sliding

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890

for very very cheap I recommend this it

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.630 
for very very cheap I recommend this it
has<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.609> basic<00:04:18.269> modes<00:04:18.570> you<00:04:19.109> know<00:04:19.229> high<00:04:19.640> low

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
has the basic modes you know high low

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.140 
has the basic modes you know high low
and<00:04:21.140> stroke<00:04:22.370> so<00:04:23.370> pretty<00:04:23.669> much<00:04:23.729> like<00:04:23.940> all<00:04:24.090> of

this cheaper ones

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.529 
this cheaper ones
the<00:04:25.530> difference<00:04:25.919> between<00:04:26.099> high<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.550> low<00:04:26.759> is<00:04:27.150> I

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
the difference between high and low is I

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.260 
the difference between high and low is I
don't<00:04:28.530> know<00:04:28.650> maybe<00:04:28.830> fifty<00:04:29.340> percent<00:04:29.669> but<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
don't know maybe fifty percent but the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.059 
don't know maybe fifty percent but the
law<00:04:30.419> that's<00:04:30.810> like<00:04:31.020> Isis<00:04:31.349> i<00:04:31.470> mentioned<00:04:31.830> couple

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
law that's like Isis i mentioned couple

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.460 
law that's like Isis i mentioned couple
times<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:33.479> big<00:04:33.659> difference<00:04:33.810> between<00:04:34.139> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
times the big difference between the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.350 
times the big difference between the
good<00:04:34.680> high<00:04:34.949> end<00:04:35.159> batteries<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:36.000> these<00:04:36.150> law

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
good high end batteries and these law

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.170 
good high end batteries and these law
grants<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.650> low<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.159> low<00:04:38.400> should<00:04:38.940> be

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
grants is that low the low should be

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.149 
grants is that low the low should be
like<00:04:39.360> really<00:04:39.960> really<00:04:40.169> low<00:04:40.500> when<00:04:40.860> you<00:04:40.979> wanna

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
like really really low when you wanna

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.680 
like really really low when you wanna
you<00:04:41.490> don't<00:04:41.639> want<00:04:41.759> to<00:04:41.819> blind<00:04:42.060> yourself<00:04:42.270> you

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
you don't want to blind yourself you

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.730 
you don't want to blind yourself you
don't<00:04:42.750> wanna<00:04:42.960> mess<00:04:43.169> up<00:04:43.319> your<00:04:43.379> night<00:04:43.710> vision

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
don't wanna mess up your night vision

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.890 
don't wanna mess up your night vision
and<00:04:44.220> stuff<00:04:44.370> like<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.550> you<00:04:45.360> want<00:04:45.539> to<00:04:45.599> save<00:04:45.780> the

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
and stuff like that you want to save the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.420 
and stuff like that you want to save the
battery<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.710> that's<00:04:46.919> pretty<00:04:47.159> much<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.310> only

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
battery so that's pretty much the only

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.760 
battery so that's pretty much the only
difference<00:04:47.909> actually<00:04:48.330> has<00:04:48.629> pretty<00:04:49.289> nice

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
difference actually has pretty nice

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.369 
difference actually has pretty nice
pocket<00:04:50.250> clip<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:51.000> has<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.330> screw<00:04:51.690> on<00:04:51.720> one<00:04:52.080> not

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
pocket clip it has the screw on one not

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.010 
pocket clip it has the screw on one not
the<00:04:52.590> not<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.919> one<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.460> goes<00:04:53.610> around<00:04:53.819> so<00:04:54.270> it's

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
the not the one that goes around so it's

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.350 
the not the one that goes around so it's
it's<00:04:55.560> good<00:04:55.889> because<00:04:56.099> it's<00:04:56.400> stronger<00:04:56.819> it's<00:04:57.150> not

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
it's good because it's stronger it's not

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.809 
it's good because it's stronger it's not
good<00:04:57.599> because<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.930> cannot<00:04:58.169> swap<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:59.520> I'm

look<00:05:30.630> like<00:05:30.719> the<00:05:30.990> bounder<00:05:31.259> camera<00:05:31.560> it<00:05:31.620> actually

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
look like the bounder camera it actually
