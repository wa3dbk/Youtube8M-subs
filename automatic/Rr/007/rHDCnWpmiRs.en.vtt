stopwatch i'm going to time how quickly

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.359 
stopwatch i'm going to time how quickly
it<00:01:05.489> boots<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.950> i<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.369> get<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.360> right

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
it boots up so if i can get this right

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.450

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.160 
now and i am setting the start watch
right<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> from<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> moment<00:01:48.360> i<00:01:48.780> press

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
right here so from the moment i press

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.649 
right here so from the moment i press
the<00:01:49.590> power<00:01:49.799> button<00:01:50.329> from<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.360> moment<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.770> when

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
the power button from the moment to when

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.929 
the power button from the moment to when
it<00:01:55.009> actually<00:01:56.450> boots<00:01:57.450> into<00:01:57.630> windows<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it actually boots into windows so you

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.540 
it actually boots into windows so you
see<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.619> starting<00:02:01.619> windows<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:03.409> and

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:16.070 

okay<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:14.020> has<00:02:14.290> now<00:02:14.890> booted<00:02:15.370> into<00:02:15.610> windows

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
okay and it has now booted into windows

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.140 
okay and it has now booted into windows
let's<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.320> wait<00:02:17.530> until<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:18.040> shows<00:02:18.910> all<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
let's just wait until it shows all the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.370 
let's just wait until it shows all the
files<00:02:19.450> on<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> desktop<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.450> go<00:02:22.480> so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
files on the desktop and there we go so

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.950 
files on the desktop and there we go so
I<00:02:25.710> guess<00:02:26.710> if<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.460> count<00:02:27.790> when<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.210> booted

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
I guess if you count when it's booted

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.600 
I guess if you count when it's booted
into<00:02:29.110> windows<00:02:29.310> would<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.490> about<00:02:32.100> 33<00:02:33.100> 34

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
into windows would be about 33 34

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.290 
into windows would be about 33 34
seconds<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.720> then<00:02:35.650> after<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> loads<00:02:36.610> all<00:02:37.030> of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
seconds and then after it loads all of

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.580 
seconds and then after it loads all of
the<00:02:38.370> desktop<00:02:39.370> icons<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.570> stops<00:02:40.900> at<00:02:41.580> 41.5<00:02:43.590> so

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
the desktop icons it stops at 41.5 so

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.860 
the desktop icons it stops at 41.5 so
that<00:02:45.400> wasn't<00:02:45.730> really<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:46.270> most<00:02:46.570> accurate

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that wasn't really the most accurate

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.470 
that wasn't really the most accurate
test<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.040> i<00:02:48.370> will<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:51.100> reboot<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:52.000> then<00:02:52.270> show

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
test so i will do a reboot and then show

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.300 
test so i will do a reboot and then show
you<00:02:52.540> how<00:02:53.170> quickly<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:53.680> does<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> reboot<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you how quickly it does on a reboot to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.410 
you how quickly it does on a reboot to
get<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.270> windows<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.890> I'm<00:03:00.070> going<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.490> restart

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
get to windows so I'm going to restart

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.220 
get to windows so I'm going to restart
the<00:03:01.720> computer<00:03:02.140> right<00:03:02.680> now<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:04.750> I'm<00:03:04.870> going<00:03:05.170> to

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
the computer right now see I'm going to

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.090 
the computer right now see I'm going to
restart<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> restart<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:10.500> then<00:03:11.500> we're

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
restart it so restart and then we're

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.560 
restart it so restart and then we're
going<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.580> start<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:17.670> here<00:03:18.670> we<00:03:18.790> are<00:03:18.940> starting

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
going to start and here we are starting

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:30.260 
going to start and here we are starting
whoops

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.040 

so<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.320> starting<00:03:31.800> up<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.880> course<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:33.900> has

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
so it's starting up and of course it has

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:43.540 
so it's starting up and of course it has
already<00:03:34.290> started<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:34.980> last<00:03:35.190> time<00:03:35.730> but

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.400 

okay<00:03:44.550> we're<00:03:45.200> into<00:03:46.200> Windows<00:03:46.590> now<00:03:46.800> and

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
okay we're into Windows now and

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.030 
okay we're into Windows now and
everything's<00:03:49.410> loaded<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:51.260> about<00:03:53.480> 25<00:03:54.480> seconds

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
everything's loaded so about 25 seconds

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.640 
everything's loaded so about 25 seconds
about<00:03:56.040> 25<00:03:56.490> seconds<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.180> was<00:03:57.480> quicker<00:03:57.990> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
about 25 seconds so it was quicker the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.340 
about 25 seconds so it was quicker the
second<00:03:59.400> time<00:03:59.580> when<00:03:59.760> i<00:03:59.820> rebooted<00:04:00.360> but<00:04:01.260> of

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
second time when i rebooted but of

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.020 
second time when i rebooted but of
course<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.890> would<00:04:02.100> suspect<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.610> would<00:04:02.790> be

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
course I would suspect it would be

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.870 
course I would suspect it would be
because<00:04:03.420> it's<00:04:03.630> a<00:04:03.720> reboot<00:04:04.110> and<00:04:04.320> not<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.880> full

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
because it's a reboot and not a full

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.430 
because it's a reboot and not a full
boot<00:04:06.240> up<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:08.090> that<00:04:09.090> that's<00:04:09.450> not<00:04:09.690> like<00:04:10.080> the<00:04:10.260> most

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
boot up so that that's not like the most

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.140 
boot up so that that's not like the most
accurate<00:04:10.710> test<00:04:11.220> those<00:04:11.490> those<00:04:11.820> aren't<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
accurate test those those aren't the

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.110 
accurate test those those aren't the
most<00:04:12.300> accurate<00:04:12.660> tests<00:04:13.350> but<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:15.000> to

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
most accurate tests but it's just to

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.320 
most accurate tests but it's just to
give<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.420> an<00:04:15.690> idea<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.290> how<00:04:16.709> quick<00:04:17.040> an<00:04:17.280> SSD<00:04:17.880> can

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
give you an idea of how quick an SSD can

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.270 
give you an idea of how quick an SSD can
boot<00:04:18.570> up<00:04:18.810> windows<00:04:20.270> so<00:04:21.270> i<00:04:21.299> hope<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.100> like<00:04:23.100> this
