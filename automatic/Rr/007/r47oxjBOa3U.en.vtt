00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
I'm not going to roast them whole if you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.270 
I'm not going to roast them whole if you
have<00:00:57.989> little<00:00:58.320> ones<00:00:58.500> like<00:00:58.739> those<00:00:58.890> little<00:00:59.070> new

potatoes<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> could<00:00:59.940> certainly<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.739> but

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
potatoes you could certainly do that but

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
potatoes you could certainly do that but
with<00:01:01.859> these<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> make

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
with these you're going to want to make

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
with these you're going to want to make
them<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.629> little<00:01:03.719> bit<00:01:03.930> smaller<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.650> we're<00:01:05.610> just

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
them a little bit smaller so we're just

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.410 
them a little bit smaller so we're just
gonna<00:01:05.790> cut<00:01:06.119> them<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.390> half<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.390> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
gonna cut them in half and then I'm just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.580 
gonna cut them in half and then I'm just
gonna<00:01:09.659> make<00:01:09.960> these<00:01:10.170> nice<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.930> chunks<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
gonna make these nice little chunks this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.899 
gonna make these nice little chunks this
nice<00:01:13.799> little<00:01:14.130> bite-sized<00:01:15.049> chunks<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
nice little bite-sized chunks is that

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:18.679 
nice little bite-sized chunks is that
over<00:01:18.150> there

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
over there

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.890 
over there
so<00:01:18.900> cut<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.950> again<00:01:20.580> lengthwise<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
so cut this again lengthwise and you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
so cut this again lengthwise and you
know<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.159> bigger<00:01:26.490> chunks<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.180> could

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
know if you want bigger chunks you could

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
know if you want bigger chunks you could
almost<00:01:27.780> certainly<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:28.860> cooks

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
almost certainly do that this just cooks

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.789 
almost certainly do that this just cooks
really<00:01:29.430> quickly<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> nice<00:01:30.570> fast<00:01:31.470> way

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really quickly this is a nice fast way

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.069 
really quickly this is a nice fast way
of<00:01:31.829> roasting<00:01:32.540> obviously<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.840> bigger

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of roasting obviously if you have bigger

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
of roasting obviously if you have bigger
chunks<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.590> will<00:01:34.680> take<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> bit<00:01:35.100> longer<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.460> cook

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
chunks it will take a bit longer to cook

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.469 
chunks it will take a bit longer to cook
but<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.229> cooks<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.070> oven<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.670> baking

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
but this cooks in the oven on a baking

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.170 
but this cooks in the oven on a baking
dish<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.380> about<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> half<00:01:41.070> hour<00:01:41.280> which<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> great

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
dish in about a half hour which is great

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
dish in about a half hour which is great
so<00:01:42.840> we're<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:42.990> looking<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.530> some<00:01:43.710> nice

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
quick roasted potatoes this is the way

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.100 
quick roasted potatoes this is the way
to<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.299> said<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.960> you

through
quickly<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> you'll<00:01:54.570> expand<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> leave<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
quickly and you'll expand to leave it in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
quickly and you'll expand to leave it in
a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.710> longer<00:01:55.920> okay<00:01:56.220> beautiful<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
a little bit longer okay beautiful so

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
a little bit longer okay beautiful so
you've<00:01:57.720> got<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.200> set<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.560> let's<00:01:59.369> put<00:01:59.610> our

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you've got this all set up let's put our

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.980 
you've got this all set up let's put our
olive<00:02:00.060> oil<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.619> base<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.960> same<00:02:03.960> thing

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
olive oil in the base here same thing

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.190 
olive oil in the base here same thing
with<00:02:04.380> our<00:02:04.500> pepper<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.060> our<00:02:06.270> salt<00:02:09.080> add<00:02:10.080> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
with our pepper and our salt add the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.050 
with our pepper and our salt add the
potatoes<00:02:10.800> in<00:02:10.979> I'm<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.640> coat<00:02:11.849> them<00:02:12.030> in

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
potatoes in I'm going to coat them in

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.540 
potatoes in I'm going to coat them in
here

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.820 

now<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> could<00:02:16.660> certainly<00:02:17.020> just<00:02:17.140> drizzle<00:02:17.710> it

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
now you could certainly just drizzle it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.340 
now you could certainly just drizzle it
over<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:19.120> baking<00:02:19.510> dish<00:02:19.540> which<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.930> have<00:02:20.110> here

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
over the baking dish which I have here

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.020 
over the baking dish which I have here
but<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.040> find<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.580> much<00:02:21.850> better

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
but they just find this is a much better

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.960 
but they just find this is a much better
way<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.420> like<00:02:22.680> really<00:02:23.680> perfectly<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
way of like really perfectly and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.320 
way of like really perfectly and
completely<00:02:25.840> coating<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:27.550> potatoes<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:28.150> just

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
completely coating the potatoes so just

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.080 
completely coating the potatoes so just
get<00:02:28.600> on<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:29.020> there<00:02:29.310> mix<00:02:30.310> mix<00:02:30.580> mix<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:30.970> could

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
get on in there mix mix mix you could

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.720 
get on in there mix mix mix you could
certainly<00:02:31.360> use<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.600> spoon<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.410> just

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
certainly use a spoon but this is just

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.150 
certainly use a spoon but this is just
much<00:02:33.730> faster<00:02:34.710> so<00:02:35.710> does<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.890> make<00:02:35.950> sure

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
much faster so does it make sure

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.830 
much faster so does it make sure
everything<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:36.970> nice<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.390> coated<00:02:37.540> because

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
everything is nice and coated because

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.240 
everything is nice and coated because
you<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.110> want<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.410> tapes<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.800> dry<00:02:39.040> out<00:02:39.160> we

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
you don't want the tapes to dry out we

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.010 
you don't want the tapes to dry out we
won't<00:02:39.370> be<00:02:39.550> covering<00:02:39.940> them<00:02:40.180> they<00:02:40.750> will<00:02:40.960> be

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
won't be covering them they will be

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.260 
won't be covering them they will be
roasting<00:02:41.590> uncovered<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.090> sure

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
roasting uncovered so just make sure

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.290 
roasting uncovered so just make sure
everything<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.290> nice<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.430> covered<00:02:45.730> okay

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
everything is nice and covered okay

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.330 
everything is nice and covered okay
great

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
great

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.940 
great
now<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.720> baking<00:02:50.200> sheet<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.680> I'm

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
now I have this baking sheet that I'm

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.380 
now I have this baking sheet that I'm
using<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.400> I've<00:02:51.460> covered<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:51.970> foil<00:02:52.210> you

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
using and I've covered it in foil you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.850 
using and I've covered it in foil you
don't<00:02:52.570> need<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.810> do<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.050> I<00:02:53.110> just<00:02:53.380> find<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.740> for

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
don't need to do that I just find it for

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.800 
don't need to do that I just find it for
cleanup<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:54.610> makes<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.000> an<00:02:55.120> absolute<00:02:55.630> breeze

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
cleanup this makes it an absolute breeze

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.670 
cleanup this makes it an absolute breeze
so<00:02:56.650> let's<00:02:56.800> just<00:02:57.010> pop<00:02:57.250> those<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:58.500> spread<00:02:59.500> them

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
so let's just pop those on spread them

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.760 
so let's just pop those on spread them
out<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:01.480> again<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> more<00:03:02.020> space<00:03:02.380> they<00:03:02.590> have

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
out just again the more space they have

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.140 
out just again the more space they have
if<00:03:02.920> they're<00:03:03.070> not<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.340> top<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.550> each<00:03:03.760> other<00:03:04.000> if

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
if they're not on top of each other if

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.150 
if they're not on top of each other if
you're<00:03:04.270> not<00:03:04.390> crowding<00:03:04.870> them<00:03:05.020> they'll<00:03:06.010> cook

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
you're not crowding them they'll cook

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.880 
you're not crowding them they'll cook
even<00:03:06.460> faster<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.600> I<00:03:07.660> have<00:03:07.900> my<00:03:08.050> oven<00:03:08.380> preheating

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
even faster so I have my oven preheating

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
even faster so I have my oven preheating
at<00:03:08.980> 425<00:03:09.970> degrees<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:11.140> as<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:11.770> note<00:03:12.070> most

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
at 425 degrees just as a note most

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.460 
at 425 degrees just as a note most
people's<00:03:13.240> ovens<00:03:13.600> are<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> little<00:03:14.020> bit<00:03:14.110> off<00:03:14.260> so

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
people's ovens are a little bit off so

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.840 
people's ovens are a little bit off so
unless<00:03:14.710> you<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:15.040> little<00:03:15.370> thermometer

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
unless you have a little thermometer

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.460 
unless you have a little thermometer
that<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.270> there<00:03:16.450> testing<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.110> may<00:03:17.290> be<00:03:17.320> a

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
that is in there testing it it may be a

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.020 
that is in there testing it it may be a
bit<00:03:17.680> off<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.100> your<00:03:18.280> cooking<00:03:18.550> times<00:03:18.790> always

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
bit off so your cooking times always

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.900 
bit off so your cooking times always
vary<00:03:19.390> for<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.290> with<00:03:21.220> these<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.550> such<00:03:21.760> small

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
vary for this with these in such small

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.880 
vary for this with these in such small
pieces<00:03:22.240> it's<00:03:22.480> gonna<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.780> like<00:03:22.930> 30<00:03:23.320> to<00:03:23.500> 45

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
pieces it's gonna be like 30 to 45

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.090 
pieces it's gonna be like 30 to 45
minutes<00:03:24.510> about<00:03:25.510> 20<00:03:26.080> minutes<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.860> want<00:03:27.010> to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
minutes about 20 minutes in you want to

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.040 
minutes about 20 minutes in you want to
check<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.520> and<00:03:27.700> flip<00:03:28.360> them<00:03:28.570> give<00:03:28.750> them<00:03:28.870> like<00:03:29.020> a

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
check it and flip them give them like a

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.960 
check it and flip them give them like a
little<00:03:29.230> stir<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:29.920> both<00:03:30.130> sides<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:30.640> get<00:03:30.790> nice

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
little stir so both sides can get nice

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.400 
little stir so both sides can get nice
and<00:03:31.000> crispy<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.540> then<00:03:31.780> you'll<00:03:31.930> be<00:03:32.020> good<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.260> go

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and crispy and then you'll be good to go

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.410 
and crispy and then you'll be good to go
and<00:03:32.740> just<00:03:32.980> keep<00:03:33.190> an<00:03:33.310> eye<00:03:33.459> on<00:03:33.490> it<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.090> anywhere

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
and just keep an eye on it and anywhere

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.910 
and just keep an eye on it and anywhere
from<00:03:34.480> 30<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.959> 45<00:03:35.320> minutes<00:03:35.500> they<00:03:35.709> should<00:03:35.740> eat

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
from 30 to 45 minutes they should eat

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.620 
from 30 to 45 minutes they should eat
golden-brown<00:03:36.450> yummy

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
golden-brown yummy

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.050 
golden-brown yummy
ready<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.990> go<00:03:38.110> so<00:03:38.350> we'll<00:03:38.470> check<00:03:38.590> back<00:03:38.770> then

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
ready to go so we'll check back then

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.520 
ready to go so we'll check back then
okay<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.330> it's<00:03:40.480> been<00:03:40.780> about<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:42.010> 32<00:03:43.000> minutes
