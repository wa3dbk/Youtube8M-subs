00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.660
 hello dear people i am faria to me 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.730
 I am very happy that I am in guardians of 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 the galaxy the superhero rocket racoon 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.960
 My voice was allowed to borrow an important 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.789
 role in the film played by her mixtape 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
 who does not know what it is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.279
 That's what they called us in the 80s 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.109
 today playlists haye has too big 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.369
 dumbass in the headphones down the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.190
 are you guys you have to take care of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.329
 because this tape and the player mixtape 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.500
 One has done especially for someone 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.629
 by falling in love again 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.969
 So the favorite songs others ranked 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.760
 and as a gift sometimes you can too 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.600
 made for yourself and has the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.420
 cassette recorder 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.399
 kept in standby mode and when 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.170
 the favorite song on the radio came one has 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 on recording has pressed the song 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.239
 heard it was pleased that it 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.199
 finally hard on 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.519
 then the moderator has squeezed and 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.519
 Here's what it all about 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.070
 we can continue now 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.500
 So that's important now 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.960
 promised to pencil now and then 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.300
 occurred that is a bandsalat was 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.940
 because the cassettes recorder and walkman 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.940
 So it's a little bit broken 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:40.020
 wanted and for this one had the here and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:45.210
 could, so to speak, turn back and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.890
 then it was okay again 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.130
 was a pretty good plan more too 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 mixtapes and walkthrough are on 28th 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.039

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039
