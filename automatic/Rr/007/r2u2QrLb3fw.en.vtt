00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
into the down tube we find it a little

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.310 
into the down tube we find it a little
bit<00:01:02.399> throughout<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:03.090> revise<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.899> shapes<00:01:04.140> a

little<00:01:04.439> bit<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.040> asymmetry<00:01:05.369> does<00:01:05.880> is

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
little bit what this asymmetry does is

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.690 
little bit what this asymmetry does is
it<00:01:06.570> balances<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> forces<00:01:07.680> acting<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.220> the

it balances the forces acting on the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
it balances the forces acting on the

frame from the drivetrain because the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.289 
frame from the drivetrain because the

putting a lot of power to the cranks is

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.510 
putting a lot of power to the cranks is
when<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> asymmetry<00:01:19.560> really<00:01:20.159> comes<00:01:20.369> into

the bike a lot more stable at those at
those<00:01:25.200> speeds<00:01:25.470> first<00:01:26.280> thing<00:01:26.430> you'll<00:01:26.580> notice

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
those speeds first thing you'll notice

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.270 
those speeds first thing you'll notice
in<00:01:27.030> looking<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.350> couple<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:29.040> things

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
in looking at this a couple of things

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.160 
in looking at this a couple of things
the<00:01:29.820> fork<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.180> much<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.509> integrated<00:01:31.020> with

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
the fork is much more integrated with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
the fork is much more integrated with
the<00:01:31.259> frame<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.950> doing<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:32.970> I've<00:01:33.240> gone

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the frame in doing this I've gone

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.850 
the frame in doing this I've gone
through<00:01:33.540> an<00:01:33.600> inch<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> half<00:01:33.930> fork<00:01:34.590> crown

through an inch and a half fork crown
lower<00:01:35.400> bearings<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:35.939> inch<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> half<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:36.570> as

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
lower bearings an inch and a half now as

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.450 
lower bearings an inch and a half now as
mentioned<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> quarter<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> years<00:01:37.920> past

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
mentioned a quarter in the years past

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
mentioned a quarter in the years past
this<00:01:39.000> increases<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> rigidity<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> front

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
this increases the rigidity in the front

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.880 
this increases the rigidity in the front
end<00:01:40.920> by<00:01:41.100> about<00:01:41.250> 19%<00:01:42.079> what<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.200> does<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
end by about 19% what this does is it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.469 
end by about 19% what this does is it
increases<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.490> braking<00:01:44.850> power<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
increases your braking power it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
increases your braking power it
increases<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> stability<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> front<00:01:46.979> end

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
increases the stability in the front end

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.490 
increases the stability in the front end
gives<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> more<00:01:47.670> steering<00:01:48.090> precision

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
gives you more steering precision

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
gives you more steering precision
