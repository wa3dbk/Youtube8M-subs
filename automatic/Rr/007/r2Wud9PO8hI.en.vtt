00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.830
 galarreta the abortion doing some mathematical formulas we will do later 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.179
 of this report who will be the winner of South Africa 2010 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.179
 is possibly the most sublime sensation and the world sport 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.739
 lift the world cup of the fifa 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.990
 it's an experience 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 and only a handful of capitanich 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.789
 six elections 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.160
 they share the story 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.310
 they will do so in the next century 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.050
 the five-time world champion 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 leads all other selections with their five world cups 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.789
 followed closely by italy 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.720
 the current global monarchs 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.570
 Germany has three world championships 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.210
 the last one got in italy 90 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 Argentina has two 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.800
 like its neighbor uruguay 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.020
 but this one more than half a century ago since the last 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.720
 england and france close the list with many drinks each 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.489
 yes 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.600
 both won 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.910
 as hosts of the event 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.400
 well exposed the seven countries has the distinction 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.350
 it's called art champions of 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560
 and in just two more months 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.740
 32 selections classified for the new 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 just like the most beautiful sport 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.149
 a lot but a lot of talent 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.909
 to become the new monarch of the ball 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.260
 and international 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.500
 for the first time in African lands 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.010
 do you have to know 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.010
 how could I know who the new champion will be 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.110
 pike before 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.110
 that the first match of the world cup is played 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.049
 by Internet 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.950
 has been circulating an email with a simple but 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.200
 curiously successful mathematical formula 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.530
 because of being able to predict who will be the next world champion 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.170
 already wants to know who will be 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
 I have a little patience, pay close attention 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.490
 since your paper pillar list or calculator 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.359
 and water the next calculation 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.639
 Brazil won the world cup 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.689
 in the united states 1994 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.939
 before that he won the 1970 World Cup 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:27.249
 if we add to 1970 plus 1994 the result is from it peres 1964 remind yourself 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:28.869
 number 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:36.949
 Argentina won its last world cup in 1986 before that won the 1978 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.219
 will play in argentina 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.809
 add it 1986 kill 1978 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:50.119
 interestingly the result is 3 thousand 964 the same number of the equation 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.319
 previous 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.849
 Germany won its last world cup in 1990 before that triumph in the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.299
 World Championship of 1974 played in Germany 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:09.340
 now let's add 1974 plus 1990 incredible 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.929
 once again the result is that perez 1964 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:18.139
 this formula has already been tested before to know who will be champion 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.349
 since in 2002 during the Japan-Korea World Cup 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.630
 Brazil according to the formula 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.119
 I should be a champion 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.710
 if we add 1962 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.419
 year in which Brazil won the World Cup March 2002 and May of this World Cup 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:38.259
 the result once again you can ask 1964 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.829
 and so it was Brazil was crowned champion efe japan korea 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.819
 ohl the time has come that they cause low 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.839
 in the city according to this formula 

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:52.839
 the next world champion 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.140
 If you want to know, you should only respect 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.559
 the magic number is to say perez 1964 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:05.319
 the year of this new South Africa World Cup that is 2010 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.319
 you already have the result 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.529
 1954 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:15.039
 in which the Swiss World Cup was played 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.289
 Isabel you who won it 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.729
 the federal republic of germany 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.340
 yes 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.180
 so 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.139
 after appealing 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.960
 because a certain formula works just not only will it be richer than before 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.740
 world 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.599
 but it will become the intimacy of all your friends 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.800
 but sometimes 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.360
 nothing 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.409
 note 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.469
 this formula have nothing scientifically verifiable 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.840
 and it could be just another coincidence 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.029
 in the fascinating 20 world football world 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.400
 although who knows 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.400
 Germany could be champion 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:02.949
 so the Germans must be happy with that expensive calculation for you 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.849
 who will be the next champion 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.289
 I do not know I hope the money 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.520
 Well, I think it's going to be Brazil, although Spain really has an impact
