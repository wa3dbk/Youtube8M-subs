have any English players we had like a
three<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.000> four<00:01:54.210> maybe<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.810> didn't<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.079> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
three or four maybe but we didn't have a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.300 
three or four maybe but we didn't have a
law<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.619> very<00:01:55.799> annoying<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.280> know

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
law which is very annoying you know

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.310 
law which is very annoying you know
apparently<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.659> choose<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> captain<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
apparently when you choose a captain of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.750 
apparently when you choose a captain of
the<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.619> course<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.950> did<00:01:59.100> choose<00:01:59.369> Johan

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
the so of course I did choose Johan

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.330 
the so of course I did choose Johan
and<00:02:00.990> apparently<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.260> has<00:02:02.770> an<00:02:02.890> influence<00:02:03.130> on

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and apparently that has an influence on

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160 
and apparently that has an influence on
the<00:02:03.460> pack<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:03.880> for<00:02:04.090> me<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.450> really<00:02:04.720> did<00:02:04.990> not

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
the pack but for me it really did not

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.630 
the pack but for me it really did not
add<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.350> load<00:02:05.560> of<00:02:05.710> German<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.190> French<00:02:06.250> players

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
add a load of German and French players

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
which was you know just extremely

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.630

could have discovered them what's the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.040 
could have discovered them what's the
point<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.210> keeping<00:02:28.450> than<00:02:28.630> you<00:02:28.660> know<00:02:28.810> it's<00:02:28.930> just

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
point in keeping than you know it's just
