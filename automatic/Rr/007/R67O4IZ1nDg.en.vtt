00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.970
 Hello and welcome again 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.660
 at minecraft tutorial today i will 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.390
 you this 100% invisible input 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 show secret entrance and this 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.630
 works with the new snapshot 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.230
 is 14 18 or 14 w 18 a and in this 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.280
 Snapshot can slime into several 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.570
 blog etc 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.829
 and something like that and also the blocks 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.480
 they are there and I will be you 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.420
 Now show how the following works 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.539
 namely the part over there and indeed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.100
 we need a runway here and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.870
 we need a runway here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.109
 the slime blog here is the block of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 should be done away later and here 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.590
 then you throw the blocks then that 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.020
 whole opens you can do that elsewhere 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.049
 but make it very compact 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.939
 I have done so here 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.360
 this circuit is relatively simple here 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.200
 comes a block here completely on it 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.470
 and here comes a repeater on level 2 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.380
 and that's it 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.909
 and then we can do a lever 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 take to show how the whole 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.740
 this is how it works 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.479
 at the beginning and then that is retracted 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.299
 and so it will be extended again 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.840
 very nice then here is a block 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.439
 Here comes a chance to go next 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.850
 Here comes the computer then here 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.869
 of course you can also do the dropper 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.270
 to take something else 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.869
 that's up to you or that too 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.700
 let down show so then pulls 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.930
 that a little bit better 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.789
 from here you can go already input 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:12.540
 Build so then you need a hopper 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.630
 and a paul gray and a hopper my 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 map 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:23.400
 and then i hope and my card and that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.490
 It was already here if now 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.540
 blog rheinwerft then opens the 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.430
 all when you get out because here again 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.450
 then takes the whole thing tight again 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.830
 that's it, you can now 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.400
 of course, here are any blocks your 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.510
 continue to build then I would recommend 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 that means here again a bit 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.270
 einzug although there is no need 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 obsidian 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.800
 This is also quite enough here 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.050
 important is that here am 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.640
 the slum blog now for example this 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.310
 blog touched he tried the down to 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.210
 pull and that will not work 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.440
 that's why it does not work 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.820
 does that mean when you're there? 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.260
 you want to build something then you have to 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.650
 Obsidian take just like here and 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.010
 here 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.870
 and accordingly it here 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.950
 can you do it again though here too 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.960
 not because when the whole is drafted 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
 because something is not working there 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.220
 he wanted to take something with him water 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.030
 or if I'm dumb now let me completely 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.030
 think for a second 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:40.200
 somewhere he hangs here firmly I 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:43.280
 somewhere in the moment, of course 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.990
 Please excuse this blog here 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.370
 if that is there this blog can 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.020
 Of course, do not be pulled there 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.820
 I'm so sorry because I was real now 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.770
 brain fk but we can for example 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.959
 still block here but that has to block 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.290
 be obsidian 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.820
 and let's take that out again 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.080
 you see the claim block is short 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.310
 this blog and will try that 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.520
 and that would not increase 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.930
 work that way it has to be here 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.940
 of course, his obsidian 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.160
 I wanted to show that because otherwise here 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.760
 would be connected but also 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.049
 otherwise you have free choice 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.329
 now we can here for example that 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.739
 Hide a bit or something like that 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.630
 not necessarily open 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.700
 wanted to go in here or something 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.010
 Here is the exit quite a lot 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.940
 I wish I hope you could so 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.830
 help you to install it somewhere 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.919
 is in any case very secret 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.090
 you throw your blog like that and then could 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.080
 Here marching long do you need halt 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.700
 another way up 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.850
 Maybe I'll think about that too 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.560
 What I would say please forget 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.380
 not to rate and comment 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.380
 and see you next time 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.380
 partys
