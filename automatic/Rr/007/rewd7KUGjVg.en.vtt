is a
it's<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.400> lump<00:01:27.640> we're<00:01:27.910> a<00:01:27.940> bunch<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.450> fiber

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
it's a lump we're a bunch of fiber

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's a lump we're a bunch of fiber
tissues<00:01:29.530> get<00:01:29.830> together<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.580> they<00:01:30.730> form<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.330> lot

tissues get together and they form a lot

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.470

but<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.900> doesn't<00:01:31.930> turn<00:01:32.650> cancers<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:34.270> pretty

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
but it doesn't turn cancers it's pretty

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.130 
but it doesn't turn cancers it's pretty
good<00:01:34.630> to<00:01:34.720> go<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.810> didn't<00:01:37.810> want<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.020> risk

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
good to go but I didn't want to risk

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.250 
good to go but I didn't want to risk
having<00:01:38.560> another<00:01:39.130> benign<00:01:39.640> lump<00:01:40.060> in<00:01:40.330> my<00:01:40.750> body

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
having another benign lump in my body

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.590 
having another benign lump in my body
eventually<00:01:42.130> turn<00:01:42.610> into<00:01:42.640> cancer<00:01:43.000> even<00:01:43.420> though

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
eventually turn into cancer even though

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.350 
eventually turn into cancer even though
I've<00:01:43.900> been<00:01:44.110> told<00:01:44.260> they're<00:01:44.650> not<00:01:44.680> linked<00:01:45.360> but

I've been told they're not linked but

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.090 
I've been told they're not linked but

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
was told it was benign once upon a time

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.200 
was told it was benign once upon a time
and<00:01:50.710> then<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:50.920> turned<00:01:51.070> into<00:01:51.160> cancer<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:52.000> was

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
and then it turned into cancer so I was

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.340 
and then it turned into cancer so I was
about<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.570> go<00:01:52.690> around<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:54.060> however<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.720> was

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
about to go around to however I was

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.310 
about to go around to however I was
about<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.710> go<00:01:56.890> through<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:58.320> radiation

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
about to go through the radiation

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.390 
about to go through the radiation
treatment<00:01:59.470> in<00:01:59.890> October<00:02:00.760> of<00:02:00.790> last<00:02:00.940> year<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.560> it

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
treatment in October of last year so it

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.860 
treatment in October of last year so it
was<00:02:03.460> recommended<00:02:03.880> to<00:02:04.120> me<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:04.600> go<00:02:04.780> ahead

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
was recommended to me to just go ahead

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.440 
was recommended to me to just go ahead
and<00:02:05.350> go<00:02:05.500> with<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.770> radiation<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.550> then<00:02:06.790> worry

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
and go with the radiation and then worry

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.170 
and go with the radiation and then worry
about<00:02:07.540> surgery<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.680> my<00:02:08.950> breast<00:02:09.250> another<00:02:09.880> time

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
about surgery on my breast another time

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.540 
about surgery on my breast another time
because<00:02:10.710> my<00:02:11.710> body<00:02:11.980> would<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:12.610> ravaged<00:02:13.570> with

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
because my body would be ravaged with

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.890 
because my body would be ravaged with
radiation<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.330> wouldn't<00:02:16.660> be<00:02:16.720> able<00:02:16.780> to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
radiation and it wouldn't be able to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.450 
radiation and it wouldn't be able to
handle<00:02:17.350> another<00:02:18.190> extreme<00:02:19.710> surgery<00:02:20.710> until

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
handle another extreme surgery until

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.890 
handle another extreme surgery until
maybe<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.910> few<00:02:22.090> months<00:02:22.300> later<00:02:23.550> so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
maybe a few months later so

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.240 
maybe a few months later so

was<00:03:08.830> told<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.070> again<00:03:09.370> but<00:03:10.360> she<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.650> know<00:03:11.710> she

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
was told that again but she you know she

some more research on it to make sure it

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.969

from<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.310> way<00:04:21.789> it<00:04:21.970> looked<00:04:22.180> when<00:04:22.270> she<00:04:22.479> took<00:04:22.660> it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
from the way it looked when she took it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.719 
from the way it looked when she took it
out<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.650> lung<00:04:23.889> to<00:04:24.069> look<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.400> fiber

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
out the lung to look like a fiber

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.749 
out the lung to look like a fiber
adenoma<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:26.099> shouldn't<00:04:27.099> be<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.220> problem<00:04:27.370> but

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
adenoma so shouldn't be a problem but

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.580 
adenoma so shouldn't be a problem but
still<00:04:27.849> better<00:04:28.840> safe<00:04:29.110> than<00:04:29.229> sorry<00:04:29.289> to

and I kind of lost it so I saw a
counselor<00:05:40.800> from<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.370> time<00:05:41.610> that<00:05:42.060> was

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
counselor from the time that was

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
so I've been able to handle it since

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.640 
so I've been able to handle it since
then<00:05:47.430> because<00:05:47.730> it<00:05:48.390> wasn't<00:05:48.870> as<00:05:49.050> big<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.470> deal

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
then because it wasn't as big of a deal

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.450 
then because it wasn't as big of a deal
