00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.870
 today to test 350 kg of six steel 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.880
 cylinders in line 160 horses in 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.810
 european version 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.330
 welcome to the new world of the big 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.450
 tourism with the bmw k it's 100 gt 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.450
 she 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.639
 yeah 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.730
 m 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.030
 so we know that bmw is a specialist 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 six cylinders online in the world 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.430
 automotive 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.170
 this is the very first time they 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.989
 develop an engine of this 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.320
 architecture for a motorcycle his main 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.269
 characteristic 55 cm wide an engine 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.670
 extremely compact but inside 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.230
 a maximum of torque a maximum of 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.230
 sensations and also a lot of sport 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.660
 so necessarily on the part of a six 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.220
 cylinders are expected to velvety to 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.350
 sweetness to creaminess at a 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.610
 sound also we can tell you everything 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.450
 immediately we are clearly not disappointed 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.400
 this mechanics is really 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.640
 exceptional couple there are at 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.410
 resell we can evolve very often a 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.340
 even two or three reports to 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.890
 above what we are used to 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.860
 rolling and if we want the power of 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.900
 3000 to 8500 rpm 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.670
 really very very strong it's even 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.229
 amazing for a machine that is before 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.229
 everything for big tourism 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.320
 then an engine with capabilities 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.370
 sports is good still it is necessary that 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.350
 the cycle part follow 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.170
 alas once again we are really 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.729
 bluffed by what these 350 kg shows up 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.460
 really age it is manageable 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.930
 so that 's first of all to a very 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.950
 good distribution of masses a center 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.300
 of gravity placed very low 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.490
 and then things are greatly 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.050
 facilitated by a low height of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.170
 saddle by a driving position 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.140
 natural handlebars are very wide 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.010
 very backwards we really feel the 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.930
 motorcycle behavior 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.690
 so obviously question comfort and 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.620
 protection is royal 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.540
 except that precisely comfort is 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.070
 maybe a bit too good since after 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.239
 a few hundred kilometers per 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.580
 example on highway we have a little 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.350
 tendency to sink it becomes even a 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.970
 little tiring level equipment one is 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.020
 at bmw so that means equipment 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.820
 really bloated 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.190
 it is for example a regulator of 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.440
 speed control with the handlebar very 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.290
 easy to handle a board computer 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.940
 multifunctional radio besides a 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.050
 little criticism about it orders 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.950
 are placed on the left flank of 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.360
 fairing 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.220
 it's not very ergonomic compared 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.900
 the rest and precisely this computer 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.760
 multifunction ergonomics has been 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.049
 particularly worked and neat 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.430
 it's impressive 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.450
 at the beginning when we take the machine 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.709
 normal we say we're never going 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.970
 understand how it works but in 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.980
 does that come very, very fast 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.690
 you have a main switch for 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.420
 select functions a wheel 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.400
 drop down to scroll the menu and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.030
 we then click to select the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.310
 desired functions 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.840
 as usual bmw synonymous with 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.110
 security so for example you have 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.690
 obviously the bs coupled with a braking 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.340
 amplified you also have traction control 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.870
 if you are a player or could even 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.110
 disconnect one finds of course 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.400
 the duolever and paralever suspensions and 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.620
 optional on this machine 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.579
 they are associated with the esa system which 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.440
 allows you to adjust them very 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:36.040
 precisely according to various 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.130
 comfort conditions duo solo solo with 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.049
 filled suitcase is perfect we find 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.459
 a xenon optics is the first 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.530
 approval for this type of optics and 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.820
 in addition the system is directional 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.950
 that is to say that whatever the angle 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.060
 turning machine 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.500
 the light beam will go 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.019
 automatically to illuminate at best 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.209
 the road level protection on is 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.180
 obviously in the maximum domain so 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.160
 the bust extremely well protect the 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.330
 legs no swirl 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.840
 by the way if you want to have a small 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.730
 little more 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.900
 1 you have this little detail very 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.310
 practice is very effective 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.590
 we still take a little air 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.650
 on the arms and then the bubble if she 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.400
 is electrically adjustable in height 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.650
 when you ride in the rain 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.640
 it is particularly troublesome a towel 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.620
 ice cream would be really welcome 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.419
 and then still in maximum position 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.220
 it generates a stir it's a little 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.199
 move the machine ben that I think that 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.510
 it's due to both the bubble and the 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.840
 presence of the top boxes precisely this top 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.120
 16 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.130
 inside we can put two 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.590
 full- face helmets in each suitcase 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.080
 a fifteen that come in very easily 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.380
 plus some small objects we find 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.580
 also left side a small empty pocket on 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.930
 find the same right side but at 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.850
 inside there is the connection with 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.800
 a USB plug and plug to plug in 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.970
 an auxiliary drive finally there is a 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.889
 small very nice detail it's 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.560
 that we can all be closed either by 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.810
 the handlebar switch is by the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.770
 remote control that can also activate 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.770
 the tear of the motorcycle 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.250
 in conclusion it was a little while 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.110
 we expected the replacement for the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.490
 drooling without stopping is what I can 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.260
 to tell you is that the case and 100 gt 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.330
 she takes over the torch really with 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.370
 brio it's a phenomenal machine to 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.260
 use it is not without defects 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.730
 of course we have for example the selection 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.240
 speeds that is a bit closed 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.040
 noisy 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.050
 we also have some jolts of 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.520
 transmission but ultimately this six 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.800
 cylinders stuffed with technology is 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.960
 really nice to use it's 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.890
 super nice 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.300
 Besides, it's simple all 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.490
 machines that have been manufactured are already 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.420
 pre order will not be there for all 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.520
 world before a few months 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.200
 excuse me but I'm still going 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.200
 enjoy a little bit go hi 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.650
 going
