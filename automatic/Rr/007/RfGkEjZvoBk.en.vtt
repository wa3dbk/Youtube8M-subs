00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
seems to be snapped in all the way and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.600 
seems to be snapped in all the way and
yeah<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.380> if<00:01:27.860> you<00:01:28.010> put<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.280> in<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.490> way

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.790 
yeah it if you put it in all the way
although<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.480> know<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:29.830> it's<00:01:30.830> easy<00:01:31.160> to<00:01:32.800> do

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
although you know what it's easy to do

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.410 
although you know what it's easy to do
that<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.820> see<00:01:34.970> how<00:01:35.060> there<00:01:35.210> could<00:01:35.360> be

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
that so I can see how there could be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.230 
that so I can see how there could be
some<00:01:35.890> issue<00:01:36.890> with<00:01:37.070> it<00:01:37.400> falling<00:01:37.730> out<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.090> as

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
some issue with it falling out but as

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.710 
some issue with it falling out but as
far<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:38.450> oh<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:38.750> feels<00:01:38.930> that<00:01:39.230> feels<00:01:39.530> nice<00:01:39.770> I

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.690 
far as oh it feels that feels nice I
would<00:01:41.720> feel<00:01:41.870> nicer<00:01:42.230> if<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.530> analog<00:01:43.400> sticks

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
would feel nicer if the analog sticks

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.040 
would feel nicer if the analog sticks
are<00:01:43.850> up<00:01:43.940> here<00:01:44.150> instead<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.450> down<00:01:44.660> here<00:01:44.930> but

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
Captain I think I'll get used to it I

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.380 
Captain I think I'll get used to it I
don't<00:02:43.340> think<00:02:43.370> there's<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:43.970> much<00:02:44.180> they

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
don't think there's really much they

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.479 
don't think there's really much they
could<00:02:44.450> do<00:02:44.690> about<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.959> to<00:02:45.200> make<00:02:45.320> that<00:02:45.590> button

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
could do about it to make that button

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.850 
could do about it to make that button
press<00:02:46.840> kind<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.930> hard<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.200> push<00:02:48.440> but<00:02:48.680> yeah

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
press kind of hard to push but yeah

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.120 
press kind of hard to push but yeah
overall<00:02:49.160> it's<00:02:49.459> it's<00:02:49.730> good<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.480> try<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:51.130> think

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
overall it's it's good just try I think

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.000 
overall it's it's good just try I think
unless<00:02:52.340> you<00:02:52.519> really<00:02:53.530> yeah<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.560> think<00:02:54.739> it's

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
unless you really yeah I think it's

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.470 
unless you really yeah I think it's
unlikely<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.790> would<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:56.030> playing<00:02:56.239> it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
unlikely that you would be playing it

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.229 
unlikely that you would be playing it
and<00:02:56.630> cause<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:57.140> fall<00:02:57.440> out<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:58.580> even<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.090> it

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
and cause it to fall out is even that it

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.460 
and cause it to fall out is even that it
still<00:02:59.480> doesn't<00:02:59.690> going<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.870> come<00:02:59.989> out<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.290> yeah

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
still doesn't going to come out so yeah

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.720 
still doesn't going to come out so yeah
overall<00:03:00.860> I'd<00:03:00.980> say<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.430> pretty<00:03:01.640> cool

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
overall I'd say this is pretty cool

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.880 
overall I'd say this is pretty cool
looking<00:03:02.090> forward<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.600> using<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:03.310> next

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.340 

is<00:03:08.200> also<00:03:09.200> from<00:03:09.410> PDP<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.970> polling<00:03:11.569> go<00:03:11.750> folio

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.640 
the ultimate organization protection
solution<00:03:14.780> I'm<00:03:15.050> not<00:03:15.170> going<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.380> read<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.590> other

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
solution I'm not going to read the other

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.320 
solution I'm not going to read the other
languages<00:03:16.040> because<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.310> can't<00:03:17.170> write<00:03:18.170> okay

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
languages because I can't write okay

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.309 
languages because I can't write okay
obviously<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.450> holds<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> lot<00:03:20.750> more<00:03:20.990> stuff<00:03:21.260> than

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
obviously it holds a lot more stuff than

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.430 
obviously it holds a lot more stuff than
your<00:03:21.620> typical<00:03:21.940> v<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.120> case<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:24.110> for<00:03:24.320> me

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
your typical v that case so like for me

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.040 
your typical v that case so like for me
I<00:03:24.470> was<00:03:24.830> on<00:03:25.010> vacation<00:03:25.550> for<00:03:25.870> over<00:03:26.870> two<00:03:27.020> weeks

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
it's nice to have something that can

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.400 
it's nice to have something that can
hold<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.330> bit<00:03:29.480> more<00:03:29.660> I'm<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.020> going<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.230> go

somewhere for a few hours you know I

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.360 
somewhere for a few hours you know I
don't<00:03:32.959> mind<00:03:33.200> using<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.560> smaller<00:03:33.830> case<00:03:34.100> but

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
don't mind using a smaller case but

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.750 
don't mind using a smaller case but
anyway<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.330> like<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.410> look<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.709> this<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.730> far

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
anyway I like the look of this so so far

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.840 
anyway I like the look of this so so far
so<00:03:41.000> good<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:42.739> as<00:03:43.280> if<00:03:43.459> it<00:03:43.610> looks<00:03:43.760> like

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
so good and then as if it looks like

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.290 
so good and then as if it looks like
it's<00:03:44.560> sturdy

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:55.070 

oh<00:03:51.290> yeah<00:03:52.290> lots<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:52.770> room<00:03:52.920> for<00:03:53.130> games<00:03:53.960> and<00:03:54.960> then

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
oh yeah lots of room for games and then

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.600 
oh yeah lots of room for games and then
you<00:03:55.170> can<00:03:55.320> put<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.590> charger<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.100> stuff<00:03:56.310> here

you can put your charger and stuff here
and<00:03:56.810> then<00:03:57.810> one<00:03:57.960> thing<00:03:57.990> I<00:03:58.170> like<00:03:58.320> about<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.680> is

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
and then one thing I like about this is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.920 
and then one thing I like about this is
if<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.310> just<00:03:59.520> want<00:03:59.700> this<00:03:59.760> one<00:04:00.000> case<00:04:00.360> like<00:04:00.810> I

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
if you just want this one case like I

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.330 
if you just want this one case like I
was<00:04:01.050> just<00:04:01.080> saying<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.590> can<00:04:01.740> just<00:04:01.920> keep<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.250> in

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
was just saying you can just keep it in

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.770 
was just saying you can just keep it in
here<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:03.570> case<00:04:03.870> also<00:04:04.110> has<00:04:05.570> slots<00:04:06.570> are

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
here and this case also has slots are

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.660 
here and this case also has slots are
for<00:04:06.960> vita<00:04:07.200> games<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:08.370> that's<00:04:08.760> pretty<00:04:09.000> cool

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
for vita games so that's pretty cool

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.800 
for vita games so that's pretty cool
another<00:04:11.670> thing<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:11.940> I've<00:04:12.150> been<00:04:12.270> wanting<00:04:12.450> for

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
another thing that I've been wanting for

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.960 
another thing that I've been wanting for
some<00:04:12.990> time<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.380> case<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.830> big<00:04:14.040> enough<00:04:14.070> to

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
some time is a case it's big enough to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.650 
some time is a case it's big enough to
hold<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.300> veto<00:04:15.480> while<00:04:15.810> it's<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.260> like<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:17.660> grip

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
hold the veto while it's in like a grip

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.650 
hold the veto while it's in like a grip
case<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.560> I'm<00:04:20.010> wondering<00:04:20.330> if<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.480> would

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
case and I'm wondering if this would

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.310 
case and I'm wondering if this would
work<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:22.380> oh<00:04:23.300> yeah<00:04:24.300> there's<00:04:24.900> plenty<00:04:25.200> of<00:04:25.230> room

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
work so oh yeah there's plenty of room

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.960 
work so oh yeah there's plenty of room
there<00:04:25.470> but<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:25.980> problem<00:04:26.310> is<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.580> not<00:04:26.670> really

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
there but the problem is it's not really

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.620 
there but the problem is it's not really
very<00:04:27.720> well<00:04:27.960> protected<00:04:28.460> so<00:04:29.460> I<00:04:29.670> don't<00:04:30.330> know<00:04:30.420> I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
very well protected so I don't know I

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.590 
very well protected so I don't know I
guess<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.230> could<00:04:31.380> put<00:04:31.530> it<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.600> close

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
guess I could put it like that and close

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.200 
guess I could put it like that and close
it<00:04:36.470> well<00:04:37.470> it's<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:38.040> solution<00:04:38.310> i<00:04:38.670> guess<00:04:38.850> but<00:04:39.060> it's

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
it well it's a solution i guess but it's

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.420 
it well it's a solution i guess but it's
not<00:04:39.390> very<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:40.440> not<00:04:40.620> ideal<00:04:40.740> because<00:04:41.160> you're

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
not very it's not ideal because you're

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.630 
not very it's not ideal because you're
not<00:04:41.550> protecting<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.120> screen<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:43.640> there's

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
not protecting the screen and there's

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.790 
not protecting the screen and there's
not<00:04:44.820> much<00:04:45.000> padding<00:04:45.270> on<00:04:45.600> this<00:04:45.960> part<00:04:46.230> right<00:04:46.500> oh

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
not much padding on this part right oh

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.540 
not much padding on this part right oh
so<00:04:47.400> that's<00:04:47.520> here<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:49.470> but<00:04:49.890> yeah<00:04:50.040> this<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.520> a

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
so that's here so but yeah this is a

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.110 
so that's here so but yeah this is a
good<00:04:51.410> solution<00:04:52.410> i<00:04:52.770> think<00:04:53.010> i<00:04:53.130> paid<00:04:53.340> only<00:04:53.550> what

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
good solution i think i paid only what

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.990 
good solution i think i paid only what
maybe<00:04:54.690> twenty<00:04:55.050> dollars<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:55.760> not<00:04:56.760> sure

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
maybe twenty dollars for this not sure

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
maybe twenty dollars for this not sure
but

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
but

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.719 
but
I<00:05:00.120> like<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.889> also<00:05:02.889> like<00:05:05.009> so<00:05:06.009> here's<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.520> case

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
I like it I also like so here's the case

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.689 
I like it I also like so here's the case
moving<00:05:07.479> in<00:05:07.629> here<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.409> it's<00:05:09.069> got<00:05:09.280> grooves

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
moving in here and it's got grooves

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.010 
moving in here and it's got grooves
built<00:05:10.360> in<00:05:10.539> here<00:05:11.190> to<00:05:12.270> accommodate<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.629> analog

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
built in here to accommodate the analog

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.899 
built in here to accommodate the analog
sticks<00:05:14.379> you<00:05:14.590> can<00:05:14.770> see<00:05:14.949> and<00:05:15.639> then<00:05:15.759> when<00:05:15.849> you

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
sticks you can see and then when you

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.059 
sticks you can see and then when you
want<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:16.120> take<00:05:16.270> it<00:05:16.300> out<00:05:16.509> you<00:05:16.539> just<00:05:16.949> pull<00:05:17.949> on

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
want to take it out you just pull on

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.999 
want to take it out you just pull on
this<00:05:18.250> comes<00:05:19.000> out<00:05:19.259> that's<00:05:20.259> pretty<00:05:20.440> cool<00:05:20.560> seems

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
this comes out that's pretty cool seems

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:27.390 
this comes out that's pretty cool seems
to<00:05:21.159> protect<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.639> pretty<00:05:21.789> well<00:05:25.889> yeah<00:05:26.889> I'm<00:05:27.129> a<00:05:27.159> fan

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
to protect it pretty well yeah I'm a fan

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.100 
to protect it pretty well yeah I'm a fan
of<00:05:27.430> this<00:05:27.639> case<00:05:27.879> I<00:05:28.060> think<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:28.629> then<00:05:28.720> you<00:05:28.840> put<00:05:29.020> it

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
of this case I think so then you put it

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.450 
of this case I think so then you put it
on<00:05:29.199> like<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.759> you<00:05:30.759> ready<00:05:30.940> to<00:05:31.090> go<00:05:31.979> and<00:05:34.199> hmm<00:05:35.199> I

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
on like that you ready to go and hmm I

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.390 
on like that you ready to go and hmm I
do<00:05:36.460> have<00:05:36.639> a<00:05:36.759> template<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.389> zippers<00:05:38.400> hopefully

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
do have a template the zippers hopefully

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.800 
do have a template the zippers hopefully
will<00:05:39.580> last<00:05:39.759> a<00:05:39.909> long<00:05:40.000> time<00:05:40.060> like<00:05:40.449> I<00:05:40.539> think<00:05:40.750> it

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
will last a long time like I think it

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.379 
will last a long time like I think it
might<00:05:40.930> be<00:05:40.990> serve<00:05:41.470> you<00:05:41.620> look<00:05:41.740> for<00:05:41.889> last<00:05:42.069> a<00:05:42.190> while

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
might be serve you look for last a while

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.529 
might be serve you look for last a while
but<00:05:43.389> it's<00:05:43.539> not<00:05:44.220> we<00:05:45.220> are<00:05:45.370> opening<00:05:45.970> it<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.330> seems

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
but it's not we are opening it it seems

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.469 
but it's not we are opening it it seems
to<00:05:46.690> be<00:05:46.810> all<00:05:46.900> right<00:05:47.550> but<00:05:48.550> then<00:05:48.729> just<00:05:49.000> now<00:05:49.180> as<00:05:49.360> you

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
to be all right but then just now as you

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.930 
to be all right but then just now as you
might<00:05:49.630> have<00:05:49.690> seen<00:05:49.780> what<00:05:50.020> I<00:05:50.080> was<00:05:50.199> closing<00:05:50.530> it

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
might have seen what I was closing it

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.309 
might have seen what I was closing it
kind<00:05:51.940> of<00:05:52.000> touches<00:05:52.389> I<00:05:52.569> know<00:05:52.900> it's<00:05:53.050> working

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
kind of touches I know it's working

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.260 
kind of touches I know it's working
better<00:05:53.440> so<00:05:53.740> maybe<00:05:54.639> you<00:05:54.789> just<00:05:54.849> have<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.090> break

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
better so maybe you just have to break

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.719 
better so maybe you just have to break
it<00:05:55.419> in<00:05:55.509> use<00:05:55.979> but<00:05:56.979> yeah<00:05:57.159> I<00:05:57.190> think<00:05:57.340> I<00:05:57.610> would

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729 
it in use but yeah I think I would

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:58.890 
it in use but yeah I think I would
recommend<00:05:57.969> both<00:05:58.240> of<00:05:58.419> these<00:05:58.509> products

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
recommend both of these products

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.580 
recommend both of these products
obviously<00:05:59.020> I<00:05:59.259> haven't<00:05:59.440> used<00:05:59.710> them<00:05:59.860> at<00:06:00.580> all<00:06:01.590> but

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
obviously I haven't used them at all but

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.379 
obviously I haven't used them at all but

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
in there and I actually have a couple

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.279 
in there and I actually have a couple
though<00:06:43.380> so<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.889> think<00:06:44.370> this<00:06:44.639> will<00:06:44.759> be<00:06:44.819> my<00:06:45.289> main

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.289 
though so I think this will be my main

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.860 
though so I think this will be my main
case<00:06:46.639> when<00:06:47.639> I'm<00:06:47.759> going<00:06:48.240> in<00:06:48.330> a<00:06:48.419> row<00:06:48.539> or<00:06:48.720> more

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
case when I'm going in a row or more

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.260 
case when I'm going in a row or more
than<00:06:49.020> just<00:06:49.169> the<00:06:49.860> day<00:06:50.120> pretty<00:06:51.120> cool<00:06:51.360> and<00:06:51.630> I

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
than just the day pretty cool and I

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.719 
than just the day pretty cool and I
might<00:06:54.270> experiment<00:06:54.690> with<00:06:54.990> keeping<00:06:55.319> this

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:55.729 
might experiment with keeping this

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.620 
might experiment with keeping this
keeping<00:06:56.729> the<00:06:56.819> Vita<00:06:57.000> in<00:06:57.150> there<00:06:57.300> and<00:06:57.419> then<00:06:57.509> just

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
keeping the Vita in there and then just

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.089 
keeping the Vita in there and then just
like<00:06:57.780> wrapping<00:06:58.169> something<00:06:58.440> around<00:06:58.740> it<00:06:58.949> so<00:06:59.069> it

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
like wrapping something around it so it

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.189 
like wrapping something around it so it
isn't<00:06:59.190> it<00:06:59.400> scratched<00:06:59.669> up<00:06:59.849> but<00:07:00.569> anyway<00:07:00.960> I've

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 
isn't it scratched up but anyway I've

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.600 
isn't it scratched up but anyway I've
gone<00:07:01.349> on<00:07:01.410> long<00:07:01.680> enough<00:07:01.710> thanks<00:07:02.190> for<00:07:02.310> watching

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
gone on long enough thanks for watching

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.360 
gone on long enough thanks for watching
