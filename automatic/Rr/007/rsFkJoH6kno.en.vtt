00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.490
 welcome back off body and get moved 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.960
 are not chic and send them today 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 new gameplay for you on the man 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 drove a Remington today once a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.960
 shock and I 'll go along nicely 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.760
 it was supposed to be right the first day 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.010
 I mix and play some stuff pot 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 charter each other and this is already one 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 nice result you on kill confirmed 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.640
 I drove finish 4210 with a you go 4 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 county free on it already 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.420
 and that in itself is super good I think 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.640
 I think remington is the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.559
 best shot can still have so far I have 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.030
 still not use everything of course i am 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.430
 started today so a whole 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 hard to say but then I find it 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.329
 really a beast he will do it later 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.899
 I will soon have a streak and see 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.550
 that is actually just nice and clean 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.500
 is just pee you know 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.820

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.039
 qrow i'll win you'll find it all 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 talked to him about live stream yesterday 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.719
 maybe blackops second part 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.260
 yes it went one time 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.580
 bit good other time not and I have 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.130
 nw3 done it already went a bit 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.409
 better in my opinion I had too 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.390
 a lot of kills the mole had two molotovs 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.000
 also had almost double moab and I know then 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.580
 not that was in my opinion latitude 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.140
 gameplay black movement ran yesterday 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.170
 not quite i don't know what it is like 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.970
 maybe the yes effe effe deo or something 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.110
 I know a lot but that will happen 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 of course we go because I stay 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.950
 post on line as you see well 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.329
 agree quixote game gameplay i think 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.729
 will agree once a bit 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.479
 who will try to switch with you 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.189
 number of gameplay and I don't know my 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.380
 Shop their class now asks you yes 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.110
 I have got here 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 lightweight if it's good and then ghost 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.570
 I am the second scavenger in the park 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.909
 and thirdly I was that extreme 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.689
 conditioner 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.380
 and dad on him another one I still had 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.090
 a 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.729
 I no longer know exactly which that was 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.950
 dutchtuber tee or so from that direction and 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.600
 then play crooked jimmy buy ugly 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.289
 fear fences down I have no bottles 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.179
 no 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.709
 I know a lot because that is the data 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.640
 found the slots too few I just 5 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.379
 burken 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.230
 and two edge mine because i like the laser 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.370
 sight and long barrel on my one 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.030
 remington 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.430
 yeah so yeah I was playing, and yes 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.989
 i 'm going well but i just had it 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.860
 a live streams I have punished the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.360
 went live again and experienced 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.400
 which joy so you just get really 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.170
 crazy about me you also fight a small 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.329
 little had i left but i left too 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.370
 the excess in their tug 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.290
 So I pull this no longer required to 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.920
 therefrom my life three months live stream 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.620
 me 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.760
 paul just went for a yes to one 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.170
 little 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.519
 well how can i say clear little one 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.480
 bicycle 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.400
 and that was noticeable that that too 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.870
 Ark bike has bratwurst army too 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.519
 apps channel set 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.019
 there you can for him if you want to know 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.970
 what it was you can go to his channel 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.730
 bratwurst an army 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.829
 know you most people to and 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.959
 he just talked about what happened 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.599
 when in the middle of the live stream 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.030
 happened because you didn't hear that and 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.410
 yes so that we leave it at that 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.739
 because I am talking about my one 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.500
 little gimple what you have what hopefully 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.819
 likes whether I am yes or not a feather 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.620
 nice the must just say because me 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.389
 can't shop so well I can play 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.220
 do n't know all those routes to walk 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.319
 I just know you can shoot it 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.239
 button and go with that banana 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.160
 so don't expect too much of course 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.440
 but my remmington i know a lot 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.720

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.519
 shawty who can really beast with a shun 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.079
 I can learn a lot from I go 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.310
 just train gameplay a bit 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.169
 view how he walks how his 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.590
 running lines and hopefully I can 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.419
 teach them and that you simply 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.250

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.370
 with a shot 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.620

 did I always follow and yes but 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.580

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.840
