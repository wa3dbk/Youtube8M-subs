00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 does not exist 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.400
 question number 58 in an ice cream parlor 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 come cones each cone has three balls 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.050
 of ice cream of different flavors and two 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.480
 sauces the flavors of the balls of 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.060
 ice cream are chocolate vanilla arequipe 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.060
 lemon and chewing gum and the sauces are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.500
 chocolate and strawberry the total amount of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.920
 ways that you can combine the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.170
 flavors and the sauces in the cones are 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 as we can observe the flavors of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.630
 chocolate are 1 2 3 4 we made the 5 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.380
 let's choose 3 the first flavor what 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.980
 you can take the second in 5 ways 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.800
 I can choose flavor in four ways 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.090
 and the third flavor I have to choose 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.260
 Three ways but what happens the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.750
 sites with the three flavors abyc 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:10.870
 it's the same as choosing the flavor 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:17.300
 and go and it's the same as choosing the flavor 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:24.250
 ba6 and it's the same as c &amp; a and it's the same 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:27.050
 taste looks and it's the same taste you see 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.810
 it means that here they are also all 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.869
 these repeated therefore I have to 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.790
 divide the result that I have here between 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:42.080
 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 flavors 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.780
 by the number of sauces in the rises not 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.060
 I have no problem because I want to 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.260
 choose two sauces and there are only two 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.280
 then I will choose to multiply by 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:02:01.310
 one therefore I have to live between 6 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:05.430
 5 for 4 20 for 360 sense between 6 10 10 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.300
 for a 10 10 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.060
 ways 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.750
 therefore the correct answer and the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.750
 yes 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.829
 do not 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 and
