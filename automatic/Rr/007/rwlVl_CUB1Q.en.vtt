00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 at the sinus study has become clear how diverse and 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.569
 complex the group of migrants in Germany is an example of this 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.940
 we see Lipka years ago the 38-year-old crutch covers in Mannheim 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.430
 and dared some time ago to turn his life upside down and his 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.529
 Passion to devote to photography 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.680
 meanwhile he is in the renowned catalog Blickfang under Germany 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:29.339
 Best photographers listed on his customer list are big names of 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.809
 Companies and personalities from Germany Holland Turkey Rousseau 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.809
 Menacher introduced us now 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.780
 because lease Yerlikaya takes the camera in hand 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.930
 there are still questions for everyone at any time then there are only 10 still motive and 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.280
 the search for the perfect picture 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.940
 Every new second is a chance to change your life without it 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.400
 Motto while Likar staged today probably still in management 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.130
 just under a year and a half ago, he studied marketing and sales 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.180
 Exploring the decision to turn his hobby into a profession he quit his job 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 Contracted with a large Mannheim company and made his own 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.640
 Photo Studio on it was a very tough decision because he was not up from today 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.299
 Tomorrow is about decisions but of course I have the beginning 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.799
 Not in the market also called by many headhunters 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.790
 I would like to work like the sales and marketing manager 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.790
 The decision is then, in principle, is that I have said 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.190
 Live once more in this world and have a dream come true 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.619
 to photograph her victory eggs 15 years ago with the birth of his daughter 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.760
 he bought a professional camera 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.240
 and look one picture at a time by not taking pictures like that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.539
 When I wanted that, I started researching 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.189
 Attended seminars attended courses I just continued to educate and did 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.289
 seen that in principle it is with passion for me and has that 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.439
 ever expanding and professionals had reaped Seat March in the meantime 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.159
 He has his own nearly 400 square meter studio 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.329
 in the middle of Mannheim and is internationally recognized as a photographer 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.069
 For singer Jay Kay he was born in Turkey when he was four 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.359
 but his parents moved to Germany several times as a child between the two 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.469
 Countries back and forth 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.769
 that still shapes his life today, so I think that will not happen either 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.509
 change because my parents live in Turkey but somehow feel in 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:28.410
 Germany stay 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.840
 and internationally, there is no problem in three 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.019
 Hours Istanbul 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.559
 and also six seven hours to Berlin so on it says about no 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.420
 The more the fact that he deals with German and Turkish culture 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:41.809
 grew up 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:47.069
 is for the 38-year-old photographer something of which he personally as well 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.269
 also profited professionally I think trains have the discipline of 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.299
 German and and Russian of the temperamental kill 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.439
 "I can do both 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.109
 Take advantage of it and get my opinions and percent from Walton too 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.119
 look a little bit and also deal with the whole and myself more closely 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.650
 to make the best out of it and that's what it's all about for both of you 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.029
 Cultures also understand a cultural diversity as its work 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.620
 Photographer influenced tells Egli Kaya 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.650
 So photography is always such an overall product for me, I do not see it as 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.630
 Dimension photography but also to deal with humans 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.090
 who is in front of the camera and therefore this interesting person for me 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.770
 who are also interesting to work or who have other CVs 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.130
 also from other cultures com where I do not know what my dream is 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.790
 Argentina photograph Zuckerberg Ronny to the area he is natural 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.070
 not bad a dream that will eventually come true 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.040
 just as it started barely a year and a half ago that was natural 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.950
 sold out to work 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.370
 but as a full-time that never thought I always weekend so 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.609
 already photographed for 4 already 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.139
 but never heard that i said i will live a lot of it 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.340
 will also have in the name what we are very fast now in the hands 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:00.959
 I would like to say that happened, we actually had me 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:01.739
 as fast as I dreamed
