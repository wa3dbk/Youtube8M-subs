characters<00:00:43.809> realism<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.679> me<00:00:44.800> felt<00:00:45.129> like<00:00:45.160> it

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
characters realism to me felt like it

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.560 
characters realism to me felt like it
would<00:00:45.429> be<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:45.640> hardest<00:00:45.910> thing<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.149> me<00:00:46.300> to<00:00:46.359> get

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
would be the hardest thing for me to get

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.569 
would be the hardest thing for me to get
into<00:00:46.840> and<00:00:47.140> understand<00:00:47.590> I<00:00:47.920> mean<00:00:48.370> I've<00:00:48.550> been

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
into and understand I mean I've been

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.549 
into and understand I mean I've been
going<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.269> art<00:00:49.480> school<00:00:49.539> and<00:00:49.750> not<00:00:50.079> learning<00:00:50.260> in

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
going to art school and not learning in

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.919 
going to art school and not learning in
painting<00:00:51.160> or<00:00:51.339> drawing<00:00:52.179> or<00:00:52.480> anything<00:00:52.690> like

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
painting or drawing or anything like

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.259 
painting or drawing or anything like
that<00:00:52.989> it's<00:00:53.320> all<00:00:53.410> self-taught<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.250> I<00:00:54.730> basically

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
that it's all self-taught so I basically

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:56.880 
that it's all self-taught so I basically
just<00:00:55.570> buckled<00:00:56.440> down

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
just buckled down

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.489 
just buckled down
I<00:00:57.149> scored<00:00:58.149> a<00:00:58.300> couple<00:00:58.420> gigs<00:00:58.749> doing<00:00:59.109> stuff<00:00:59.350> where

00:00:59.489 --> 00:00:59.499 
I scored a couple gigs doing stuff where

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.599 
I scored a couple gigs doing stuff where
I<00:00:59.530> could<00:00:59.649> just<00:00:59.800> kind<00:00:59.890> of<00:01:00.010> practice<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.519> get

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
I could just kind of practice and get

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.849 
I could just kind of practice and get
paid<00:01:00.879> but<00:01:01.870> I<00:01:01.899> didn't<00:01:02.170> want<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.410> do<00:01:02.499> regular

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
paid but I didn't want to do regular

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.259 
paid but I didn't want to do regular
characters<00:01:03.249> I<00:01:03.370> kind<00:01:03.550> of<00:01:03.579> wanted<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.909> mix<00:01:04.089> them

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
characters I kind of wanted to mix them

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.990 
characters I kind of wanted to mix them
up<00:01:04.420> with<00:01:05.379> my<00:01:05.409> abstract<00:01:06.040> letterforms<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.850> my

up with my abstract letterforms and my

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.930 
up with my abstract letterforms and my
half<00:01:07.180> Jack's<00:01:07.390> ideas<00:01:07.890> my<00:01:08.890> surreal<00:01:09.250> and<00:01:09.580> other

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
half Jack's ideas my surreal and other

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.430 
half Jack's ideas my surreal and other
aspects<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:10.420> flauta<00:01:10.690> influenced<00:01:11.110> what<00:01:11.230> I<00:01:11.290> get

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
aspects and flauta influenced what I get

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.770 
aspects and flauta influenced what I get

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
for fine art graphic design architecture

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.590 
for fine art graphic design architecture
terior<00:01:14.380> design<00:01:14.680> fashion<00:01:15.370> so<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.120> tend<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.420> apply

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
terior design fashion so I tend to apply

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.650 
terior design fashion so I tend to apply
all<00:01:16.960> those<00:01:17.110> things<00:01:17.380> at<00:01:17.560> once<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:18.730> feel<00:01:19.480> that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
all those things at once I feel that

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.270 
all those things at once I feel that
complements<00:01:20.170> each<00:01:20.200> other<00:01:20.440> real<00:01:20.680> well<00:01:20.860> if<00:01:21.160> I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
complements each other real well if I

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.320 
complements each other real well if I
can<00:01:21.430> figure<00:01:21.610> out<00:01:21.730> a<00:01:21.880> way<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.120> do<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:24.330> somewhat

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
can figure out a way to do it somewhat

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.950 
can figure out a way to do it somewhat
geometrical<00:01:26.070> doing<00:01:27.070> these<00:01:27.220> two<00:01:27.430> basically<00:01:28.390> on

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
geometrical doing these two basically on

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.840 
geometrical doing these two basically on
both<00:01:29.230> ends<00:01:29.710> kind<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.070> complements<00:01:30.550> each<00:01:30.640> other

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
both ends kind of complements each other

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
both ends kind of complements each other
and<00:01:31.000> kind<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.210> makes<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.480> work<00:01:31.630> automatically

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
and kind of makes it work automatically

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.170 
and kind of makes it work automatically
same<00:01:33.340> thing<00:01:33.580> also<00:01:33.910> bite<00:01:34.090> bite<00:01:34.380> using

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
same thing also bite bite using

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.990 
same thing also bite bite using
basically<00:01:37.180> the<00:01:37.270> same<00:01:37.570> shapes<00:01:38.760> they<00:01:39.760> kind<00:01:39.970> of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
basically the same shapes they kind of

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.330 
basically the same shapes they kind of
look<00:01:40.150> like<00:01:40.200> pillars<00:01:41.200> or<00:01:41.470> bookends

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
look like pillars or bookends

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.240 
look like pillars or bookends
some<00:01:43.939> what<00:01:44.090> mirror<00:01:44.299> images<00:01:44.659> that<00:01:44.869> kind<00:01:45.049> of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
some what mirror images that kind of

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.039 
some what mirror images that kind of
basically<00:01:46.250> give<00:01:47.000> automatic<00:01:47.539> balance<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.960> this

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
basically give automatic balance to this

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.050 
basically give automatic balance to this
wall<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:48.950> have<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.369> large<00:01:49.549> centerpiece

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
wall so you have the large centerpiece

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.940 
wall so you have the large centerpiece
in<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.270> middle<00:01:50.509> a<00:01:50.659> two<00:01:50.990> at<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.259> end<00:01:51.289> you

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
in the middle a two at the end you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.319 
in the middle a two at the end you
pretty<00:01:52.130> much<00:01:52.219> do<00:01:52.399> what<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.610> want<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:52.969> then<00:01:53.060> in

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
pretty much do what you want and then in

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.419 
pretty much do what you want and then in
between<00:01:53.450> that<00:01:53.810> because<00:01:54.200> those<00:01:54.890> anchors<00:01:55.280> are
