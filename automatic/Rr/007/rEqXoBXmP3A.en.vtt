 pcs 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 series 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.910
 this is the goal as mayor is 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.540

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.160

 happy population is a pretty concept 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 complex but the producer managed to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.719
 make the game more accessible to beginners 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 making some modifications as fact 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.829
 You no longer need to create 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.350
 manually entire grid and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.690
 underground plumbing in your city 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.520
 another novelty is that you can choose 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.120
 a specialization for your city 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.010
 such as mining or even casinos and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.320
 depending on your choice you receive 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.400
 specific advantages for acquiring 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.400
 certain resources 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.200
 this new system encourages you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 interact with your neighbors since your 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.350
 region is surrounded by cities of other 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 players 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.030
 a new feature that gives you the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 possibility of selling its resources or 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.759
 import services that are missing 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 in your city for example 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.229
 but your actions will not only affect 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.750
 your neighbors thanks to the sim system 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.299
 Syrian word all connected players 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.119
 will influence what happens in the world 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.640
 of the game if many people are looking for 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.130
 same product your price may increase 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.500
 in the global market or whether several 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.630
 players have heavily polluted cities 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.260
 and this could lead to a major problem 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.330
 environmental 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.950
 is a very interesting system that 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.799
 encourage players to take 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.630
 decisions not only thinking in your city 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.490
 however the big problem is that you are 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.950
 obliged to always be connected to the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.619
 internet to play and after launch 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.810
 the servers are suffering from 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.250
 overcrowding, which makes 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.600
 gamers have to wait in a row 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.600
 to start a match 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.569
 an amendment that should not please 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.880
 gamers who used to build 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.310
 gigantic metropolis in others 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.860
 series is that the maximum size 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.870
 of cities was reduced, leaving the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.100
 similar to the average cities of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.470
 city ​​4 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.910
 but according to the director of the game this 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.220
 should increase in the future. 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.080
 despite the smaller sizes of cities 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.360
 impressed even more by the 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.250
 of visual details 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.340
 this happens thanks to the new engine 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.769
 graphic called glassbox that was created 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.920
 especially for the game and allows 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.780

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.019
 you can see even each of your 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.019
 residents 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.579
 released exclusively for pcs if 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.790
 inserts should also win a version 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.950
 for mac until June of this year and the game 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.230
 still has a limited edition that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.209
 puts super heroes and villains to shake 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.209
 still more the routine of society
