00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
rocketry could not be really cool we've

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
rocketry could not be really cool we've
awakened<00:01:39.360> are<00:01:39.540> obviously<00:01:40.110> we've<00:01:40.320> waking

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that's not awakened is electro at the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
that's not awakened is electro at the
top<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> he's<00:01:44.430> literally<00:01:44.759> supposed<00:01:45.720> some<00:01:45.960> of
