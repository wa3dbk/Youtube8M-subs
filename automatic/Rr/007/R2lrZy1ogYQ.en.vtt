00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 or legend all welcome to a new 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.719
 video in this community thanks for 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.400
 tune in our channel today 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.320
 As you can see, it's a boxing 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.999
 thanks to the online store and that has 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.230
 facilitated this speaker so that 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.769
 we could do what is the review in 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.660
 our channel 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.769
 possibly in another video we are going to do 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.119
 what the draw so you can 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.580
 participate in the draw we will do it 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.650
 international but before that we're going to 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.599
 do what it is that are the first 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.070
 impressions before continuing with the video 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.349
 I want to give you what my opinion is 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.239
 about this of this device the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.250
 true its short price that are twenty 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.480
 euros fully satisfies the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.670
 needs at the time we hear 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.350
 music in no time then it 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.390
 will distort the sound at the time 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.250
 give full volume and I try it 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.510
 you may try that at the time 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.460
 buy it and connect it to your 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.050
 device will have an excellent 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.149
 sound and the truth because it's worth it 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.500
 which is the investment well as you can see 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.640
 we have what is the box that has a 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.559
 nice finish if we open it 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.719
 completely as we can see we can 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.940
 find what is the device itself 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.109
 what is the charger that later 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.789
 let's talk a little about what is the 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.130
 battery also at the bottom we can 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.400
 find what is the manual that the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.750
 true 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
 nowadays nobody reads the manuals 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.710
 we always look for what is on the internet 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.450
 here we have what is the device 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.400
 comes with our three things what is 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
 the manual or on the battery charged and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 of course what the speaker is like 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.980
 can see here we have what is a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.440
 device in which it has an aspect 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.450
 completely elegant compact and a 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.430
 Well-designed design can really 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.780
 be easy to carry on any side 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.390
 at the time that we want to enjoy 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.610
 a favorite music something I want 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.840
 emphasize them and I mentioned them to the beginning 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.100
 Video is that at the time 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.230
 let's connect this speaker in our 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.090
 device we will notice that if you 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.200
 We give full volume to our 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.729
 device at the time we are 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.530
 listening to music the speaker in no 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.540
 the music will always be saturated 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.070
 it will sound completely clear and the truth 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.810
 It is a point in favor at the time 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.700
 let's buy this speaker 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.650
 if we talk about its scope it can reach 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.510
 simultaneously transmit one 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.920
 distance of 15 meters which 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.290
 So far, it has become the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.000
 Longest distance you can transmit 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.740
 what is a speaker that connects to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.240
 through the bluetooth well if we talk about 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.500
 the autonomy that the most important to the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.930
 when we bought a device 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.759
 This laptop can last you from 15 to 20 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.400
 hours continuously at the time that 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.430
 we are playing music too 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.769
 last more than 100 hours waiting for everything 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.989
 that thanks to its 1100 battery 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.909
 milliamps which will then have a 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.010
 greater autonomy than other devices 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.390
 the same size as you can see the how 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.010
 I previously mentioned it has a 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.659
 quite enough size that more 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.120
 go on let's talk let's see what 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.159
 what are these photos are we finished that 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.510
 brings what is the speaker ps we talk about 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.129
 the cognitive of how we are going to connect 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.319
 this speaker to our devices what 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.090
 we can do through the nfc or to 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 through what is the bluetooth of 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.950
 our device this speaker the 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.720
 name of him himself is ice cream mestres is 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.370
 a powerful speaker that the truth then 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.760
 it's worth buying it has a 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.200
 power of 4 watts of hd sound that 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.209
 incorporates the battery that I eat 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.650
 I previously mentioned them is 1800 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.879
 thousand now let's talk a little more about 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.049
 close what is the design of this 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.090
 speaker as you can see in the part 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.099
 front we can find what is the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.450
 power button we just want it 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.010
 extend only we press it a 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.230
 time and if we want to pay for it 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.209
 we keep pressed at least 3 the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.590
 world will go out as you can see here 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.909
 we have what is the logo what is 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.010
 the name of what the device is 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.720
 also on its back we can 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.370
 find what the usb port for 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.210
 can charge the 1,800 thousand battery 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.490
 amps too 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.170
 with holes that will give exit to 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.020
 low of what is the speaker that 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.940
 incorporates what is our speaker and in 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.500
 its bottom part we can see what they are 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.270
 the instructions and also where it was 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.430
 manufactured what is this high now 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.560
 let's try what the speaker is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.850
 right then let's turn them on and what 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.490
 we want to turn on because we keep 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.730
 pressed as you can see week is 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.380
 turn on it's already on it also emits 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.540
 a blue color as you can see I do not know if 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.430
 they are caught there and until now only 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.230
 we can connect it through our 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.140
 bluetooth service I have it 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.480
 connected let's place it here we're going to 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.180
 play a song that does not 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.180
 have copyright can not see 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.770
 is the music that we have in the background what 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.000
 that in our in our channel here what 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.230
 We can connect through bluetooth 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.850
 as you can see here I already have it 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.960
 connected me 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.960
 without any problem 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.440
 and we can give it the sound 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.630
 i 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.219
 d 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.270

 worry because the store sends it to you
