00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.230
 the eleventh service of Italy 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.650
 Australia web reference to lorenzo 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.730
 a voice out of the chorus but not even then 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 so much because those that are his 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.700
 we call the grievances against 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.180
 of Australia are easily 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.460
 sharable 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.600
 then tell us your story 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.640
 Australian very briefly then me 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 the first time I heard of it 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.989
 of Australia was when I 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.199
 met my partner her 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.699
 Austal in 2006 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.160
 she was then in Italy with her parents 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.910
 because of Italian origin 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.399
 we met, we got engaged 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.679
 and so I came to know we say 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.079
 of Australia as a place where 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.519
 I could have gone to live one day 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.560
 because in his time he studied anyway 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.510
 I had a job in Italy so the idea 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.870
 to come and live in australia I do not 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.060
 he never touched me even then 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.490
 the first time in 2007 we had 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.259
 opportunity I have had the opportunity to come 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.170
 in australia in a marriage house 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.770
 of katia 's sister with working 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.869
 holiday visa because I wanted it anyway 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.369
 try the experience of working on the 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.100
 out of Italy, something I never had 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.880
 done through one except a small one 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.409
 experience far from trivial 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.329
 and so I started working here in 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.759
 australia in 2007 with the work us davis 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:44.110
 it's a six month six seven experience 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:48.040
 months I have to say quite positive too 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.420
 because anyway at that time I don't 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.530
 I thought I had to stay here in 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.240
 australia if not for short periods 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.899
 so I had people in themselves going back in 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.610
 all cases then the place 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.610
 judged moment a positive experience 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.490
 after which they returned our a 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.409
 second time in 2008 always taking advantage 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.009
 the same working holiday visa done 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.840
 the year before 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.880
 this time on the occasion of birth 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.950
 my nephew's son of the action 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.140
 dedicated to this time they stayed in 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 Australia for four months but right for 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.560
 holiday we shot the victoria a little 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.480
 we have been 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.560
 we saw the classic destinations so 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.670
 the android flashlights 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.530
 in short, a little all those goals 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.390
 classic that there are victories 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.080
 after that they came back to Italy 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.870
 started a new job in 2010 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.239
 unfortunately with the first signs of the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.810
 crisis in short that loomed in europe ho 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.760
 lost my job I lost my job 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.670
 we started to think so myself and the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.650
 my partner to be able to come to work 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.690
 in australia because anyway 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.459
 Job opportunities here are many 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.030
 really so many as long as I want to work for you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.590
 hard and so we did the sport 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.930
 pisa who gave me the opportunity to 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.390
 having a permanent one must do that 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.160
 however a very coveted thing every 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.560
 day by many young Italians who 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.470
 in fact many come here then 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.799
 will these interviews envy 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.959
 this situation is already many now 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.870
 however, I remain a little stunned when 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.430
 I express volunteers would like to come back in 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.989
 Italy many micro but how is the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.459
 permanent and then return to Italy not 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.430
 do everything in order to stay on 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.350
 pipe and hairpin bends in Italy then then 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.160
 nothing if you didn't come back here in June 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.720
 last year after a couple of months 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.269
 so fortunately job search 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.609
 I immediately found work in the field in 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.650
 he worked in Italy then in retail 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.290
 and now I'm a store manager at 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.180
 a company with a company here in 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.200
 australia has got it so of 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.660
 savor what is real life 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.760
 I would not say working above all 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.920
 I would say the Australian is hotter than the big ones 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.810
 Italian cities like melbourne 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.269
 I also imagine simine because I have friends 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.880
 who work in sydney have the same 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.470
 we say grievances like you said before 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.239
 of working life in australia 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.609
 so a life made to wake up 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.069
 sit morning get on a vehicle 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.510
 public arrives works 8 ends of 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.400
 work at 6am and get back on the vehicle 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.989
 public back home at 7 and a half 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.600
 at eight o'clock in the evening you eat shower then a 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.910
 read this for 5 6 days a week 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.650
 then it depends how much work you and 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.260
 that one day a week you have 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.199
 of rest we say that as far as I am 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.150
 I'm concerned I'm so stressed tired 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.190
 of everything more then that I am at random a 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.340
 we sing in a spin but not even more than 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.590
 so so this is the life that i and 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.540
 like me so many other people that the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.780
 i live in work here in melbourne do 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.729
 so who has little to envy we say 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.470
 so if not that work that yes 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.840
 because anyway I said before and I work 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.370
 here it is not as easily found as before 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.690
 but in any case it is found in strict terms a 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.310
 I work there are opportunities I say 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.320
 provided that Australia is a country that 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.160
 we love to see knows how to give you so much but knows 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.590
 also take away a lot so unfortunately 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.110
 then there is also another aspect that many 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.110
 they do not consider that in Italy many 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.510
 they have a vision we say a little too much 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.699
 mythologized of Australia because until 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.669
 you come here on vacation is beautiful yes 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.550
 fun to surf hours here though then 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.280
 when he starts to see you work 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.910
 five years 60 a week because i 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.740
 prices 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:28.169
 the path of life is crazy if not 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.700
 work those hours you fail fails 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.050
 to do nothing can not have a rent 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.270
 not really a car can not have 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.349
 he has two money in his pocket but he eats one in the ark 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.820
 pizza so i mean 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.210
 there is also this aspect of the coin 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.660
 but thank god 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:46.880
 at least there is that money so there is the 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.880
 chiaroscuro that chiaroscuro
