here<00:00:11.100> keeps<00:00:12.100> us<00:00:12.280> warm<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.870> it<00:00:13.990> down<00:00:14.140> here<00:00:14.380> in

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
here keeps us warm have it down here in

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.890 
here keeps us warm have it down here in
the<00:00:14.530> basement<00:00:14.680> you<00:00:15.160> fill<00:00:15.400> it<00:00:15.519> with<00:00:15.900> the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
the basement you fill it with the

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.660 
the basement you fill it with the
pellets<00:00:17.410> there<00:00:17.650> I<00:00:17.680> cleaned<00:00:18.130> it<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:18.400> other<00:00:18.520> day

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
pellets there I cleaned it the other day

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.930 
pellets there I cleaned it the other day
poor<00:00:18.910> things<00:00:19.210> been<00:00:19.420> on<00:00:19.539> since<00:00:19.869> November<00:00:20.500> and

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:23.940 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.370 

the<00:00:24.940> exhaust<00:00:25.270> fan<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:25.779> making<00:00:26.199> a<00:00:26.260> little

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
the exhaust fan is making a little

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.349 
the exhaust fan is making a little
screeching<00:00:26.949> sound<00:00:27.310> so<00:00:27.609> I<00:00:27.640> feel<00:00:28.090> that<00:00:28.119> I<00:00:30.359> feel

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
screeching sound so I feel that I feel

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.489 
screeching sound so I feel that I feel
that<00:00:31.600> there's<00:00:31.930> some<00:00:33.780> something<00:00:34.780> going<00:00:35.050> on<00:00:35.260> in

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
that there's some something going on in

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:37.739 
that there's some something going on in
here<00:00:35.949> which<00:00:36.670> you<00:00:36.699> can't<00:00:37.089> see<00:00:37.300> I'll<00:00:37.449> get<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:37.749 
here which you can't see I'll get the

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:39.509 
here which you can't see I'll get the
light<00:00:37.929> but<00:00:38.170> I<00:00:38.379> am<00:00:38.499> going<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.949> remove<00:00:39.280> the

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
light but I am going to remove the

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.629 
light but I am going to remove the
exhaust<00:00:40.120> blower<00:00:40.749> as<00:00:41.139> I<00:00:41.920> think<00:00:42.159> something<00:00:42.519> has

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:42.639 
exhaust blower as I think something has

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:44.069 
exhaust blower as I think something has
gotten<00:00:42.940> in<00:00:43.030> between<00:00:43.149> the<00:00:43.539> blades<00:00:43.749> of<00:00:43.960> the

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
gotten in between the blades of the

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.369 
gotten in between the blades of the
turbine<00:00:44.499> down<00:00:44.799> there<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.399> we'll<00:00:46.350> check<00:00:47.350> back

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
turbine down there so we'll check back

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.879 
turbine down there so we'll check back
with<00:00:47.620> that<00:00:49.049> okay<00:00:50.049> here<00:00:50.260> we<00:00:50.379> are<00:00:50.409> go<00:00:50.679> with<00:00:50.829> a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889 
with that okay here we are go with a

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:53.189 
with that okay here we are go with a
little<00:00:51.039> more<00:00:51.129> light<00:00:51.429> and<00:00:51.999> what<00:00:52.749> I'm<00:00:52.839> going<00:00:53.079> in

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
little more light and what I'm going in

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:01.349 
little more light and what I'm going in
for<00:00:53.379> here<00:00:53.709> is<00:00:53.829> the<00:00:55.709> I'm<00:00:56.709> going<00:00:57.069> in<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.999> exhaust

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
for here is the I'm going in the exhaust

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.260 
for here is the I'm going in the exhaust
blower<00:01:01.929> here<00:01:02.739> they<00:01:03.519> call<00:01:03.699> it<00:01:03.819> the<00:01:03.879> combustion

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
blower here they call it the combustion

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.950 
blower here they call it the combustion
motor<00:01:04.750> also<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:06.850> nothing<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.390> a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
motor also that's nothing but a a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.000 
motor also that's nothing but a a
glorified<00:01:08.710> record<00:01:09.100> changer<00:01:09.490> motor<00:01:10.590> with<00:01:11.590> a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
glorified record changer motor with a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.710 
glorified record changer motor with a
couple<00:01:12.400> turbine<00:01:12.820> blades<00:01:13.120> on<00:01:13.330> there<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.600> get

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
couple turbine blades on there to get

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.310 
couple turbine blades on there to get
the<00:01:13.900> air<00:01:14.500> moving<00:01:14.950> as<00:01:15.100> this<00:01:15.310> is<00:01:15.520> a<00:01:15.550> negative

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
the air moving as this is a negative

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.840 
the air moving as this is a negative
vacuum<00:01:17.320> system<00:01:17.920> where<00:01:18.070> there's<00:01:18.280> always<00:01:18.430> got

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
vacuum system where there's always got

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.580 
vacuum system where there's always got
to<00:01:18.880> be<00:01:19.030> a<00:01:19.180> a<00:01:20.130> negative<00:01:21.130> flow<00:01:21.370> of<00:01:21.670> air<00:01:21.970> to<00:01:22.590> keep

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
to be a a negative flow of air to keep

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.690 
to be a a negative flow of air to keep
the<00:01:23.650> pellets<00:01:24.100> going<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:25.330> why<00:01:25.540> don't<00:01:25.720> we<00:01:26.700> even

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
the pellets going so why don't we even

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.350 
the pellets going so why don't we even
get<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> nut<00:01:28.150> driver<00:01:28.270> in<00:01:28.570> there<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:30.330> take<00:01:31.330> a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
get a nut driver in there and take a

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.300 
get a nut driver in there and take a
look<00:01:31.450> at<00:01:31.660> things<00:01:31.870> I<00:01:32.080> suspect<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:32.950> will<00:01:33.070> have<00:01:33.220> to

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
look at things I suspect I will have to

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.360 
look at things I suspect I will have to
vacuum<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.940> because<00:01:34.150> other<00:01:34.600> YouTube<00:01:35.370> videos

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
vacuum it because other YouTube videos

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.130 
vacuum it because other YouTube videos
show<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:36.880> there's<00:01:37.120> there's<00:01:37.540> some<00:01:37.660> ash<00:01:37.870> in

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
show that there's there's some ash in

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.250 
show that there's there's some ash in
between<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.030> combustion<00:01:40.030> chamber<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:40.870> the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
between the combustion chamber and the

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.960 
between the combustion chamber and the
back<00:01:41.650> of<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:41.890> unit<00:01:42.010> here<00:01:42.310> so<00:01:42.550> we'll<00:01:42.730> take<00:01:42.880> a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
back of the unit here so we'll take a

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.380 
back of the unit here so we'll take a
look<00:01:43.120> at<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.450> minute<00:01:44.909> we<00:01:45.909> have<00:01:46.060> white

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
look at that in a minute we have white

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.370 
look at that in a minute we have white
and<00:01:46.659> we<00:01:47.409> have<00:01:47.440> red

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.960 

the<00:01:50.980> red<00:01:51.190> goes<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.700> black<00:01:53.550> on<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.729> exhaust

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
the red goes to the black on the exhaust

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.330 
the red goes to the black on the exhaust
combustion<00:01:55.600> motor<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.620> white<00:01:56.800> RC<00:01:57.190> goes

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
combustion motor and the white RC goes

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.270 
combustion motor and the white RC goes
to<00:01:57.490> white<00:01:58.470> there's<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> lot<00:01:59.620> of<00:01:59.740> tie<00:01:59.920> wraps

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
to white there's a lot of tie wraps

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.270 
to white there's a lot of tie wraps
which<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.550> want<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.790> keep<00:02:01.000> all<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.360> types

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
which you want to keep all the types

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.780 
which you want to keep all the types

of<00:04:08.140> there<00:04:08.290> because<00:04:08.560> like<00:04:09.480> any<00:04:10.480> exhaust<00:04:10.840> type

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200
