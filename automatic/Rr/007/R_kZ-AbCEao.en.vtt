00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.700
 Welcome to the double right 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.150
 important today is about the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.010
 original software from the s2 and wanted 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.869
 yes some have worked again and 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.710
 I just wanted to show how to get back 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.380
 hope to grow 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.480
 because you are not alone 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.130
 got the download link 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.570
 below description where here again the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.949
 you can download files in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.460
 a simple packed here 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.480
 he is 2 gb, and was just in here 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 so it may take a while 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.650
 to six percent of the stuff said and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 a description is also early on 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:43.170
 Tomorrow morning at 4 PM 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.270
 I think I'll show you purely pure 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.130
 could work virtually because of me 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.180
 mine will not come down again and if 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.890
 I would like to talk then on gingerbread 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.690
 so I stay I have to make 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.370
 show you this way so far 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.910
 he goes it 's her download 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 click her volume button under home 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.299
 button and the omnipotence button so the 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 standby button at the same time then comes 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.960
 the son was nothing brings in the volume 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.130
 because then you come in the download 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.869
 if the main is ever very good 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.189
 you do not need the drivers of 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.810
 12 for pc 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 but I think for those who 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 So you have already logged out of the update 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.729
 have done on the pc 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.740
 they should have all these tranches 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.179
 Otherwise, thanks and install the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.210
 makes but one but he stuck 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.039
 advises on the internet brings as 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.630
 installed with me still papa drivers 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.280
 I was taking usb port for a long time 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.789
 but that should not be the problem now 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.170
 his 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:45.619
 we open the floor as I said everything in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.619
 this situation we can look for 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.810
 I do not do it because I actually 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.530
 with that with the software very much 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.650
 I am satisfied 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.520
 only what I have planned what me too 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.750
 yesterday already the description 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.180
 has been written 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.700
 I should once the winner because lotto 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.120
 I would like to try jackpot 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.260
 but unfortunately I have not yet 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 So no official version found 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.550
 and all the informal I want 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.020
 me on my on my device because I 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.490
 Just then you may have got worse 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.620
 drivers and their bugs are there so many 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.060
 bugs mostly in it works 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.980
 not really thought of me first okay coni 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.240
 wait a bit if anyone 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.310
 from you always only official version 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.230
 of lakes Seagate he has some completely 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.970
 works where no growth are the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.030
 can you send me by pn 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.520
 otherwise I wait a bit 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.670
 then if you have opened now click 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.590
 her on the maintenance mainz shortly on pet 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:53.150
 here at the top and choose the gti 68 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.180
 euro xx 4g as I said in the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.580
 seventh round from and then the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.200
 up here in it 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:10.180
 then the pda unloads and takes here 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.180
 the choice is the idea with the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.660
 perpetrators part 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.080
 Now we wait here for a short time 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.130
 is shown 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.450
 small appliances meanwhile times indicated 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.450
 application installed 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:39.379
 would have to fit here now 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.180
 said the software is still alive at all 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.280
 normal for me today at least 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.430
 That's what I say in my mind 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.299
 this file is a bit respectful 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.519
 now everything is in it 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.310
 Now we see top down here 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.900
 is blue 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.549
 Then you click so I I hold 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.410
 clicks the three weeks must click 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.670
 a reh partition with automatic 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.340
 clicked on if you the peter drenker 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.049
 I'll tell you in advance before you 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.519
 Now I'm expressing something I promise 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.190
 you do not work us I can 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.870
 do not promise you 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.579
 with me it worked on the band 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.989
 I do not know how I said I can 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.069
 it just does not promise you but 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.890
 I assume 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.690
 I assume one would have to work 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.139
 You then click on start when the device 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.090
 then I found it then you go in the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:26.120
 Recovery mode clicks her volume of 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.410
 home button and then the standby button 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:33.020
 then he should go to the state 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:37.310
 go and get from there 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:42.440
 then simply from fulda factory 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.180
 and found the 21st 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.530
 so that your device has been completely deleted 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.780
 then he starts then I think would have to 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.289
 he then he would have to picture again in jinja 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.210
 start 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.460
 I promise I can not do it to you 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.349
 I promise but I'm pretty 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.180
 sure that's how it works with me 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.830
 I was working then got it 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.660
 later , justice was completely transferred 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.550
 recognizes it because I finally got that 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.060
 official update wanted to have everything 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.500
 That's why I'm working fine 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.080
 you can not be sure that 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.210
 did not work and that's why 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.639
 I really only do it before you 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.220
 then if you are not necessarily 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.260
 wanted to have again because otherwise no 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.550
 mistakes happen I do not want to 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.400
 risk now because of here again 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.450
 warning before something makes up the left side 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.960
 We took exactly the risk 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.310
 enter 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.800
 you can, of course, then again and again 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.930
 with 4.1 and 4.2 software are available 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.400
 We have already made a video's 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.479
 On a channel you can find the video like 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.099
 plane my samsung galaxy s2 is here 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.610
 otherwise have fun with gingerbread 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.950
 again 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.110
 and as said who of you was 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.970
 a decent tooth janet 462 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.380
 Which one does not work anymore 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.460
 I like to pack it 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.990
 I'm glad about it 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.060
 Of course we'll see each other next video 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.060
 again a nice nice day 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.380
 Well, I wish you a nice week there 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.890
 was important at all sounds 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.890
 is then
