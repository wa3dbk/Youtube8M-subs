infinite 8 Keller FM right I'm not sure

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
infinite 8 Keller FM right I'm not sure
ability<00:00:20.580> looks<00:00:20.820> like<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.300> does<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.960> yeah<00:00:22.109> it's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
ability looks like it does so yeah it's

the<00:00:34.680> infinite<00:00:35.130> 8<00:00:35.309> calorie<00:00:35.700> sign<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.480> i'm<00:00:36.719> not

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the infinite 8 calorie sign but i'm not

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
the infinite 8 calorie sign but i'm not
sure<00:00:37.110> i<00:00:37.320> guess<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> find<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.579> out

these trash containers when you try to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.130 
these trash containers when you try to
move<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.530> explode<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.399> nothing<00:01:03.239> happens<00:01:03.270> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
move or explode it nothing happens just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
move or explode it nothing happens just
nothing<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.949> doesn't<00:01:05.519> even<00:01:05.640> move<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.119> little

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
nothing it doesn't even move a little

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600 
nothing it doesn't even move a little
bit<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> try<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.680> explode<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> old

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bit and if you try to explode the old

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.210 
bit and if you try to explode the old
trash<00:01:08.939> containers<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> normal<00:01:10.320> ones<00:01:10.619> they

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
trash containers so the normal ones they

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.550 
trash containers so the normal ones they
move<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.760> hell<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.689> fly<00:01:12.930> away<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
move as hell they just fly away when you

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.679 
move as hell they just fly away when you
throw<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> grenade<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.189> them<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> makes<00:01:15.600> me

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
throw a grenade to them so that makes me

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.270 
throw a grenade to them so that makes me
think<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.680> through<00:01:16.979> with<00:01:17.159> this
