00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
this on a regular basis so you need to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.740 
this on a regular basis so you need to
build<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.540> list<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:17.090> Diego<00:01:18.090> rented<00:01:18.600> through

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
build a list and Diego rented through

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.170 
build a list and Diego rented through
this<00:01:18.840> program<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> he<00:01:20.100> shows<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.700> he's

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
this program and he shows you how he's

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.740 
this program and he shows you how he's
built<00:01:21.570> list<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.229> 13<00:01:22.590> days<00:01:22.770> four<00:01:23.130> thousand<00:01:23.750> 358

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
built list in 13 days four thousand 358

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
built list in 13 days four thousand 358
subscribers<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.680> think<00:01:25.890> he<00:01:26.009> says<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:27.290> but

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
subscribers and think he says and but

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.830 
subscribers and think he says and but
the<00:01:28.860> process<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.400> uses<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.850> great<00:01:30.299> solid

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the process he uses this great solid

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.359 
the process he uses this great solid
process<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> process<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.189> will

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
process and it's a process that will

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.980 
process and it's a process that will
help<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.790> build<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.180> list<00:01:33.329> maybe<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:33.960> fast

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
help you build a list maybe not as fast

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.440 
help you build a list maybe not as fast
and<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.470> quick<00:01:34.710> as<00:01:34.890> Diego<00:01:35.490> stunning<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:36.240> made

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and as quick as Diego stunning he made

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
and as quick as Diego stunning he made
the<00:01:36.479> system<00:01:36.990> he<00:01:37.079> understands<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:39.000> see

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the system he understands but I can see

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.999 
the system he understands but I can see
it's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> really<00:01:39.720> good<00:01:39.869> process<00:01:40.259> starting<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it's a really good process starting to

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's a really good process starting to
put<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.490> an<00:01:42.079> operation<00:01:43.079> now<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.560> own

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
put it in an operation now for my own

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.260 
put it in an operation now for my own
list<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> load<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.700> list<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.000> little<00:01:45.149> bit

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
list of the load my list a little bit

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.639 
list of the load my list a little bit
more<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.340> great<00:01:47.610> system<00:01:48.649> at

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
more and it is a really great system at
