00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
like that where your electronics are

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
like that where your electronics are
sensitive<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.570> not<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> work<00:00:40.170> so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
sensitive it's not going to work so

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.229 
sensitive it's not going to work so
let's<00:00:41.040> have<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.250> look<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.730> thing<00:00:41.940> closer
