00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.000
 well here we have today I am going to 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.310
 put to cook the asparagus again 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.770
 because they see that the other video of the 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.830
 asparagus with the steak when you reach 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.470
 to the last part when I was 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.759
 serving everything that way is that I have the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.860
 Sopita and here I have the chicken ready 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.050
 that has a silicon of its lengths that 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.210
 they are for flavor 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.460
 now the only thing I'm going to do is nothing else 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.489
 that is so that the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.489
 asparagus to serve them 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.280
 it takes just two minutes here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.649
 boiling the water the asparagus we are going to 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.649
 leave about 45 minutes 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 Well, three minutes have passed, I'm going to 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:07.260
 leave two more minutes and it will be ready 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.340
 apparently the asparagus are already 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 ready turned off the fire and I'm going to put 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.940
 here to a little market with the medical center 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.940
 with him I will put the chick 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.240
 that are all the asparagus 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.850
 or a ladito and I'll put the good 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.850
 I'm going to put the chicken 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.820
 this time I cut it for now 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.400
 is going to be the test, do not fight, have 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.409
 been cutting up cut a bit 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.790
 of this chile from long skies that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.790
 they are only to give this voice 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.870
 because here we have the flying saucer 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.870
 Grilled chick with asparagus 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:06.610
 I have cucumber sliced ​​cucumber and 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.830
 I took advantage and I put half avocado 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.720
 also on slice is that I'm going to put 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.810
 pepper nothing else where is the avocado 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.310
 and less than once a little bit everything 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.370
 but I wanted nothing more than avocado and 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.370
 cucumber little salt for cucumbers 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.750
 they talk to me 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.989
 when the call came back to where I put 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.370
 Here we have what I was looking for 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.680
 seasoning we have olive oil 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.019
 extravirgen show a little bit more 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.310
 on the side where the asparagus are 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.739
 you can throw everything now let's 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.019
 throwing the oil side of his payments 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.590
 olive and the cucumber side we are going to 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.730
 put the lemon juice 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.980
 so the dish would be 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.080
 completely ready and as you know 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.390
 all the food dishes have 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.170
 their respective vegetable soup ok without 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.960
 rice without corn and without good potato 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.420
 as we have everything ready there, nothing else 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.240
 the only thing I'm going to check out is the test 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.060
 for you is the neck is already going by 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.180
 a hundred are coming out 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:20.500
 anyway 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.290
 the long selector was very rich 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.170
 launched very rich 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.170
 the avocado is not too rich 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.650
 chew a lot 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.570
 I'm quick but you have to chew 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.640
 much normally, it's easier 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.680
 when I'm eating the most but when 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.660
 I am speaking before the camera because it is a 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.110
 little harder to talk about chewing the 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.110
 Same time 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.599
 and besides I did not speak when they have the 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.599
 mouth full but I have to 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.030
 and 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.030
 Kitty 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.720
 and of course the asparagus 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.640
 we want to grab all of the game 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.640
 this afternoon 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.750
 I'm going to cut with the knife in 13 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.930
 parts along but 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:42.150
 I also wanted once they saw how 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.850
 is all the relaxation that 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:48.000
 Well, this is going to be neither combining 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.760
 today in front of a steak 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.520
 stem 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.900
 the chick the iron this is thigh we 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.250
 breast but you can still do 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:03.340
 avocado breast cucumber chilitos 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.340
 asparagus and in little things around 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.610
 natural fat allowed 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.039
 of a better fat that there may be 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.680
 because the body does not occupy fat but 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:25.270
 animal fat and vegetable fat that is very 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.789
 allowed good after that the cup 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.849
 of water that is optional if you put the 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:33.310
 lemon or nothing else natural water 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.990

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.520
