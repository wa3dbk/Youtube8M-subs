00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
now notice loads and loads of code so

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.440 
now notice loads and loads of code so
this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> real<00:01:40.740> big<00:01:41.009> possibility<00:01:41.250> now<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:42.030> in

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this is a real big possibility now as in

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.230 
this is a real big possibility now as in
never<00:01:42.600> previous<00:01:43.820> encoding<00:01:44.820> we've<00:01:45.030> seen

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
never previous encoding we've seen

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.999 
never previous encoding we've seen
things<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.600> car<00:01:45.899> parts<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.470> they've<00:01:46.649> ended<00:01:46.890> up

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
things at car parts and they've ended up

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.649 
things at car parts and they've ended up
coming<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> next<00:01:47.759> update<00:01:47.939> things<00:01:48.479> like

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
coming in the next update things like

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
coming in the next update things like
that<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.350> could<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.860> really<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.220> seen<00:01:50.399> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
that so we could really really be seen a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.389 
that so we could really really be seen a
possibility<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> jet<00:01:51.450> pack<00:01:51.600> dlc<00:01:51.810> now<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:53.100> may

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
possibility of a jet pack dlc now it may

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.590 
possibility of a jet pack dlc now it may
be<00:01:53.430> something<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.450> their

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
be something that they had in their

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.510 
be something that they had in their
secretly<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.770> now<00:01:55.799> solve<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
secretly see that you can now solve the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.609 
secretly see that you can now solve the
spec<00:01:56.759> type<00:01:56.969> things<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.450> miners<00:01:57.750> tell<00:01:57.990> ya<00:01:58.170> but

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
spec type things the miners tell ya but

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.499 
spec type things the miners tell ya but
there's<00:01:59.340> endless<00:01:59.490> possibilities<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.450> if

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
there's endless possibilities and we if

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.230 
there's endless possibilities and we if
we<00:02:00.659> could<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.990> jet<00:02:01.229> pack<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.799> GTA<00:02:02.219> 5<00:02:02.460> may<00:02:02.759> not

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
we could get a jet pack on GTA 5 may not

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.969 
we could get a jet pack on GTA 5 may not
be<00:02:03.360> absolutely<00:02:03.869> awesome<00:02:03.960> now<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.740> other

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
be absolutely awesome now the other

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
be absolutely awesome now the other
possibility<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> recycling<00:02:06.540> code

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
possibility is that the recycling code

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930 
possibility is that the recycling code
and<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:08.220> unlikely<00:02:08.729> i

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
and but that is very very unlikely i

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.830 
and but that is very very unlikely i
don't<00:02:09.149> think<00:02:09.360> they're<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.750> doing

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
don't think they're going to be doing

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.320 
don't think they're going to be doing
that<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.289> someone<00:02:10.590> like<00:02:10.619> rockstar<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.819> yeah

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
that not someone like rockstar but yeah

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940 
that not someone like rockstar but yeah
guys<00:02:12.510> we've<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:12.900> loads<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.379> proof<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
guys we've got loads of proof that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
guys we've got loads of proof that
pax<00:02:14.250> may<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.879> coming<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> GTA<00:02:15.510> 5<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.140> in<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
pax may be coming to GTA 5 is now in the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.470 
pax may be coming to GTA 5 is now in the
coding<00:02:16.739> for<00:02:17.069> one<00:02:17.190> point<00:02:17.430> 12<00:02:17.670> now<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.300> think

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
coding for one point 12 now if you think

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.869 
coding for one point 12 now if you think
this<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.720> all<00:02:18.810> fake<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.730> someone<00:02:20.730> says

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
this is all fake and and someone says

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.339 
this is all fake and and someone says
made<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:21.360> random<00:02:21.690> code<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.170> have

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
made up with random code and have

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.040 
made up with random code and have
displayed<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.250> screen<00:02:23.280> I'll<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.209> short

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
displayed on screen I'll have a short

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.240 
displayed on screen I'll have a short
tutorial<00:02:25.470> in<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> description<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.160> can

go<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.459> check<00:02:26.610> out<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.030> look<00:02:27.150> in<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.300> files

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
go and check out and look in the files

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780 
go and check out and look in the files
yourself<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.140> see<00:02:28.260> exactly<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:29.250> code<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.610> for

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
yourself and see exactly the code in for

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.270 
yourself and see exactly the code in for
