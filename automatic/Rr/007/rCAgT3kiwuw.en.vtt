00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I've got a big good idea and because of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.779 
I've got a big good idea and because of
so<00:00:17.550> many<00:00:17.670> tobacco's<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.449> try<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:20.039> do

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
so many tobacco's now to try is to do

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.740 
so many tobacco's now to try is to do
once<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.270> month<00:00:21.420> like<00:00:22.020> five<00:00:22.740> chart<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.750> pivotal

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
once a month like five chart of pivotal

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.740 
once a month like five chart of pivotal
battles<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.289> last<00:00:25.560> month<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
battles of the last month and that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.060 
battles of the last month and that
thought<00:00:27.990> was<00:00:28.140> maybe<00:00:28.289> something<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.859> could<00:00:29.010> all

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
thought was maybe something we could all

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.959 
approaches a spring weather is getting
warmer<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.739> summer<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.160> very<00:00:44.399> warm<00:00:44.730> I

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
warmer the summer will be very warm I

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
warmer the summer will be very warm I
can<00:00:45.480> imagine<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.020> list<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.410> change

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
can imagine that this list will change

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.729 
can imagine that this list will change
as<00:00:47.520> time<00:00:47.550> goes<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.629> we'll<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.989> once<00:00:49.200> drop

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
as time goes on so we'll see once drop

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.650 
as time goes on so we'll see once drop
know<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.980> top<00:00:50.280> five<00:00:50.550> new<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:51.030> Bibles<00:00:51.360> coming

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
know the top five new two Bibles coming

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
know the top five new two Bibles coming
into<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> it's<00:00:53.070> not<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> big<00:00:53.280> good<00:00:53.579> idea<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> keep

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
into so it's not a big good idea to keep

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 
into so it's not a big good idea to keep
a<00:00:54.180> record<00:00:54.410> what<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:55.530> smoking<00:00:55.860> over<00:00:56.039> the

a record what would smoking over the
year<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.109> why<00:00:58.109> those<00:00:58.590> particular<00:00:59.100> tobacco's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
month as the weather gets warmer I think

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.000 
month as the weather gets warmer I think
this<00:02:26.850> will<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.150> more<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.570> winter<00:02:28.440> Virginia

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
this will be more of a winter Virginia

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.670 
this will be more of a winter Virginia
and<00:02:29.400> that's<00:02:29.910> sort<00:02:30.570> of<00:02:30.660> spiciness<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.440> just

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and that's sort of spiciness to it just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.050 
and that's sort of spiciness to it just
adds<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.950> little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.280> warmth<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.009 
adds a little bit of warmth to the
tobacco<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:35.180> know<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.330> Gustavo<00:02:36.720> in
