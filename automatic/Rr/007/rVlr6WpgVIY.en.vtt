00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.019
 on 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:11.459
 one point 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.570
 In this little tutorial I want to remove the tool called a 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.859
 Make developers aware 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:19.950
 this tool reads 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.970
 yes developed for 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.789
 the individual adaptation of the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.920
 TAKKT changes by customers, the feature is what makes the vendors coalesce 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.579
 Cohesion use around 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.579
 to lower her clock rates while idling Laura 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.280
 and you can do all this here at the on development process was very good 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.330
 customize with this tool 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.360
 in my case 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.900
 For example, I have a six-core processor from Amway here 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 remote and 2x 6085 de 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.030
 and I gave him Bayer 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 Conan Koerdt 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.850
 and the other power saver mechanisms this all at me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.239
 but to stop the individual settings how much 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.439
 want to be created at which multiplier 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.390
 and to be able to put up with this tool 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 short explanation in advance the Piesteritz are theirs in Qatar Alcorcon to see 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.960
 expand my body 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.119
 Pinault is the four in my case p 4 is percent that's the deepest that 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.040
 means percent 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.090
 the lowest of the former mode 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.530
 4 0 for Stoke needs from us 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.260
 the used that in this case would be a peculiarity that is around 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.810
 For the top models, these six-core processors are Mandela themselves 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.899
 outside in court for her with us anyway 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.420
 switched on did not want to use 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.740
 Cleese TAKKT 1 is interesting now 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.260
 2 3 and 4 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.760
 you can already see so far is here I have the lowest multi Fichtel 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760
 Vierer Multi hurry up six processors 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.130
 and at tier1 den 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.380
 Accordingly, I can set more tension for the percent here now 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.540
 CPU survive crate 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.140
 and Basler 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 re-accentuate tension 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.119
 Important is just otherwise the program complains that you are not at one 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.149
 PI of an offender wants to set lower voltage 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:20.689
 as percent yapi percent p4 or tread or p2 so that's it 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.519
 Senn make him feel that way 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.900
 both victims of the otherwise Mio voltage is set 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.799
 if you have done with his attitude 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.249
 Friedman also derive that to take over 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:38.499
 you can still set and bc2 now just balancing running or on 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.889
 maximum 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:42.729
 Bach Max Maute forms so whiny driving mode 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:46.169
 and because I realized that it has no effect on me so if I 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.469
 stop Jennifer and I need a job 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.909
 Utilization on drivers with no or other programs 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.789
 Dagmar Goch the car too high 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:03:01.269
 It is important to ensure that this is also permanently stored 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.549
 SZ are what I have made 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.549
 that once you open the Zoller Stepney 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.739
 attached this 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.509
 Box Piesteritz 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.680
 which one is allowed to the court has permanent transmitter so Hagemann make 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.160
 And if you have changed something here then also cover this window 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.189
 is almost a percent 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.099
 for the service running with the program 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.459
 as always with start with Windows 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.739
 because then you do not need this program extra states 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.829
 that is, if I make change here now and shelves Sindy at the 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.829
 next restart again way unless I go to service 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.059
 then click on pictures to save a change like for example 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:46.059
 There was a lot of tension now 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:50.569
 afflict 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.649
 at the same time we do not see any more on paper then she will soon be the 1 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 also one comma 3 6 2 from stand 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.749
 then that's permanent 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.749
 I do not undo the tension that I need 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.689
 sued 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.399
 you can still have animals here 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:13.789
 the cool Kreuth in the BIOS make out instead of parrying by hand 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.509
 determine when he should press up and down 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:17.909
 I have it with me 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.929
 not further dealt with because the percent of times that test Lutz got me that 

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:23.539
 not as good as 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.339
 the normal day that customers create quality with us 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.400
 so that percent 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.660
 So with this tool I can now easily without this 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.639
 Main window Neustadter my clock rates stop 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.919
 With fresh relaxation and SchÃ¶na you can also 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.580
 idle at the processor but still a bit 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.409
 Save electricity 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.240
 I hope that will help us 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.919
 have fun with it
