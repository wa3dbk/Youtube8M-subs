behind this bag is to be able to make a

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.280 
behind this bag is to be able to make a
sling<00:00:24.439> bag<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:25.250> swings<00:00:26.090> both<00:00:26.570> ways<00:00:26.630> and

actually has the top of the bag remain
on<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.619> top<00:00:30.829> both<00:00:31.400> ways<00:00:31.730> I<00:00:32.119> can<00:00:32.570> actually<00:00:33.050> take

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
on the top both ways I can actually take

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.550 
on the top both ways I can actually take
the<00:00:33.500> bag<00:00:33.680> off<00:00:34.600> flip<00:00:35.600> this<00:00:35.840> one<00:00:36.730> strap<00:00:38.410> put<00:00:39.410> the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
the bag off flip this one strap put the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.370 
the bag off flip this one strap put the
bag<00:00:39.739> on<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.700> other<00:00:40.850> direction<00:00:41.090> and<00:00:41.810> when<00:00:42.350> I

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
bag on the other direction and when I

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.900 
bag on the other direction and when I
flip<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:42.739> actually<00:00:43.160> around<00:00:43.399> again<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.719> bag

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
flip it actually around again the bag

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.029 
flip it actually around again the bag
top<00:00:46.910> opening<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.600> still<00:00:47.870> on<00:00:48.019> the<00:00:48.109> top<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.890> now<00:00:49.010> I

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
top opening is still on the top so now I

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.069 
top opening is still on the top so now I
can<00:00:49.100> access<00:00:49.370> my<00:00:49.579> gear<00:00:50.030> from<00:00:50.629> both<00:00:50.870> directions

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
can access my gear from both directions

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.310 
can access my gear from both directions
so<00:00:51.649> if<00:00:51.739> I<00:00:51.859> do<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:52.910> one<00:00:53.090> more<00:00:53.149> time<00:00:53.300> for<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:54.879> we

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
so if I do that one more time for you we

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.709 
so if I do that one more time for you we
flip<00:00:57.320> our<00:00:57.530> rail<00:00:58.239> then<00:00:59.239> we<00:00:59.359> put<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.629> back<00:00:59.960> on<00:01:01.719> and

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
flip our rail then we put it back on and

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.680 
flip our rail then we put it back on and
so<00:01:03.410> if<00:01:03.589> I<00:01:03.769> flip<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.519> bag<00:01:04.699> back<00:01:05.000> into<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.449> front

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
so if I flip the bag back into the front

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.890 
so if I flip the bag back into the front
my<00:01:06.590> put<00:01:07.040> me<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.250> still<00:01:07.460> accessible<00:01:07.820> we<00:01:08.720> also

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
