00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.129
 January 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.640
 in Finland it is cold that peels but 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.770
 They know how to take care of themselves to see if the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.320
 played with their next game they of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.860
 they offer work will be for alan 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.329
 wake 2 in the next xbox according to many 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.309
 rumors if any airline ticket has already 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.410
 reserved the next generation of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.080
 xbox will be officially presented at san 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.720
 francisco the frame will be the event game 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.489
 developer convention 2013 1 in which 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.650
 Microsoft has become strong from time to time 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.080
 when where the best meet 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 developers this includes the remedy 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 entertainment that already think about that 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.050
 new generation of consoles for now 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.990
 they have been recruiting for a while 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.580
 effective your list seems to have no end and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 have released a new video in which 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 they seem to have vacancies will be launched this 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.050
 time to several consoles or remain faithful 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.720
 to pc and xbox gives me that we will know 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.700
 in coming weeks 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.890
 rebellions another study that has been done 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.150
 with good results but its new 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.310
 title remains a mystery 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.260
 yes sniper elite never dead or aliens 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.300
 versus predator serve as clues to 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.310
 guess what is not expected we will have 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.290
 to think more about the video that serves as 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.970
 breakthrough for the new rebellion has 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.130
 several details that remind us more 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.810
 still scream your case the boss team that a 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.720
 new game looks like it's going to have 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.340
 Nazi zombies and something satanic there will be 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.440
 see if they decide to throw something else 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.620
 tasty to get an idea of what 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.290
 game he has in his hands 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.510
 many of us wondered why tomb 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.450
 raider will not see the light in wii and then 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.920
 we have an answer the director 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.810
 creative of the new tomb raider has 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.940
 explained why the ara will not come by 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.260
 Now you will know eyeos 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.370
 placed in line with others 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.080
 developers 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.210
 precisely wield the same motives 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.430
 that have been used for kinect for example 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.290
 in the last three years if they were to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.180
 make a tomb raider paraguay this would be 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.370
 very different they would have to take advantage 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.410
 the unique features of the console 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.570
 your control system the screen of 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.850
 remote and do something different like 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.590
 excuse gives the feeling that they do not know 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.810
 well will you because many of the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.880
 games that reach it make little use 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.860
 of the new command however if they want 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.500
 always take advantage of what is offered 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.690
 We will give a vote of confidence to the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.670
 least has not said that we will never see the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 will you do this sounds like a lot to me 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.330
 movie 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 Some say that dark souls 2 already 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.129
 will enter the next generation of 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.319
 consoles and others do not want to see dundar 7 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.610
 but at this rate it seems that everyone is going to 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.860
 be very happy 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.630
 and taca miyazaki responsible for 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.070
 demon's souls and dark souls 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.230
 unchecked in the development of the 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.030
 next delivery says he does not want to see 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.340
 a saga with infinite numbers like 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.100
 surname however you want to play attack 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.080
 shows 2 as much as we look at a 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.900
 good example of knowing how to retire on time 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.640
 his argument is valid believed to have 100% 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.010
 Left without good ideas and wants to try 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.049
 other things we respect you uncle 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.019
 it seems that very long times await us 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.890
 interesting at the end of the path the mouse and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.079
 the view 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.909
 I'm eva white and here's your daily fix 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.280

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.930
 abstracts in ig in Spain and in our
