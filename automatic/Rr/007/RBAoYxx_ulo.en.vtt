00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.439
 what is the most difficult for a player 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:10.549
 Peruvian when he goes abroad 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:12.040
 well in my experience here it was 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.990
 Quick 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:20.760
 can migrate almost closing the market 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.270
 of passes here in the summer and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.240
 Y 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.539
 and the biggest luck that cost me a little 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.489
 it was that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.010
 because in living together to live with another 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.230
 meet with another type of people with another 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.370
 the culture I think that in this part that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:51.449
 part a little that you can enter 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.640
 and more when I win when it's more difficult 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.339
 would you say the extra adaptation 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.970
 football that adaptation 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.510
 soccer 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.329
 I believe for myself, of course, yes 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.000
 not because 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.540
 acquired a principle they told me the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.540
 things clearly 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.190
 and the talent of everything to make a great 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:19.430
 player but but I had to try to 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.650
 adapt to our politicians volleyball 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.110
 are how are you I greet you chemo what 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.810
 I like to hear you 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.450
 How about I wanted to ask you a little something 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.270
 from orejita this I wanted to consult t 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.829
 what football have you found the 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.420
 Spanish football well we already know that 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.079
 has a very important level, 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.039
 only this in Europe but at the 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.939
 world what kind of releases found 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:53.710
 what problems have you encountered 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.759
 with adaptation to the rhythm you have 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.490
 found with playing is technically 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.740
 good teams that work hard the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.210
 tactical part a physical preparation 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.760
 much more demanding than you could 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.620
 have here 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.000
 how are you living all that with you 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.670
 have you found in spain 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.540
 edison 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.670
 here in Spain I found 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.830
 work work work 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.880
 different work 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.930
 in a faster job 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.470
 in training with shorts are from 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.540
 one hour one hour and ten thirty no more 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.920
 but very intense very very fast they try 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.069
 for all players 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.520
 of the subsidiary have a technique one 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.520
 technique 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.000
 is enviable always always work 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.050
 everything technical, tactical, physical, 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.330
 physical they leave it for 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.320
 for one more side 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.270
 your me not a more personal side but the 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.060
 shampoo work is paramount to 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.530
 everything worked a ball here clear the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.990
 physical part has also worked with the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.760
 ball 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.670
 if the strong physics that works with 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.840
 the ball and so everything is reduced 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.390
 we all work 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.420
 We not work for example from 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.810
 long practices 11 against 11 18 against 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.379
 bolton against 9 in midfield always 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.290
 always in small fields not 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.360
 we work, we do not work very long 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.540
 we are with edison flowers here 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.950
 conversing in capital radio and they are 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.650
 you feel like you left at a good time 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.060
 that it was the best time to leave or with 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.489
 what has cost the adaptation of 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.819
 you suddenly feel that you could wait for a 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.090
 little more in college 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.939
 I feel that it is that I felt in that 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.620
 moment that was already was the opportunity to 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:56.170
 way was of opportunity we could not 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.469
 take advantage we could not take advantage 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.870
 because he came or he was playing he had 500 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:06.069
 minutes and in depth almost all the first 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.879
 part with a university student I think it was 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.700
 one was a time when I thought about 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.370
 that I had to go did not have to go or 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.030
 you still think the same 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.579
 yes yes from the beginning of a principle 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.460
 I knew it was going to cost and I knew I was going to 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.940
 being difficult was not going to be easy but 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.260
 and here I came across a group of 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.120
 club people with a group of people 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.290
 that I'm always going to vote you start to 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.410
 snow and I think that is the paramount thing 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.630
 I always mind always by all 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.490
 really try in the fastest 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.039
 possible for 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.660
 to be able to have the egg 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.330
 definitely Daniel I hear him talking 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.009
 to jason that has not fallen in perhaps one of 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.289
 the best teams in Spain in 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.430
 As for the training, the Villarreal is 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.349
 a team that works a lot with your 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.250
 quarry where he gives much importance to 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:08.630
 the games formed in your house and I 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.490
 I think it was the ideal time for 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.020
 leave today they are just fulfilled if not 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.409
 I made a mistake 19 years just 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.969
 compliments and nine years you do not 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.860
 and images of all the future that has 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:19.809
 ahead and I am convinced that 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.519
 in a few years he will be a figure in the 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:24.740
 Spanish football because the conditions and 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:28.550
 I have sincerely ambition 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.099
 I think it's a soccer player that 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.370
 we have for a future and with brilliant 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.419
 honestly it is not one of those I believe 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.800
 considered if you put yourself now 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.199
 ask all Peruvian journalism 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.759
 and the people in the street more or less 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.889
 design what is the selection that is going to 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.660
 play in the next playoff and I'll 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.699
 I assure that within that eleven holder 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:50.030
 everyone imagines if they are flowers 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:53.129
 that you're playing angel editing yo 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.279
 did at first 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.939
 the technician told me he needed me 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:02.350
 front and a forward 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:05.890
 being followed 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.050
 not now now in the first stage in the 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.510
 first year that it touched me and then basic of 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:14.050
 the steel matches now in this 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.940
 new year we are putting of band by 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.280
 right they can make the diagonal by 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.040
 right enter 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.900
 ok with the features that I play that 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.310
 has it was by right by state by 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.370
 inside inside any of the 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.169
 three positions behind the point 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.700
 quietly and even on tip 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.350
 play and can play from left end 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.210
 extreme right by the conditions that 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.500
 they have the characteristics of 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.600
 insurance that can yield in any 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.690
 those positions and he did thank you very much a 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.760

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.560

 to time and it never happened through your 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:04.170
 head back in these years 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:06.289
 or that never happens we have left of
