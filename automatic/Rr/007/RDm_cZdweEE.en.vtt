00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
I I find it hard to believe that
somebody<00:00:50.160> can't<00:00:50.700> make<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> parallel<00:00:51.719> if

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
somebody can't make the parallel if

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
somebody can't make the parallel if
