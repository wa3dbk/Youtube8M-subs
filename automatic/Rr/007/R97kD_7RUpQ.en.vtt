price I've seen him being talked about

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.170 
price I've seen him being talked about
as<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:51.600> potential<00:00:52.190> speculation<00:00:53.190> or<00:00:53.550> potential

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

card<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.629> invest<00:00:54.960> in<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.690> him<00:00:57.930> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
card to invest in I don't see him that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.740 
card to invest in I don't see him that
way<00:00:58.699> obviously<00:00:59.699> he's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> very<00:01:00.210> strong<00:01:00.329> card

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
way obviously he's a very strong card

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.399 
way obviously he's a very strong card
and<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.469> least<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:02.660> six<00:01:03.660> power<00:01:03.899> toughness

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and you at least get six power toughness

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.890 
and you at least get six power toughness
when<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.769> time<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.949> attack<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.489> him<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
when it's time to attack with him and

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
when it's time to attack with him and
then<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> gain<00:01:07.409> incrementally<00:01:08.369> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> like

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
then you gain incrementally kind of like

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.160 
then you gain incrementally kind of like
I<00:01:09.720> guess<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.400> creature<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:12.270> at<00:01:12.479> him

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I guess the the creature I look at him

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.260 
I guess the the creature I look at him
and<00:01:13.409> compared<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> him<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.700> I'm<00:01:14.909> an<00:01:15.090> old

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and compared to him and I'm an old

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.140 
and compared to him and I'm an old
school<00:01:15.540> player<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:16.610> like<00:01:17.610> five<00:01:17.880> five

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
school player is that one like five five

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.300 
school player is that one like five five
or<00:01:18.479> six<00:01:18.869> six<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> every<00:01:19.619> during<00:01:20.009> every

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
or six six and every during every

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.969 
or six six and every during every
player's<00:01:20.640> turn<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> 11<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
player's turn you get a 11 so then it's

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.399 
player's turn you get a 11 so then it's
your<00:01:23.640> turn<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.180> 11<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> next<00:01:25.020> turn<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.229> get

your turn I get 11 the next turn I get

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.190 
your turn I get 11 the next turn I get

of creating 21 ones i believe they were
supporting<00:01:51.390> he<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:51.960> Treefolk<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.590> some

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
supporting he was I got Treefolk of some

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
supporting he was I got Treefolk of some
time<00:01:52.920> kind<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.610> dude<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:55.200> a

time kind of like this dude you get a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.469 
time kind of like this dude you get a
2-2<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:55.860> manifest<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.579> asked<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> prefer<00:01:57.450> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
2-2 with manifest I asked you prefer to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.730 
2-2 with manifest I asked you prefer to
22<00:01:58.100> or<00:01:59.780> manufactures<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.990> 22<00:02:01.380> could<00:02:01.619> be

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
22 or manufactures that 22 could be

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740 
22 or manufactures that 22 could be
something<00:02:01.979> much<00:02:02.579> much<00:02:02.850> bigger<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.360> much<00:02:03.420> much

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
something much much bigger and much much

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.980 
something much much bigger and much much
better<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.229> 11<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.579> really<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.149> mean<00:02:06.240> yeah

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
better and 11 is not really I mean yeah

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.740 
better and 11 is not really I mean yeah
it's<00:02:07.200> nice<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:07.890> turn<00:02:08.520> 8<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:09.390> are<00:02:09.539> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it's nice but it's turn 8 what are you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.980 
it's nice but it's turn 8 what are you
really<00:02:10.349> producing<00:02:10.830> 11<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
really producing 11 for it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.350 
really producing 11 for it
I<00:02:12.050> mean<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.440> could<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:13.040> mean<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.120> could<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.330> a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
I mean it could be I mean it could be a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.030
