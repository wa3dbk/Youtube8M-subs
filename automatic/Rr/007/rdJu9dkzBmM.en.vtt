00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hey people back in the kitchen that 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.769
 means we cook something again today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:14.190
 together and low carb is currently available 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.120
 the topic could be everywhere and some could 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.170
 maybe not anymore 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.000
 but i have some recipes 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.480
 tried in the last time and one 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.220
 recipe is really delicious you save yes 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.289
 At low carb just calories 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.640
 not calories and carbohydrates 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.000
 Of course many have spaghetti 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.760
 carbohydrates and that's where I'm on 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.370
 twitter from the lovely woman peugeot 404 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.190
 on twitter get the tip celery 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.600
 try 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.270
 celery did not have like in the supermarket 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.980
 then I bought and I rettig 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.610
 swear to you, since it is only 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.989
 like spaghetti because it's really delicious 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.410
 Of course it tastes great 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.600
 zucchini spaghetti also as an alternative 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.510
 you can eat but I like it now 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 not so good that i really do 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.510
 every day would like it but yes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.090
 really tastes really delicious and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.430
 I think so comes from the taste 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.130
 you do not even taste that delicious 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 is of consistency and appearance 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.090
 and I do not really know 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 really hated or spaghetti on 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 soonest and yes I wanted you now 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.950
 show how to do it the way we need it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.909
 I think everybody knows that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.070
 what it looks like in salvage it looks like 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.909
 I 've already prepared something 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.380
 a bit smaller 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.380
 the shield was now very fast 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 so and then I have such a great one here 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:02.729
 This is one of the names of the device 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.109
 I'll say packaging so it looks 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.090
 and I also only cost 24 99 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.459
 have that in such a load with us now 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.629
 Bought 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.140
 this is a spiral cutter with it 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.599
 you can cut different spirals 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.590
 so it's always thinner and thinner 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:24.569
 There are various essays that the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.239
 you can put in here so 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.079
 can adjust and yes I think so 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.989
 really good 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.670
 I'm looking for something in the net 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.780
 like that and link that then 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:45.180
 infobox below because she wants something like that too 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:47.010
 then we put this in here and pull 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.620
 us 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:55.150
 Spaghetti you get here such great 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.190
 spaghetti threads 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.410
 I tear it then also in the meantime 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:13.080
 always off so that they are not too long 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:18.190
 become like that and at the end then stays that way 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:21.130
 little thing live a bit olive oil 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.760
 Put in the pan and wait for the pan 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.760
 gets hot 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.700
 I then add dried tomatoes 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.030
 purely want or taste are delicious 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.819
 optional 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.060
 whether it be light fresh tomatoes 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.140
 do rows or it just comes now 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.230
 also leave out 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:58.390
 you cut a bit fast 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:03.180
 Parsley because I have now epo and 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:07.590
 is there then later is pure anyway 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.590
 and I are a bit water conservation 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.090
 is not really just that 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.790
 not even half a glass through the one 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.290
 to be able to get away with it 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.360
 Dried tomatoes also a bit 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.669
 to become soft 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.870
 and I 've done stage 3 now 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:35.550
 my heart goes now to level 9 so 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.550
 is not set very high 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.919
 then a shot does not cream now either 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:49.120
 too much that's enough for one 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.100
 little bit on cooks and some herbs 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.240
 Cream cheese I have one with the stops he has 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:05:01.990
 now on 100 grams, the 28th 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:24.070
 carbohydrates I give about that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:26.080
 that herbal cream cheese you can now 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.830
 Of course, take normal cream cheese 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.039
 or cream cheese with other taste 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.810
 then we go a little salt 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:40.060
 not too much because the dry tomatoes 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:43.560
 are mostly salty and I admit and 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.560
 a bit sharper 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 and then I give the parsley 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:59.289
 To conclude purely puts once again 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.160
 tidy on full pulp again 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.160
 bring to the boil 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:13.710
 so we are done so it looks and 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.760
 now without flax so so if you 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.230
 not brought you now 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.700
 that is ultimately what you would think 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.700
 I'm just now noodles here plate 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:32.070
 caution hot yes as I said try it 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.010
 In any case, it 's great 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:38.850
 delicious and a great alternative to 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:40.890
 normal spaghetti and yes that was already 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.690
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.580
 I look forward to your comments and 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.050
 if you cook that then I would 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.270
 I look forward to instagram 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:52.010
 Post twitter or facebook with me 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:56.190
 or share or hashtag after megabyte 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:58.200
 on instagram and twitter and yes me 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.100
 would say we see each other then 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.100
