for<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> next<00:01:36.689> video<00:01:36.960> by<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
for the next video by going back to this

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.230 
for the next video by going back to this
method<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.119> looking<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:40.640> 450,000<00:01:41.640> combat

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
method we are looking at 450,000 combat

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.999 
method we are looking at 450,000 combat
experience<00:01:42.659> power<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.560> does<00:01:43.860> include

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
experience power so that does include

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.670 
experience power so that does include
constitution<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:45.960> method<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
constitution but for this method the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
constitution but for this method the
great<00:01:46.920> thing<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.850> can

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
great thing about it is that you can

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.260 
great thing about it is that you can
alter<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:49.799> experience<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> get<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
alter your experience so you can get a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.969 
alter your experience so you can get a
tack<00:01:51.689> experience<00:01:52.259> strength<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.619> experience

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
tack experience strength for experience

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.920 
tack experience strength for experience
different<00:01:53.310> experience<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.909> even<00:01:54.420> balanced

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
different experience or even balanced

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.590 
different experience or even balanced
they<00:01:55.909> should<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.060> able<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.390> those

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
they should be able to get you those

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
they should be able to get you those
high<00:01:57.780> hits<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> hope<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
high hits that you hope for but the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.340 
high hits that you hope for but the
great<00:01:59.460> thing<00:01:59.490> about<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:01.200> have

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
great thing about it is that they have

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.020 
great thing about it is that they have
such<00:02:01.710> low<00:02:01.979> health<00:02:02.219> which<00:02:02.640> means<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:02.909> you

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
such low health which means that you

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520 
such low health which means that you
don't<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.210> have<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> aim<00:02:03.659> for<00:02:03.689> extremely

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
don't really have to aim for extremely

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.590 
don't really have to aim for extremely
high<00:02:04.799> hit<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:05.729> they<00:02:05.880> already<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.360> very

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
high hit because they already have very

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.839 
high hit because they already have very
low<00:02:06.719> health<00:02:07.099> sadly<00:02:08.099> their<00:02:08.280> weakness<00:02:08.700> though

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
low health sadly their weakness though

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.220 
low health sadly their weakness though
is<00:02:09.030> crush<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:10.229> dalek<00:02:10.619> uses<00:02:11.250> /<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.450> those

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is crush and the dalek uses / so those

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.940 
is crush and the dalek uses / so those
are<00:02:13.260> two<00:02:13.470> things

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
are two things

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.140 
are two things
that<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.310> might<00:02:14.610> want<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:14.879> consider

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that you just might want to consider

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.330 
that you just might want to consider
maybe<00:02:15.480> whilst<00:02:15.900> doing<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.260> method<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:17.099> you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
maybe whilst doing this method if you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
maybe whilst doing this method if you
can<00:02:17.550> find<00:02:17.730> any<00:02:17.940> sort<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.180> benefit<00:02:18.569> at<00:02:18.720> all<00:02:18.870> that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
can find any sort of benefit at all that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.229 
can find any sort of benefit at all that
would<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.290> great<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.310> course<00:02:20.580> their

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
would be great but of course their

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.839 
would be great but of course their
weakness<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.840> crush<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.459> method

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
weakness is crush now for this method

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.400 
weakness is crush now for this method
though<00:02:24.060> you've<00:02:24.480> got<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.690> be<00:02:24.750> careful<00:02:24.989> with

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
though you've got to be careful with

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.400 
though you've got to be careful with
what<00:02:25.470> sorts<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.569> runescape<00:02:27.569> system<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.200> use

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
what sorts of runescape system you use

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.809 
what sorts of runescape system you use
you<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.590> are<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.769> going<00:02:28.920> to<00:02:28.980> use<00:02:29.190> legacy

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
you know are you going to use legacy

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.020 
you know are you going to use legacy
mode<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.269> evolution<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.290> combat<00:02:31.550> with<00:02:32.550> dark

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
mode or evolution of combat with dark

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.990 
mode or evolution of combat with dark
though<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.840> will<00:02:34.200> still<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.709> those<00:02:35.000> boosted

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
though you will still get those boosted

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.479 
though you will still get those boosted
hits<00:02:36.239> if<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.750> use<00:02:36.930> your<00:02:37.080> basic<00:02:37.470> abilities<00:02:37.950> in

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
hits if you use your basic abilities in

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
hits if you use your basic abilities in
the<00:02:38.730> evolution<00:02:39.060> of<00:02:39.120> combat<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.170> legacy

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the evolution of combat but in legacy

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.809 
the evolution of combat but in legacy
may<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.769> don't<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.220> worry<00:02:41.430> about<00:02:41.549> that

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
may you don't have to worry about that

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.000 
may you don't have to worry about that
kind<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.060> stuff<00:02:42.120> because<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> your<00:02:43.799> hits

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
kind of stuff because all of your hits

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.589 
kind of stuff because all of your hits
will<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.549> same<00:02:44.760> bonus<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.420> only

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
will have that same bonus but the only

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.720 
will have that same bonus but the only
downside<00:02:46.260> when<00:02:46.560> they<00:02:46.709> pretty<00:02:47.370> much<00:02:47.459> in<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
downside when they pretty much in the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.520 
downside when they pretty much in the
evolution<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.180> combat<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.440> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
evolution of combat is that if you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.530 
evolution of combat is that if you
usually<00:02:49.650> threshold<00:02:50.340> abilities<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.209> won't

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
usually threshold abilities you won't

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.289 
usually threshold abilities you won't
get<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.870> Dalek<00:02:52.260> boost<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:54.030> know<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
get that Dalek boost of you know the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.640 
get that Dalek boost of you know the
lower<00:02:54.480> your<00:02:54.660> health<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.049> higher<00:02:55.230> your<00:02:55.440> head

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
lower your health the higher your head

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.900 
lower your health the higher your head
so<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.799> won't<00:02:56.040> get<00:02:56.099> that<00:02:56.220> kind<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.489> boost<00:02:56.700> if

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
so you won't get that kind of boost if

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.670 
so you won't get that kind of boost if
you<00:02:57.420> are<00:02:57.599> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> evolution<00:02:58.230> of<00:02:58.290> combat<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
you are on the evolution of combat and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.470 
you are on the evolution of combat and
using<00:02:59.069> like<00:02:59.160> threshold<00:02:59.579> abilities<00:02:59.970> or

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
using like threshold abilities or

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.910 
using like threshold abilities or
ultimate<00:03:00.930> abilities<00:03:01.349> those<00:03:01.530> kind<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.769> things

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
ultimate abilities those kind of things

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.460 
ultimate abilities those kind of things
won't<00:03:02.190> work<00:03:02.250> as<00:03:02.640> regards<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.840> your<00:03:03.930> inventory

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
won't work as regards to your inventory

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.110 
won't work as regards to your inventory
you<00:03:04.620> don't<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.040> go<00:03:05.190> like<00:03:05.430> full<00:03:05.730> out<00:03:05.880> this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you don't have to go like full out this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.000 
you don't have to go like full out this
is<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.299> very<00:03:06.569> easy<00:03:06.630> method<00:03:07.230> all<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.470> bought<00:03:07.829> was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
is a very easy method all I bought was

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559 
is a very easy method all I bought was
some<00:03:08.160> overloads<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.819> prayer<00:03:09.000> potions<00:03:09.390> and

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
some overloads and prayer potions and

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.509 
some overloads and prayer potions and
some<00:03:09.720> perennials<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.380> last<00:03:10.560> me<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.860> half

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
some perennials the last me about half

rare job and they will job effigies now
I<00:03:50.549> did<00:03:50.970> do<00:03:51.090> some<00:03:51.239> research<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.930> effigies<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
I did do some research on effigies and

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.190 
I did do some research on effigies and
also<00:03:53.850> because<00:03:54.180> they're<00:03:54.329> very<00:03:54.569> rare<00:03:54.870> on<00:03:55.019> this

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
also because they're very rare on this

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.620 
also because they're very rare on this
sort<00:03:55.500> of<00:03:55.530> keel<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:56.010> did<00:03:56.459> some<00:03:56.579> research<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.180> you

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
sort of keel I did some research and you

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.170 
sort of keel I did some research and you
should<00:03:57.870> be<00:03:58.019> seeing<00:03:58.290> one<00:03:58.650> effigy<00:03:59.130> every<00:03:59.819> two<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
should be seeing one effigy every two to

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.420 
should be seeing one effigy every two to
five<00:04:00.569> thousand<00:04:01.019> keels<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:02.099> means<00:04:02.340> that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
five thousand keels which means that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.520 
five thousand keels which means that
because<00:04:02.819> you<00:04:02.910> can<00:04:03.030> kill<00:04:03.349> 902<00:04:04.349> about<00:04:04.500> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
because you can kill 902 about a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.860 
because you can kill 902 about a
thousand<00:04:05.099> per<00:04:05.190> hour<00:04:05.340> doing<00:04:05.790> this<00:04:05.940> method<00:04:06.359> you

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
thousand per hour doing this method you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.770 
thousand per hour doing this method you
are<00:04:07.079> looking<00:04:07.410> about<00:04:07.560> one<00:04:07.799> effigy<00:04:08.220> every<00:04:08.849> two

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
are looking about one effigy every two

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.409 
are looking about one effigy every two
to<00:04:09.829> six<00:04:10.829> hours<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.519> you<00:04:11.579> should<00:04:11.880> expect<00:04:12.180> one

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
to six hours so you should expect one

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.839 
to six hours so you should expect one
every<00:04:12.989> so<00:04:13.169> often<00:04:13.349> which<00:04:13.709> means<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.069> along

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
every so often which means that along

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.699 
every so often which means that along
with<00:04:14.880> the<00:04:15.090> effigy<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.930> might<00:04:16.169> get<00:04:16.289> an<00:04:16.410> extra

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
with the effigy you might get an extra

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.409 
with the effigy you might get an extra
boost<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.400> know<00:04:17.519> if<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.669> do<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:17.940> one<00:04:18.180> of

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
boost you know if you do get one of

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.620 
boost you know if you do get one of
around<00:04:19.099> 20,000<00:04:20.099> experience<00:04:20.489> per<00:04:20.579> hour<00:04:20.729> but

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
around 20,000 experience per hour but

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.750 
around 20,000 experience per hour but
not<00:04:22.109> obviously<00:04:22.409> in<00:04:22.560> combat<00:04:23.010> but<00:04:23.250> that's

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
not obviously in combat but that's

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.950 
not obviously in combat but that's
something<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.180> might<00:04:24.300> want<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.539> look<00:04:24.630> forward

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
something you might want to look forward

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.089 
something you might want to look forward
to<00:04:25.050> whilst<00:04:25.229> doing<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.500> method<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.010> know

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
to whilst doing this method you know

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.510 
to whilst doing this method you know
like<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.340> little<00:04:26.640> surprise<00:04:26.970> every<00:04:27.240> few

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
like a little surprise every few

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.240 
like a little surprise every few
hours<00:04:27.789> but<00:04:28.389> because<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.080> method<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:29.949> fast

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
hours but because this method is so fast

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.909 
hours but because this method is so fast
near<00:04:31.050> 450,000<00:04:32.050> combat<00:04:32.319> experience<00:04:32.680> per<00:04:32.770> hour

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
get and get so it might be something you

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.580 
get and get so it might be something you
might<00:04:40.180> get<00:04:40.389> every<00:04:40.720> so<00:04:40.870> often<00:04:41.080> if<00:04:41.319> you<00:04:41.409> do<00:04:41.500> this

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
might get every so often if you do this

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.589 
might get every so often if you do this
method<00:04:41.919> quite<00:04:42.310> often<00:04:42.490> but<00:04:42.940> it's<00:04:43.479> not

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
method quite often but it's not

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:44.999 
method quite often but it's not
something<00:04:43.810> that<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.110> should<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.590> know<00:04:44.680> camp

something that you should you know camp

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.680 
something that you should you know camp
here<00:04:45.190> for<00:04:45.220> because<00:04:45.759> it's<00:04:46.240> sort<00:04:46.479> of<00:04:46.539> like<00:04:46.629> a
