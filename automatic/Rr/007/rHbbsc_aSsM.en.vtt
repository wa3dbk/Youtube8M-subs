00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.630
 seen 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.100
 Baker at that baffled you that you no 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.370
 offside is increasing 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.720

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.040
 of the sands of the sand shoots and that 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.630
 palm over yourself 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.250
 biggest chance for fc twente in the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.250
 second half if you don't like the sand 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.350
 there very much recommend the right unlocked 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.460
 of the holy mountain at speed 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.480
 the reason for being in the knight and church dike 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.480
 the in between 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.930
 van lunteren tap wide of fun and 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.110
 in the hands of my sari van 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.110
 Veenendaal 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.820
 fc twente with diets 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.450
 diets to grow along from the mosque 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.560
 now almost to the eretreffer 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.560
 fc twente de a 4 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:14.760
 what art and flight work it remains 0 4 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.760
 again only a few guns 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.700
 Ajax wins with zero here with excellent 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.590
 football 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.720
 here at fc twente the reigning 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.000
 national champion 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.810
 nicer phones after the disappointing 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.980
 0 0 against Utrecht becomes a difference with 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.320
 last Friday 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.640
 yes very nice anyway really one 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.070
 much nicer 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.860
 I think we were the god team 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:46.030
 has shown that those are the criticisms 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.070
 had we had them having to 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.870
 have taken themselves and yes there is mine 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.580
 way to show that you have 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.140
 understood and that is just a good one 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.000
 play a game 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.130
 well they did it here at the 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.990
 leader Novy you win then you have it 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:03.700
 well done this is a new start 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.320
 continue to embroider for embroidery 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.860
 what we are doing 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.030
 Friday is then one or day stories color 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.160
 And that is acidic then there at that time 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.110
 is because it is unnecessary when you look 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.940
 to the match and and the opponent 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.500
 and the chances that you have the spaces that you have 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.000
 have to play we don't do it then 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.640
 is that acid 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.660
 we haven't had any time tonight either 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.120
 we don't have it either 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.530
 well done and we are also sloppy and 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.000
 but good as you but at least 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.470
 are willing to stay together 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.580
 Do keep the spaces small then 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.770
 you don't have to 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.820
 have no coal and consequences but 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.460
 for us especially for was mainly 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.560
 from important that we we with one 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.360
 good intention and then can 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.640
 you can still play evenly 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.880
 or lose me is what we do 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.470
 intention on the field is a 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.950
 won and now look at file 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.660
 and secure pu PSV we find one so they 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.060
 again pack 3 points and again 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.620
 show such a match then I have 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.610
 we come a step closer and again 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.020
 at the top 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.840
 you know we can measure ourselves against the 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.190
 top and that show today so yes 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.960
 there is just much more to the team than 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.300
 that we have shown so far on 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.620
 play dialysate has already been shown and also all this 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.810
 year is that we just peak and fall 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.730
 and yes we need as little as possible 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.660
 troughs and we can very well 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.720
 play football 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.730
 further waited psv at home well I hope so 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.620
 what people are heading for and that we are there 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.770
 can also continue this line and then 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.240
 then yes then you touch and it is 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.480
 important for the girls now this 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.220
 result they take with me and I have them 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.960
 constantly told of boys' faith 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.160
 can play good football to yourself 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.230
 we need a good result once 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:39.180
 maybe this is the turnaround 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.180
 and that it becomes easier
