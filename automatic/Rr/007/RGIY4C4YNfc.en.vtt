00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 Hello everyone, super mario, you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.040
 see video Gaidar already excavated lanka 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:26.670
 Today we will disassemble p90 Ems with this 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.180
 improved version in it more 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.480
 cartridges like if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.490
 added so now show skills 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.350
 there will be so much last return well 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.910
 Dexterity and throw range is for 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.970
 convenience to me personally 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.239
 how will be dressed 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.320
 no just a helmet will be dressed for a coupon all 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.680
 by zeros as usual 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.410
 passed in advance to the room we start here 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.430
 battle now show on the walls to she 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.320
 shoots take the average distance such 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.239
 if you just hold and do not let go 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.449
 there will be such a life 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.199
 if you just cover it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.240
 will only 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.210
 vertical cottage naturally if 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.290
 yell lowered then everything flies 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.479
 quite a lot 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.450
 that is, this bit for kosyachil but you can 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.800
 to the ideal finish off in sight actually 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.670
 same return only 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.440
 smaller i.e. go up to the side if 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.300
 just clamp if only to click 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.020
 up and if clicked lower 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.850
 everything is pretty heap going guns 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.810
 principle designed to kill 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.750
 it is in the head so we will try 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:45.270
 there is no need to have any special equipment here 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.270
 danced at the head and everything 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.880
 here is the first customer went our 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 as if we were not taken from the pomegranate 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:05.090
 but I already for kosyachil on close 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.950
 distances you can shoot spray but 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.630
 medium already desirable to click if 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.240
 to the head 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.210
 weapon damage is not very big so 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.360
 in the body is not very cool will kill 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:23.150
 that we should try to shoot 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.130
 It is in the head that is, and to have the first 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.959
 the person took down the mask and naturally 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.880
 desirable because the damage is not very big 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.010
 and of course the mask is not very penetrates 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.470
 it is advisable to buy a mask with anti 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.470
 helmet that is more convenient to play was just 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.670
 so now the principle of arms 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.910
 big do not say nothing 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.410
 because here everything is simple 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.750
 you can basically shoot yourself in the body 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.550
 try now here's show but in 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.510
 principle for shooting a body is desirable 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.510
 set the rate of fire 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.390
 boy you doing something here boy 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.260
 braids were already visible there from above 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 prototype is sitting 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.129
 I'm trying to do it now 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 run to kill somebody in the body that 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.780
 had an idea what it is 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.500
 So 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.830
 for kosyachok head again 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.150
 he even a few cross POS 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.150
 it will be convenient for me 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.390
 that is, see what's in the body 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.430
 he would kill us there our team 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.250
 He helped lead that is in the body kills 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.900
 pretty long enough so just 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.900
 kill head faster 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.090
 that is, it is immediately noticeable on the result 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.970
 that I am in the body of the clip holder released this what 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.060
 as if in the head 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.990
 one bullet fired so to speak and there still 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.890
 left over by other opponents they 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.890
 ran out of topic so guys 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.900
 I'm really confused here 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.760
 here is my girlfriend sitting to my left 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.430
 I'm shooting me as I shoot a video 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.580
 guide so in the near future 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.310
 see the guide on how to shoot a video 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.860
 Hyde here is such a fatherly thing will be 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.490
 so here's a guy here and some kind of mask 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.010
 saved him 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.250
 and here too the guy mask damn what 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.190
 this will need to be broadcast if you 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.290
 buy in arms as already noticed 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.280
 I do not say anything because everyone said 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.550
 here for the first 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.640
 30 seconds of the battle if there is nothing difficult 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.770
 with this weapon, the main thing is to have at least 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.770
 some which i don't have 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:07.100
 miraculously killed the body of the boy prices 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:10.520
 It was probably for kosyachil there is still 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.030
 such a topic is something you can just do 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.500
 strafe 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.389
 stop and shoot 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.760
 purposefully targeted to the head 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.870
 but it's a bit off to me this weapon 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.910
 it seems here you can support a little 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.900
 that is, but not much, that is, you should be able to 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.900
 stop so to speak 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.960
 c 3 did not take well oh well 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.810
 So 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.820
 let's go now on the left side there too 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.470
 good position there can be there from above 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.240
 someone climb constantly you can there 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.700
 take off 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.700
 try this type of og 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.050
 need to somehow catch here 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.240
 and to the post office 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.360
 volume on this type let's go just 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.360
 kill 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.400
 so cool 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.260
 so I didn't understand that you killed me 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.120
 there for type sits still interesting 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.120
 it seems not 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:43.279
 the guy stitches sees to hung normally 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.259
 so now and brazen just ran 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:49.539
 cutting the enemy for an hour is probably not 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:53.199
 we are not killed yet i'm tough here 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:53.199
 sorry grenade did not have time to throw 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.770
 that people are already tightened 15 9 by the way 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:06.490
 Guy can and better in principle but here 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:11.430
 The third fight for today is Sasha here two fights 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.430
 Stepushka just played with him and everything 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.449
 Do we Panova is very tough 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:28.880
 so ended the fight with a score of 17 and 9 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:32.600
 so here we come out crashing 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.260
 so if I didnâ€™t say what 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.260
 skills if 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.229
 do so to kill the body then 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.970
 better to put a speed arrow 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.740
 that is, but with him is not very comfortable in 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.120
 head that is if you want to shoot at 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.219
 head, you can still put some 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.379
 scatter that is, but I just have my own 

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:54.289
 recoil if in the body many are 

00:07:49.379 --> 00:07:56.860
 rate of fire that is like that 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.439
 I don't know, maybe one more 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.270
 no news showed everything thanks 

00:07:59.439 --> 00:08:03.360
 watched the most important play &amp; for 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.360
 pleasures
