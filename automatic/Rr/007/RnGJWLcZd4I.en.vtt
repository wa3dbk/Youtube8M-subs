00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
line up here cut the sitter out and then

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.710 
line up here cut the sitter out and then
fold<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.299> pretty<00:01:15.930> much<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> cone<00:01:17.720> see

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
fold it up pretty much like a cone see

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.980 
fold it up pretty much like a cone see
that<00:01:18.930> that's<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.409> bottom<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.790> left<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that that's the bottom of it I left that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.999 
that that's the bottom of it I left that
the<00:01:22.380> lip<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.369> very<00:01:24.180> edge<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.470> plate<00:01:25.710> as

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the lip on the very edge of the plate as

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.510 
the lip on the very edge of the plate as
you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.460> around<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.880> perimeter<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:28.520> give

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you can see around the perimeter to give

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.770 
you can see around the perimeter to give
it<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> spread<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:31.710> takes<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it the spread that it takes to kind of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.590 
it the spread that it takes to kind of
keep<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:34.770> being<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.100> straight<00:01:35.369> cone<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
keep it from being a straight cone the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630 
keep it from being a straight cone the
tops<00:01:36.840> open<00:01:37.320> for<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> probably

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
tops open for now I'm going to probably

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.200 
tops open for now I'm going to probably
make<00:01:39.210> some<00:01:39.240> paper<00:01:39.570> towel<00:01:40.070> cloth<00:01:41.070> around<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
make some paper towel cloth around the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.330 
make some paper towel cloth around the
edge<00:01:42.299> give<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:42.810> room<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> smoke<00:01:44.100> come

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
edge give some room for the smoke come

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.359 
edge give some room for the smoke come
out<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.270> fold<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.290> into<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> cone<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
out when you fold it up into a cone and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
out when you fold it up into a cone and
you're<00:01:48.360> using<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.659> lot<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> glue<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> got<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
you're using a lot of glue so you got to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.600 
you're using a lot of glue so you got to
be<00:01:49.740> careful<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.130> don't<00:01:50.220> want<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> over

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
be careful you don't want to over

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.310 
be careful you don't want to over
saturate<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.780> take<00:01:52.259> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
saturate and then you can just take a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.069 
saturate and then you can just take a
close<00:01:53.100> pin<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.700> clip<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.270> cone<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.750> keep<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
close pin and clip your cone to keep it

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.569 
close pin and clip your cone to keep it
the<00:01:55.259> cone<00:01:55.470> shape<00:01:56.810> I'll<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:57.990> wire<00:01:58.229> cutters

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
the cone shape I'll use wire cutters
