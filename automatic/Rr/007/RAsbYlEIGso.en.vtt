00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:07.890
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.130
 video tutorial about search engines 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.070
 of drivers or drivers I am cristian 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 calvera good the first thing I have them 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.900
 it's called driver identifies 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.870
 driver identify in version 4.2 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 point 3 is a scan of drivers or 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:32.239
 controllers remember that it is a 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.080
 program because it looks for updates or 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.489
 drivers that are needed in your 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.730
 computer 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.360
 there the drivers are scanning 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360
 what's wrong with it 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.760
 well we see that it stopped there good 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.130
 when you have finished scanning 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.050
 drivers simply what 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.290
 does this is 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.850
 minimized there is minimized opens the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.610
 browser that has default 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.500
 configured in this case a case 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.310
 internet explorer and then search 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.960
 we finish the siesta well if it's bad if 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.119
 is regular then when it says good 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.160
 it's because the controller is 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.080
 updated and when this update is 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.680
 because there is an update of said 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680
 controller 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.320
 they download it and simply install it on 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:35.230
 sure is very basic the second of them 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.230
 it's driver and yes 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.390
 driver li zhi wen or install a 4.3 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:46.150
 point all and see what 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.010
 good this controller also similar 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.970
 the other only that is a little more 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.070
 complex and 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.710
 you just give it to scan there 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.060
 the good process appears in my case 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.940
 I have the professional 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 this means that they can download and 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.920
 install several drivers but if 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.750
 outside the normal version the basic one of 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.520
 then this will only test 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.390
 allows to download one by one and with one 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.390
 very slow speed 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.700
 after I do the scan here they say 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.800
 what are the obsolete drivers or 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.980
 the missing ones and it's just going to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.520
 get drivers 6 download them and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520
 They installed 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.230
 and finally another of the controlled 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.800
 another driver finder is 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.800
 drivermax 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:41.210
 drivermax is another program only that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.210
 this you have to create an account because 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.830
 obviously if your kind of accounts cold 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.990
 be free but also obviously 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.080
 subscribe and pay a lot of money 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.730
 for the service but when you 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.160
 downloads you have to register your mail 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.230
 your password to access the service 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.440
 of driver max otherwise you can not 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.970
 download any drive simply the 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.180
 cinnamon 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.950
 after that scan obviously you 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.710
 will tell which drivers you need or 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.780
 controller you can only download 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.660
 two per day 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.180
 if you are in the part as a free user 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.510
 the controllers per day and install them 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.330
 You can not do the rest when you need 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.590
 you have simply given a plan and you 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.590
 the page comes out 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.740
 so let's bless that continue as 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.140
 free user 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.160
 and here it simply tells you that now you 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.340
 open the page and here it looks in the same 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.410
 max driver server 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.290
 obviously the driver that is needed 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.599
 but more because it is loading and there 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.769
 they simply talk to him later after 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.989
 that leaves you a few seconds what you download and 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.300
 simply that here you will see a 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.560
 option where you can see the 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.519
 drivers to download and go 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.110
 downloading solos here generally 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.849
 well these were the controllers of 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.280
 drivers is very important to maintain a 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:19.440
 counter updated your system 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.650
 operative its obviously its processor 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.360
 and all the base ports and other things 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.300
 then it is our programs are 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.700
 good because windows does not update them 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.090
 by themselves unless they are windows 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.590
 update that will be called and never does it - 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.330
 and cristian boiler and I hope you like it 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.250
 these videotutorials that are doing 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.520
 about technology we'll see you in the next 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.520
 bye
