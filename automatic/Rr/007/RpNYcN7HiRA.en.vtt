recently<00:02:46.079> retched<00:02:46.439> the<00:02:46.650> pattern<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.370> stops

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
recently retched the pattern that stops

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.839 
recently retched the pattern that stops
people<00:02:48.000> from<00:02:48.510> pretty<00:02:49.290> much<00:02:49.549> reusing<00:02:50.549> games

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
people from pretty much reusing games

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.210 
people from pretty much reusing games
now<00:02:51.540> it's<00:02:51.720> using<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.109> tagging<00:02:52.590> system<00:02:52.980> where<00:02:53.129> it

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
now it's using a tagging system where it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.179 
now it's using a tagging system where it
tags<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.819> game<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:54.840> particular<00:02:55.189> console

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
tags the game to the particular console

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.670 
tags the game to the particular console
or<00:02:56.370> user<00:02:56.669> we're<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.209> sure<00:02:57.480> which<00:02:57.750> yet<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:58.590> it

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
or user we're not sure which yet but it

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.409 
or user we're not sure which yet but it
tags<00:02:58.950> them<00:02:59.250> so<00:02:59.549> basically<00:02:59.879> it's<00:02:59.969> a<00:03:00.030> one<00:03:00.239> use

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
tags them so basically it's a one use

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.670 
tags them so basically it's a one use
only<00:03:00.569> thing<00:03:00.959> once<00:03:01.169> you<00:03:01.260> finish<00:03:01.530> with<00:03:01.620> your

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
only thing once you finish with your

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.110 
only thing once you finish with your
game<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.280> can't<00:03:02.579> give<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.849> someone<00:03:03.090> else

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
game you can't give it to someone else

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.059 
game you can't give it to someone else
you<00:03:03.329> can't<00:03:03.569> sell<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:04.379> it'll<00:03:04.829> only

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
you can't sell it because it'll only

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.559 
you can't sell it because it'll only
work<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.579> that<00:03:05.730> particular<00:03:05.849> user<00:03:06.269> or

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
work with that particular user or

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.289 
work with that particular user or
console<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:08.069> obviously<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.819> know<00:03:08.939> stops

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
console so this obviously you know stops

this<00:03:52.259> pirating<00:03:52.739> it's<00:03:53.459> likely<00:03:53.970> gonna<00:03:54.090> happen

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
this pirating it's likely gonna happen

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.909 
this pirating it's likely gonna happen
obviously<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.139> patent<00:03:55.439> doesn't<00:03:55.680> mean<00:03:55.799> is

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
obviously the patent doesn't mean is

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.469 
obviously the patent doesn't mean is
definitely<00:03:56.430> gonna<00:03:56.579> happen<00:03:56.970> but<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.329> just

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
definitely gonna happen but it just

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.460 
definitely gonna happen but it just
means<00:03:57.629> that<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:57.930> when<00:03:58.019> you're<00:03:58.139> looking<00:03:58.379> into

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
means that so when you're looking into

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.319 
means that so when you're looking into
the<00:03:58.739> idea<00:03:59.009> and<00:03:59.069> testing<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.549> waters<00:03:59.939> and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
the idea and testing the waters and

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.640 
the idea and testing the waters and
obviously<00:04:00.629> testing<00:04:01.109> their<00:04:01.259> pattern<00:04:01.530> so

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
obviously testing their pattern so

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.199 
obviously testing their pattern so
nobody<00:04:01.919> else<00:04:01.949> can<00:04:02.129> copy<00:04:02.459> them<00:04:02.699> which<00:04:03.180> is

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
nobody else can copy them which is

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.300 
nobody else can copy them which is
always<00:04:03.599> always<00:04:04.139> good<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.769> major

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
always always good to do a major

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.979 
always always good to do a major
companies<00:04:05.790> all<00:04:05.909> pattern<00:04:06.269> things<00:04:06.449> anyway<00:04:06.810> just

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
companies all pattern things anyway just

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.409 
companies all pattern things anyway just
in<00:04:07.620> case<00:04:07.680> they<00:04:08.069> need<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.340> use<00:04:08.519> it<00:04:08.759> and<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.359> know

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:09.419 
in case they need to use it and you know

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.759 
in case they need to use it and you know
they'll<00:04:09.629> find<00:04:09.900> them<00:04:10.079> that<00:04:10.259> someone<00:04:10.470> else<00:04:10.530> has

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
they'll find them that someone else has

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.349 
they'll find them that someone else has
bought<00:04:10.979> it<00:04:11.129> because<00:04:11.250> they<00:04:11.669> haven't<00:04:11.819> patented

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
bought it because they haven't patented

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.759 
bought it because they haven't patented
it<00:04:12.479> so<00:04:12.599> it's<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.810> safety<00:04:13.290> precaution<00:04:13.409> of

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
it so it's a safety precaution of

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.920 
it so it's a safety precaution of
anything<00:04:14.159> but<00:04:14.699> let<00:04:15.299> me<00:04:15.329> know<00:04:15.419> what<00:04:15.629> you<00:04:15.720> think

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
contract really that's the main reason

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.770 
contract really that's the main reason
and<00:05:17.130> it's<00:05:17.400> expensive<00:05:17.820> upgrades<00:05:18.180> so<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.690> know

then<00:05:20.580> upgrade<00:05:20.970> it<00:05:21.480> just<00:05:21.750> saves<00:05:21.900> money<00:05:22.140> as

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320
