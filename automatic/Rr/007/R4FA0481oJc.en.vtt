00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.130 
confused on where you're supposed to be
going<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:12.040> aside<00:04:12.640> from<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.330> should<00:04:14.050> be

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
going but aside from that you should be

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.080 
going but aside from that you should be
fine

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
fine

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.349 
fine
and<00:04:16.530> most<00:04:17.530> hits<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.340> one<00:04:18.640> hit<00:04:18.820> that<00:04:18.970> he<00:04:19.120> got

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
and most hits the one hit that he got

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.300 
and most hits the one hit that he got
was<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.810> one<00:04:20.109> move<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.500> doesn't<00:04:20.980> knock<00:04:21.130> you

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
was the one move that doesn't knock you

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.870 
was the one move that doesn't knock you
down<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.700> one<00:04:21.910> HP<00:04:22.180> immediately<00:04:23.520> he's<00:04:24.520> really

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
down to one HP immediately he's really

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.330 
down to one HP immediately he's really
so<00:04:25.090> strong<00:04:25.450> that<00:04:25.630> he's<00:04:25.890> unforgiving<00:04:26.890> if<00:04:27.010> you

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
so strong that he's unforgiving if you

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.180 
so strong that he's unforgiving if you
get<00:04:27.669> him<00:04:28.030> in<00:04:28.210> any<00:04:28.990> position<00:04:29.410> where<00:04:29.770> he<00:04:29.860> can<00:04:30.040> hit

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
get him in any position where he can hit

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.920 
get him in any position where he can hit
you<00:04:30.870> you're<00:04:31.870> getting<00:04:32.110> down<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.380> one<00:04:32.530> HP<00:04:33.930> but

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
you you're getting down to one HP but

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.210 
you you're getting down to one HP but
aside<00:04:35.110> from<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.320> is<00:04:35.560> actually<00:04:35.830> really<00:04:35.980> easy

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
aside from that is actually really easy

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:57.850 
aside from that is actually really easy
I<00:04:36.370> didn't<00:04:36.610> even<00:04:36.760> have<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.120> heal

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.699

so yeah cutting and editing for the
surprise<00:05:01.949> potion<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:02.639> kind<00:05:02.819> of<00:05:02.879> pointless

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:03.089 
surprise potion was kind of pointless

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:04.639

to the Badlands real quick the crest is
still<00:05:29.339> here<00:05:30.179> so<00:05:30.719> you<00:05:30.779> can<00:05:31.019> fight<00:05:31.289> him<00:05:31.439> time<00:05:31.589> and

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
still here so you can fight him time and

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.739 
still here so you can fight him time and
time<00:05:31.830> again<00:05:31.889> but<00:05:32.459> obviously<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.389> won't<00:05:33.599> get

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:43.529 
real quick a little more strengthen the

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.929 
real quick a little more strengthen the
ultimate<00:05:43.949> weapon<00:05:44.339> and<00:05:46.219> for<00:05:47.219> whatever<00:05:47.399> reason

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
ultimate weapon and for whatever reason

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.509 
ultimate weapon and for whatever reason
I<00:05:48.649> actually<00:05:49.649> didn't<00:05:50.039> have<00:05:50.189> the<00:05:50.309> Royal

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:50.519 
I actually didn't have the Royal

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:52.369 
I actually didn't have the Royal
radiance<00:05:51.029> equipped<00:05:51.389> during<00:05:51.659> that<00:05:51.809> I<00:05:52.019> had<00:05:52.229> the

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
radiance equipped during that I had the

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.749 
radiance equipped during that I had the
ultimate<00:05:52.709> weapon<00:05:53.009> so<00:05:53.159> I<00:05:53.219> could<00:05:53.399> have<00:05:53.490> finished

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
ultimate weapon so I could have finished

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.239 
ultimate weapon so I could have finished
that<00:05:53.819> even<00:05:54.089> faster<00:05:55.610> but<00:05:56.779> anyway<00:05:58.189> here's<00:05:59.189> the

00:05:59.239 --> 00:05:59.249 
that even faster but anyway here's the

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:03.000 
that even faster but anyway here's the
void<00:05:59.550> gear

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.670 

for<00:06:03.700> some<00:06:04.000> reason<00:06:04.420> it<00:06:04.540> actually<00:06:04.870> suits<00:06:05.200> aqua

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
for some reason it actually suits aqua

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.070 
for some reason it actually suits aqua
kind<00:06:05.920> of<00:06:06.070> well<00:06:07.890> like<00:06:08.890> whether<00:06:09.070> leggings<00:06:09.700> or

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
kind of well like whether leggings or

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.460 
kind of well like whether leggings or
the<00:06:11.080> black<00:06:11.830> and<00:06:11.860> white<00:06:12.250> goes<00:06:12.550> good<00:06:12.970> with<00:06:13.180> her

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
the black and white goes good with her

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.409 
the black and white goes good with her
surprisingly

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.390 

and<00:06:18.599> unfortunately<00:06:19.319> technically<00:06:20.069> this<00:06:20.280> is

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
and unfortunately technically this is

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.800 
and unfortunately technically this is
gonna<00:06:20.550> be<00:06:20.729> my<00:06:20.909> way<00:06:21.090> of<00:06:21.120> showing<00:06:21.419> off<00:06:21.629> this

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
gonna be my way of showing off this
