hold<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.380> again<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.250> turn<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.520> move<00:02:35.670> counter

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
hold it again to turn the move counter

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.970 
hold it again to turn the move counter
on<00:02:37.520> now<00:02:38.520> when<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.820> play<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> clock<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.740> side

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
on now when we play the clock the side

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.520 
on now when we play the clock the side
that<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.390> player<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.660> whose<00:02:43.140> turn<00:02:43.350> it<00:02:43.470> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
that is the player that whose turn it is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.700 
that is the player that whose turn it is
to<00:02:43.650> move<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.520> will<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.850> blinking<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:48.710> notice

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
to move this will be blinking and notice

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.370 
to move this will be blinking and notice
how<00:02:49.920> in<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:51.030> Braunstein<00:02:51.600> mode<00:02:51.870> it

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
how in this Braunstein mode it

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.360 
how in this Braunstein mode it
effectively<00:02:52.860> works<00:02:53.190> as<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.489> delay<00:02:54.650> since<00:02:55.650> when

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
effectively works as a delay since when

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.979 
effectively works as a delay since when
you<00:02:56.550> make<00:02:56.850> your<00:02:57.000> move<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.600> get<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
you make your move you get the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.000 
you make your move you get the
five-second<00:02:58.709> delay

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
five-second delay

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.820 
five-second delay
added<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.580> your<00:02:59.700> side<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.380> next<00:03:01.410> move

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
added to your side for the next move

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
added to your side for the next move
you're<00:03:02.010> going<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.280> make<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:05.040> called<00:03:05.640> a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
you're going to make and it's called a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.530 
you're going to make and it's called a
non<00:03:06.150> accumulating<00:03:07.080> increment<00:03:07.739> meaning<00:03:08.510> if<00:03:09.510> we

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
non accumulating increment meaning if we

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.390 
non accumulating increment meaning if we
play<00:03:09.900> quickly<00:03:11.030> those<00:03:12.030> 5<00:03:12.300> seconds<00:03:12.750> will<00:03:12.930> not

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
play quickly those 5 seconds will not

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.370 
play quickly those 5 seconds will not
accumulate<00:03:14.400> they<00:03:15.030> will<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.450> increase<00:03:15.870> to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
accumulate they will just increase to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.020 
accumulate they will just increase to
the<00:03:16.530> last<00:03:16.770> time<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:17.850> it's

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
the last time you have so it's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.220 
the last time you have so it's
essentially<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.570> different<00:03:18.780> way<00:03:19.200> of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
essentially a different way of

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.120 
essentially a different way of
indicating<00:03:19.880> displaying<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.060> delay

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
indicating displaying the delay

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.930 
indicating displaying the delay
notice<00:03:23.130> how<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.310> move<00:03:23.640> moves<00:03:24.450> are<00:03:24.660> increasing

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
notice how the move moves are increasing

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.340 
notice how the move moves are increasing
if<00:03:26.940> we<00:03:27.150> want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.390> pause<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.570> clock<00:03:27.900> we<00:03:28.230> can

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
if we want to pause the clock we can

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.430 
if we want to pause the clock we can
just<00:03:28.530> level<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.370> buttons<00:03:29.700> or<00:03:30.300> press<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.200> in

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
just level the buttons or press this in

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.990 
just level the buttons or press this in
the<00:03:31.530> middle<00:03:32.180> now<00:03:33.950> notice<00:03:34.950> how<00:03:35.130> it's<00:03:35.550> this

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the middle now notice how it's this

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 
the middle now notice how it's this
player's<00:03:36.300> turn<00:03:36.420> and<00:03:36.930> that's<00:03:37.050> indicated<00:03:37.650> here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
player's turn and that's indicated here

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.220 
player's turn and that's indicated here
if<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:38.880> were<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.000> press<00:03:39.300> this<00:03:39.480> side<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:40.020> start

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
if we were to press this side to start

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.840 
if we were to press this side to start
this<00:03:40.380> clock<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.860> won't<00:03:41.040> play<00:03:41.220> because<00:03:41.700> it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
this clock it won't play because it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.420 
this clock it won't play because it
knows<00:03:42.000> that<00:03:42.270> this<00:03:42.480> is<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.870> players<00:03:43.430> whose

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
knows that this is the players whose

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.120 
knows that this is the players whose
turn<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.110> press<00:03:46.320> this<00:03:46.530> side<00:03:46.769> and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
turn it is so you press this side and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.250 
turn it is so you press this side and
again<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.150> starts<00:03:48.450> counting<00:03:50.269> so<00:03:51.269> this<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.720> what

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
again it starts counting so this is what

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.170 
again it starts counting so this is what
we<00:03:52.380> just<00:03:52.620> set<00:03:52.830> was<00:03:53.130> using<00:03:53.580> preset<00:03:53.820> 10<00:03:56.180> 90

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
we just set was using preset 10 90

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.330 
we just set was using preset 10 90
minutes<00:03:58.370> maximum<00:03:59.370> of<00:03:59.460> 30<00:03:59.730> moves

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
minutes maximum of 30 moves

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.150 
minutes maximum of 30 moves
and<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.520> second<00:04:02.910> time<00:04:03.030> control<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:04.160> sixty

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
and a second time control of sixty

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.330 
and a second time control of sixty
minutes<00:04:05.460> all<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> five<00:04:06.810> second<00:04:07.200> delay<00:04:07.340> so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
minutes all with a five second delay so

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.010 
minutes all with a five second delay so
as<00:04:08.490> you<00:04:08.610> can<00:04:08.730> see<00:04:08.790> this<00:04:09.090> can<00:04:09.330> be<00:04:09.480> used<00:04:09.690> for

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
as you can see this can be used for

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.440 
as you can see this can be used for
tournaments<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.130> are<00:04:11.190> both<00:04:11.670> feed<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.120> an<00:04:12.270> on

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
tournaments that are both feed a an on

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.220 
tournaments that are both feed a an on
feed<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:12.920> USCF<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:15.630> have<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.810> wide<00:04:16.080> variety

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
feed a USCF and you have a wide variety

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.070 
feed a USCF and you have a wide variety
of<00:04:16.620> settings<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.400> choose<00:04:17.670> from<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.180> remember

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
of settings to choose from just remember

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.210 
of settings to choose from just remember
that<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.440> delay<00:04:19.860> is<00:04:20.220> not<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:22.220> displayed

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
that the delay is not a is is displayed

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.880 
that the delay is not a is is displayed
as<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> Bronstein<00:04:24.240> method<00:04:24.660> delay<00:04:24.990> meaning<00:04:25.560> it's

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
as a Bronstein method delay meaning it's

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.210 
as a Bronstein method delay meaning it's
added<00:04:26.370> after<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.940> move<00:04:27.170> versus<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.890> standard

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
added after you move versus the standard

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.770 
added after you move versus the standard
delay<00:04:29.670> which<00:04:29.910> counts<00:04:30.420> down<00:04:30.980> before<00:04:31.980> your<00:04:32.160> move

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
delay which counts down before your move

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.850 
delay which counts down before your move
essentially<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:33.960> same<00:04:34.200> thing<00:04:34.500> but<00:04:34.710> it

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
essentially it's the same thing but it

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.580 
essentially it's the same thing but it
is<00:04:34.980> displayed<00:04:35.460> differently

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.650 

you
