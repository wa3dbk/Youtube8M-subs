00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.500
 Larger screen thinner profile 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.719
 metal edges but always with the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.059
 same rectangular design if you're 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.640
 tired of seeing more of the same as soon as 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.590
 to smartphones this video is 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.570
 for you how are you greeted by vanessa 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.610
 hand orellana of cinema in Spanish and today 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.790
 I have the phone list with 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.400
 clearer designs let's start with the 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.059
 number 5 and the phone that inspired this 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.129
 list the samsung galaxy s 6 edge because 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.860
 two curves are better than one already 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.989
 difference of note 4 in the curves of 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.910
 this new samsung flagship phone 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.160
 they extend on both sides of their 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.710
 screen have certain functions 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.260
 specific to the curve but it is also 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.880
 almost identical to the traditional s 6 though 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.940
 you know how the curves 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.050
 and they take a less visual advantage to the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.240
 competition number 4 other phone 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.330
 curvilinear the flex 2 chip of the gym with 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.760
 its arched and semi flexible silhouette this 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.830
 phone has an even crazier design 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.770
 that the previous one is not as handsome as the 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.620
 s 66 but it costs you more than 100 dollars 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.140
 less and it comes with an 8 processor 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.500
 64-bit cores and the most recent 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.479
 version of android lollipop 5.0 though 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.610
 the purpose of that curve does not fit me 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.920
 clear and maybe they did not want them 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.590
 will go to the iphone 6 plus and what 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.220
 they turned from one to the base of the pocket 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 back and with that we went to number 3 on 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.619
 op o n 3 if you love celtics 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.900
 surely this attention 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.509
 strange phone instead of having two 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.479
 cameras one front and one rear east 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.790
 phone has one that rotates according to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.400
 the subject means that you can take 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.440
 all your photos with the super camera 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.660
 16 megapixels 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.790
 the concept sounds interesting but in 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.680
 reality is too strange 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.070
 to my liking and the phone feels 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.200
 heavy and uncomfortable in the pocket and the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.090
 number two how is this yota phone with 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.540
 double screen 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.910
 hÃ©ctor star wars and is not the conte 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.130
 The phone's main screen is 5 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.380
 inches on your list while 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.750
 back is electronic ink in 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.790
 black and white the idea is that you use 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.580
 the back to read and review your 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.010
 basic alerts to keep the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.080
 device battery when you use 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.540
 the main one has good intentions 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.360
 but already in practice I do not know how useful 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.970
 is to have the two screens especially 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.240
 considering that it is the most expensive of this 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.010
 list but without a doubt the craziest has 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.620
 that being the bronx and bolt is a 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.270
 device with design as weird as his 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.250
 name and although it has the same 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.890
 basic functions of a telephone 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.320
 intelligent traditional claims to be the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.180
 anti smartphone that is the one of the 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.830
 bothersome tools instead of 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.260
 show you notifications on the screen 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.840
 shows you bubbles of different 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.800
 colors and sizes so you do not have that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.530
 urgency of 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.870
 and check them at all times I doubt that 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.790
 let's start to see more round phones 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.580
 but at least it falls well a bit 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.590
 diversity and there they have five 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.590
 phones that dared to challenge 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.300
 the traditional design rules 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.430
 Write me a message with more of your 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.440
 rare phones that have seen and do not 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.170
 forget to visit without net dotcom 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.620
 ls for more toxic like this until the 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.620
 next
