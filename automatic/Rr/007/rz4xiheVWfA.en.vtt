00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
start getting in there it's gonna get

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.580 
start getting in there it's gonna get
really<00:01:02.329> hard<00:01:06.940> wow<00:01:07.940> really<00:01:08.210> nice<00:01:08.660> in<00:01:08.900> here<00:01:08.930> look

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
really hard wow really nice in here look

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.700 
really hard wow really nice in here look
at<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:14.080> that's<00:01:15.080> we<00:01:15.259> could<00:01:15.440> look<00:01:15.530> at<00:01:15.650> that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
at that that's we could look at that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:27.440 
at that that's we could look at that
tree<00:01:18.340> yeah<00:01:20.410> snapped<00:01:21.410> off<00:01:21.680> up<00:01:21.920> there

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.240 

so<00:01:27.899> I<00:01:27.930> guess<00:01:28.110> we'll<00:01:28.289> just<00:01:28.350> follow<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.950> kind

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
so I guess we'll just follow this kind

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.810 
so I guess we'll just follow this kind
of<00:01:29.719> beating<00:01:30.719> down<00:01:30.899> trail<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:32.960> seems<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.449

heading up to the top so I'm heading
that<00:03:54.700> way<00:03:56.700> let's<00:03:57.700> go<00:03:58.620> all<00:03:59.620> right<00:03:59.920> well

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.500 

I<00:04:03.510> mean<00:04:04.050> a<00:04:04.140> little<00:04:04.410> clearing

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.550 

and

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.460 
and
found<00:04:11.190> my<00:04:11.400> first<00:04:11.610> sign<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:12.810> not<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.050> sign

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
found my first sign but it's not a sign

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:27.030 
found my first sign but it's not a sign
of<00:04:14.270> my<00:04:15.270> people<00:04:16.190> at<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.370> sign<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.820> bear

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.700 

fairly<00:04:27.850> fresh<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:31.170> guess<00:04:32.170> I'd<00:04:32.440> better<00:04:32.620> be

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
fairly fresh so I guess I'd better be

00:04:32.710 --> 00:05:00.419 
fairly fresh so I guess I'd better be
careful<00:04:34.980> cool<00:04:35.980> looking<00:04:36.310> fungus

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:00.429 

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:02.939 

obviously<00:05:01.429> you<00:05:01.580> probably<00:05:01.999> can't<00:05:02.239> tell<00:05:02.360> but

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
obviously you probably can't tell but

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.660 
obviously you probably can't tell but
I'm<00:05:03.949> at<00:05:04.279> the<00:05:04.429> peak<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:06.080> first<00:05:06.379> peak

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
I'm at the peak the first peak

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.600 
I'm at the peak the first peak

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
clear or if getting over time so it's

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:42.700 
clear or if getting over time so it's
fun<00:05:35.940> look<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.150> this<00:05:37.330> is<00:05:37.569> nice

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.310 

well<00:06:07.310> unless<00:06:07.640> there's<00:06:07.970> cliffs<00:06:08.300> there<00:06:08.630> which<00:06:09.170> I

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320 
well unless there's cliffs there which I

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.580 
well unless there's cliffs there which I
don't<00:06:09.380> think<00:06:09.830> so<00:06:10.540> now<00:06:11.540> I<00:06:11.900> won't<00:06:12.200> be<00:06:12.290> able<00:06:12.470> to
