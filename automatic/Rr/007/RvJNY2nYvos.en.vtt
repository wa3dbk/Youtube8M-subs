 Hobart 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.270
 all very similar is interesting to tell 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.700
 Percent or 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.370
 that was the phenomenon of the new cinema, yes that's for sure Toni Elias 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.950

 in love immediately 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.960
 earl 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 that's absurd, a dark secret seems 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.960
 he is a vampire with over human powers 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.650
 he does not need that either 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.900
 looking in my world 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.310
 that would be the environment 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.710
 The whole hustle and bustle is not crazy and makes you a bit somehow 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.780
 decided differently 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.270
 a lot of my friends arrived yesterday for the premiere in London parents 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.150

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.470
 Television often looks so everyone in there then it gets very funny but as we do 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.350

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.299
 Hermes Interior Minister 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.760
 "If they are good and touch people, then that's great 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.219
 but if not then it did not sell people care 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.309

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:05.189
 which in the US beat more expensive than that circulated on the youth choir of the same name 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.169

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.479
 Teen stars will be happy 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.939
