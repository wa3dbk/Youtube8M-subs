Ron I'm gonna also into a review on that
as<00:00:45.490> well<00:00:45.730> but<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.739> 4000<00:00:48.280> model<00:00:48.520> fits<00:00:48.970> great

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
as well but this 4000 model fits great

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.370 
as well but this 4000 model fits great
on<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.600> as<00:00:50.230> far<00:00:50.500> as<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.110> drag

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
on it as far as the just the drag

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.800 
on it as far as the just the drag
capacity<00:00:53.980> on<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.370> think<00:00:54.880> this<00:00:55.000> reel<00:00:55.300> puts<00:00:55.630> out

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 
capacity on I think this reel puts out

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.549 
capacity on I think this reel puts out
about<00:00:58.950> 13<00:00:59.950> pounds<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.340> drag<00:01:00.550> I<00:01:00.820> would<00:01:01.030> say

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
about 13 pounds of drag I would say

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.359 
about 13 pounds of drag I would say
probably<00:01:02.559> 13<00:01:03.340> to<00:01:03.700> 12<00:01:03.940> I'm<00:01:04.239> not<00:01:04.390> sure<00:01:04.629> on<00:01:04.780> that

the price it packs a lot of heat so you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.600 
the price it packs a lot of heat so you
can't<00:02:34.700> go<00:02:34.819> wrong<00:02:35.030> with<00:02:35.090> that

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
can't go wrong with that

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.550 
can't go wrong with that
again<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.940> love<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.599> the<00:02:38.900> fact<00:02:39.140> that<00:02:39.290> it's<00:02:39.440> got

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
again I love the the fact that it's got

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.399 
again I love the the fact that it's got
the<00:02:39.709> waterproof<00:02:39.980> drag<00:02:40.959> where<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.110> fish

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
the waterproof drag where we fish

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.160 
the waterproof drag where we fish
basically<00:02:42.829> in<00:02:43.670> 24/7<00:02:44.209> outdoor<00:02:44.629> addiction<00:02:45.049> we

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
basically in 24/7 outdoor addiction we

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.699 
basically in 24/7 outdoor addiction we
do<00:02:45.290> a<00:02:45.319> lot<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.530> River<00:02:45.799> a<00:02:46.190> lot<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:47.200> dams<00:02:48.200> and

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
do a lot of River a lot of dams and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.399 
do a lot of River a lot of dams and
that's<00:02:49.280> primarily<00:02:49.579> our<00:02:50.030> hunting<00:02:50.360> grounds<00:02:50.810> so

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
that's primarily our hunting grounds so

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.949 
that's primarily our hunting grounds so
most<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.549> time<00:02:52.760> if<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:53.359> in<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.810> water

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
most of the time if we're in the water

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.050 
most of the time if we're in the water
already<00:02:54.290> we're<00:02:54.980> you<00:02:55.129> know<00:02:55.250> we're<00:02:55.700> basically

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
already we're you know we're basically

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.300 
already we're you know we're basically
just<00:02:56.390> waiting<00:02:56.660> through<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.079> water<00:02:57.310> there

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
just waiting through the water there

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.860 
just waiting through the water there
would<00:02:58.400> be<00:02:58.430> times<00:02:58.700> where<00:02:58.910> you<00:02:59.030> fall<00:02:59.299> you<00:02:59.510> trip

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
would be times where you fall you trip

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.599 
would be times where you fall you trip
and<00:03:00.109> you'll<00:03:00.349> be<00:03:00.470> taking<00:03:00.859> down<00:03:01.010> your<00:03:01.040> gear<00:03:01.340> with

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
and you'll be taking down your gear with

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.059 
and you'll be taking down your gear with
you'll<00:03:01.849> get<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.390> water<00:03:02.629> so<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.230> makes

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
you'll get into the water so that makes

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.759 
you'll get into the water so that makes
a<00:03:04.190> lot<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:05.049> sense<00:03:06.049> for<00:03:06.109> me<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.319> get<00:03:06.560> something

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
a lot of sense for me to get something

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.099 
a lot of sense for me to get something
that's<00:03:07.040> waterproof<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.720> won't<00:03:09.019> have

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
that's waterproof so that I won't have

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.140 
that's waterproof so that I won't have
to<00:03:09.290> worry<00:03:09.500> about<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.099> much<00:03:10.340> where<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:11.000> not

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
to worry about it so much where it's not

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.940 
to worry about it so much where it's not
gonna<00:03:11.299> ruin<00:03:11.540> my<00:03:11.750> day<00:03:11.780> after<00:03:12.319> I<00:03:12.349> fall<00:03:12.769> in<00:03:12.859> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
gonna ruin my day after I fall in the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.830 
gonna ruin my day after I fall in the
water<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> know<00:03:13.459> I'm<00:03:13.549> saying<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.030> can

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
water and you know I'm saying I can

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.420 
water and you know I'm saying I can
still<00:03:14.989> catch<00:03:15.140> fish<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.010> we<00:03:16.099> still

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
still catch fish with it and we still

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.149 
still catch fish with it and we still
relied<00:03:16.790> on<00:03:16.819> it<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.950> again<00:03:19.579> with<00:03:20.540> rivers

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
relied on it so and again with rivers

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.000 
relied on it so and again with rivers
there's<00:03:22.159> a<00:03:22.220> bunch<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.609> sand<00:03:23.470> especially<00:03:24.470> where

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
there's a bunch of sand especially where

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.920 
there's a bunch of sand especially where
we<00:03:25.130> finish<00:03:25.459> there's<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.060> bunch<00:03:26.389> of<00:03:26.540> micro

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
we finish there's just a bunch of micro

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.740 
we finish there's just a bunch of micro
sands<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.530> your<00:03:28.310> little<00:03:28.700> pellet<00:03:29.060> size<00:03:29.239> sand

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
sands and your little pellet size sand

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.229 
sands and your little pellet size sand
so<00:03:30.109> we<00:03:30.919> drop<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.489> ground<00:03:31.700> some<00:03:32.000> time

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
so we drop it on the ground some time

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.750 
so we drop it on the ground some time
which<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.810> after<00:03:33.319> we<00:03:33.620> catch<00:03:33.859> a<00:03:33.980> fish<00:03:34.220> trying<00:03:34.700> to

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
which is after we catch a fish trying to

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.699 
which is after we catch a fish trying to
land<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.180> will<00:03:35.329> drop<00:03:35.599> the<00:03:35.720> rod<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.260> reel<00:03:36.560> in

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
land it will drop the rod and reel in

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.949 
land it will drop the rod and reel in
the<00:03:36.799> ground<00:03:37.099> it'll<00:03:37.879> pick<00:03:38.120> up<00:03:38.239> some<00:03:38.389> sand

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
the ground it'll pick up some sand

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.960 
the ground it'll pick up some sand
that's<00:03:39.709> just<00:03:39.889> how<00:03:40.010> that's<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.700> the<00:03:40.760> nature

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
that's just how that's just the nature

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.140 
that's just how that's just the nature
of<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.209> game<00:03:41.389> so<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.989> wanted<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.739> get<00:03:42.889> something

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
of the game so I wanted to get something

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.369 
of the game so I wanted to get something
basically<00:03:44.150> it's<00:03:44.389> gonna<00:03:44.510> have<00:03:44.720> to<00:03:44.810> be<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.959> kind

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
basically it's gonna have to be a kind

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.170 
basically it's gonna have to be a kind
of<00:03:45.440> like<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.620> saltwater<00:03:46.069> application<00:03:46.730> that<00:03:46.940> way

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
of like a saltwater application that way

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.080 
of like a saltwater application that way
it<00:03:47.989> can<00:03:48.290> withstand<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.980> some<00:03:49.609> of<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.849> stuff

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
it can withstand just some of the stuff

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.210 
it can withstand just some of the stuff
we<00:03:50.720> don't<00:03:50.900> have<00:03:50.989> any<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.410> saltwater<00:03:51.739> stuff

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
we don't have any of the saltwater stuff

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.430 
we don't have any of the saltwater stuff
here<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:52.760> that's<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.299> know<00:03:53.419> I'm<00:03:53.989> not<00:03:54.230> worried

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
here but that's you know I'm not worried

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.259 
here but that's you know I'm not worried
about<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.859> I<00:03:54.889> just<00:03:55.190> need<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.910> actual

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
about that I just need the actual

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.289 
about that I just need the actual
protection<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:57.169> it<00:03:57.290> comes<00:03:57.819> as<00:03:58.819> far<00:03:59.120> as<00:03:59.209> the

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
protection that it comes as far as the

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.129 
protection that it comes as far as the
saltwater<00:03:59.930> application<00:04:00.650> type<00:04:00.859> Rios<00:04:01.190> and

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
saltwater application type Rios and

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.339 
saltwater application type Rios and
let's<00:04:03.139> see<00:04:04.480> as<00:04:05.480> far<00:04:05.720> as<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.900> color<00:04:06.079> is

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
let's see as far as the color is

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.750 
let's see as far as the color is
probably<00:04:06.620> going<00:04:06.799> to<00:04:06.859> look<00:04:06.980> it's<00:04:07.340> probably

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
probably going to look it's probably

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.189 
probably going to look it's probably
gonna<00:04:07.879> like<00:04:08.150> black<00:04:08.510> on<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.310> video<00:04:10.310> but<00:04:10.639> it's

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
gonna like black on the video but it's

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.599 
gonna like black on the video but it's
kinda<00:04:12.199> like<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.379> metallic<00:04:12.680> it's<00:04:13.310> got<00:04:13.459> your

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
kinda like a metallic it's got your

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.560 
kinda like a metallic it's got your
metallic<00:04:13.970> flakes<00:04:14.239> in<00:04:14.419> there<00:04:14.569> as<00:04:14.690> well

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
metallic flakes in there as well

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.270 
metallic flakes in there as well
supposed<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:17.780> all<00:04:18.019> aluminum<00:04:18.560> body<00:04:18.859> okay

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
supposed to have all aluminum body okay

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.490 
supposed to have all aluminum body okay
and<00:04:20.199> it's<00:04:21.199> very<00:04:21.500> rigid<00:04:22.220> nice<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.240> tight

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
and it's very rigid nice and tight
