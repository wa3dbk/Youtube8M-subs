00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:20.030 
hey guys so I'm
you<00:00:12.370> a<00:00:13.560> comparison<00:00:14.560> of<00:00:15.510> bare<00:00:16.510> minerals<00:00:16.960> Matt

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.130 

versus<00:00:21.040> the<00:00:21.400> elf<00:00:21.840> mineral<00:00:22.840> foundation

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.200 

I<00:00:26.369> wanted<00:00:27.369> to<00:00:27.490> share<00:00:27.670> these<00:00:27.789> with<00:00:27.849> you<00:00:28.060> because

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
I wanted to share these with you because

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.720 
I wanted to share these with you because
to<00:00:28.630> me<00:00:28.779> guys<00:00:29.019> these<00:00:29.560> products<00:00:30.009> are<00:00:30.099> very

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
to me guys these products are very

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.299 
to me guys these products are very
similar<00:00:31.090> but<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.930> big<00:00:32.110> difference<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.800> the

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
similar but the big difference is the

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.170 
similar but the big difference is the
price<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:34.180> pay<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:36.070> elf<00:00:36.280> foundation<00:00:37.000> is

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
price you pay the elf foundation is

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.150 
price you pay the elf foundation is
smaller<00:00:39.989> that's<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.170> difference<00:00:41.410> in<00:00:41.829> size

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
smaller that's the difference in size

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.790 
smaller that's the difference in size
this<00:00:43.089> however<00:00:43.420> is<00:00:43.780> around<00:00:44.199> i<00:00:44.379> think<00:00:44.589> it<00:00:44.710> was

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
this however is around i think it was

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.979 
this however is around i think it was
thirty<00:00:45.160> dollars<00:00:45.699> and<00:00:45.970> this<00:00:46.210> is<00:00:46.449> like<00:00:46.660> five

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
thirty dollars and this is like five

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.100 
thirty dollars and this is like five
dollars<00:00:47.400> so<00:00:48.400> if<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.850> compare<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.420> size<00:00:49.659> alone

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
dollars so if you compare the size alone

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.750 
dollars so if you compare the size alone
you're<00:00:50.440> still<00:00:50.769> getting<00:00:50.890> more<00:00:51.220> for<00:00:51.460> your<00:00:51.519> money

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
you're still getting more for your money

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.740 
you're still getting more for your money
with<00:00:52.059> else<00:00:52.650> if<00:00:53.650> you<00:00:54.070> do<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:54.430> fish<00:00:55.030> size<00:00:55.329> in<00:00:55.720> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
with else if you do the fish size in the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.060 
with else if you do the fish size in the
price<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.930> that's<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.230> first<00:00:59.590> thing<00:00:59.680> is<00:00:59.920> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
price so that's the first thing is the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.400 
price so that's the first thing is the
size<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:01.300> second<00:01:01.870> thing<00:01:02.020> that's<00:01:02.230> different

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
size the second thing that's different

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.400 
size the second thing that's different
about<00:01:02.739> them<00:01:03.100> is<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.399> applicators<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
about them is the applicators now the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.830 
about them is the applicators now the
elf<00:01:05.680> foundation<00:01:06.520> just<00:01:06.729> has<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.910> very<00:01:07.270> simple

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
elf foundation just has a very simple

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.460 
elf foundation just has a very simple
applicator<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.729> just<00:01:09.970> tap<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.390> off<00:01:10.810> through

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
applicator you just tap it off through

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.960 
applicator you just tap it off through
the<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.860> know<00:01:11.979> you'll<00:01:12.130> shake<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.520> up<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:12.850> then

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
the you know you'll shake it up and then

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.770 
the you know you'll shake it up and then
tap<00:01:13.149> it<00:01:13.360> through<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:16.660> bare<00:01:16.899> minerals<00:01:17.259> matt

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
tap it through the bare minerals matt

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.810 
tap it through the bare minerals matt
has<00:01:19.780> an<00:01:19.960> easier<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.740> use<00:01:20.979> applicator<00:01:21.729> that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
has an easier to use applicator that

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.520 
has an easier to use applicator that
seems<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.539> get<00:01:22.690> through<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.140> mineral

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
seems to get through the mineral

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.600 
seems to get through the mineral
foundation<00:01:23.979> a<00:01:24.429> bit<00:01:24.610> better<00:01:26.070> however<00:01:27.070> it's<00:01:27.460> not

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
foundation a bit better however it's not

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.060 
foundation a bit better however it's not
much<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.420> difference<00:01:28.929> I<00:01:29.140> think<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.830> make<00:01:30.039> a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
much of a difference I think to make a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.340 
much of a difference I think to make a
huge<00:01:30.640> difference<00:01:31.180> in<00:01:31.630> whether<00:01:32.020> you're<00:01:32.229> going

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
huge difference in whether you're going

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.980 
huge difference in whether you're going
to<00:01:32.439> buy<00:01:32.560> one<00:01:32.590> product<00:01:33.280> versus<00:01:33.850> together<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to buy one product versus together so

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890 
to buy one product versus together so
again<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.310> big<00:01:39.579> difference<00:01:40.060> between<00:01:40.240> these

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
again the big difference between these

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.639 
again the big difference between these
two<00:01:40.960> products<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.220> price<00:01:42.490> because<00:01:43.060> yet

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
two products is the price because yet

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.889 
two products is the price because yet
the<00:01:44.909> bare<00:01:45.909> minerals<00:01:46.299> matt<00:01:46.479> has<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.659> better

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
the bare minerals matt has a better

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.200 
the bare minerals matt has a better
applicator<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:50.049> a<00:01:50.079> bigger<00:01:50.590> size

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
applicator and it is more a bigger size

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.120 
applicator and it is more a bigger size
but<00:01:52.210> thirty<00:01:52.600> dollars<00:01:53.079> compared<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.890> five

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
but thirty dollars compared to five

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.359 
but thirty dollars compared to five
dollars<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:55.750> up<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.259> decide<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
dollars it's up to you to decide is it

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.639 
dollars it's up to you to decide is it
really<00:01:57.610> worth<00:01:57.759> it<00:02:01.020> also<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.079> wanted<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.439> share

try out the bare minerals Matt I think
on<00:03:02.630> coverage<00:03:03.170> they're<00:03:03.530> both<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:04.010> same<00:03:04.750> so

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
on coverage they're both the same so

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.450 
on coverage they're both the same so
really<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.320> just<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.590> matter<00:03:06.830> of<00:03:07.010> Christ

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
really it's just a matter of Christ

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.430 
really it's just a matter of Christ

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
going to last a little bit longer than I

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.140 
going to last a little bit longer than I
would<00:03:11.630> go<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.170> bare<00:03:12.350> minerals<00:03:12.770> Matt<00:03:13.160> or

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
there's not much of a huge difference

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.160 
there's not much of a huge difference
other<00:03:42.680> than<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:43.040> amount<00:03:43.490> the<00:03:44.270> price<00:03:44.570> and<00:03:44.990> the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
other than the amount the price and the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.620 
other than the amount the price and the
