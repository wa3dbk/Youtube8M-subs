00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.160
 playstation 3 yes friends I'm good 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.230
 on xbox 360 and on minecraft and that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.990
 was really a lot of time that I 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.059
 did not make 360 videos and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.100
 it's always a little more 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.660
 nostalgic to come back on this 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 version 2 of minecraft 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 so here and so today what is this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.420
 that we're going to do we're going all 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.670
 just do a little glitch for 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 have the cape in minecraft so 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.620
 t24 therefore currently last in 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.750
 day of minecraft console and we will do 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.289
 this little guide to have the magnificent 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.219
 cap and we can even have the framework of 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.960
 different colours 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.020
 you will see that it is really very very 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.460
 simple so survival is very simple there 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
 simply need to have a pack 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 of skins so to the people you take a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.070
 skin change skins 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 so you go to me I take in the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.150
 skin pack 4 and that's to have worries this 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.220
 skin pack but it's to have other 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.700
 it's the same just to have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.040
 to have a little ski that to cape like 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 this one for example here is this one there to 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.540
 the cape and cynic 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.330
 so that's what you do it's 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.400
 that you choose this skin the nickel 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.130
 I want to point out that even before 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.299
 continue is that simply this 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.369
 glitch it's not me who has it 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.710
 found I have seen on the beat Video 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.950
 it's big so wait it's enough 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.750
 complicated to pronounce it is based hoc 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.009
 sky you see something like this here in 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.570
 anyway you will have the link of his chain 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.500
 in the description so do not hesitate to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.439
 to see them is a youtube hours 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.759
 English speaking here and I have not seen for 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.259
 the my of youtube francophone hours 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.020
 do this kind of glitch so it's for 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.340
 what I propose to you so when 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 you have been worried so when you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.450
 have chosen your little griche with 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.329
 your little screen with the cape 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.920
 you just have to man gold waiting for me 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.170
 I knew more how did you do 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.680
 just to save up hockey in 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680
 safeguard 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.410
 first of all it's a little bit a little 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.850
 little longer to save but it's 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.010
 very very simple against this counter 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.810
 will only work on one that he 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.360
 see there so that will be the basic skin 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.790
 ie it will be steve's skin 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.690
 if I say no nonsense I remember 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.970
 more of his name but I believe that 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.950
 it's steve at first so that's it 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.920
 will only work on this one 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.260
 but it's really not bad already for 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.180
 to have a cape on another skin 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.000
 that on the random skins end the 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.590
 skins that are available to us ok so 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.870
 when you did that hop you can 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:51.400
 to leave hop let's go there the tac interface 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.270
 nickel up the interface if you can go 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.940
 a little faster thank you 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.350
 let's go go hop or else norah 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.970
 reaches the interface it will just take 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:06.040
 go into the storage level so 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.270
 it's a little further it's true that we 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.010
 sees a little bit the difference between 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.080
 xbox one and 360 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.820
 ok so then you head everything to 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.620
 right in the system settings 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.510
 so the same on playstation to help you 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.610
 in your storage and you choose 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.680
 simply the location of the you 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.940
 have downloaded all boskin in what I 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.920
 think he's in my memory card 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.670
 July applications 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.000
 minecraft and I'm looking for the skins pack 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.250
 Number 4 So here if it so 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.220
 this one I repeat it is always the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.780
 skin the skins pack where there is so the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.820
 pack of skins end the skin I have 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.900
 chosen with the cape and it's this one 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.190
 to choose 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.459
 you click on it makes you remove 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.250
 deleted so here's where you got it 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.420
 deleted you go back to the interface 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.260
 up and we're just going 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.170
 revive 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.420
 minecraft is restarting the server where 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.430
 we were and then we will have 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.829
 normally the glitch that off market and 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.660
 so we'll have the little cape that we 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.880
 will make the kéké on the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.140
 waiters here so of course it takes 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.880
 wait for minecraft or wallace 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:17.109
 accelerate a little bit either 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:19.190
 friendly up my little kid 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.060
 minecraft hockey 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.060
 that's good nickel hop is chosen on 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.060
 the location 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.569
 you will wait for a little water 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:35.090
 but the noise here is memory cards 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:36.560
 nickel nickel and so we choose friends 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.740
 so here is the server where we were 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.639
 up have the server loaded 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.130
 so we will have the little 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.699
 cape that will magically appear 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.630
 and can not even change the the the 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:58.419
 design of this cape initialization of the 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.419
 waiter go go go 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:03.059
 and here are the friends we have everything 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.229
 just capcom lake you see him so 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:04.649
 there the cape she is gray all 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.569
 simply 

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:08.519
 so I'm just going to take off the small ones 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.289
 armor that is there is the whole cape 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:11.909
 just as is currently 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.689
 with the little that we will be able 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.800
 it's very nice that's true 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.929
 it's nice it's nice 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.599
 so I do not think this glitch march 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.099
 on the next gen so I have not tested 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.409
 but most of the tutorials that are so 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.599
 on that match there is no written xbox 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.149
 one or ps4 so I'm sorry for them 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.269
 xbox one players but feel free to 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:36.389
 test at home by cons 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:37.860
 this is not how we tell you 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.909
 do not delete a skins pack that you 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.080
 bought because I think he 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.550
 would then be redeemed later 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.830
 so that would be pretty annoying 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.409
 so we can have the pack of 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.789
 this little cape and then you have 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:50.449
 just to choose for example I you 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.979
 give up the agglo stone of a bucket of water 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.709
 up is for example when we at the agglo 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.869
 stone we have all Norman items if I 

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.829
 say no nonsense finally all the states 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:02.069
 - all the 

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:03.449
 the texts on two blocks in on the 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.249
 cape the same for water power that 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.740
 the bear is nice enough we see a small 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.059
 little through we went the armor the 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.559
 swords all of this I 'm going to see if we can 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:13.589
 test with other blocks imagine it 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:14.969
 yeah that it is already like this 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:18.059
 friendly enough friends imagine 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:20.699
 imagine anyway with this kind of cap 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.979
 on a server that would be enough swag 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.539
 still ok friends but I hope this 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.669
 tutorial and well just it you 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.199
 will be pleased do not hesitate to put a small 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.579
 blue thumbs and to share the video is to 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.079
 subscribe if it's not done yet 

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:33.329

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:34.259
 great pleasure to the friend and so I
