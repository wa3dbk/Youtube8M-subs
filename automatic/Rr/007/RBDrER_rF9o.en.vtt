watching it when I'm dancing with Amy

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.479 
watching it when I'm dancing with Amy
it's<00:02:21.760> literally<00:02:22.299> just<00:02:22.420> about<00:02:22.900> me<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.709> her<00:02:23.920> and

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
it's literally just about me and her and

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.979 
it's literally just about me and her and
that's<00:02:24.700> all<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> see<00:02:25.180> onstage<00:02:25.510> that's<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:25.959> I

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
that's all I see onstage that's all I

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.979 
that's all I see onstage that's all I

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.390 
feel so that that feels amazing to me
and<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.530> goes<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.799> lot<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.190> show

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
and I think it really goes a lot to show

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.590 
and I think it really goes a lot to show
that<00:02:31.330> that's<00:02:31.510> how<00:02:31.690> I've<00:02:31.810> grown<00:02:31.989> in<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.600> my

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
that that's how I've grown in that my

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.990 
that that's how I've grown in that my
performances<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.380> become<00:02:35.620> more<00:02:35.799> real<00:02:36.069> too<00:02:36.670> I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
performances have become more real too I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.720 
performances have become more real too I
think<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.329> audience<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.780> myself<00:02:38.730> it's

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
think the audience and myself it's

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.160
