Heyho folks, today I'm going to show you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.060
something you

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.700
also may always have been dreaming of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.800
since the iCloud has been published.

00:00:42.913 --> 00:00:44.913
You know the principle of

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:46.514
the dropbox

00:00:46.514 --> 00:00:48.274
you create a dropbox folder

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.900
put all your files in it, it's getting synced and you can take a look on your iPhone too

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.360
great. That was never possible with the iCloud yet

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.100
It's a cloud and yes there is your data inside

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.678
but you know

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.574
you could never really control it, you never could safe files in it

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.480
in principle you could delete things

00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:10.674
but you never had

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.000
folders to enter and say, zack this goes there, zack I'll delete that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.280
this, this and that... that was never possible

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.160
with Yosemite which will be released in autumn

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.860
it will change with the iCloud Drive

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.740
then you will be able to access it better

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.573
you will be able to use and create things

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.580
and here you can see my iCloud Drive

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.000
Here are my Keynote files inside and those are some Pages files inside this folder

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.620
I can take a look and if I think I don't need it anymore

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.500
I delete it and it's gone

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.840
I think it's cool that an app like Pixelmator has it's own folder

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.460
there I've been playing around already

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.680
It's no problem anymore, because it's simple now

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.220
here inside a folder

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.400
I also can open it from here right away

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.160
If I had a second mac, I could open those folders too and access them from it

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200
and it just works

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.640
what I also like

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.400
is that it works just like the Dropbox, but at the same time it's integrated

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.920
that is a disadvantage in my eyes if you have something like the dropbox

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.740
and it isn't integrated 100%, because it's another app that's running besides

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.820
but this is just clever implemented to the system and it runs smooth

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.960
Now it's also possible that I

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.200
just take files like this picture

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.780
and I drag and drop it into my iCloud Drive

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.440
and now it already says "synchronize"

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.880
this easily works and click this automatically does it's job

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.880
now I have my data in it

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.560
it's also to possible to share it for other users

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.033
I can share it so easily

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.240
and for me this is very handy, you have

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.180
your files ordered

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.180
the problem is, that iCloud online memory costs a lot in my opinion

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.980
of course it's not for free, they have to pay their servers too

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.320
All in all I think it's really cool and I'm excited how well it already works

00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:33.034
I hope you liked it too

00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:35.013
see you soon
