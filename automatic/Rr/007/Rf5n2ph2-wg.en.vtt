fruits but what you do to cook is turn

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.370 
fruits but what you do to cook is turn
it<00:00:24.999> to<00:00:25.089> the<00:00:25.179> left<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.869> you<00:00:25.989> feel<00:00:26.169> a<00:00:26.199> little

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
right in there in the basket and then

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.990 
right in there in the basket and then
you<00:00:32.380> remove<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.770> basket<00:00:32.950> dumps<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.670> food<00:00:33.850> in

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.639 
you remove the basket dumps the food in
and<00:00:34.149> then<00:00:34.239> you<00:00:34.360> can<00:00:34.510> process<00:00:34.720> it<00:00:35.079> so<00:00:35.260> I<00:00:35.290> meant<00:00:35.559> a

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
and then you can process it so I meant a

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.860 
and then you can process it so I meant a
food<00:00:35.829> processing<00:00:36.399> part<00:00:36.640> so<00:00:37.239> all<00:00:37.420> you<00:00:37.600> do<00:00:37.719> to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
food processing part so all you do to

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.670 
food processing part so all you do to
you<00:00:38.410> know

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
you know

you know
puree<00:00:39.039> the<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.789> veggies<00:00:40.120> and<00:00:40.269> it<00:00:40.359> does

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539 
puree the the veggies and it does

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.569 
puree the the veggies and it does
provide<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.260> pretty<00:00:41.500> coarse<00:00:41.800> chop<00:00:42.160> it's<00:00:42.399> not

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
provide a pretty coarse chop it's not

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.040 
provide a pretty coarse chop it's not
super<00:00:43.030> smooth<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:43.570> if<00:00:43.629> you're<00:00:43.750> just<00:00:43.780> starting

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
super smooth so if you're just starting

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.470 
super smooth so if you're just starting
your<00:00:44.379> baby<00:00:44.590> on<00:00:44.800> food<00:00:45.070> might<00:00:45.910> not<00:00:46.059> be<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.359> best

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
your baby on food might not be the best

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.750 
your baby on food might not be the best
option<00:00:46.780> a<00:00:47.230> blender<00:00:48.190> might<00:00:48.339> be<00:00:48.460> better<00:00:48.640> for

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
option a blender might be better for

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.099 
option a blender might be better for
that<00:00:49.059> because<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.449> can<00:00:49.570> get<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.780> really

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
that because you can get it really

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:57.360 
that because you can get it really
really<00:00:50.379> smooth<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.940> all<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.359> do<00:00:52.859> is<00:00:53.859> turn<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
really smooth but all you do is turn it

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.060 
really smooth but all you do is turn it
won't<00:00:57.640> stay<00:00:58.210> puree<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.140> have<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.620> hold<00:00:59.800> it<00:00:59.949> in

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
won't stay puree you have to hold it in

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.610 
won't stay puree you have to hold it in
order<00:01:00.249> for<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.670> work<00:01:00.910> I<00:01:01.379> couldn't<00:01:02.379> walk

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
order for it to work I couldn't walk

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.680 
order for it to work I couldn't walk
away<00:01:02.829> from

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
away from

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.230 
away from

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.440 
out pretty easily I'll show you how to
do<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.830> minute<00:01:27.979> but<00:01:28.940> there<00:01:29.119> are<00:01:29.240> some

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
do that in a minute but there are some

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.540 
do that in a minute but there are some
tricks<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.900> loading<00:01:30.110> them<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.740> filling<00:01:31.400> them

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
tricks to loading them and filling them

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.370 
tricks to loading them and filling them
well<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.360> have<00:01:32.630> learned<00:01:32.840> along<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.229> way

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
well that I have learned along the way

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.790 
well that I have learned along the way
so<00:01:34.509> this<00:01:35.509> one<00:01:35.720> I've<00:01:35.810> got<00:01:35.840> almost<00:01:36.320> full<00:01:36.590> but

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
so this one I've got almost full but

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.340 
so this one I've got almost full but
we'll<00:01:37.430> start<00:01:37.729> with<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.300> front<00:01:38.450> one<00:01:38.659> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
we'll start with the front one the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.870 
we'll start with the front one the
tricky<00:01:39.590> part<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:40.070> making<00:01:40.310> sure<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.640> each

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
tricky part is making sure that each

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.029 
tricky part is making sure that each
cube<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.509> filled<00:01:41.899> completely<00:01:42.229> with<00:01:42.710> food

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
cube is filled completely with food

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.130 
cube is filled completely with food
that's<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.640> one<00:01:43.880> thing<00:01:44.210> I'm<00:01:44.660> actually<00:01:44.869> just

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
that's the one thing I'm actually just

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.790 
that's the one thing I'm actually just
gonna<00:01:45.320> fill<00:01:45.619> that<00:01:45.770> up<00:01:47.320> that's<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.500> one<00:01:48.649> thing

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
gonna fill that up that's the one thing

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.520 
gonna fill that up that's the one thing
I've<00:01:48.950> run<00:01:49.100> into<00:01:49.280> is<00:01:50.050> making<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.110> batch<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.289> these

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
I've run into is making a batch of these

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.070 
I've run into is making a batch of these
and<00:01:51.920> then<00:01:52.039> going<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.580> pop<00:01:53.360> them<00:01:53.570> out<00:01:53.690> after

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
and then going to pop them out after

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.109 
and then going to pop them out after
they've<00:01:54.229> frozen<00:01:54.500> and<00:01:55.009> finding<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.910> there

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
they've frozen and finding that there

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.450 
they've frozen and finding that there
are<00:01:56.240> air<00:01:56.390> bubbles<00:01:56.420> in<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.320> middle<00:01:57.560> stuff<00:01:57.950> but

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
are air bubbles in the middle stuff but

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.590 
are air bubbles in the middle stuff but
it's<00:01:58.580> the<00:01:58.640> only<00:01:58.789> thing<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.210> want<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.420> try

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
it's the only thing that you want to try

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.910 
it's the only thing that you want to try
and<00:01:59.750> avoid<00:01:59.840> because<00:02:00.350> each<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.590> these<00:02:00.710> is

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
and avoid because each of these is

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.859 
and avoid because each of these is
exactly<00:02:01.550> one<00:02:01.789> ounce<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.210> food<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:02.539> makes<00:02:02.750> it

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
exactly one ounce of food which makes it

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.300 
exactly one ounce of food which makes it
really<00:02:02.899> easy<00:02:03.289> for<00:02:03.440> you<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.740> measure<00:02:03.979> out<00:02:04.160> how

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
really easy for you to measure out how

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.960 
really easy for you to measure out how
much<00:02:04.460> your<00:02:04.670> baby's<00:02:04.910> getting<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:07.100> my<00:02:07.759> little

tricks<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:08.630> filling<00:02:09.050> are<00:02:09.560> using<00:02:10.039> this

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
tricks for filling are using this

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.560 
tricks for filling are using this
spatula<00:02:10.880> which<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.209> just<00:02:11.390> from

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
spatula which is just from

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.210 
spatula which is just from
williams-sonoma<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.800> tell<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.100> very

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
williams-sonoma you can tell it's very

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.810 
williams-sonoma you can tell it's very
well<00:02:13.610> loved<00:02:13.910> because<00:02:14.329> it's<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.870> colored<00:02:15.230> and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
well loved because it's just colored and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.210 
well loved because it's just colored and
very<00:02:16.820> used<00:02:17.420> looking<00:02:18.019> at<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.320> point<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:18.980> it's

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
very used looking at this point but it's

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.250 
very used looking at this point but it's
the<00:02:19.370> perfect<00:02:19.790> size<00:02:20.000> for<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.600> running<00:02:20.989> along

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
the perfect size for just running along

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.009 
the perfect size for just running along
the<00:02:21.640> edges<00:02:22.640> because<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.780> want<00:02:23.959> to

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
the edges because you really want to

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.780 
the edges because you really want to
make<00:02:24.110> sure<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.500> these<00:02:24.769> are<00:02:24.980> visible<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.640> your

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
make sure that these are visible so your

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.240 
make sure that these are visible so your
ice<00:02:25.940> cubes<00:02:26.329> pop<00:02:26.600> out<00:02:26.840> or<00:02:27.530> your<00:02:27.709> little<00:02:27.860> keeps<00:02:28.130> a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
ice cubes pop out or your little keeps a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.770 
ice cubes pop out or your little keeps a
food<00:02:28.430> pop<00:02:28.700> out<00:02:28.910> really<00:02:29.540> easily<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:32.510> one<00:02:32.690> will

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
food pop out really easily then one will

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.170 
food pop out really easily then one will
do<00:02:32.959> once<00:02:33.200> I've<00:02:33.350> got<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.530> filled<00:02:33.950> is<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:35.000> pick

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
do once I've got it filled is just pick

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.610 
do once I've got it filled is just pick
it<00:02:35.269> up<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.570> drop<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.989> little<00:02:36.140> bit<00:02:36.320> just<00:02:36.560> to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
it up and drop it a little bit just to

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.990 
it up and drop it a little bit just to
make<00:02:36.769> sure<00:02:36.799> all<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.190> air<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.459> out<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:37.760> see<00:02:37.910> if

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
make sure all the air is out and see if

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.539 
make sure all the air is out and see if
it<00:02:38.150> settles<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:39.890> one<00:02:40.040> looks<00:02:40.160> like<00:02:40.310> it's

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
it settles and that one looks like it's

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.090 
it settles and that one looks like it's
settling<00:02:40.880> pretty<00:02:41.180> darn<00:02:41.600> well<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.290> think<00:02:42.980> I'm

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
know end up lying perfectly square and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.199 
know end up lying perfectly square and
perfectly<00:03:54.200> flat<00:03:54.639> and<00:03:55.639> then<00:03:55.790> I'll<00:03:55.909> show<00:03:56.150> you

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209

outside in my freezer

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.339 
outside in my freezer
I've<00:03:58.010> got<00:03:58.340> cubes<00:03:58.969> out<00:03:59.239> there<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.870> then<00:04:00.109> I<00:04:00.139> just

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
I've got cubes out there and then I just

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.220 
I've got cubes out there and then I just
back<00:04:00.829> all<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:01.730> bags<00:04:01.939> you<00:04:02.510> know<00:04:02.599> one<00:04:02.900> by<00:04:03.049> one

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
back all of the bags you know one by one

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.659 
back all of the bags you know one by one
so<00:04:03.409> I<00:04:03.469> can<00:04:03.620> just<00:04:03.709> flip<00:04:03.919> through<00:04:04.099> for<00:04:04.310> each<00:04:04.400> meal

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
so I can just flip through for each meal

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.360 
so I can just flip through for each meal
and<00:04:04.909> pick<00:04:05.419> whatever<00:04:05.599> I<00:04:05.780> want<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.230> use<00:04:06.379> but<00:04:06.769> they

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
and pick whatever I want to use but they

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.009 
and pick whatever I want to use but they
stand<00:04:07.639> up<00:04:07.790> by<00:04:07.939> themselves<00:04:07.969> and<00:04:08.599> they<00:04:08.719> stack

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
stand up by themselves and they stack

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.659 
stand up by themselves and they stack
beautifully<00:04:09.560> which<00:04:09.739> is<00:04:09.919> one<00:04:10.159> of<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.370> reasons

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
beautifully which is one of the reasons

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.330 
beautifully which is one of the reasons
why<00:04:10.819> I<00:04:10.849> love<00:04:11.349> the<00:04:12.349> silicone<00:04:12.769> perfect<00:04:13.159> cube

extra<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:36.919> six<00:04:37.190> total<00:04:37.610> because<00:04:37.849> I<00:04:37.940> tend<00:04:38.210> to

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
extra I have six total because I tend to

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.290 
extra I have six total because I tend to
cook<00:04:38.539> in<00:04:38.750> large<00:04:39.169> large<00:04:39.530> batches<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:41.150> way

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
cook in large large batches and that way

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.939 
cook in large large batches and that way
I<00:04:41.330> don't<00:04:41.449> have<00:04:41.780> to<00:04:41.900> cook<00:04:42.050> fast<00:04:42.349> or<00:04:42.680> twice<00:04:42.919> a

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:43.420 
I don't have to cook fast or twice a
month

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
month

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.370 
month
I<00:04:43.669> don't<00:04:44.210> even<00:04:44.300> think<00:04:44.389> I<00:04:44.570> cook<00:04:44.990> twice<00:04:45.199> a<00:04:45.259> month

I don't even think I cook twice a month

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.689 
I don't even think I cook twice a month
so<00:04:45.590> I<00:04:45.620> would<00:04:45.770> say<00:04:45.919> once<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.220> month<00:04:46.370> once<00:04:46.550> every

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
so I would say once a month once every

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.999

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
baby food and that I had intended to use

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.769 
baby food and that I had intended to use
for<00:05:12.300> breast<00:05:12.539> milk<00:05:13.159> and<00:05:14.159> that<00:05:14.969> catch<00:05:15.330> is<00:05:15.479> just<00:05:15.689> a

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779 
for breast milk and that catch is just a

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.790 
for breast milk and that catch is just a
little<00:05:16.169> bit<00:05:16.319> of<00:05:16.409> overflow<00:05:16.949> from<00:05:17.249> my<00:05:17.659> main

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
little bit of overflow from my main

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.579 
little bit of overflow from my main
freezer<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:20.219> the<00:05:20.249> house<00:05:20.550> but<00:05:20.999> it's<00:05:21.589> luckily

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:22.589 
freezer in the house but it's luckily

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:24.049 
freezer in the house but it's luckily
it's<00:05:22.770> right<00:05:22.889> next<00:05:23.009> to<00:05:23.129> my<00:05:23.189> cabin<00:05:23.580> so<00:05:23.789> I<00:05:23.849> just

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:24.059 
it's right next to my cabin so I just

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.980 
it's right next to my cabin so I just
hop<00:05:24.179> out<00:05:24.330> there<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:24.749> take<00:05:25.229> her<00:05:25.349> food<00:05:25.619> and<00:05:26.990> then

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
hop out there and take her food and then

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.019 
hop out there and take her food and then
I<00:05:28.080> bring<00:05:28.259> it<00:05:28.349> in<00:05:28.439> to<00:05:28.499> microwave<00:05:28.830> it<00:05:28.860> so<00:05:29.550> once

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
I bring it in to microwave it so once

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.730 
I bring it in to microwave it so once
it's<00:05:30.209> stopped<00:05:30.809> I<00:05:31.080> have<00:05:31.259> it<00:05:31.379> like<00:05:31.469> that

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
it's stopped I have it like that

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.909 
it's stopped I have it like that
um<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:32.879> so<00:05:32.909> therefore<00:05:33.869> if<00:05:34.050> you<00:05:34.169> do<00:05:34.379> have<00:05:34.589> extra

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
um and so therefore if you do have extra

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.379 
um and so therefore if you do have extra
space<00:05:35.219> in<00:05:35.399> the<00:05:35.490> bottom<00:05:35.789> and<00:05:35.909> you<00:05:36.029> want<00:05:36.119> to<00:05:36.270> have

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
space in the bottom and you want to have

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.480 
space in the bottom and you want to have
a<00:05:36.419> back<00:05:36.659> supply<00:05:37.050> which<00:05:37.259> I<00:05:37.349> always<00:05:37.559> have<00:05:37.889> you

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
a back supply which I always have you

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.829 
a back supply which I always have you
could<00:05:38.639> just<00:05:38.789> stack<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.179> bags<00:05:39.330> right<00:05:39.509> on<00:05:39.689> top

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:39.839 
could just stack the bags right on top

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.969 
could just stack the bags right on top
of<00:05:39.959> each<00:05:40.050> other<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.319> you<00:05:40.409> don't<00:05:40.439> lose<00:05:40.679> any

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
of each other and you don't lose any

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.759 
of each other and you don't lose any
wasted<00:05:41.519> space<00:05:41.699> in<00:05:41.969> the<00:05:42.149> freezer<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:43.259> that's

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:43.769 
wasted space in the freezer so that's

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:49.309 
wasted space in the freezer so that's
the<00:05:43.949> storage

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.290 

so<00:05:50.219> I<00:05:50.249> thought<00:05:50.490> it<00:05:50.610> would<00:05:50.669> be<00:05:50.789> a<00:05:50.819> good<00:05:50.939> idea<00:05:51.029> to

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
so I thought it would be a good idea to

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.879 
so I thought it would be a good idea to
show<00:05:51.449> you<00:05:51.509> my<00:05:51.749> freezer<00:05:51.990> system<00:05:52.439> I<00:05:52.469> just<00:05:52.740> you

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
show you my freezer system I just you

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.170 
show you my freezer system I just you

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
had actual views of what it looked like

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.089 
had actual views of what it looked like
from<00:05:57.180> when<00:05:57.539> I<00:05:57.569> go<00:05:57.749> and<00:05:57.869> grab<00:05:57.960> boots<00:05:58.289> so<00:05:58.680> what<00:05:59.069> I
