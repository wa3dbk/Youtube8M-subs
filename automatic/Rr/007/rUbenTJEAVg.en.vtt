especially young people believing it

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.289 
especially young people believing it
because<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:16.920> world<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.880> always<00:01:18.150> good

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.179 
it seems almost common sense you know
that<00:01:23.869> driving<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> alcohol<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.530> mix<00:01:25.650> why

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
that driving and alcohol don't mix why

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
that driving and alcohol don't mix why

because<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.100> believe<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.340> an

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
because of this I believe it is an

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.590 
because of this I believe it is an
education<00:01:33.090> process<00:01:34.100> that<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:36.390> countries

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
imagine it's a weekly buzz you know for

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.720 
imagine it's a weekly buzz you know for
you<00:04:15.690> when<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:16.410> get<00:04:16.530> onto<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.890> circuit<00:04:17.250> how<00:04:17.670> do

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
you when you get onto the circuit how do

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.070 
you when you get onto the circuit how do
you<00:04:17.850> handle<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.450> fact<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.750> you're<00:04:18.930> not

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
you handle the fact that you're not

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.100 
you handle the fact that you're not
doing<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.500> anymore<00:04:20.120> well<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.540> was<00:04:21.690> my<00:04:21.840> choice

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
doing it anymore well it was my choice

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.990 
doing it anymore well it was my choice
not<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.920> it<00:04:23.070> because<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.400> was<00:04:23.610> tired<00:04:23.820> of

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
not to do it because I was tired of

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.720 
not to do it because I was tired of
doing<00:04:24.300> it<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:24.720> now<00:04:25.650> I<00:04:25.680> haven't<00:04:26.010> woken<00:04:26.250> up<00:04:26.550> from

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
doing it so now I haven't woken up from

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.460 
doing it so now I haven't woken up from
my<00:04:26.970> tiredness<00:04:27.300> okay

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
exciting in a way not so much for us

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.980 
exciting in a way not so much for us
right<00:04:36.270> now<00:04:36.540> but<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.760> have<00:04:38.790> some<00:04:39.210> young<00:04:39.720> and

right now but you have some young and
new<00:04:40.230> teams<00:04:40.560> coming<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.580> being<00:04:42.090> successful

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
new teams coming up and being successful

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.650 
new teams coming up and being successful
it<00:04:43.380> sort<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:45.710> increases<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.830> spice<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:48.090> I'm

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
it sort of increases the spice and I'm

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.830 
it sort of increases the spice and I'm
quite<00:04:48.870> happy<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.170> see<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:50.430> a<00:04:50.460> way

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
quite happy to see this in a way

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.450 
quite happy to see this in a way
especially<00:04:51.840> if<00:04:52.290> now<00:04:52.500> like<00:04:52.740> our<00:04:52.950> last<00:04:53.160> race<00:04:53.400> in

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
especially if now like our last race in

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.570 
especially if now like our last race in
Barcelona<00:04:54.000> we<00:04:54.570> on<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.200> way<00:04:55.290> back<00:04:55.500> up<00:04:55.770> to<00:04:55.980> the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
Barcelona we on the way back up to the

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.350 
Barcelona we on the way back up to the
top<00:04:56.960> we<00:04:57.960> were<00:04:58.110> missing<00:04:58.500> very<00:04:58.710> very<00:04:59.360> small

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
top we were missing very very small

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.810 
top we were missing very very small
amount<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:01.080> the<00:05:01.170> top<00:05:01.350> teams<00:05:01.620> so<00:05:02.520> we<00:05:02.700> have

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
amount to the top teams so we have

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.850 
amount to the top teams so we have
worked<00:05:03.120> very<00:05:03.480> hard<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.170> order<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.770> achieve

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
worked very hard in order to achieve

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.100 
worked very hard in order to achieve
things<00:05:05.250> again<00:05:05.610> and<00:05:05.820> coming<00:05:06.270> back<00:05:06.420> up<00:05:06.450> again

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
things again and coming back up again

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.670 
things again and coming back up again
but<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:09.030> new<00:05:09.180> rules<00:05:09.450> obviously<00:05:09.900> allow<00:05:10.470> this

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
but the new rules obviously allow this

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.770 
but the new rules obviously allow this
to<00:05:10.830> happen<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:11.250> Formula<00:05:11.610> One<00:05:11.760> is<00:05:12.120> very

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
how serious do you think this is as a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.870 
how serious do you think this is as a
threat<00:05:42.210> because<00:05:43.170> it's<00:05:43.530> both<00:05:43.800> decision<00:05:44.640> and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
threat because it's both decision and
