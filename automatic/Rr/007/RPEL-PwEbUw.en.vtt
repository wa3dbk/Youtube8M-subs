my bike luckily and I haven't made a
video<00:00:42.860> recently<00:00:43.280> not<00:00:43.970> because<00:00:44.360> my<00:00:44.540> bike<00:00:44.750> has

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
video recently not because my bike has

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.329 
video recently not because my bike has
been<00:00:44.930> out<00:00:45.470> of<00:00:45.650> commission<00:00:45.799> but<00:00:46.100> mainly

been out of commission but mainly

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.039

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:48.049 
because I just haven't had the time to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:52.680 
because I just haven't had the time to
the<00:00:48.860> exhaust

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.940 

yeah<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:53.840> after<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.260> crash<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:54.500> bike<00:00:54.800> was

yeah so after the crash the bike was

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.950 
yeah so after the crash the bike was
fine<00:00:55.190> only<00:00:55.670> thing<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.090> was<00:00:56.180> messed<00:00:56.420> up<00:00:56.629> was

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
fine only thing that was messed up was

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.930 
fine only thing that was messed up was
the<00:00:57.320> whole<00:00:57.469> entire<00:00:57.680> lever<00:00:57.980> broke<00:00:58.250> off<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.790> it

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
the whole entire lever broke off and it

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.780 
the whole entire lever broke off and it
was<00:00:58.969> basically<00:00:59.149> just<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.660> stump<00:00:59.960> of<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.890> the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
was basically just a stump of it so the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.850 
was basically just a stump of it so the
way<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.000> got<00:01:02.210> home<00:01:02.480> was<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:03.019> took<00:01:03.140> an<00:01:03.440> allen<00:01:03.829> key

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
way I got home was I took an allen key

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.010 
way I got home was I took an allen key
and<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.430> inserted<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.059> into<00:01:05.239> this<00:01:05.479> little<00:01:05.780> hole

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
and I inserted it into this little hole

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.190 
and I inserted it into this little hole
inside<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:07.009> the<00:01:07.159> one<00:01:07.310> part<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.790> on<00:01:08.200> clutch

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
inside of the one part of the on clutch

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.440 
inside of the one part of the on clutch
lever<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.770> kind<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.340> used<00:01:10.550> that<00:01:10.790> as<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:11.090> little

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
lever and kind of used that as a little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.719 
lever and kind of used that as a little
lock<00:01:11.630> clutch<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:12.680> I<00:01:12.710> was<00:01:12.950> riding<00:01:13.250> with<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.369> super

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
lock clutch so I was riding with a super

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.790 
lock clutch so I was riding with a super
shorty<00:01:14.090> on<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.210> way<00:01:14.360> home<00:01:14.479> but<00:01:14.750> luckily<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:15.590> was

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
shorty on the way home but luckily I was

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.040 
shorty on the way home but luckily I was
about<00:01:16.040> my<00:01:16.850> alerts<00:01:17.149> maybe<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.659> mile<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> half

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
about my alerts maybe a mile and a half

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.040 
about my alerts maybe a mile and a half
away<00:01:18.259> from<00:01:18.380> my<00:01:18.590> house<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:18.800> I<00:01:19.759> wasn't<00:01:20.750> too<00:01:20.869> bad

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
away from my house so I wasn't too bad

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.609 
away from my house so I wasn't too bad
but<00:01:21.369> without<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.430> clutch<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.820> really<00:01:23.060> can't

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
but without a clutch you really can't

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.889 
but without a clutch you really can't
really<00:01:24.619> can't<00:01:24.830> ride<00:01:25.009> your<00:01:25.039> bike<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:25.610> I

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
really can't ride your bike so I

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.580 
really can't ride your bike so I
probably<00:01:26.899> would<00:01:27.110> have<00:01:27.170> had<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.350> get<00:01:27.440> it<00:01:27.500> towed

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
probably would have had to get it towed

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.350 
probably would have had to get it towed
if<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.009> didn't<00:01:28.220> figure<00:01:28.340> something<00:01:28.700> out<00:01:28.789> soon

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
if I didn't figure something out soon

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.290 
if I didn't figure something out soon
sooner<00:01:29.899> than<00:01:30.020> later<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:30.640> luckily<00:01:31.640> right<00:01:32.119> away

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
sooner than later but luckily right away

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.090 
sooner than later but luckily right away
it<00:01:32.479> came<00:01:32.690> to<00:01:32.840> me<00:01:32.960> okay<00:01:33.410> I<00:01:33.440> see<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> little<00:01:33.979> hole

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
it came to me okay I see a little hole

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.100 
it came to me okay I see a little hole
hopefully<00:01:34.369> I<00:01:34.550> could<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:34.910> use<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.929> little

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
hopefully I could just use the little

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.020 
hopefully I could just use the little
allen<00:01:36.679> key<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.130> kind<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.640> use<00:01:37.759> that<00:01:37.789> as<00:01:37.940> a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
allen key and kind of use that as a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.940 
allen key and kind of use that as a
little<00:01:38.270> clutch<00:01:38.929> because<00:01:39.110> there's<00:01:39.380> no<00:01:39.530> way<00:01:39.710> I'm

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
little clutch because there's no way I'm

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.160 
little clutch because there's no way I'm
getting<00:01:40.670> my<00:01:40.880> bike<00:01:41.090> towed<00:01:41.330> for<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.660> mile<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.140> a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
getting my bike towed for a mile and a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.100 
getting my bike towed for a mile and a
half<00:01:42.229> toe<00:01:43.420> for<00:01:44.420> something<00:01:44.690> so<00:01:44.810> stupid

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
half toe for something so stupid

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.779 
half toe for something so stupid
especially<00:01:45.470> because<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:46.460> bike<00:01:46.640> was

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
especially because the bike was

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.200 
especially because the bike was
obviously<00:01:47.409> undamaged<00:01:48.409> other<00:01:48.560> than<00:01:48.649> that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
obviously undamaged other than that

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.380 
obviously undamaged other than that
mechanically<00:01:50.210> so<00:01:50.590> as<00:01:51.590> soon<00:01:51.800> as<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.270> used<00:01:53.270> that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
mechanically so as soon as I used that

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.090 
mechanically so as soon as I used that
it<00:01:53.659> started<00:01:53.960> up<00:01:54.050> right<00:01:54.200> away<00:01:54.289> it<00:01:54.470> was<00:01:54.560> fine<00:01:54.800> but

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
it started up right away it was fine but

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.440 
it started up right away it was fine but
um<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.920> only<00:01:57.979> thing<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:58.490> was<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> little<00:01:59.270> bit

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
um the only thing that was a little bit

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.380 
um the only thing that was a little bit
messed<00:01:59.659> up<00:01:59.840> was<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.549> engine<00:02:01.549> slider<00:02:01.880> on<00:02:02.180> the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
messed up was the engine slider on the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.789 
messed up was the engine slider on the
right<00:02:02.540> side<00:02:02.810> so<00:02:03.229> that<00:02:03.350> covers<00:02:03.530> up<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
right side so that covers up the

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.880 
right side so that covers up the
alternator<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:05.840> was<00:02:06.020> chewed<00:02:06.320> up<00:02:06.470> that's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
alternator and that was chewed up that's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.069 
alternator and that was chewed up that's
pretty<00:02:07.040> much<00:02:07.189> done<00:02:07.490> and<00:02:07.759> then<00:02:08.390> obviously<00:02:08.750> the

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
pretty much done and then obviously the

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.710 
pretty much done and then obviously the
mirror<00:02:09.579> but<00:02:10.579> other<00:02:10.880> than<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.450> was<00:02:11.480> pretty

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
mirror but other than that it was pretty

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.340 
mirror but other than that it was pretty
much<00:02:11.840> okay<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:13.640> little<00:02:14.120> frame<00:02:14.299> slider<00:02:14.630> had<00:02:15.320> a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
much okay the little frame slider had a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.199 
much okay the little frame slider had a
little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.739> wear<00:02:15.950> on<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.280> like<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.000> little

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
little bit of wear on it like a little

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.880 
little bit of wear on it like a little
little<00:02:17.600> couple<00:02:17.989> scratches<00:02:18.200> but<00:02:18.500> i<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.799> took

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
little couple scratches but i just took

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.530 
little couple scratches but i just took
my<00:02:18.950> blowtorch<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.150> like

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
my blowtorch to it and just like

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.030 
my blowtorch to it and just like
basically<00:02:21.470> made<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.250> let's<00:02:22.519> do<00:02:22.910> flat<00:02:23.269> edge<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
basically made it let's do flat edge and

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.240 
basically made it let's do flat edge and
that's<00:02:25.040> fine<00:02:25.280> just<00:02:25.790> had<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.090> bit<00:02:26.299> of<00:02:26.329> a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
that's fine just had a little bit of a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.860 
that's fine just had a little bit of a
couple<00:02:28.250> scratches<00:02:28.459> like<00:02:28.850> nothing<00:02:29.510> major<00:02:29.690> at

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
couple scratches like nothing major at

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.930 
couple scratches like nothing major at
all<00:02:29.989> wasn't<00:02:30.410> worn<00:02:30.650> away<00:02:30.769> at<00:02:30.950> all<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.340> i<00:02:31.610> think

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
all wasn't worn away at all so i think

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.960 
all wasn't worn away at all so i think
the<00:02:32.120> engine<00:02:32.480> slider<00:02:32.750> took<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.170> majority<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the engine slider took the majority of a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.790 
the engine slider took the majority of a
front<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> crash<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.810> uh

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
front of the crash and uh

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.030 
front of the crash and uh
did<00:02:38.490> its<00:02:38.640> job<00:02:39.050> as<00:02:40.050> well<00:02:40.470> as<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> mirror<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
did its job as well as the mirror the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.470 
did its job as well as the mirror the
mirror<00:02:41.160> took<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:42.120> lot<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> force<00:02:43.490> but<00:02:44.490> it's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
mirror took a lot of the force but it's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.830 
mirror took a lot of the force but it's
all<00:02:45.630> good<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.130> didn't<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.220> hurt<00:02:47.370> at<00:02:47.550> all<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.940> had

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
all good I didn't get hurt at all I had

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.270 
all good I didn't get hurt at all I had
a<00:02:48.870> little<00:02:49.200> scratch<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.650> my<00:02:49.770> knee<00:02:49.830> because<00:02:50.100> I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
a little scratch on my knee because I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.790 
a little scratch on my knee because I
was<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.580> wearing<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:51.620> wasn't<00:02:52.620> wearing

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800

leather<00:02:53.100> pants<00:02:53.430> but<00:02:53.900> at<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.990> same<00:02:55.200> time<00:02:55.410> it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
leather pants but at the same time it

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.220 
leather pants but at the same time it
was<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:55.860> little<00:02:56.070> that<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.900> didn't

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
was so little that like it didn't

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.500 
was so little that like it didn't
wouldn't<00:02:58.920> matter<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.310> was<00:02:59.430> wearing<00:02:59.610> full

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
wouldn't matter if I was wearing full

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.160 
wouldn't matter if I was wearing full
gear<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.930> odd<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:02.390> lot<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.420> people<00:03:03.510> were<00:03:03.870> asking

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
gear and odd a lot of people were asking

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.350 
gear and odd a lot of people were asking
me<00:03:04.290> why<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> think<00:03:04.710> it<00:03:05.010> happened<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:06.030> just

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
me why I think it happened and I just

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.050 
me why I think it happened and I just
think<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.570> section<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.170> road<00:03:07.430> going<00:03:08.430> back<00:03:08.760> to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
think that section of road going back to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.780 
think that section of road going back to
that<00:03:09.090> area<00:03:09.750> after<00:03:10.440> my<00:03:10.530> crash<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.130> touching

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
that area after my crash and touching

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.480 
that area after my crash and touching
the<00:03:11.880> ground<00:03:12.000> at<00:03:12.330> night<00:03:12.890> when<00:03:13.890> it<00:03:13.980> was<00:03:14.010> all<00:03:14.220> dry

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
the ground at night when it was all dry

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.430 
the ground at night when it was all dry
the<00:03:15.210> car<00:03:15.390> wash<00:03:15.540> clothes<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.050> everything<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.410> I

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
the car wash clothes and everything so I

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.550 
the car wash clothes and everything so I
was<00:03:16.530> all<00:03:16.650> dry<00:03:16.860> um<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:18.090> ground<00:03:18.390> was<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.110> felt

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
was all dry um the ground was just felt

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.950 
was all dry um the ground was just felt
slick<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.700> there<00:03:20.850> was<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:20.970> build<00:03:21.210> of<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.390> wax<00:03:21.600> or

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
slick like there was a build of a wax or

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.570 
slick like there was a build of a wax or
tire<00:03:22.260> shine<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.860> don't<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.160> what<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.370> was<00:03:23.550> but

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
tire shine I don't know what it was but

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.030 
tire shine I don't know what it was but
I<00:03:24.150> almost<00:03:24.810> feel<00:03:24.990> like<00:03:25.050> because<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.800> turn

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
I almost feel like because of the turn

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.980 
I almost feel like because of the turn
area<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.640> some<00:03:26.820> people<00:03:27.120> are<00:03:27.360> either

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
area that some people are either

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.350 
area that some people are either
stopping<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:29.040> slowing<00:03:29.610> down<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.880> turning<00:03:30.090> so

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
stopping and slowing down and turning so

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.150 
stopping and slowing down and turning so
a<00:03:30.390> bunch<00:03:30.630> of<00:03:30.720> stuff<00:03:30.780> that's<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.560> their<00:03:31.740> car<00:03:31.950> is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
a bunch of stuff that's on their car is

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.600 
a bunch of stuff that's on their car is
going<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.520> come<00:03:32.700> onto<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.150> road<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:35.430> road

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
going to come onto the road and the road

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.160 
going to come onto the road and the road
coming<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> opposite<00:03:36.600> direction<00:03:36.720> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
coming in the opposite direction is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.810 
coming in the opposite direction is
totally<00:03:37.560> clean<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:37.980> normal<00:03:38.280> but<00:03:38.490> on<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
totally clean and normal but on the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.410 
totally clean and normal but on the
right<00:03:39.000> side<00:03:39.240> it's<00:03:39.420> all<00:03:39.600> built<00:03:40.020> up<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:41.420> my

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
right side it's all built up and my

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.310 
right side it's all built up and my
tires<00:03:42.690> were<00:03:43.459> pretty<00:03:44.459> much<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:45.000> mean<00:03:45.930> obviously

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
tires were pretty much I mean obviously

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.900 
tires were pretty much I mean obviously
there<00:03:46.890> weren't<00:03:47.160> two<00:03:47.310> temperature<00:03:47.730> yet

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
there weren't two temperature yet

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.360 
there weren't two temperature yet
because<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> hadn't<00:03:48.570> been<00:03:48.660> rotting<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.770> at<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
because I hadn't been rotting but at the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.890 
because I hadn't been rotting but at the
same<00:03:50.580> time<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.150> was<00:03:51.270> about<00:03:51.450> 70<00:03:51.840> degrees

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
same time it was about 70 degrees

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.229 
same time it was about 70 degrees
outside<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:53.630> did<00:03:54.630> dry<00:03:54.930> off<00:03:55.170> probably<00:03:56.209> 50<00:03:57.209> to

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
outside and I did dry off probably 50 to

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.290 
outside and I did dry off probably 50 to
75<00:03:58.080> 75<00:03:58.770> percent<00:03:59.160> of<00:03:59.220> my<00:03:59.310> tires<00:03:59.820> before<00:04:00.120> I

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
75 75 percent of my tires before I

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.660 
75 75 percent of my tires before I
started<00:04:00.600> riding<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.950> think<00:04:02.310> by<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.580> time

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
started riding so I think by the time

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.820 
started riding so I think by the time
that<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:03.000> got<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.300> that<00:04:03.420> section<00:04:03.770> they<00:04:04.770> were

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
that I got to that section they were

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.130 
that I got to that section they were
probably<00:04:05.070> fairly<00:04:05.880> dry<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.900> know<00:04:09.989> they're

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
probably fairly dry and you know they're

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.540 
probably fairly dry and you know they're
probably<00:04:10.350> all<00:04:10.530> right<00:04:10.709> but<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.070> just<00:04:11.310> think<00:04:11.489> it

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
probably all right but I just think it

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.940 
probably all right but I just think it
was<00:04:11.610> one<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.820> those<00:04:11.940> situations<00:04:12.150> where<00:04:12.950> unless

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
was one of those situations where unless

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.010 
was one of those situations where unless
I<00:04:14.070> was<00:04:14.220> going<00:04:14.580> maybe<00:04:14.880> half<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.270> speed<00:04:15.780> maybe

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
I was going maybe half the speed maybe

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.900 
I was going maybe half the speed maybe
10<00:04:16.320> miles<00:04:16.500> per<00:04:16.590> hour<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:16.980> said<00:04:17.160> 20<00:04:17.520> something

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
10 miles per hour and said 20 something

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.320 
10 miles per hour and said 20 something
I<00:04:18.260> would<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.350> been<00:04:19.440> able<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.790> know<00:04:20.790> be<00:04:21.000> okay

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
I would have been able to know be okay

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.780 
I would have been able to know be okay
but<00:04:21.750> as<00:04:22.620> soon<00:04:22.680> as<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:22.919> get<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.130> bike<00:04:23.310> moving

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
but as soon as you get the bike moving

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.990 
but as soon as you get the bike moving
and<00:04:24.200> I<00:04:25.200> feel<00:04:25.710> like<00:04:25.860> especially<00:04:25.980> at<00:04:26.460> low<00:04:26.640> speeds

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and I feel like especially at low speeds

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.280 
and I feel like especially at low speeds
in<00:04:27.150> those<00:04:27.270> tight<00:04:27.480> corners<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:27.990> stuff<00:04:28.140> like

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
in those tight corners and stuff like

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.970 
in those tight corners and stuff like
that<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:29.040> really<00:04:29.340> easy<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.640> lose<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.180> I

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
that it's really easy to lose it and I

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.650 
that it's really easy to lose it and I
didn't<00:04:31.980> panic<00:04:32.280> brake<00:04:32.610> or<00:04:32.760> anything<00:04:33.120> or<00:04:33.360> give

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
didn't panic brake or anything or give

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.420 
didn't panic brake or anything or give
it<00:04:33.750> throttle<00:04:33.990> I<00:04:34.320> pretty<00:04:34.530> much<00:04:34.620> was<00:04:35.220> going

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it throttle I pretty much was going

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.210 
it throttle I pretty much was going
through<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:35.820> turn<00:04:36.000> at<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.950> 27<00:04:37.950> miles<00:04:38.070> per

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
through the turn at like a 27 miles per

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.130 
through the turn at like a 27 miles per
hour<00:04:38.370> probably<00:04:38.700> like<00:04:38.880> 22<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.630> think<00:04:39.960> by<00:04:40.050> the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
hour probably like 22 I think by the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.409 
hour probably like 22 I think by the
time<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.350> crash<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.770> was<00:04:40.860> going<00:04:40.980> 22<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.640> before

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
time I crash I was going 22 but before

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.170 
time I crash I was going 22 but before
that<00:04:42.510> was<00:04:42.660> maybe<00:04:42.810> going<00:04:42.990> like<00:04:43.169> low<00:04:43.470> 20

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
that was maybe going like low 20

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.990 
that was maybe going like low 20
and<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:45.830> know<00:04:45.919> made<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.190> turn<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:46.669> kind<00:04:46.910> of

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
and you know made the turn I kind of

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.129 
and you know made the turn I kind of
went<00:04:47.120> through<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.389> term<00:04:47.570> without<00:04:47.720> any

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
went through the term without any

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.110 
went through the term without any
throttle<00:04:48.650> at<00:04:48.770> all<00:04:48.919> just<00:04:49.639> kind<00:04:49.789> of<00:04:49.820> gliding

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
throttle at all just kind of gliding

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.950 
throttle at all just kind of gliding
through<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:50.830> no<00:04:51.830> break<00:04:52.100> and<00:04:52.720> not<00:04:53.720> even

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
through it and no break and not even

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.360 
through it and no break and not even
leading<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.259> bike<00:04:54.410> just<00:04:54.889> steering<00:04:55.190> it

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
leading the bike just steering it

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.689 
leading the bike just steering it
basically<00:04:55.699> it<00:04:55.910> was<00:04:56.030> going<00:04:56.210> so<00:04:56.270> slow<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:57.699> you

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
basically it was going so slow and you

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.909 
basically it was going so slow and you
know<00:04:58.789> the<00:04:58.940> bike<00:04:59.150> I<00:04:59.419> it<00:04:59.990> felt<00:05:00.440> like<00:05:00.620> when<00:05:00.800> I<00:05:00.860> was

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
know the bike I it felt like when I was

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.129 
know the bike I it felt like when I was
doing<00:05:01.370> at<00:05:01.639> the<00:05:01.669> rear<00:05:01.970> end<00:05:02.150> slid<00:05:02.509> out<00:05:02.539> and<00:05:02.870> then

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
doing at the rear end slid out and then

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.840 
doing at the rear end slid out and then
the<00:05:03.229> front<00:05:03.440> end<00:05:03.650> washed<00:05:03.860> out<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.400> really<00:05:04.729> don't

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
the front end washed out I really don't

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.460 
the front end washed out I really don't
know<00:05:04.970> but<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.389> just<00:05:05.690> know<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:05.930> when<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.139> did<00:05:06.350> go

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
know but I just know that when I did go

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.870 
know but I just know that when I did go
down<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:07.400> bike<00:05:07.729> basically<00:05:08.660> twirled<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.880> the

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
down the bike basically twirled and the

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.140 
down the bike basically twirled and the
tank<00:05:11.479> was<00:05:11.660> facing<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.199> curb<00:05:12.440> then<00:05:12.710> so<00:05:13.340> if<00:05:13.880> i

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
tank was facing the curb then so if i

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.460 
tank was facing the curb then so if i
had<00:05:14.419> would<00:05:14.600> have<00:05:14.690> been<00:05:14.810> going<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.110> little<00:05:15.139> bit

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
had would have been going a little bit

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.710 
had would have been going a little bit
faster<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:16.699> tank<00:05:16.970> would<00:05:17.150> have<00:05:17.240> hit<00:05:17.360> the<00:05:17.479> curb

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
faster the tank would have hit the curb

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.140 
faster the tank would have hit the curb
and<00:05:17.930> cause<00:05:18.470> a<00:05:18.800> ton<00:05:19.160> of<00:05:19.190> damage<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:19.820> I'm<00:05:19.970> just

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
and cause a ton of damage so I'm just

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.330 
and cause a ton of damage so I'm just
happy<00:05:20.389> that<00:05:20.539> didn't<00:05:20.810> happen<00:05:21.139> that<00:05:22.130> was<00:05:22.250> the

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
happy that didn't happen that was the

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.490 
happy that didn't happen that was the
main<00:05:22.490> thing<00:05:22.520> because<00:05:22.940> I<00:05:23.240> mean<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.870> got<00:05:24.110> up<00:05:24.289> right

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
main thing because I mean I got up right

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.140 
main thing because I mean I got up right
away<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.919> fell<00:05:25.250> off<00:05:25.280> and<00:05:25.610> i<00:05:25.639> got<00:05:25.789> up<00:05:25.820> right<00:05:26.060> away

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
and i was running towards my bike as it

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.520 
and i was running towards my bike as it
was<00:05:28.130> still<00:05:28.370> sliding<00:05:28.729> towards<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.690> curb<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.349> I
