though we had a mountain of good deeds
he<00:03:51.290> will<00:03:51.320> lose<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:52.010> mountain<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.489> good<00:03:52.670> deeds

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
he will lose that mountain of good deeds

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.300 
he will lose that mountain of good deeds

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
because again one of the things related

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:03.960 
because again one of the things related
