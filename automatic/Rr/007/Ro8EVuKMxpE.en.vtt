00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.640
 topic and we go to the other maybe like the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.060
 mentioned here and if we no longer have 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.220
 problems because we stop buying from 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.119
 weapons that only benefit the 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:21.030
 gun salesmen and commission agents 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.450
 let's see more confidently look what 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.370
 happened with Ecuador 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.650
 with the player we had a conflict 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.160
 armed several times in the century 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:36.110
 20 but now we have a relationship of 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.790
 total closeness that allows in 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.530
 any time we disappear 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.020
 our troops from the border or the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.570
 let's take 300 kilometers beyond each 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.730
 one this was a proposal that we were 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.410
 working with the president leash and 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.930
 that unfortunately ended my 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.880
 government 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.620
 again we are like the war of the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:58.300
 peaceful post 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.940
 we have politicians who do not reason by looking 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.540
 to Peru as a state but they are seeing 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.380
 their interests and how to take advantage of 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.350
 the circumstances 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.829
 It is true what Don Julian says in 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.470
 at a certain moment they disarmed us I did not 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.820
 I know why what a rush to sell airplanes and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 to leave us without fixing the mind 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.050
 and then came the so-called caviares 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.440
 and they ended up 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.300
 put the idea and impose its criteria on 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.400
 all governments that should not be 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.990
 buy arms I hear journalist who 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
 It makes my hair stand on end 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.590
 I feel cold when they talk about buying 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.600
 arms hear more cold will you feel when 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.970
 feel bayonets of others from others 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.520
 armies killing their children killing 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.170
 his brothers or killing his parents 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.900
 they want 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.930
 and I do not believe so much that organisms 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.940
 internationals intervene 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.740
 in conflict with the equator and the form 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.990
 in which the problem with the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.310
 Ecuador is an example of what is going to 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.100
 pass the Rio Protocol is 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.340
 supposed to settle the problem we had 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.530
 four or five guarantors the guarantors we 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.350
 they betrayed selling arms chile 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.890
 selling arms to the equator when it was 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.840
 Argentine guarantor selling weapons 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.700
 that's what we say we should leave them 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.540
 the batteries of which are friends we are 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.420
 brothers we are not, because we are not 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.280
 we will see them nor will we be 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.280
 learn to defend our interests
