00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.409
 My name is Michael Thurk from Bishop that you want in Dusseldorf 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.820
 and I'll explain some Sion Terrain structures today 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.750
 The easiest unfolded sector in the program is about it 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.859
 Standard Tourbus fell asleep 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.249
 the so-called courage 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.399
 there is nothing in it that only the bracket is otherwise only if 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.680
 He has the disadvantage of most reasonable and even light 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.270
 from that at least a little bit off in which bar head ball and on 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.320
 Keeping dramas in Abruzzo in reflector will make that important 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 even high tech a reflector becomes uneven 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 This is the oldest closest you can buy spices any 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.480
 Beginners are sold we have 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.070
 second in front of Petrov won as a boss Porsche prefers to buy us mostly 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 you need to see her see you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.130
 it's next 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.860
 so far stood reflectors 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.540
 provided with a true 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.460
 there are already much closer not against it is just clear 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.460
 do not give concentrated and much more even 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660
 the Swiss were gone 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.020
 entered 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.890
 so I have clearly in the cone of light so that I can do a lot for 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.050
 Judges make the light as before that's actually the cheapest way to go 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.660
 struggle 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.320
 the Königseer option 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.250
 is the so-called shares gem 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.790
 the also a meaningful spotted in this case in it in the team Thomas 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.890
 Cousins ​​is a Nico was picking brothel then is incredible tele2 lowers tax 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.190
 So a combination of trains in the aforementioned devices the ideal thing 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.090
 You can actually get darker 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.490
 It also makes the lightest SBO themes Florian Müller 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.100
 can recommend a fine stress can recommend to us is one of the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 mostly used light come 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.450
 the Institut Ennstaler very clearly saw the bright spot in the middle 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.750
 which is illuminated a bit unevenly 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.360
 the shares would be invested with its four gates we have enough air for them 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.389
 more 

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.010
 for uniform illumination but it does not work really well 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.369
 and worry 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.369
 nice result 

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.069
 that is now the seven inch reflector staff 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.890
 We see that the light is much more even in Rhineland-Palatinate 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.319
 to have 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.899
 soft leaking 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:30.059
 below a much smaller cone of light also gives off as a trader 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.069
 Virtue punishable 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.449
 and that is very much 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:36.149
 Accent Jr 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.359
 and now dominated in the exploiter 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.149
 At the same time much softer to the plan runs the border 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.079
 detected 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.999
 That's the best option, it's always a matter of time
