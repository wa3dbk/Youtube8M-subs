hello<00:00:03.870> so<00:00:04.200> in<00:00:04.410> this<00:00:04.560> video<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.130> going

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
hello so in this video we're just going

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.369 
hello so in this video we're just going
to<00:00:05.460> make<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.850> quick<00:00:06.330> comparison<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:07.319> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
to make a quick comparison of the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.919 
to make a quick comparison of the
hardware<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.309> physical<00:00:08.940> size<00:00:09.420> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
hardware the physical size and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.730 
hardware the physical size and
dimensions<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.639> HTC<00:00:12.540> One<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.410> we<00:00:13.530> have

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
dimensions of the HTC One that we have

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.620 
dimensions of the HTC One that we have
here<00:00:14.040> against<00:00:14.700> some<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> other<00:00:15.299> leading

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
here against some of the other leading

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
here against some of the other leading
smartphones<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> moment<00:00:17.100> which<00:00:17.430> you

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
smartphones at the moment which you

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.960 
smartphones at the moment which you
might<00:00:17.760> be<00:00:17.970> comparing<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.930> HTC<00:00:19.740> One<00:00:20.010> against

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
might be comparing the HTC One against

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.590 
might be comparing the HTC One against
so<00:00:21.570> we've<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.289> samsung<00:00:22.769> galaxy<00:00:23.519> s3<00:00:23.670> one<00:00:24.510> of

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
so we've got a samsung galaxy s3 one of

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480 
so we've got a samsung galaxy s3 one of
the<00:00:24.689> most<00:00:24.869> popular<00:00:25.380> phones<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.920> moment<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the most popular phones at the moment so

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.990 
the most popular phones at the moment so
let's<00:00:26.939> see<00:00:27.210> how<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.840> stacks<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.880> in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
let's see how it stacks up here so in

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
let's see how it stacks up here so in
terms<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.359> actual<00:00:30.539> size<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.619> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
terms of actual size you can see that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
terms of actual size you can see that
it's<00:00:31.949> almost<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.940> same<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.780> HTC<00:00:34.260> One<00:00:35.660> just

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
it's almost the same the HTC One just

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.420 
it's almost the same the HTC One just
appears<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.710> very<00:00:38.340> very<00:00:38.899> marginally

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
appears to be very very marginally

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.709 
appears to be very very marginally
longer<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.610> don't<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.879> how<00:00:41.969> easy<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
longer I don't know how easy that is

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.709 
longer I don't know how easy that is
picking<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.219> camera<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
picking up on the camera here you can

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.490 
picking up on the camera here you can
see<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.829> s3<00:00:47.550> has<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:48.090> curvature

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
see that the s3 has more curvature

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.610 
see that the s3 has more curvature
around<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.649> corners<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> indeed

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
around the corners and it is indeed

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.580 
around the corners and it is indeed
slightly<00:00:52.620> wider<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:54.030> terms<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.989> thickness

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
slightly wider in terms of thickness

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
slightly wider in terms of thickness
there<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.219> isn't<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.610> much<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> they

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
there really isn't that much in it they

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.319 
there really isn't that much in it they
are<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:58.170> comparable<00:01:01.219> terms<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> quality<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
are very comparable terms of quality you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
are very comparable terms of quality you
can<00:01:03.539> tell<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.280> HTC<00:01:05.280> One<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> premium

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
can tell that the HTC One is the premium

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200 
can tell that the HTC One is the premium
it<00:01:06.330> feels<00:01:06.689> more<00:01:07.260> robust<00:01:07.680> where<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> s3<00:01:08.939> does

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it feels more robust where the s3 does

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.490 
it feels more robust where the s3 does
feel<00:01:09.450> plasticky<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.680> terms<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.100> weight

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
feel plasticky and in terms of weight

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
feel plasticky and in terms of weight
just<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.610> specs<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> just

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
just not going off the specs you just

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.890 
just not going off the specs you just
feel<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:16.650> feel<00:01:16.979> almost<00:01:17.840> identical<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
feel here they feel almost identical the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
feel here they feel almost identical the
HTC<00:01:19.530> One<00:01:19.710> probably<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.430> just<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.270> slightly

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
HTC One probably is just the slightly

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560 
HTC One probably is just the slightly
heavier<00:01:22.020> device<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:23.939> also<00:01:24.150> bring

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
heavier device so if we then also bring

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.440 
heavier device so if we then also bring
in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.110> note<00:01:25.560> 2<00:01:25.950> now<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.880> might<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
in the note 2 now this might not be a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
in the note 2 now this might not be a
direct<00:01:28.080> competitor<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.979> it'll<00:01:29.130> give<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.400> an

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
direct competitor but it'll give you an

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.789 
direct competitor but it'll give you an
idea<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:30.150> actual<00:01:30.420> sizing<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.530> see

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
idea for actual sizing so you can see

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.890 
idea for actual sizing so you can see
how<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.400> HTC<00:01:33.240> One<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:34.439> lot<00:01:34.770> smaller

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
how the HTC One is a lot smaller

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.030 
how the HTC One is a lot smaller
naturally<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> screen<00:01:37.799> size

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
naturally because of the screen size

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.840 
naturally because of the screen size
it's<00:01:38.450> not<00:01:39.450> as<00:01:39.720> wide<00:01:41.119> thickness<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:43.170> note<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
it's not as wide thickness the note is

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.730 
it's not as wide thickness the note is
very<00:01:44.850> similar<00:01:45.509> perhaps<00:01:46.140> fractionally

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
very similar perhaps fractionally

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.280 
very similar perhaps fractionally
thicker<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> overall<00:01:48.810> profile

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
thicker you can see the overall profile

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.499 
thicker you can see the overall profile
size<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> considerably<00:01:50.460> different<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.390> of

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
size is considerably different and of

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.859 
size is considerably different and of
course<00:01:51.540> wait<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> note<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.710> naturally<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
course wait the note to naturally is

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.060 
course wait the note to naturally is
much<00:01:54.869> heavier<00:01:55.909> we've<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.119> got<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.710> iPhone<00:01:58.710> 4

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
much heavier we've then got the iPhone 4

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.149 
much heavier we've then got the iPhone 4
or<00:01:59.100> 4s<00:01:59.659> so<00:02:01.189> this<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:03.020> again<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.229> different<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
or 4s so this is again very different in

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.679 
or 4s so this is again very different in
terms<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.610> size<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.600> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
terms of size so you can see that the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.730 
terms of size so you can see that the
HTC<00:02:07.320> One<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.740> much<00:02:08.459> bigger<00:02:09.319> it's<00:02:10.319> wider

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
HTC One is much bigger it's wider

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.470 
HTC One is much bigger it's wider
thickness<00:02:12.580> wise<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:14.380> HTC<00:02:15.010> One<00:02:15.220> probably<00:02:15.520> wins

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
thickness wise the HTC One probably wins

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.690 
thickness wise the HTC One probably wins
it<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:18.190> iphone<00:02:18.970> feels<00:02:19.270> much<00:02:19.510> more<00:02:19.750> compact

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
it the iphone feels much more compact

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.490 
it the iphone feels much more compact
but<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.150> obviously<00:02:22.240> gaining<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.840> lot<00:02:23.110> more<00:02:23.380> in

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
but you obviously gaining a lot more in

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.130 
but you obviously gaining a lot more in
terms<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.830> actual<00:02:24.160> screen<00:02:24.490> size<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.840> features

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
terms of actual screen size and features

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.240 
terms of actual screen size and features
on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:27.280> HTC<00:02:27.700> One<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.420> terms<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.840> weight<00:02:29.250> very

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
on the HTC One in terms of weight very

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.360 
on the HTC One in terms of weight very
very<00:02:30.580> comparable<00:02:32.640> we've<00:02:33.640> got<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.300> HTC<00:02:35.010> 8x<00:02:36.010> hit

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
very comparable we've got the HTC 8x hit

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.930 
very comparable we've got the HTC 8x hit
so<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.270> windows<00:02:37.660> phone<00:02:38.050> from<00:02:38.080> HTC

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
so this is the windows phone from HTC

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.740 
so this is the windows phone from HTC
you<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.120> see<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.630> terms<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:41.080> size<00:02:42.750> it's

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
you can see that in terms of size it's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.890 
you can see that in terms of size it's
much<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:44.290> similar<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.860> 8x<00:02:45.790> is<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.420> little<00:02:46.750> bit

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
much more similar the 8x is a little bit

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.490 
much more similar the 8x is a little bit
sort<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> square<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.190> corners<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.990> bit

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
sort of square on the corners it's a bit

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.020 
sort of square on the corners it's a bit
wider<00:02:51.780> as<00:02:52.780> well<00:02:53.590> just<00:02:54.310> very<00:02:54.850> very

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
wider as well just very very

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.220 
wider as well just very very
fractionally<00:02:57.450> sickness<00:02:58.450> wise<00:02:58.690> i<00:02:58.720> think<00:02:59.140> the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
fractionally sickness wise i think the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.180 
fractionally sickness wise i think the
HTC<00:02:59.800> one's<00:03:00.660> picked<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.560> x<00:03:02.920> is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
HTC one's picked it there the x is

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.420 
HTC one's picked it there the x is
pretty<00:03:03.460> thin<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.060> it's<00:03:04.180> got<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.540> curvature<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
pretty thin but it's got a curvature to

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.830 
pretty thin but it's got a curvature to
the<00:03:06.550> sides<00:03:06.850> here<00:03:09.210> quality-wise<00:03:10.210> are<00:03:10.660> both

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
the sides here quality-wise are both

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.180 
the sides here quality-wise are both
very<00:03:11.170> good<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:12.120> HTC<00:03:13.120> One<00:03:13.510> feels<00:03:14.190> slightly

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
very good the HTC One feels slightly

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.770 
very good the HTC One feels slightly
more<00:03:15.550> robust<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.210> this<00:03:16.330> has<00:03:16.480> got<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.630> nice

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
more robust but this has got a nice

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.260 
more robust but this has got a nice
rubbery<00:03:17.110> texture<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.680> back<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.670> HTC

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
rubbery texture on the back of the HTC

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.860 
rubbery texture on the back of the HTC
8x<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.640> from<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.820> second<00:03:22.180> go<00:03:22.300> actually<00:03:22.720> it

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
8x and from this second go actually it

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.280 
8x and from this second go actually it
doesn't<00:03:23.050> look<00:03:23.320> like<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.650> 8x<00:03:24.130> is<00:03:25.050> that<00:03:26.050> much

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
doesn't look like the 8x is that much

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.840 
doesn't look like the 8x is that much
wider<00:03:27.870> so<00:03:28.870> there<00:03:29.080> we<00:03:29.200> have<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.920> finally

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
wider so there we have that and finally

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.930 
wider so there we have that and finally
a<00:03:30.880> slightly<00:03:31.270> older<00:03:31.390> device<00:03:32.610> it's<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.700> samsung

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
a slightly older device it's a samsung

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.210 
a slightly older device it's a samsung
galaxy<00:03:34.150> s2<00:03:34.630> but<00:03:35.080> it's<00:03:35.230> again<00:03:35.470> very<00:03:35.500> popular

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
galaxy s2 but it's again very popular

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.040 
galaxy s2 but it's again very popular
device<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:36.730> still<00:03:36.970> might<00:03:37.180> be<00:03:37.300> one<00:03:37.480> that

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
device and still might be one that

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.380 
device and still might be one that
you're<00:03:38.140> upgrading<00:03:38.290> from<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.790> in<00:03:40.060> terms<00:03:40.240> of

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
you're upgrading from so in terms of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.050 
you're upgrading from so in terms of
size<00:03:40.600> again<00:03:40.960> we<00:03:41.080> can<00:03:41.260> see<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.560> HTC<00:03:42.130> One<00:03:42.400> is

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
size again we can see the HTC One is

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.220 
size again we can see the HTC One is
much<00:03:43.360> bigger<00:03:45.090> with<00:03:46.090> there<00:03:46.510> isn't<00:03:46.780> actually<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
much bigger with there isn't actually a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.840 
much bigger with there isn't actually a
lot<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.680> comes<00:03:47.980> more<00:03:48.220> on<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.550> actual

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
lot in it comes more on the actual

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.030 
lot in it comes more on the actual
height<00:03:49.120> of<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:50.020> device<00:03:50.290> where<00:03:50.680> we're<00:03:50.860> seeing

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
height of the device where we're seeing

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.210 
height of the device where we're seeing
the<00:03:51.250> increase<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.910> here<00:03:52.590> thickness<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.040> will

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
the increase is here thickness you will

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.610 
the increase is here thickness you will
benefit<00:03:54.760> slightly<00:03:55.210> with<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.390> HTC<00:03:56.080> One<00:03:56.290> it's

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
benefit slightly with the HTC One it's

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.750 
benefit slightly with the HTC One it's
fractionally<00:03:57.310> thinner<00:03:58.170> white<00:03:59.170> wise<00:03:59.440> the<00:04:00.100> HTC

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
fractionally thinner white wise the HTC

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.810 
fractionally thinner white wise the HTC
One<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.660> little<00:04:01.960> bit<00:04:02.170> heavier<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.640> there

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
One is a little bit heavier so there

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.150 
One is a little bit heavier so there
will<00:04:03.940> be<00:04:04.060> an<00:04:04.150> increase<00:04:04.300> but<00:04:04.540> then<00:04:04.900> the<00:04:05.080> s2<00:04:05.590> it

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
will be an increase but then the s2 it

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.220 
will be an increase but then the s2 it
was<00:04:06.280> made<00:04:06.490> out<00:04:06.520> of<00:04:06.730> plastics<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:07.720> doesn't

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
was made out of plastics and doesn't

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.170 
was made out of plastics and doesn't
have<00:04:08.410> quite<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> same<00:04:09.220> features<00:04:09.850> most

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
have quite the same features most

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.620 
have quite the same features most
specifically<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.500> screen<00:04:11.860> size<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:13.390> there<00:04:13.540> we

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
specifically the screen size so there we

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.140 
specifically the screen size so there we
