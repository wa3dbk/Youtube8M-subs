interface up on the side I've also got
controls<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.609> things<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.910> knees<00:00:30.300> pull

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
controls for things like knees pull

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
controls for things like knees pull
vectors<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.590> affect<00:00:31.949> knee<00:00:32.430> swing<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.239> can

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
vectors to affect knee swing and I can

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.910 
vectors to affect knee swing and I can
pull<00:00:33.660> these<00:00:33.809> around<00:00:34.140> depending<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.590> how<00:00:34.800> it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
pull these around depending on how it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
pull these around depending on how it
needs<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> move<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.730> what<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.120> doing<00:00:36.390> I'm

now<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.110> back<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.739> key<00:00:49.980> at<00:00:50.100> frame<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
now I'm back to one key at frame one and

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
now I'm back to one key at frame one and
no<00:00:51.600> movement<00:00:51.870> let's<00:00:52.530> say<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.890> example<00:00:53.309> I'm

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
no movement let's say for example I'm

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
no movement let's say for example I'm
going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.699> pull<00:00:53.910> his<00:00:54.090> wrist<00:00:54.329> around<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.809> little

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
going to pull his wrist around a little

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
going to pull his wrist around a little
bit<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:55.800> him<00:00:55.829> tap<00:00:56.190> his<00:00:56.399> feet

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
bit and then make him tap his feet

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.139 
bit and then make him tap his feet
I'll<00:00:57.449> pick<00:00:57.660> his<00:00:57.840> wrist<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.879> bend<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
I'll pick his wrist and bend it in

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360

and<00:01:03.229> ignoring<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> head<00:01:04.589> deformation<00:01:05.250> let

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
and ignoring the head deformation let

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.090 
and ignoring the head deformation let
him<00:01:05.700> put<00:01:05.850> his<00:01:05.970> arm<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:07.010> we<00:01:08.010> can

see<00:01:08.159> I've<00:01:08.430> got<00:01:08.610> keys<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.210> different<00:01:09.600> places

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
see I've got keys at different places

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
see I've got keys at different places
here<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> need<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:11.220> sure<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.580> I'm

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here so I need to make sure when I'm

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
here so I need to make sure when I'm
deleting<00:01:12.150> keys<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:12.960> looking

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
deleting keys that I'm actually looking

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
deleting keys that I'm actually looking
at<00:01:13.770> all<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.280> them<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> big<00:01:15.210> deal<00:01:15.240> making

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
at all of them it's a big deal making

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.270 
at all of them it's a big deal making
sure<00:01:16.259> you've<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> whole<00:01:16.950> skeleton

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280

keys with the keys off that wrist I've

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.249 
keys with the keys off that wrist I've
eliminated<00:01:28.590> some<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> motion<00:01:29.930> now<00:01:30.930> I'll

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
eliminated some of the motion now I'll

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.620 
eliminated some of the motion now I'll
scrub<00:01:31.650> over<00:01:31.829> here<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> frame<00:01:32.490> 35<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.450> say

and<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.180> here<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.659> put<00:01:45.930> on

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and what we can do in here is put on

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590 
and what we can do in here is put on
additional<00:01:46.470> pivots<00:01:47.100> right<00:01:47.329> now<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> i<00:01:48.570> zoom

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
additional pivots right now and i zoom

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.580 
additional pivots right now and i zoom
in<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:49.890> I've<00:01:50.280> got<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.820> heel<00:01:51.750> control<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
in I can see I've got a heel control and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.679 
in I can see I've got a heel control and
I<00:01:53.189> can<00:01:53.340> also<00:01:53.460> select<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.210> GUI<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
I can also select it in the GUI on the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.920 
I can also select it in the GUI on the
side<00:01:55.130> rotating<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.280> makes<00:01:57.000> his<00:01:57.180> foot<00:01:57.420> rotate

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
side rotating this makes his foot rotate

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
side rotating this makes his foot rotate
reasonably<00:01:58.770> although<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> may<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.610> him<00:01:59.700> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
reasonably although I may want him to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.060 
reasonably although I may want him to
tap<00:02:00.000> his<00:02:00.210> foot<00:02:00.450> from<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.710> his<00:02:01.829> foot

pivot effector I now have what looks

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.740 
pivot effector I now have what looks
like<00:02:10.770> an<00:02:11.039> extra<00:02:11.400> bone<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.300> don't<00:02:12.480> want<00:02:12.629> to

let's<00:02:40.620> say<00:02:40.769> at<00:02:40.890> frame<00:02:41.159> 40<00:02:41.640> he's<00:02:41.970> going<00:02:42.209> to

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
let's say at frame 40 he's going to

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.860 
let's say at frame 40 he's going to
rotate<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.989> foot<00:02:43.319> up<00:02:43.349> from<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.159> point<00:02:44.459> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
rotate this foot up from that point and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.770 
rotate this foot up from that point and
key<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.200> back<00:02:46.709> down<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:47.459> he'll<00:02:48.299> rotate

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
key it and back down here he'll rotate

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:56.390 
key it and back down here he'll rotate
down<00:02:49.700> keyed<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.650> up<00:02:52.650> again<00:02:53.069> here<00:02:55.040> so<00:02:56.040> now<00:02:56.190> he's

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
down keyed and up again here so now he's

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.670 
down keyed and up again here so now he's
tapping<00:02:56.730> his<00:02:56.909> foot<00:02:57.269> from<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.690> heel<00:02:57.959> based<00:02:58.439> on

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
tapping his foot from the heel based on

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.089 
tapping his foot from the heel based on
that<00:02:58.829> extra<00:02:59.129> pivot<00:02:59.549> doing<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.359> little<00:03:00.540> dance<00:03:01.099> we

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
that extra pivot doing a little dance we

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.589 
that extra pivot doing a little dance we
look<00:03:02.310> over<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.639> the<00:03:02.760> perspective<00:03:03.030> view<00:03:03.569> and

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
look over in the perspective view and

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.009 
look over in the perspective view and
zoom<00:03:03.900> out<00:03:04.079> we<00:03:04.349> can<00:03:05.099> see<00:03:05.280> him<00:03:05.489> not<00:03:06.359> only<00:03:06.689> bending

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
zoom out we can see him not only bending

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.069 
zoom out we can see him not only bending
over<00:03:07.549> but<00:03:08.549> there's<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.819> little<00:03:09.090> foot<00:03:09.359> tap<00:03:09.599> from

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
over but there's a little foot tap from

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.990 
over but there's a little foot tap from
the<00:03:10.230> right<00:03:10.409> place<00:03:10.709> using<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.220> extra<00:03:11.459> pivot<00:03:11.849> I

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the right place using that extra pivot I

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.690 
the right place using that extra pivot I
can<00:03:12.840> turn<00:03:13.079> off<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.439> extra<00:03:13.709> pivot<00:03:14.129> clicking

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
can turn off that extra pivot clicking

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.210 
can turn off that extra pivot clicking
back<00:03:14.909> on<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> joint<00:03:15.420> and<00:03:15.659> now<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.799> pivoting

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
back on the joint and now it's pivoting

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.089 
back on the joint and now it's pivoting
back<00:03:17.579> on<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.910> original<00:03:18.000> pivot<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.470> ika

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
back on the original pivot of that ika

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.900 
back on the original pivot of that ika
handle<00:03:21.799> once<00:03:22.799> I've<00:03:22.980> got<00:03:23.129> this<00:03:23.340> going<00:03:23.699> in<00:03:23.819> his

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
handle once I've got this going in his

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.879 
handle once I've got this going in his
major<00:03:24.150> motion<00:03:24.629> then<00:03:25.169> I<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.440> deal<00:03:25.590> with<00:03:25.620> things

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
major motion then I can deal with things

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.069 
major motion then I can deal with things
like<00:03:26.069> my<00:03:26.250> pole<00:03:26.489> vectors<00:03:26.879> on<00:03:27.060> my<00:03:27.209> knees<00:03:27.419> let's

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
like my pole vectors on my knees let's

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.780 
like my pole vectors on my knees let's
say<00:03:28.199> at<00:03:28.319> this<00:03:28.530> point<00:03:28.799> in<00:03:29.010> addition<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.400> tapping

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
say at this point in addition to tapping

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.240 
say at this point in addition to tapping
his<00:03:29.940> foot<00:03:30.239> he<00:03:31.230> needs<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.650> move<00:03:31.829> that<00:03:32.040> knee<00:03:32.220> a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
his foot he needs to move that knee a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.520 
his foot he needs to move that knee a
little<00:03:32.430> bit<00:03:32.579> side<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:32.970> side<00:03:33.150> I'll<00:03:34.109> pull<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
little bit side to side I'll pull that

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.619 
little bit side to side I'll pull that
pole<00:03:34.919> vector<00:03:35.310> over<00:03:35.609> a<00:03:35.639> little<00:03:35.849> bit<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.419> maybe

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
pole vector over a little bit or maybe

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.300 
pole vector over a little bit or maybe
up<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.049> down<00:03:37.199> and<00:03:37.409> that's<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.859> give<00:03:38.069> me

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
up and down and that's going to give me

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.149 
up and down and that's going to give me
that<00:03:38.790> control<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.569> can<00:03:40.260> pick<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:40.769> even<00:03:41.040> move

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
that control I can pick it and even move

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.879 
that control I can pick it and even move
the<00:03:41.310> pivot<00:03:41.519> out<00:03:41.930> these<00:03:42.930> are<00:03:43.109> moderately

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
the pivot out these are moderately

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.710 
the pivot out these are moderately
limited<00:03:44.370> depending<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:44.849> how<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> move<00:03:45.479> them

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
limited depending on how you move them

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.360 
limited depending on how you move them
as<00:03:45.870> most<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.560> motion<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:46.979> derived<00:03:47.250> from

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
as most of the motion is derived from

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.670 
as most of the motion is derived from
the<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.549> K<00:03:47.690> but<00:03:48.690> I'll<00:03:48.780> put<00:03:48.930> that<00:03:49.049> in<00:03:49.109> and<00:03:49.440> set<00:03:49.650> a

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
the I K but I'll put that in and set a

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.860
