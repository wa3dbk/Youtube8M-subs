00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
secret is because I think for a lot of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.020

people the larger the group you know the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.840 
people the larger the group you know the
harder<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> time<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.950> grill<00:00:44.219> at<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> time

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
you know that I felt I had to kind of

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.550 
you know that I felt I had to kind of
balance<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.720> was<00:03:48.870> since<00:03:49.080> there<00:03:49.260> are<00:03:49.440> other

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
balance it was since there are other

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.560 
balance it was since there are other
other<00:03:49.980> cooking<00:03:50.280> times<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.850> don't<00:03:51.030> want<00:03:51.330> that

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
side you know there's a lot of you know

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.860 
side you know there's a lot of you know
sides<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.670> drinks<00:04:00.210> in<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.480> milk<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.780> know

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
sides and drinks in the milk you know

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.300 
sides and drinks in the milk you know
how<00:04:00.990> do<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.170> balance<00:04:01.380> out<00:04:01.740> when<00:04:02.040> you're<00:04:02.190> doing

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
how do you balance out when you're doing

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.090 
how do you balance out when you're doing
these<00:04:02.550> large<00:04:02.880> format<00:04:03.390> items<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.950> know<00:04:05.070> I

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
these large format items you know I

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.290 
these large format items you know I
think<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.730> get<00:04:05.880> those<00:04:06.030> out<00:04:06.150> of<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.270> way

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
think it's you get those out of the way

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.480 
think it's you get those out of the way
early<00:04:06.390> yeah<00:04:07.050> most<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.620> size<00:04:07.800> something<00:04:08.310> I

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
early yeah most of the size something I

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.010 
early yeah most of the size something I
have<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.700> there<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.330> stuff<00:04:09.690> that<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.840> can

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
have in there is stuff that you can

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.600 
have in there is stuff that you can
produce<00:04:10.170> earlier<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.890> then<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.310> then<00:04:11.430> bring

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
produce earlier and then and then bring

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.850 
produce earlier and then and then bring
the<00:04:11.760> heel<00:04:11.940> on<00:04:12.060> site<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:13.290> takes<00:04:13.500> some<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.710> the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
the heel on site so it takes some of the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.780 
the heel on site so it takes some of the
steps<00:04:14.070> out<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> it

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
steps out of it

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.580 
steps out of it
it<00:04:14.910> lets<00:04:15.300> you<00:04:15.390> concentrate<00:04:15.600> on<00:04:16.080> the<00:04:16.260> big

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
it lets you concentrate on the big

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.470 
it lets you concentrate on the big
cooking<00:04:16.890> apparatus<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.940> then<00:04:18.090> something<00:04:18.420> a
