still<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> reason<00:00:59.789> it's<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.090> jumble<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420

people have had some real bad damage
once<00:02:37.639> so<00:02:37.939> hopefully<00:02:38.719> hmv<00:02:39.109> replace<00:02:39.530> them

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
once so hopefully hmv replace them

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.830 
once so hopefully hmv replace them
quickly<00:02:42.609> inside<00:02:43.609> it's<00:02:43.849> more<00:02:44.239> cheap<00:02:44.599> plastic

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.879 
quickly inside it's more cheap plastic
I'm<00:02:45.260> afraid<00:02:46.659> and<00:02:47.659> there's<00:02:47.959> no<00:02:48.169> images<00:02:48.560> inside

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.849 
I'm afraid and there's no images inside
either<00:02:49.159> and<00:02:49.849> it's<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.299> usual<00:02:50.659> discs<00:02:50.989> for

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
either and it's just the usual discs for

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:58.240 
either and it's just the usual discs for
inside<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.239> if<00:02:53.599> I<00:02:53.780> hadn't<00:02:54.079> paid<00:02:56.799> 14-pound<00:02:57.799> 40
