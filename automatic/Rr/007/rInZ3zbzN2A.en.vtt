hi<00:00:03.820> I'm<00:00:04.150> Kenny<00:00:04.450> from<00:00:04.720> mini<00:00:04.899> ball<00:00:05.109> design<00:00:05.500> and

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
hi I'm Kenny from mini ball design and

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.190 
hi I'm Kenny from mini ball design and
today<00:00:07.029> i<00:00:07.059> wanted<00:00:07.420> to<00:00:07.510> talk<00:00:07.599> a<00:00:07.779> little<00:00:07.990> bit

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
today i wanted to talk a little bit

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.760 
today i wanted to talk a little bit
about<00:00:08.410> headlamps<00:00:09.099> now<00:00:10.080> in<00:00:11.080> my<00:00:11.320> study

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
about headlamps now in my study

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.860 
about headlamps now in my study
headlamps<00:00:12.460> i<00:00:12.580> found<00:00:12.880> out<00:00:13.090> the<00:00:13.390> reason<00:00:13.600> why

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
headlamps i found out the reason why

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.330 
headlamps i found out the reason why
some<00:00:14.200> of<00:00:14.230> them<00:00:14.470> will<00:00:14.590> run<00:00:14.800> for<00:00:15.040> a<00:00:15.070> hundred

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
some of them will run for a hundred

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.220 
some of them will run for a hundred
hours<00:00:15.550> and<00:00:15.970> some<00:00:16.180> of<00:00:16.330> them<00:00:16.510> only<00:00:16.630> run<00:00:16.900> for<00:00:16.930> two

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
hours and some of them only run for two

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.359 
hours and some of them only run for two
hours<00:00:17.640> sometimes<00:00:18.640> on<00:00:18.849> the<00:00:18.970> same<00:00:19.179> battery<00:00:20.369> so

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
hours sometimes on the same battery so

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.220 
hours sometimes on the same battery so
on<00:00:21.640> let<00:00:22.150> me<00:00:22.239> give<00:00:22.390> you<00:00:22.480> a<00:00:22.539> quick<00:00:22.720> rundown<00:00:22.989> on

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
on let me give you a quick rundown on

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.749 
on let me give you a quick rundown on
that<00:00:23.589> and<00:00:23.710> then<00:00:23.800> show<00:00:24.039> you<00:00:24.099> how<00:00:24.279> i<00:00:24.310> figured

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
that and then show you how i figured

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.620 
that and then show you how i figured
things<00:00:24.970> out<00:00:25.319> the<00:00:26.319> thing<00:00:26.589> is<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:28.300> the<00:00:28.449> more

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
things out the thing is with the more

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.910 
things out the thing is with the more
expensive<00:00:28.899> ones<00:00:29.319> like<00:00:29.529> this<00:00:29.769> princeton<00:00:30.429> now

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
expensive ones like this princeton now

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.979 
expensive ones like this princeton now
aurora<00:00:32.920> they<00:00:33.850> have<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.000> circuit<00:00:34.390> board<00:00:34.540> inside

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
aurora they have a circuit board inside

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.560 
aurora they have a circuit board inside
of<00:00:35.050> them<00:00:35.350> and<00:00:35.500> that<00:00:36.100> circuit<00:00:36.609> board<00:00:36.850> turns<00:00:37.359> the

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
of them and that circuit board turns the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.630 
of them and that circuit board turns the
light<00:00:37.780> on<00:00:37.809> and<00:00:38.019> off<00:00:38.289> had<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.649> tremendous<00:00:39.340> speed

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
light on and off had a tremendous speed

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.680 
light on and off had a tremendous speed
like<00:00:39.879> 40,000<00:00:40.750> times<00:00:40.899> a<00:00:41.109> second<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:43.390> reason

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
like 40,000 times a second the reason

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.569 
like 40,000 times a second the reason
why<00:00:43.809> this<00:00:43.870> light<00:00:44.230> runs<00:00:44.500> for<00:00:44.679> over<00:00:44.829> 100<00:00:45.219> hours

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
why this light runs for over 100 hours

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.389 
why this light runs for over 100 hours
is<00:00:45.760> because<00:00:46.289> although<00:00:47.289> it<00:00:47.859> turns<00:00:48.100> it<00:00:48.280> on<00:00:48.339> and

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
is because although it turns it on and

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.579 
is because although it turns it on and
off<00:00:48.640> forty<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.269> forty<00:00:49.690> thousand<00:00:50.140> times<00:00:50.350> per

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
off forty to forty thousand times per

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.329 
off forty to forty thousand times per
second<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:52.690> off<00:00:52.929> ninety-eight<00:00:53.829> percent<00:00:53.980> of

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
second it's off ninety-eight percent of

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.729 
second it's off ninety-eight percent of
time<00:00:54.489> it's<00:00:54.760> only<00:00:54.879> on<00:00:55.269> like<00:00:56.019> two<00:00:56.260> percent<00:00:56.679> of

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
time it's only on like two percent of

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.150 
time it's only on like two percent of
the<00:00:56.829> time<00:00:57.039> and<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:58.719> say<00:00:59.260> well<00:00:59.649> that's<00:00:59.949> not

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
the time and you say well that's not

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.310 
the time and you say well that's not
going<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.370> work<00:01:00.399> very<00:01:00.519> well<00:01:00.789> well<00:01:01.210> here's<00:01:02.170> the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
going to work very well well here's the

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.399 
going to work very well well here's the
deal<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:03.579> human<00:01:03.940> eye<00:01:04.059> when<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:04.720> flash<00:01:05.080> light

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
deal the human eye when you flash light

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.950 
deal the human eye when you flash light
into<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.830> or<00:01:06.190> any<00:01:06.670> image<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.360> sees<00:01:07.630> it

for 140 thousand to the second it's an

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.360 
for 140 thousand to the second it's an

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
LED it comes on full bright 140

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.670 
LED it comes on full bright 140
thousands<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.910> second<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.600> then<00:01:23.050> turns<00:01:23.350> off

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
thousands of a second and then turns off

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.680 
thousands of a second and then turns off
for<00:01:24.660> you<00:01:25.660> know<00:01:25.810> 80<00:01:26.650> times<00:01:27.450> in<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.540> other

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
for you know 80 times in the other

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.970 
for you know 80 times in the other
direction<00:01:30.300> your<00:01:31.300> eyes<00:01:31.510> holding<00:01:31.960> at<00:01:32.140> 132<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
direction your eyes holding at 132 the

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.380 
direction your eyes holding at 132 the
second<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:33.490> when<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:33.700> comes<00:01:33.850> back<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:34.210> again

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
second so when it comes back on again

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.090 
second so when it comes back on again
your<00:01:34.930> eye<00:01:34.960> doesn't<00:01:35.260> even<00:01:35.470> know<00:01:35.620> whatever<00:01:35.860> shut

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
your eye doesn't even know whatever shut

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.150 
your eye doesn't even know whatever shut
off<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:37.060> your<00:01:37.330> eye<00:01:37.360> for<00:01:38.140> all<00:01:38.230> intent<00:01:38.620> purposes

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
off so your eye for all intent purposes

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.800 
off so your eye for all intent purposes
thinks<00:01:39.430> it's<00:01:39.550> on<00:01:39.700> all<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.030> time<00:01:40.240> doesn't<00:01:40.540> even

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
thinks it's on all the time doesn't even

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.750 
thinks it's on all the time doesn't even
see<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.110> flicker<00:01:41.410> or<00:01:41.530> anything<00:01:42.010> as<00:01:42.280> long<00:01:42.550> as

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
see a flicker or anything as long as

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.580 
see a flicker or anything as long as
it's<00:01:43.030> turning<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.450> off<00:01:43.720> more<00:01:44.020> than<00:01:44.080> 30<00:01:44.380> times

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
it's turning on off more than 30 times

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.950 
it's turning on off more than 30 times
per<00:01:44.770> second<00:01:45.370> basically<00:01:46.330> you're<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.630> thinks

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
per second basically you're I thinks

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.010 
per second basically you're I thinks
it's<00:01:47.050> on<00:01:47.290> all<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:47.770> time<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:49.210> by<00:01:49.480> spin-off

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
it's on all the time so by spin-off

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.720 
it's on all the time so by spin-off
ninety-eight<00:01:50.620> percent<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.130> time<00:01:51.310> as<00:01:51.550> near

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730 
ninety-eight percent of the time as near

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.340 
ninety-eight percent of the time as near
as<00:01:51.760> I<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.030> tell<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.480> only<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.870> a<00:01:52.900> non<00:01:53.110> two

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
as I can tell and only be a non two

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.200 
as I can tell and only be a non two
percent<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.800> time<00:01:53.920> that's<00:01:54.160> how<00:01:54.370> you<00:01:54.430> get<00:01:54.700> this

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
percent of time that's how you get this

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.790

you're<00:02:06.940> probably<00:02:07.090> ask<00:02:07.450> yourself<00:02:07.930> how<00:02:08.110> do<00:02:08.170> i

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
you're probably ask yourself how do i

you're probably ask yourself how do i
know<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.979> this<00:02:09.099> thing<00:02:09.369> turns<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:09.970> off

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
know that this thing turns on and off

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.210 
know that this thing turns on and off
that<00:02:10.360> faster<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.140> turns<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.740> off<00:02:11.860> at<00:02:12.070> all

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
that faster that turns on and off at all

maybe<00:02:12.610> I'm<00:02:12.820> just<00:02:13.000> blowing<00:02:13.330> smoke<00:02:13.450> well<00:02:14.850> yes

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
maybe I'm just blowing smoke well yes

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.590 
maybe I'm just blowing smoke well yes
how

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
how

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.470 
how
this<00:02:17.530> little<00:02:17.800> box<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.280> built<00:02:18.520> out<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.820> a<00:02:18.970> set<00:02:19.450> of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
this little box I built out of a set of

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.810 
this little box I built out of a set of
plans<00:02:20.140> that<00:02:20.440> came<00:02:20.620> off<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.310> think<00:02:21.700> you

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
plans that came off of a I think you

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.980 
plans that came off of a I think you
might<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> radioshack<00:02:22.630> book<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.860> takes<00:02:24.990> light

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
might a radioshack book it takes light

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.110 
might a radioshack book it takes light
and<00:02:26.890> turns<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.240> sound<00:02:29.040> every<00:02:30.040> time<00:02:30.120> light

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
and turns it to sound every time light

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.640 
and turns it to sound every time light
cycles<00:02:31.750> turns<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.620> off<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.930> will<00:02:35.230> click

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
cycles turns on and off this will click

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.640 
cycles turns on and off this will click
once<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.700> think<00:02:37.270> maybe<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:38.020> can<00:02:38.380> show<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
once so I think maybe I can show you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.680 
once so I think maybe I can show you
I've<00:02:38.800> got<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.160> microphone<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.180> tape<00:02:40.480> to

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
I've got the microphone on this tape to

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.350 
I've got the microphone on this tape to
the<00:02:40.720> microphone<00:02:41.350> on<00:02:41.650> my<00:02:42.280> video<00:02:42.610> camera<00:02:42.940> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the microphone on my video camera and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.530 
the microphone on my video camera and
I've<00:02:43.750> got<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:43.990> light<00:02:44.260> going<00:02:44.650> over<00:02:44.950> there<00:02:45.540> which

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
I've got a light going over there which

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.900 
I've got a light going over there which
should<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.140> running<00:02:47.350> at<00:02:47.680> 60<00:02:48.280> cycles<00:02:48.760> that

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
should be running at 60 cycles that

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.240 
should be running at 60 cycles that
means<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.330> should<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.860> completing<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.950> sine

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
means it should be completing a sine

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.390 
means it should be completing a sine
wave<00:02:51.280> every<00:02:51.970> 60<00:02:52.750> times<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.170> second<00:02:53.650> that's<00:02:54.160> what

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
wave every 60 times a second that's what

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.670 
wave every 60 times a second that's what
the<00:02:54.610> grid<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> grid<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.600> 60<00:02:56.020> Hertz<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.440> so

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
the grid is a grid is 60 Hertz and so

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.790 
the grid is a grid is 60 Hertz and so
that<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:57.130> should<00:02:57.970> generate<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.770> sound<00:02:59.770> I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
that like should generate a sound I

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.960 
that like should generate a sound I
don't<00:03:02.800> know<00:03:02.920> whether<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.250> hear<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.820> or

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
don't know whether you can hear that or

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.230 
don't know whether you can hear that or
not<00:03:04.150> on<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.980> other<00:03:06.100> hand<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.700> shine<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.150> at

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
not on the other hand if you shine it at

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.570 
not on the other hand if you shine it at
daylight<00:03:08.310> daylight's<00:03:09.310> basically<00:03:09.820> nothing

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
daylight daylight's basically nothing

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.200 
daylight daylight's basically nothing
because<00:03:12.580> it's<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.910> all<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.270> time<00:03:14.910> okay<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:15.970> let

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
because it's on all the time okay so let

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.840 
because it's on all the time okay so let
me<00:03:16.300> show<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.510> what<00:03:16.720> i'm<00:03:16.840> up<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.200> user<00:03:17.850> well

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
me show you what i'm up to user well

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.400 
me show you what i'm up to user well
first<00:03:19.180> let<00:03:19.420> me<00:03:19.450> show<00:03:19.540> you<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:22.750> way<00:03:22.990> here<00:03:23.260> this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
first let me show you this way here this

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.170 
first let me show you this way here this
is<00:03:23.590> kind<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.010> chemo<00:03:24.310> flight<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:24.850> doesn't

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
is kind of a chemo flight that doesn't

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.740 
is kind of a chemo flight that doesn't
have<00:03:25.300> any<00:03:25.480> circuit<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:25.990> it<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:28.300> if<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.540> turn

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
have any circuit in it and if you turn

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.990 
have any circuit in it and if you turn
it<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.290> hold<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.740> against<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.460> i<00:03:30.610> mean<00:03:30.850> in

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
it on and hold this against it i mean in

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.340 
it on and hold this against it i mean in
front<00:03:31.240> of<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:32.970> don't<00:03:33.970> get<00:03:34.090> anything<00:03:34.360> turn

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
front of it you don't get anything turn

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:45.030 
front of it you don't get anything turn
it<00:03:35.470> on<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.710> flash<00:03:42.060> okay<00:03:43.380> now<00:03:44.380> let's<00:03:44.410> take<00:03:44.860> this

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it on to flash okay now let's take this

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.750 
it on to flash okay now let's take this
high-tech<00:03:45.520> one<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.850> has<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> circuit

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.630 

your<00:03:50.540> mother<00:03:50.870> very<00:03:51.170> very<00:03:52.010> fast<00:03:52.489> just<00:03:53.420> think

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
your mother very very fast just think

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.430 
your mother very very fast just think
this<00:03:55.240> thing's<00:03:55.480> probably<00:03:55.600> turn<00:03:55.930> it<00:03:56.110> on<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.319> off

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
this thing's probably turn it on and off

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:07.440 
this thing's probably turn it on and off
you<00:03:57.130> know<00:03:57.220> thousands<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:57.880> times

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.550 

that's<00:04:08.450> how<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.690> know<00:04:08.930> whether<00:04:09.230> you've<00:04:09.380> got<00:04:09.530> a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
that's how you know whether you've got a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.850 
that's how you know whether you've got a
circuit<00:04:09.980> board<00:04:10.190> in<00:04:10.730> your<00:04:11.360> light<00:04:11.600> or<00:04:11.750> not<00:04:11.900> much

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
circuit board in your light or not much

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.120 
circuit board in your light or not much
easier<00:04:13.250> way<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.460> just<00:04:13.820> a<00:04:13.940> look<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.390> see<00:04:15.130> how

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
easier way is just a look and see how

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.690 
easier way is just a look and see how
long<00:04:16.370> it's<00:04:16.549> rated<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:17.350> because<00:04:18.489> if<00:04:19.489> it's

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
long it's rated for because if it's

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.540 
long it's rated for because if it's
rated<00:04:20.060> for<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.330> couple<00:04:20.780> hours<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:22.100> doesn't<00:04:22.460> have

how<00:04:37.940> they<00:04:38.090> get<00:04:38.240> lights<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.690> last<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.170> long

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
how they get lights the last so long

how they get lights the last so long
this<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.260> a<00:04:42.290> real<00:04:42.590> high-tech<00:04:42.800> one<00:04:43.280> here<00:04:43.580> but<00:04:43.850> I

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
this is a real high-tech one here but I

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.720 
this is a real high-tech one here but I
don't<00:04:45.230> think<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.560> has<00:04:45.710> any<00:04:45.920> circuit<00:04:46.400> in<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:46.670> I

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
don't think it has any circuit in and I

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.880 
don't think it has any circuit in and I
think<00:04:46.760> it's<00:04:47.120> just<00:04:47.210> all<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:48.320> time<00:04:48.560> but<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.800> has

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
think it's just all the time but it has

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.320 
think it's just all the time but it has
some<00:04:49.100> really<00:04:49.430> frugal<00:04:50.200> led<00:04:51.200> zep<00:04:52.120> now<00:04:53.120> that's

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
some really frugal led zep now that's

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.150 
some really frugal led zep now that's
all<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.540> know<00:04:53.750> about<00:04:53.900> lights<00:04:54.410> I'm<00:04:54.650> tinny<00:04:54.920> for

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
all I know about lights I'm tinny for

all I know about lights I'm tinny for
mini<00:04:55.310> both<00:04:55.520> design<00:04:55.880> have<00:04:56.480> a<00:04:56.510> great<00:04:56.810> day<00:04:57.020> and

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
mini both design have a great day and
