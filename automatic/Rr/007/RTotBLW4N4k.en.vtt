you can have the person grab onto your
Stern<00:02:15.510> with<00:02:16.050> one<00:02:16.290> hand<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.129> other<00:02:17.220> hand

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
Stern with one hand with the other hand

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.070 
Stern with one hand with the other hand
they<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.790> hold<00:02:18.060> their<00:02:18.239> boat<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.540> their<00:02:18.660> paddle

they can hold their boat in their paddle

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.720 
they can hold their boat in their paddle
and<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.739> paddle<00:02:19.950> them<00:02:20.160> over<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.489> shore

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and you can paddle them over to shore

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
and you can paddle them over to shore
and<00:02:21.000> that's<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.569> idea<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.290> way<00:02:22.410> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
and that's the idea that's the way it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.320 
and that's the idea that's the way it
works<00:02:22.739> perfectly<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.760> course<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.180> have

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
works perfectly of course if you have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.089 
works perfectly of course if you have
two<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.540> three<00:02:24.780> boats<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.140> help<00:02:25.170> out<00:02:25.500> one<00:02:25.950> other

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
two or three boats to help out one other

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.830 
two or three boats to help out one other
boat<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.610> maybe<00:02:26.760> push<00:02:27.060> their<00:02:27.269> boat<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.660> help

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
boat can maybe push their boat and help

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
boat can maybe push their boat and help
bump<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.440> shore<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.920> everything

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
bump it over to shore and everything

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.539 
bump it over to shore and everything
works<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:29.940> well<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.750> work<00:02:31.560> together<00:02:31.739> make

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
works out well so work together make

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.130 
works out well so work together make
sure<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:32.849> keep<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.180> priorities<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.780> mind

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
