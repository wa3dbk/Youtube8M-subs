00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.510
 so here I am at my workplace at 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.060
 the workshop that I opened an earthen 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.520
 so after a day of work when 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.970
 I had several coaching workshops 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.820
 etc. 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.349
 well you have to put everything away you need everything 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.450
 clean up 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.340
 and yes all we could dirty everything 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.700
 that we made and so I 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.190
 cleans everything I tidy everything before 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.770
 leave and like that tomorrow the workshop and 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.539
 hero probe set up to host 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.539
 the new participants 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.670
 cleaning and storage is 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.230
 completed and I can finally go back to the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.230
 house to relax 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.720
 once home I can finally 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.130
 start my evening routine good the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240
 rain but a little bit helped because 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.410
 you may not see when I 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.560
 came back but there was still 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.870
 a few small drops of rain so 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.960
 I will start by doing my little 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.960
 evening routine to go to bed 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:31.510
 so here I prepare my styling to your 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.570
 ready marks must be specified 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.910
 and yes they will shrink completely 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.340
 so here I spray a few lotions and 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.740
 I will prepare my hair to sleep 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.869
 for the next day 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.250
 so I'm going to put some milk 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.810
 capillary 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.300
 so when you have played really well 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.250
 very small quantities like I you 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.229
 tell it in my video about how 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.670
 reduce the quantities you saw 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.890
 a game but always a small amount 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.740
 of capillary milk I will call 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 apply that on the little part that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.810
 I did and then I went plaited 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.479
 this part so that it can and pull 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.920
 my hair and that I have more sleep very 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.140
 easily and like that the next day 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.360
 morning it's soft hair and 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.650
 are very easy to thousands ago 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.650
 no worries 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.819
 So that's about five 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.500
 minutes 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.180
 so my routine to combine audi is 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.239
 almost done since my routine 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.640
 capillary so after applying my 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.440
 milk where one falls to pau and mount them 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.860
 capillaries on my head so but I 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.720
 want well shrinks that's it with my 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.489
 big snat are ready to go to sleep 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.200
 so that's the routine I'm doing 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.920
 every night before you go before 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.260
 to go to bed 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.690
 it takes me 20 mo of three minutes to 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.030
 do that and then before I go 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.400
 bedtime i will also added a last 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.480
 accessory that I really love 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.480
 so I do not know if you know 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.200
 I do not know if you know it's 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.660
 really my favorite accessory in 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.030
 darling accessories of movement is in 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.770

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.100
 accessories to go to sleep then you 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.860
 know how galley always to find 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.840
 the right scarf the same thing compared to 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.670
 may be on his head to go to sleep and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.130
 especially the good thing that's wrong 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.600
 go out at night while we sleep so 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.860
 that I really opted for that and 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.260
 you will understand why 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.610
 I love the happiness of hats 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.130
 drake and loxley so house m so 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.640
 as you can see it's a superb 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.130
 nightcap in wax and yes it is in 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.380
 box it's really great we put that on 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.630
 his head and we're really great at 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.210
 comfortable at home but what I do not 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.180
 did not show you her the inside and 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.560
 yes I show you here is the interior 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.520
 so as you can see 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.370
 the outside being wars and the inside 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.620
 Satin is so well it makes us 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.390
 really super soft hair and for 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.250
 those who are really sensitive to 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.950
 cotton because cotton is actually going 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.900
 absorb moisture from your hair and 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.670
 a few to dry them up so if you 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.130
 are really sensitive to this phenomenon 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.720
 I really advise you to use this 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.700
 kind of accessory for sleeping 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.190
 so there you have seen a it's really 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.940
 super so there are two sides 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:43.190
 so that's the side of it all 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.050
 here and there it is the sides touax 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.330

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.390

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.740
