and we've got it up on a lift to make

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.819 
and we've got it up on a lift to make
the<00:00:44.760> job<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.149> easier

regardless of whether you've got a lift
or<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> stand<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.350> need<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
or just a stand you need to have the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
or just a stand you need to have the
bike<00:00:50.010> sitting<00:00:50.370> straight<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:51.090> we<00:00:51.930> do

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
bike sitting straight up and down we do

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.569 
bike sitting straight up and down we do
this<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> oil<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.890> primary<00:00:53.370> case

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
this so the oil in the primary case

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.430 
this so the oil in the primary case
doesn't<00:00:54.000> leak<00:00:54.180> out<00:00:54.390> after<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.110> remove<00:00:55.410> the

a 9/16 wrench and a 1/2 inch wrench for
the<00:01:13.560> adjuster<00:01:16.220> go<00:01:17.220> ahead<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.490> thread<00:01:17.670> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the adjuster go ahead and thread that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
the adjuster go ahead and thread that
nut<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> create<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.890> much

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
nut up then we want to create as much

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
nut up then we want to create as much
slack<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.580> cable<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.150> can<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
slack in the cable as we can we do that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.749 
slack in the cable as we can we do that
by<00:01:22.380> threading<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> adjuster<00:01:23.369> back<00:01:23.520> onto

by threading the adjuster back onto

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.289 
by threading the adjuster back onto
itself<00:01:26.000> as<00:01:28.159> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:29.850> cable<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
itself as you can see this cable is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.380 
itself as you can see this cable is
pretty<00:01:30.479> loose<00:01:30.689> now

when<00:01:37.970> that's<00:01:38.150> off<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.780> can<00:01:38.930> pull<00:01:39.140> that<00:01:39.170> pin

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
when that's off you can pull that pin

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.460 
when that's off you can pull that pin
and<00:01:39.740> remove<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.250> lever<00:01:40.430> from<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.790> housing
