sup guys Aron Rafi here wanted to talk

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.670 
sup guys Aron Rafi here wanted to talk
to<00:00:07.330> you<00:00:07.509> a<00:00:07.540> little<00:00:07.689> bit<00:00:07.809> about<00:00:08.049> my<00:00:08.230> board<00:00:08.530> with

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
to you a little bit about my board with

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:31.870 
to you a little bit about my board with
by<00:00:08.860> early<00:00:09.099> it's<00:00:09.369> called<00:00:09.519> the<00:00:09.610> conspiracy

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.670 

you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.320 

so<00:00:39.680> as<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:39.830> three-stage<00:00:40.310> board<00:00:40.700> which<00:00:40.970> gives<00:00:41.210> it

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
so as a three-stage board which gives it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.060 
so as a three-stage board which gives it
that<00:00:41.390> really<00:00:41.720> good<00:00:42.020> pop<00:00:42.290> off<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:42.560> wake<00:00:42.830> that

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
that really good pop off the wake that

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.590 
that really good pop off the wake that
really<00:00:43.310> hard<00:00:43.490> snap<00:00:43.850> that<00:00:44.060> you<00:00:44.120> want<00:00:44.330> to<00:00:44.420> get

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
really hard snap that you want to get

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.230 
really hard snap that you want to get
and<00:00:44.840> it's<00:00:45.800> got<00:00:45.980> sharp<00:00:46.250> edges<00:00:46.490> keeps<00:00:46.940> it<00:00:47.090> high

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
and it's got sharp edges keeps it high

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.460 
and it's got sharp edges keeps it high
on<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.480> water<00:00:47.690> which<00:00:47.900> gives<00:00:48.110> a<00:00:48.230> little<00:00:48.380> bit

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
on the water which gives a little bit

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.260 
on the water which gives a little bit
more<00:00:48.710> speed<00:00:49.010> more<00:00:49.070> like<00:00:49.430> continuous<00:00:50.060> rocker

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
more speed more like continuous rocker

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.390 
more speed more like continuous rocker
so<00:00:50.990> pretty<00:00:51.200> much<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.500> best<00:00:51.620> of<00:00:51.830> both<00:00:51.980> worlds

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
so pretty much the best of both worlds

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.700 
so pretty much the best of both worlds
the<00:00:53.150> Byerly<00:00:53.360> conspiracy<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.350> one<00:00:54.559> of<00:00:54.650> the

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
the Byerly conspiracy is one of the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.990 
the Byerly conspiracy is one of the
fastest<00:00:55.070> boards<00:00:55.340> in<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.489> market<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.850> date

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
fastest boards in the market to date

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.970 
fastest boards in the market to date
with<00:00:56.150> a<00:00:56.180> three-stage<00:00:56.630> rocker<00:00:56.980> we

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
with a three-stage rocker we

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.250 
with a three-stage rocker we

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
incorporated a really deep single

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.450 
incorporated a really deep single

it release off the wake and make it
really<00:01:31.009> forgiving<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:31.520> advanced<00:01:32.420> and

really forgiving for advanced and
beginner<00:01:32.810> riders<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.649> has<00:01:33.800> ABS<00:01:34.460> beams<00:01:34.940> that

beginner riders it has ABS beams that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.210 
beginner riders it has ABS beams that
are<00:01:35.330> built<00:01:35.630> inside<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.229> glass<00:01:36.470> so<00:01:37.070> it's

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
are built inside the glass so it's

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.859 
are built inside the glass so it's
pretty<00:01:37.369> much<00:01:37.550> grind<00:01:37.910> through<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:38.540> can<00:01:38.690> ride

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
pretty much grind through you can ride

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.180 
pretty much grind through you can ride
this<00:01:38.990> thing<00:01:39.050> on<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.380> rail<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.830> turn<00:01:39.979> blue

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
this thing on the rail so you turn blue

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.130 
this thing on the rail so you turn blue
in<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.399> face<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.880> not<00:01:41.450> wear<00:01:41.660> into<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.960> foam

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
in the face and not wear into the foam

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.990 
in the face and not wear into the foam
like<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.440> do<00:01:42.530> well<00:01:42.649> with<00:01:42.800> other<00:01:42.920> boards<00:01:43.280> also

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
like you do well with other boards also

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.450 
like you do well with other boards also
with<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.390> conspiracy<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.500> has<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.039> glass

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
with a conspiracy it has the glass

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.010 
with a conspiracy it has the glass
sidewall<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.179> wraps<00:01:47.360> around<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.690> perimeter

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
of this board the glass reinforcement

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.120 
of this board the glass reinforcement
makes<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:50.450> twice<00:01:50.690> as<00:01:50.750> strong<00:01:51.140> also<00:01:51.800> makes<00:01:51.979> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
makes it twice as strong also makes it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.430 
makes it twice as strong also makes it
way<00:01:52.310> snappy<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.060> responsive<00:01:53.090> off<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.259> wake

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
way snappy and responsive off the wake

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.040 
way snappy and responsive off the wake
with<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> glass<00:01:55.550> sidewall<00:01:56.090> when<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.840> board

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
with a glass sidewall when the board

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.859 
with a glass sidewall when the board
flexes<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.130> goes<00:01:58.369> ahead<00:01:58.550> in<00:01:58.910> rebounds<00:01:59.539> back<00:01:59.720> to

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
flexes it goes ahead in rebounds back to

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.749 
flexes it goes ahead in rebounds back to
its<00:01:59.990> current<00:02:00.140> shape<00:02:00.319> way<00:02:00.649> faster<00:02:01.160> which<00:02:01.520> gives

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
its current shape way faster which gives

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.400

throughout<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.229> whole<00:02:06.380> board<00:02:06.709> keeps<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.550> wide

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
throughout the whole board keeps it wide

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.340 
throughout the whole board keeps it wide
in<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:07.970> nose<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.300> tail<00:02:08.450> but<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:08.840> cut<00:02:09.080> really

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
deck platform on this board what this

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.220 
deck platform on this board what this
does<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.939> really<00:03:00.239> strengthens<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.049> deck

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
does it really strengthens the deck

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.530 
does it really strengthens the deck
platform<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.950> stiffens<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.519> so<00:03:03.060> your<00:03:03.209> flex

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
platform and stiffens it so your flex

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.940 
platform and stiffens it so your flex
really<00:03:03.900> happens<00:03:04.230> out<00:03:04.349> in<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.500> tip<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.799> tail

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
really happens out in the tip and tail

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.830 
really happens out in the tip and tail
where<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.250> need<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.459> but<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.299> keeps<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.659> deck

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
where you need it but it keeps the deck

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.959 
where you need it but it keeps the deck
platform<00:03:07.319> real<00:03:07.560> stiff<00:03:07.920> keeps<00:03:08.609> it<00:03:08.760> real

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:08.969 
platform real stiff keeps it real

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.089 
platform real stiff keeps it real
consistent<00:03:09.659> and<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.200> keeps<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:10.590> from<00:03:10.769> having<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
consistent and it keeps it from having a

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.399 
consistent and it keeps it from having a
lot<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> torsional<00:03:11.730> twist<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.209> flex<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:13.260> got

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
lot of torsional twist and flex it's got

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.110 
lot of torsional twist and flex it's got
a<00:03:13.439> really<00:03:13.680> thin<00:03:13.950> nose<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.400> tail<00:03:14.519> which<00:03:14.819> not

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
a really thin nose and tail which not

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.970 
a really thin nose and tail which not
only<00:03:15.150> make<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.659> flex<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.079> lot<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.409> it<00:03:16.560> reduces<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
only make it flex a lot but it reduces a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.110 
only make it flex a lot but it reduces a
lot<00:03:17.189> of<00:03:17.310> swing<00:03:17.549> weight<00:03:17.700> when<00:03:17.879> you're<00:03:17.970> trying

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
lot of swing weight when you're trying

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.849 
lot of swing weight when you're trying
to<00:03:18.269> throw<00:03:18.450> those<00:03:18.599> hard<00:03:18.840> tricks<00:03:19.139> like<00:03:19.290> 9s<00:03:19.769> and

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
to throw those hard tricks like 9s and

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.550 
to throw those hard tricks like 9s and
10s<00:03:20.389> so<00:03:21.389> I<00:03:21.450> designed<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.840> whole<00:03:22.049> new<00:03:22.200> graphic

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
10s so I designed a whole new graphic

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.319 
10s so I designed a whole new graphic
for<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> conspiracy<00:03:23.040> this<00:03:23.489> year<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:24.209> had<00:03:24.299> a

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
for the conspiracy this year we had a

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.149 
for the conspiracy this year we had a
little<00:03:24.629> bit<00:03:24.780> more<00:03:24.900> color<00:03:25.169> it's<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> really

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
little bit more color it's a really

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.879 
little bit more color it's a really
funky<00:03:26.579> cool<00:03:26.790> new<00:03:27.060> look<00:03:27.329> and<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:28.109> really<00:03:28.769> like

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
funky cool new look and I really like

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.050
