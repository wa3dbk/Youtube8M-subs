00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
i'm pretty sure that you know what's

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:20.350 
i'm pretty sure that you know what's
intervene<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.300> is<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.510> size<00:05:12.870> comparison

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.800 

there<00:05:21.980> so<00:05:22.980> really<00:05:24.140> there's<00:05:25.140> no<00:05:25.320> competition

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
there so really there's no competition

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:34.190 
there so really there's no competition
it's<00:05:30.770> well<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:32.370> is<00:05:32.640> actually<00:05:32.910> a<00:05:33.479> little<00:05:33.750> bit

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
it's well it is actually a little bit

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:42.409 
it's well it is actually a little bit
wider<00:05:34.860> than<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:36.270> ipad<00:05:37.100> rip<00:05:38.100> fries<00:05:39.740> but<00:05:41.419> the

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
wider than the ipad rip fries but the

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:49.340 
wider than the ipad rip fries but the
ipad<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.380> definitely<00:05:44.010> longer<00:05:47.690> as<00:05:48.690> for<00:05:49.260> the

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
ipad is definitely longer as for the

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.140 
ipad is definitely longer as for the
screen<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:52.160> it's<00:05:53.160> gone<00:05:53.400> along<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.820> screen

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
screen and it's gone along the screen

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.779 
screen and it's gone along the screen
like<00:05:54.479> rip<00:05:54.840> for<00:05:55.140> ice<00:05:55.260> cream<00:05:56.120> but<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.570> way<00:05:58.789> your

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
like rip for ice cream but that way your

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.840 
like rip for ice cream but that way your
ipad<00:06:00.150> wins<00:06:00.830> so<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:02.010> ipad<00:06:02.370> actually<00:06:02.700> has<00:06:02.820> a

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
ipad wins so the ipad actually has a

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.900 
ipad wins so the ipad actually has a
bigger<00:06:03.120> screen<00:06:03.240> obviously<00:06:04.110> like<00:06:04.320> tallest<00:06:04.910> and

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
bigger screen obviously like tallest and

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.810 
bigger screen obviously like tallest and
and<00:06:06.390> like<00:06:06.840> holding<00:06:07.229> it<00:06:07.289> up<00:06:07.500> yeah<00:06:09.080> we<00:06:10.080> can<00:06:10.289> see

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.090 

that<00:06:15.860> and<00:06:16.860> i<00:06:17.430> don't<00:06:17.789> know<00:06:18.570> i<00:06:18.600> pad<00:06:19.410> might<00:06:19.800> be<00:06:20.070> a

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
that and i don't know i pad might be a

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.640 
that and i don't know i pad might be a
little<00:06:20.220> bit<00:06:20.400> slimmer<00:06:20.789> but<00:06:21.210> i'm<00:06:22.169> not<00:06:22.350> sure<00:06:22.410> this

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
little bit slimmer but i'm not sure this

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.800 
little bit slimmer but i'm not sure this
is<00:06:22.800> actually<00:06:23.220> the<00:06:23.340> ipad<00:06:23.700> to<00:06:24.030> the<00:06:24.240> ipad<00:06:24.600> 2

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
is actually the ipad to the ipad 2

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.390 
is actually the ipad to the ipad 2
slimmed<00:06:25.200> in<00:06:25.380> the<00:06:25.500> ipad<00:06:25.890> 1<00:06:26.220> is<00:06:26.940> less<00:06:27.210> bulky<00:06:27.720> so

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
slimmed in the ipad 1 is less bulky so

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.130 
slimmed in the ipad 1 is less bulky so
yes<00:06:29.400> has<00:06:29.910> actually<00:06:30.270> got<00:06:30.450> the<00:06:30.539> cover<00:06:30.750> on<00:06:30.960> your

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
yes has actually got the cover on your

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.050 
yes has actually got the cover on your
ipad<00:06:31.470> tues<00:06:31.770> but<00:06:31.800> i<00:06:32.160> still<00:06:32.490> think<00:06:32.550> is<00:06:32.910> a<00:06:32.940> little

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
ipad tues but i still think is a little

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.650 
ipad tues but i still think is a little
bit<00:06:33.419> slimmer<00:06:33.750> and<00:06:34.550> so<00:06:35.550> the<00:06:35.669> ipad<00:06:36.030> 2<00:06:36.270> would<00:06:36.479> be<00:06:36.510> a

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
bit slimmer and so the ipad 2 would be a

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.610 
bit slimmer and so the ipad 2 would be a
little<00:06:36.810> bit<00:06:36.960> thinner<00:06:37.289> than<00:06:37.740> this<00:06:37.979> and<00:06:39.380> so<00:06:40.380> yeah

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
little bit thinner than this and so yeah

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.969 
little bit thinner than this and so yeah
I<00:06:40.830> think<00:06:42.140> that<00:06:43.140> would<00:06:43.289> be<00:06:43.530> it<00:06:43.800> um<00:06:45.500> so<00:06:46.500> yeah<00:06:46.770> that

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
I think that would be it um so yeah that

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:49.140 
I think that would be it um so yeah that
