00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.370
 how about friends from the north when the session begins now director of 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.269
 Murmansk Institute despite these astronomical 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.369
 and today we are going to prepare a delicious recipe for tarpaulins 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.350
 The first step we are going to make is to place sheets on the table to 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.859
 form a volcano since we have full on the table we are going to add 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.169
 the sugar 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.339
 together with the yeast 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:30.960
 let's mix the sugar very well with the yeast and flour 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.129
 and we are going to form a body the center of the sand to make a volcano I know that 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.010
 we have water with the center we are going to generate our liquid that in this 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.640
 case to make the bands 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.300
 it's going to be milk 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.180
 since we have the milk will incorporate in this mixture 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.680
 Of flour 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.920
 sugar and the horseshoe 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.489
 let's deny that also 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.640
 the egg 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.460
 let's mix very well until we have 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.640
 an apple laughs 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.790
 and soft 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.290
 let's read it added 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.030
 A bar 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.330
 of butter without salt 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.790
 Iu in Navarre of wonder without salt 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.880
 let's continue to knead 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 until we incorporate all of the fat a day we have an apple 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.920
 Ibiza and Saturdays 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
 then we are going to add also launch 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.630
 in lakes add 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.410
 the baking powder 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.100
 the mass is ready 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.980
 to place it in humboldt and ferments 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.030
 To ferment our dough we put a little oil in a bowl 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.570
 we greased very well 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.540
 all the bottom of the boom 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.660
 we place our dough 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.820
 We were going to grease the surface of the dough with a little vegetable oil 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.470
 then we have to cover 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.130
 our president 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.330
 share the climax 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.180
 to let it rest afterwards 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.380
 for 40 minutes today until the second one arrived 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.600
 since in that apple you have to encourage it and the allied volume spoken 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.730
 we remove the plastic 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.730
 in flour mons the surface of the table 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.319
 i'm going to put the fine over fermented on the table 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.859
 in this step what follows is to strike the apple and this to remove from the air that 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.980
 have produced at the moment of being mental we are going to fold all the matches towards 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.039
 center 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.739
 we doubled in four 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.259
 and then we turn our more 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.279
 and we started to spread the most 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.449
 We are going to extend the dough forming a rectangle and every time we extend 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:43.399
 We went to add that in addition to 90 degrees to be able to form 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.899
 a rectangle 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:50.419
 this is a donut cutter we are going to use it to cut the dough 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.659
 and in this way 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:53.829
 obtain 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:58.290
 the demands our hands cut we are going to place one on a tray 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.989
 with waxed paper 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.259
 and we will let it rest 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:07.179
 for about 20 minutes to ferment a little more and increase 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:08.000
 its volume 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.010
 since they have increased their volume the dance 3 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:16.609
 Perez and Ireland we also heat a liter of vegetable oil in a pot 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.079
 which is at 180 degrees centigrade 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.749
 let's dip the donuts 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.729
 in the hot oil 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.879
 little by little you will go knowing are the masses 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.959
 and we're going to wait until the area turns golden and they have 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.879
 taken by golden dollar 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.720
 on the side on which side is not submerged we will boycott the plot 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.699
 where it is completely browned on the other side 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:44.699
 since we have here the one titled 'of the ornate fries the turn that both and 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.079
 we started frying by the psoe other side 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.629
 since it is endorsed by both sides 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.829
 we go with a skimmer accept the standard 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.059
 we drain the excess oil 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.529
 and we put it on a tray 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:02.739
 share the absorbent so that the excess oil is absorbed 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.970
 Pastrana more word games with different 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.989
 statements like for example 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.669
 of the Castilian and Milangela ceiling colarte sugar glas 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.430
 white sugar between the present colors and well, yesterday 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.709
 we go to glaciers these areas with chocolate 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.180
 when I took out some areas of the oil and they are still warm we are going to 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.809
 lie one half 

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.139
 from the side of nadal 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.029
 in molten chocolate 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.509
 and so this morning 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.650
 veterans our bands 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.870
 Do not forget to visit good table north point cobra to share with you 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.430
