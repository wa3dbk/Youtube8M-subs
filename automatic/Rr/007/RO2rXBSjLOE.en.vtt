00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
large crowns it's a bit of a heavy watch

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.780 
large crowns it's a bit of a heavy watch
about<00:01:09.520> 140<00:01:10.150> grams<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.650> because<00:01:12.040> it's<00:01:12.520> got

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
about 140 grams but because it's got

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.660 
about 140 grams but because it's got
such<00:01:13.180> solid<00:01:13.890> accessories<00:01:14.890> on<00:01:15.040> its<00:01:15.159> strap<00:01:15.460> and

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
such solid accessories on its strap and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.670 
such solid accessories on its strap and
deployment<00:01:16.060> clasp<00:01:16.270> it's<00:01:16.750> balanced<00:01:17.229> nice<00:01:17.470> and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
deployment clasp it's balanced nice and

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.219 
deployment clasp it's balanced nice and
well<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.400> case<00:01:19.090> thickness<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.750> nice<00:01:19.960> too

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
well and the case thickness is nice too

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.350 
well and the case thickness is nice too
because<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.520> it's<00:01:21.700> going<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.850> be<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.120> heavy

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
because if it's going to be that heavy

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.690 
because if it's going to be that heavy
it<00:01:22.750> should<00:01:22.990> at<00:01:23.080> least<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:24.280> some<00:01:24.490> substance

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
it should at least have some substance

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.490 
it should at least have some substance
to<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.120> so<00:01:25.330> that's<00:01:25.510> that<00:01:26.080> worked<00:01:26.290> out<00:01:26.440> really

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
watch and I know it's seems a little bit

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.119 
watch and I know it's seems a little bit
weird<00:02:11.290> that<00:02:11.470> this<00:02:11.560> would<00:02:11.739> be<00:02:11.769> one<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.040> my

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
weird that this would be one of my

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.530 
weird that this would be one of my
favorite<00:02:12.400> features<00:02:12.519> but<00:02:12.879> is<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.239> fact<00:02:13.450> that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
favorite features but is the fact that

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.479

which<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.540> know<00:02:16.629> isn't<00:02:16.810> just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
which you know isn't just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.530 
which you know isn't just
a<00:02:18.100> Christopher<00:02:19.100> Ward<00:02:19.280> feature<00:02:19.490> but<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:20.300> just

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
a Christopher Ward feature but it's just

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.420 
a Christopher Ward feature but it's just
nice<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.720> have<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.140> watch<00:02:21.320> like<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.010> all

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
nice to have on a watch like this so all

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.770 
nice to have on a watch like this so all
you<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.210> there's<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.570> little

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
you have to do is there's this little

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.400 
you have to do is there's this little
switch<00:02:24.200> right<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.740> let<00:02:25.010> me<00:02:25.070> zoom<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.090> it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.680 

so<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.950> take<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.430> switch<00:02:32.090> right<00:02:32.300> here<00:02:32.480> and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
so you take this switch right here and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.740 
so you take this switch right here and
pull<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.930> back<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:35.180> band<00:02:35.360> comes<00:02:35.540> right

you<00:03:26.930> know<00:03:27.020> it's<00:03:27.170> small<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.710> thought<00:03:27.860> I

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
you know it's small and I thought I

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.170 
you know it's small and I thought I
wouldn't<00:03:28.190> like<00:03:28.370> that<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.580> thought<00:03:28.790> I'd<00:03:28.940> want<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
wouldn't like that I thought I'd want to

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.760 
wouldn't like that I thought I'd want to
see<00:03:29.300> the<00:03:29.390> whole<00:03:29.480> movement<00:03:29.720> but<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.620> really

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
see the whole movement but it really

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.110 
see the whole movement but it really
breaks<00:03:30.980> from<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.310> norm<00:03:31.490> from<00:03:31.700> seeing<00:03:32.000> a

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
breaks from the norm from seeing a

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.220 
breaks from the norm from seeing a
larger<00:03:32.860> full<00:03:33.860> viewing<00:03:34.600> case<00:03:35.600> back<00:03:35.870> which<00:03:36.080> is

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
larger full viewing case back which is

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:37.510 
larger full viewing case back which is
kind<00:03:36.470> of<00:03:36.500> cool<00:03:36.560> because<00:03:36.800> it's<00:03:37.130> kind<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.310> like<00:03:37.460> a

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
kind of cool because it's kind of like a

kind of cool because it's kind of like a
little<00:03:37.760> peek<00:03:37.970> into<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.270> movement<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:38.900> can

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
little peek into the movement you can

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.840 
little peek into the movement you can
see<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.260> moving<00:03:39.290> right<00:03:39.650> there<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.130> then

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
see it moving right there and then

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.820 
see it moving right there and then
allows<00:03:41.420> this<00:03:41.630> designed<00:03:42.110> to<00:03:42.260> be<00:03:42.410> on<00:03:42.500> here<00:03:42.680> of

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
allows this designed to be on here of

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.310 
allows this designed to be on here of
the<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.430> a<00:03:43.580> wing<00:03:43.790> from<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.420> up<00:03:44.720> from<00:03:45.020> a<00:03:45.110> plane

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
the of a wing from it up from a plane

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.870 
the of a wing from it up from a plane
and<00:03:45.500> it's<00:03:45.860> also<00:03:46.010> got<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.280> serial<00:03:46.580> number<00:03:46.820> on

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
and it's also got the serial number on

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.230 
and it's also got the serial number on
here<00:03:47.060> as<00:03:47.150> well<00:03:47.180> so<00:03:47.720> overall<00:03:48.730> this<00:03:49.730> watch<00:03:50.000> is

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
here as well so overall this watch is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.490 
here as well so overall this watch is
something<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.600> will<00:03:50.750> definitely<00:03:50.780> be<00:03:51.350> keeping
