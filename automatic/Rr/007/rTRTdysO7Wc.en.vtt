00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.870 

the<00:00:14.580> simplest<00:00:15.240> portion<00:00:15.840> sensing<00:00:16.880> lighting

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the simplest portion sensing lighting

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.290 
the simplest portion sensing lighting
setup<00:00:18.450> that<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.110> can<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:20.090> finally<00:00:21.090> had<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
setup that you can make I finally had to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.030 
setup that you can make I finally had to
take<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.230> solar<00:00:23.070> light<00:00:23.550> apart<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:25.040> the

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
take this solar light apart because the

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.839 
take this solar light apart because the
NC<00:00:26.790> battery<00:00:27.720> pack<00:00:28.220> doesn't<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.520> charge

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
NC battery pack doesn't have a charge

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.370 
NC battery pack doesn't have a charge
anymore<00:00:30.559> so<00:00:31.559> what<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> got<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
anymore so what I got out of it is a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:41.959 
anymore so what I got out of it is a
motion<00:00:34.380> sensor<00:00:35.090> unit<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:40.250> with<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.700> can

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
motion sensor unit and with that you can

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.930 
motion sensor unit and with that you can
make<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> simple<00:00:43.010> motion<00:00:44.010> sensing<00:00:44.610> light<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
make a simple motion sensing light and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.110 
make a simple motion sensing light and

and a negative there are three leads

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.039 
and a negative there are three leads
coming<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.640> from<00:01:14.820> motion<00:01:15.180> sensor<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.930> is

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
coming out from motion sensor one is

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.149 
coming out from motion sensor one is
positive<00:01:16.259> negative<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.539> you<00:01:18.539> have<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
positive negative and you have the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.539 
positive negative and you have the
output<00:01:20.819> the<00:01:21.810> output<00:01:22.139> actually<00:01:24.079> outputs<00:01:25.079> about

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
output the output actually outputs about

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.249 
output the output actually outputs about
3.3<00:01:26.549> volt<00:01:27.289> you<00:01:28.289> can<00:01:28.499> actually<00:01:29.389> lit<00:01:30.389> up<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.719> small

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
3.3 volt you can actually lit up a small

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.539 
3.3 volt you can actually lit up a small
LED<00:01:31.759> maybe<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.909> red<00:01:33.240> LED<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:34.770> gives<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.219> about

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
LED maybe a red LED it gives out about

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.719 
LED maybe a red LED it gives out about
10<00:01:35.999> MA<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.929> can<00:01:37.289> actually<00:01:39.709> SS<00:01:40.709> use<00:01:41.159> this

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
10 MA so you can actually SS use this

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.289 
10 MA so you can actually SS use this
pot<00:01:42.499> this<00:01:43.499> this<00:01:44.369> part<00:01:44.639> of<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> circuit<00:01:45.270> to

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
pot this this part of the circuit to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.580 
pot this this part of the circuit to
light<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.709> small<00:01:47.279> LED<00:01:47.929> but<00:01:48.929> if<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.319> run

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
light up in a small LED but if you run

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.660 
light up in a small LED but if you run
if<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.369> want<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.729> run<00:01:50.939> something<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.630> little

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
if you want to run something a little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
if you want to run something a little
brighter<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.049> add<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.950> small<00:01:56.899> transistor

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
brighter you can add a small transistor

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.639 
brighter you can add a small transistor
like<00:01:58.880> bc547c<00:02:01.039> add<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.069> 1k<00:02:02.609> ohm<00:02:03.469> resistor<00:02:04.469> here

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
like bc547c add a 1k ohm resistor here

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.080 
like bc547c add a 1k ohm resistor here
to<00:02:04.889> the<00:02:05.009> base<00:02:05.249> and<00:02:07.250> then<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.610> add<00:02:08.819> your

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
to the base and then you can add your

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:17.680 
to the base and then you can add your
LED<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> collector<00:02:14.310> Tsai<00:02:14.550> and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.770 

depending<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:20.130> voltage<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.760> use<00:02:21.270> if

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
depending on the voltage you use if

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.619 
depending on the voltage you use if
you're<00:02:22.079> using<00:02:22.290> five<00:02:22.650> volt<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.629> probably

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
you're using five volt you probably

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.140 
you're using five volt you probably
should<00:02:24.900> put<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.110> small<00:02:26.040> resistor<00:02:26.640> here<00:02:26.879> maybe

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
should put a small resistor here maybe

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.920 
should put a small resistor here maybe
like<00:02:27.450> a

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
like a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
like a
hundred<00:02:28.109> ohm<00:02:28.290> resistor<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:30.170> then<00:02:32.090> your

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
hundred ohm resistor and then your

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.280 
hundred ohm resistor and then your
emitter<00:02:33.659> is<00:02:33.930> connected<00:02:34.109> to<00:02:34.650> ground<00:02:34.859> and<00:02:36.290> you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
emitter is connected to ground and you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.899 
emitter is connected to ground and you
can<00:02:37.319> use<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.879> five<00:02:38.879> volt<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.989> 12<00:02:40.409> volt<00:02:40.909> battery

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
can use a five volt to 12 volt battery

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:45.679 
can use a five volt to 12 volt battery
power<00:02:42.450> supply<00:02:42.950> if<00:02:43.950> you're<00:02:44.430> using<00:02:44.639> pop<00:02:45.150> Bible

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
power supply if you're using pop Bible

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.720 
power supply if you're using pop Bible
then<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.230> resistor<00:02:46.799> would<00:02:46.950> be<00:02:47.129> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.430> certain

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
then the resistor would be of a certain

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.020 
then the resistor would be of a certain
value<00:02:47.939> if<00:02:48.359> using<00:02:48.840> 12<00:02:49.170> volt<00:02:49.439> then<00:02:50.030> your

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
value if using 12 volt then your

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.770 
value if using 12 volt then your
resistor<00:02:51.689> will<00:02:52.290> have<00:02:52.439> to<00:02:52.590> change<00:02:52.859> or<00:02:53.219> you<00:02:53.400> can

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
resistor will have to change or you can

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.750 
resistor will have to change or you can
connect<00:02:54.780> more<00:02:55.170> LEDs<00:02:55.439> in<00:02:56.040> series<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.849> think

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
connect more LEDs in series I think

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.470 
connect more LEDs in series I think
anyway<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:02.549> would<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:02.939> the<00:03:03.090> setup<00:03:03.859> very

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
anyway this would be the setup very

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.679 
anyway this would be the setup very
simple<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:07.010> have<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.189> connected<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:09.659> a

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
simple I have it connected to a

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.559 
simple I have it connected to a
breadboard<00:03:10.470> here<00:03:11.959> let<00:03:12.959> me<00:03:13.079> turn<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:14.569> this

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
breadboard here let me turn it on this

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:23.559 
breadboard here let me turn it on this
is<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:16.159> DC<00:03:17.450> 547<00:03:18.450> m<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:21.510> base<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:22.109> connected<00:03:22.590> to

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
is the DC 547 m the base is connected to

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:31.220 
is the DC 547 m the base is connected to
the<00:03:24.569> 1k<00:03:24.959> resistor<00:03:25.680> here<00:03:27.439> right<00:03:28.439> and<00:03:28.739> then<00:03:30.230> this

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the 1k resistor here right and then this

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.000 
the 1k resistor here right and then this
is<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.680> output<00:03:31.859> from<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> motion<00:03:33.269> sensor<00:03:33.750> and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
is the output from the motion sensor and

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.309 
is the output from the motion sensor and
then<00:03:35.010> you<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.780> positive<00:03:37.639> coming<00:03:38.639> out<00:03:38.790> I

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
then you have the positive coming out I

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.920 
then you have the positive coming out I
connected<00:03:40.319> to<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.040> positive<00:03:41.699> and<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
connected to the positive and the

connected it to the negative of the
breadboard<00:03:47.479> and<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.699> lens<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.970> lens

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
breadboard and this is the lens the lens

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.770 
breadboard and this is the lens the lens
controls<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.750> angle<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.949> detection<00:03:59.780> and

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
controls the angle of the detection and

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.729 
controls the angle of the detection and
also<00:04:01.439> the<00:04:01.859> distance<00:04:03.109> this<00:04:04.109> will<00:04:04.349> work<00:04:04.560> without

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
also the distance this will work without

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.800 
also the distance this will work without
the<00:04:05.069> lens<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:05.669> I'm<00:04:05.819> not<00:04:06.030> sure<00:04:06.269> what<00:04:06.449> would<00:04:06.659> be

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
the lens but I'm not sure what would be

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.039 
the lens but I'm not sure what would be
the<00:04:06.930> range<00:04:07.549> there<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.909> a<00:04:09.889> potentiometer<00:04:10.889> okay

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
the range there is a potentiometer okay

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.319 
the range there is a potentiometer okay
this<00:04:13.049> is<00:04:13.259> the<00:04:13.439> potentiometer<00:04:14.189> you<00:04:14.609> can<00:04:14.909> adjust

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
this is the potentiometer you can adjust

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.159 
this is the potentiometer you can adjust
the<00:04:16.320> duration<00:04:16.739> of<00:04:17.459> how<00:04:17.759> long<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.389> LED<00:04:18.959> would

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
the duration of how long that LED would

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.589 
the duration of how long that LED would
stay<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:21.479> think<00:04:21.720> they<00:04:21.959> are<00:04:23.090> let<00:04:24.090> me<00:04:24.270> see

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
stay on and I think they are let me see

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.310 
stay on and I think they are let me see
here<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:26.210> think<00:04:27.210> there's<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.479> connection<00:04:27.780> here

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
here I think there's a connection here

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.510 
here I think there's a connection here
for<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.979> thought<00:04:29.669> knock<00:04:30.539> sensor<00:04:31.320> I<00:04:31.650> think<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
for a thought knock sensor I think the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.459 
for a thought knock sensor I think the
connection<00:04:32.789> is<00:04:33.120> right<00:04:33.389> over<00:04:33.570> here

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.490 

connection<00:04:37.469> to<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.620> tack<00:04:37.889> sensor<00:04:38.430> so

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
connection to a tack sensor so

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.000 
connection to a tack sensor so
so<00:04:39.790> if<00:04:40.790> you<00:04:41.090> have<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.900> talk<00:04:42.200> sensor<00:04:42.680> this

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
so if you have a talk sensor this

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.090 
so if you have a talk sensor this
winning<00:04:43.340> light<00:04:43.960> when<00:04:44.960> lit<00:04:45.260> up<00:04:45.380> in<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.590> daytime

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
winning light when lit up in the daytime

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.340 
winning light when lit up in the daytime
only<00:04:48.310> at<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.460> night<00:04:49.670> at<00:04:50.210> night<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:50.780> when<00:04:51.320> you

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
only at the night at night and when you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.990 
only at the night at night and when you
move<00:04:51.710> in<00:04:52.040> front<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:55.660> so<00:04:56.660> that's<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:58.000> the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
move in front of it so that's it the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.530 
move in front of it so that's it the
three<00:04:59.360> wires<00:04:59.750> connected<00:05:00.710> to<00:05:00.950> the<00:05:01.300> sensor<00:05:02.300> is

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
three wires connected to the sensor is

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.520 
three wires connected to the sensor is
as<00:05:02.900> I<00:05:03.200> said<00:05:03.410> before<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:05.600> red<00:05:05.810> would<00:05:06.050> be<00:05:06.200> the

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
as I said before the red would be the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.220 
as I said before the red would be the
positive<00:05:07.100> and<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.700> have<00:05:07.850> black<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.600> negative

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
positive and you have black a negative

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.500 
positive and you have black a negative
and<00:05:09.440> then<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.280> third<00:05:10.520> connection<00:05:10.880> is<00:05:11.360> the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
and then the third connection is the

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.820 
and then the third connection is the
output<00:05:12.050> the<00:05:13.040> output<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:16.000> 3.3<00:05:17.000> volt<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.830> about

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
output the output is 3.3 volt and about

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.920 
output the output is 3.3 volt and about
10<00:05:19.100> ma<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.820> like<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.210> said<00:05:20.270> before<00:05:20.419> you<00:05:20.900> can

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
10 ma and like I said before you can

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.310 
10 ma and like I said before you can
actually<00:05:21.440> use<00:05:21.650> the<00:05:21.919> output<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:24.070> power<00:05:25.070> an<00:05:25.520> LED

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
actually use the output to power an LED

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.270 
actually use the output to power an LED
but<00:05:27.730> if<00:05:28.730> you<00:05:29.080> want<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.200> have<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.380> brighter<00:05:30.710> LED

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
but if you want to have a brighter LED

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.900 
but if you want to have a brighter LED
you<00:05:31.790> can<00:05:31.820> connect<00:05:32.570> three<00:05:32.900> or<00:05:33.550> probably<00:05:34.550> four

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
you can connect three or probably four

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.440 
you can connect three or probably four

I<00:06:08.330> was<00:06:09.020> just<00:06:09.260> playing<00:06:09.500> around<00:06:09.830> so<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.130> just

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
I was just playing around so I just

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.630 
I was just playing around so I just
connected<00:06:11.000> the<00:06:11.240> output<00:06:12.080> to<00:06:13.010> the<00:06:13.190> transistor

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
connected the output to the transistor

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.560 
connected the output to the transistor
and<00:06:14.030> then<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:15.020> transistor<00:06:15.550> turns<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.940> led

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
and then the transistor turns the led

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.260 
and then the transistor turns the led
this<00:06:18.320> is<00:06:18.530> a<00:06:18.560> white<00:06:18.860> LED<00:06:19.070> turns<00:06:19.640> it<00:06:19.760> on<00:06:19.880> and<00:06:20.180> off

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
this is a white LED turns it on and off

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.690 
this is a white LED turns it on and off
there<00:06:21.110> is<00:06:21.260> no<00:06:21.290> adjustment<00:06:22.160> for<00:06:22.550> the

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
there is no adjustment for the

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:31.920 
there is no adjustment for the
sensitivity<00:06:23.660> of<00:06:24.130> the<00:06:25.130> movement<00:06:25.700> so<00:06:29.620> that's<00:06:30.620> it

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
sensitivity of the movement so that's it

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.140 
sensitivity of the movement so that's it
put<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:33.080> lens<00:06:33.710> cap<00:06:34.100> here<00:06:36.430> this<00:06:37.430> actually<00:06:37.970> is

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
put the lens cap here this actually is

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.140 
put the lens cap here this actually is
the<00:06:38.180> sense<00:06:38.570> in<00:06:38.810> here

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150

the sense in here
and<00:06:41.330> this<00:06:42.260> is<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:42.620> port<00:06:42.950> that<00:06:43.700> I<00:06:43.730> took<00:06:43.850> out

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
and this is the port that I took out

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:52.620 
and this is the port that I took out
from<00:06:44.570> this<00:06:45.230> unit<00:06:45.740> here

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630
