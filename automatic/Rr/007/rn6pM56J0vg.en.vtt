going to talk to you about animal based
indicators<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.210> very<00:00:18.720> specific<00:00:18.930> aspect<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.680> our

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
indicators a very specific aspect of our

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.330 
indicators a very specific aspect of our
work<00:00:20.100> related<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.240> animal<00:00:21.930> welfare<00:00:22.340> but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
work related to animal welfare but

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.759 
work related to animal welfare but
before<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> do<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:24.359> just<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.289> briefly

fact<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.770> answer<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.399> question<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
fact the answer to this question is

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.380 
fact the answer to this question is
quite<00:00:36.450> simple<00:00:36.899> we<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.910> safety<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
quite simple we know that the safety of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
quite simple we know that the safety of
our<00:00:39.510> food<00:00:39.750> chain<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.469> be<00:00:40.500> indirectly

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
our food chain can be indirectly

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.060 
our food chain can be indirectly
affected<00:00:42.059> by<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.480> welfare<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> animals<00:00:43.230> this

affected by the welfare of animals this

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.029 
affected by the welfare of animals this
is<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.579> stress<00:00:45.410> injuries<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> poor

welfare all together can lead to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.160 
welfare all together can lead to
infectious<00:00:49.739> diseases<00:00:50.100> among<00:00:50.910> animals<00:00:51.449> some

of them being food borne to consumers
one<00:00:55.230> example<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.910> animal<00:00:57.600> welfare<00:00:57.840> might

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
one example of how animal welfare might

one example of how animal welfare might
affect<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> food<00:00:58.980> safety<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.750> tail<00:01:00.750> biting

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
affect the food safety is tail biting

affect the food safety is tail biting
among<00:01:02.070> pigs<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.799> major<00:01:05.159> welfare<00:01:05.700> issue

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
among pigs this is a major welfare issue

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.600 
among pigs this is a major welfare issue
on<00:01:06.180> pig<00:01:06.390> farms<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.189> risk

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
on pig farms and it is also a risk

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.030 
on pig farms and it is also a risk
factor<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:09.350> increasing<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> frequency<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
factor of increasing the frequency of

but if you remember earlier I said I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.780 
but if you remember earlier I said I
wanted<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> talk<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.890> about<00:01:16.979> animal<00:01:17.580> based

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
wanted to talk to you about animal based

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.080

for what we are trying to measure now

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.800 
for what we are trying to measure now
let's<00:02:03.540> go<00:02:03.719> back<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> our<00:02:04.259> example<00:02:04.409> tail<00:02:05.399> biting

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
let's go back to our example tail biting

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.139 
let's go back to our example tail biting
we<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.560> an<00:02:08.280> indicator<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
we know that this is an indicator of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.199 
we know that this is an indicator of
poor<00:02:09.360> welfare<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:10.860> it's<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.370> very<00:02:11.640> specific

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
poor welfare but it's not very specific

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
poor welfare but it's not very specific
because<00:02:12.450> many<00:02:12.870> different<00:02:13.230> factors

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
because many different factors
