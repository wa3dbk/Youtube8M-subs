00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.899
 the xiii one m 8 was one of the best 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.330
 2014 cell phones thanks to its elegant 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.030
 design and its excellent performance its 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.429
 successor the meager m 9 has a design 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 very similar to its predecessor but it does 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 less slippery and gives a little more 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.880
 luxury while also improving their 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.679
 components and software that has hello 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.769
 I'm Juan Garzón to have in Spanish and 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:28.650
 I bring you the analysis of the xy one m 9 the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.019
 m 9 is so similar to m 8 that it is difficult 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.000
 distinguish one from the other the two 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.340
 they have a metal body a screen 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.160
 1080 p 5-inch and two speakers 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.560
 front the design of the m 9 is a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.050
 small improvement of the m8 by reducing a 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.790
 little the bevels of the screen moving 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.760
 the power button on the top edge 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.640
 to the side edge and now integrating a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.590
 two-tone metal on its eastern edge 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.090
 model has a gray body and an edge 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 golden that makes it look great 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.560
 also available in color 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 completely gilded and one in gray with 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.030
 silver edge thanks to that new edge 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 and the new brushing on the back 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.600
 of the cell phone 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.770
 the safety one m 9 is much less 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.740
 slippery than the model 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.840
 in general the ecstasy one 99 feels 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.700
 very well in the hand and in the pocket the 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.039
 new tom descended on the side 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.990
 it makes it easier to press when 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.789
 you use it with one hand but although it has 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.229
 a unique texture is very easy to 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.689
 confuse it with the volume buttons 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.179
 because they have practically the 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.039
 same size and are very close 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.530
 double camera of the m8 is no longer 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.420
 present there is one more camera 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.069
 traditional 20 megapixels in the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.959
 rear which offer greater 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:40.209
 resolution but not necessarily the 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:43.000
 Same photo quality as the samsung 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.770
 galaxy of 6 and iphone 6 especially 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.909
 when you take pictures in situations with 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.979
 low light 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.959
 the visual noise is notorious the colors to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.140
 Sometimes they do not reproduce well and the funds 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.149
 many times they are lost with the brightness 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.950
 Ultra pixel camera is still present 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.020
 in m 9 but now it is in the 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.079
 front and is very good to take 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.239
 all kinds of selfish the m 8 was a 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.829
 cell phone very fast but the m 9 carries 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.619
 everything at another level makes the 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.690
 experience is very very good open apps 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.239
 very quickly the games do not offer 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.400
 delays these partly thanks to 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.829
 810 snapdragon processor 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.760
 of 8 cores of two beams hertz and the 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:23.530
 3 gb ground plus the interface 67 that is 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.959
 find on android lollipop also 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.420
 they make the xxi follow 99 be very fast 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.310
 in general it is almost the same as the 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.049
 previous version but now allows 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.510
 change the backgrounds and with other sounds 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.040
 types of letters colors of the minutes and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.049
 until the navigation buttons of 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.519
 android with new themes the duration of 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.829
 the battery is not the best on the market 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.500
 but manages to offer you about a day 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.269
 full employment also includes the load 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.700
 quick that allows you for example in 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.400
 only 15 minutes manage to go from 20 to 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.769
 one hundred to almost 40 percent battery 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.139
 the former vice one 9 is an android cell phone 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.879
 that looks good performs very well and 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.799
 it's a pleasure to use it but your camera 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.139
 rear does not reach the level of its 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.239
 main competitors and their battery does not 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.859
 is the most reliable I'm Juan Garzón for 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.689
 Siles of Spanish and this was the analysis 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.689
 of safety 59
