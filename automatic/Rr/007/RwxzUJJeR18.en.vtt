00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
so I'm just going to do a couple here

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.940 
so I'm just going to do a couple here
just<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> show<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.200> them<00:00:49.500> getting<00:00:49.800> those

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
just to show you them getting those

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.720 
just to show you them getting those
patterns<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:52.350> wouldn't<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.160> cut<00:00:53.399> into

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
patterns in and I wouldn't have cut into

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
patterns in and I wouldn't have cut into
these<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.420> something<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.930> small<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> did

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
these for something so small but I did

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.770 
these for something so small but I did
order<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.670> see<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.969> i<00:00:57.000> order<00:00:57.300> doubles

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
order you can see that i order doubles

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.380 
order you can see that i order doubles
of<00:00:58.050> some<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.440> favorite<00:00:58.770> patterns<00:00:59.190> I<00:01:00.090> don't

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
of some of my favorite patterns I don't

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
of some of my favorite patterns I don't
think<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.870> canari<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.649> putting<00:01:01.980> out<00:01:02.070> a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think that canari is putting out a

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
think that canari is putting out a
six-by-six<00:01:02.489> paper<00:01:02.879> pad<00:01:03.149> yet<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.960> would

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
six-by-six paper pad yet but this would

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.070 
six-by-six paper pad yet but this would
be<00:01:04.140> ideal<00:01:04.850> technique<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.270> six<00:01:06.570> by<00:01:06.689> six<00:01:06.750> papers

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
be ideal technique for six by six papers

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.070 
be ideal technique for six by six papers
is<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.830> smaller<00:01:08.580> pattern<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:09.990> have

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is a smaller pattern and you don't have

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
is a smaller pattern and you don't have
to<00:01:10.200> cut<00:01:10.380> into<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.619> 12<00:01:10.950> x<00:01:11.010> 12<00:01:11.250> papers<00:01:11.640> but

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to cut into your 12 x 12 papers but

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
to cut into your 12 x 12 papers but
since<00:01:12.750> i<00:01:12.840> had<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.040> favorites

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
since i had two of some of my favorites

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.580 
since i had two of some of my favorites
i<00:01:14.670> decided<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.150> i<00:01:15.299> could<00:01:15.540> sacrifice<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.380> cut

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
i decided that i could sacrifice and cut

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.880 
i decided that i could sacrifice and cut
into<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:18.030> bit<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.900> bag<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
into a little bit of those and bag the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.240 
into a little bit of those and bag the
cut<00:01:20.100> files<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.140> couldn't<00:01:22.830> decide<00:01:23.100> at

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
cut files and it I couldn't decide at

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
cut files and it I couldn't decide at
first<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.670> cut<00:01:23.850> file<00:01:24.030> wanted<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> use<00:01:24.780> for

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
first what cut file wanted to use for

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
first what cut file wanted to use for
this<00:01:25.080> week<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.680> knew<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.460> photo<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.909> I

let<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.399> eat<00:01:44.549> pie<00:01:45.180> cut<00:01:45.450> cut<00:01:45.840> file<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
let them eat pie cut cut file in the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.690 
let them eat pie cut cut file in the
shop<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> thought<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.579> go

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
shop and so I thought that would go

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.389 
shop and so I thought that would go
perfect<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.560> add<00:01:49.710> there<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
perfect with this to add there to the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.940 
perfect with this to add there to the
center<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.899> then<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.290> wanted<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> add<00:01:52.710> two

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
center and then I just wanted to add two

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.670 
center and then I just wanted to add two
others<00:01:53.479> around<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.869> outside<00:01:55.200> edges<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
others around to the outside edges to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
others around to the outside edges to
kind<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> break<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.430> circle<00:01:56.880> motion<00:01:57.119> just

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
kind of break up that circle motion just

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.389 
kind of break up that circle motion just
because<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
because there was going to be a lot of

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
because there was going to be a lot of
circular<00:01:59.880> motion<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.899> layout

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
circular motion going on on this layout

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.350 
circular motion going on on this layout
and<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.799> used<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.820> acetate

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and so I used some of the little acetate

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630 
and so I used some of the little acetate
triangle<00:02:03.960> pieces<00:02:04.189> from<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.369> collection

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
triangle pieces from this collection

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.359 
triangle pieces from this collection
just<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.659> around<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.320> circle<00:02:07.530> design<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
just to go around that circle design and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.380 
just to go around that circle design and
I'm<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.640> stitch<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.300> real<00:02:09.479> news<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.140> had

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
I'm going to stitch a real news I had

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.720 
I'm going to stitch a real news I had
add<00:02:11.569> just<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.840> little<00:02:11.870> bit<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.260> adhesive<00:02:12.730> just

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
add just a little bit of adhesive just

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.210 
add just a little bit of adhesive just
to<00:02:13.790> help<00:02:13.910> those<00:02:14.120> stick<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.860> adhesive

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
to help those stick and that adhesive

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.370 
to help those stick and that adhesive
and<00:02:16.340> my<00:02:16.520> fine<00:02:16.730> liner<00:02:16.940> bottle<00:02:17.480> does<00:02:17.720> not<00:02:17.959> show

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
and my fine liner bottle does not show

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.220 
and my fine liner bottle does not show
through<00:02:18.740> all<00:02:19.010> those<00:02:19.160> acetate<00:02:19.730> pieces<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:21.200> I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
through all those acetate pieces so I

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.840 
through all those acetate pieces so I
was<00:02:21.410> able<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.740> just<00:02:21.770> I'd<00:02:22.130> hear<00:02:22.459> those<00:02:22.490> down

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
was able to just I'd hear those down

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.130 
was able to just I'd hear those down
just<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.180> little<00:02:23.330> bit<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.750> then<00:02:23.900> get<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
just a little bit and then get the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.390 
just a little bit and then get the
stitching<00:02:24.500> done<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.860> I'm<00:02:24.950> sorry<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.310> my

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
stitching done and I'm sorry that my

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.820 
stitching done and I'm sorry that my
camera<00:02:25.730> keeps<00:02:26.270> going<00:02:26.660> out<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.780> focus<00:02:27.020> it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
camera keeps going out of focus it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.380 
camera keeps going out of focus it
definitely<00:02:28.250> has<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> mind<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.970> its<00:02:29.120> own<00:02:29.330> and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
definitely has a mind of its own and

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.980 
definitely has a mind of its own and
does<00:02:29.990> what<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.260> wants<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.650> do<00:02:30.770> itself<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.180> it

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
does what it wants to do itself so it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.690 
does what it wants to do itself so it
will<00:02:33.380> kind<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.740> flicker<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.400> out<00:02:34.490> there

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
will kind of flicker in and out there

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.330 
will kind of flicker in and out there
every<00:02:35.030> once<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.420> while<00:02:35.600> but<00:02:35.990> I<00:02:36.290> just<00:02:37.100> can't

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
every once in a while but I just can't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.949 
every once in a while but I just can't
get<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.670> cooperate<00:02:38.090> most<00:02:38.300> of<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> time<00:02:38.660> so

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
get it to cooperate most of the time so

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.420 
get it to cooperate most of the time so
I<00:02:38.989> just<00:02:39.170> cross<00:02:39.320> my<00:02:39.380> fingers<00:02:39.560> and<00:02:39.860> hope<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.370> it

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
I just cross my fingers and hope that it

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.370 
I just cross my fingers and hope that it
actually<00:02:40.850> videos<00:02:41.330> what<00:02:41.690> I'm<00:02:41.840> trying<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.260> get

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
actually videos what I'm trying to get

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.979 
actually videos what I'm trying to get
it<00:02:42.470> to<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:44.239> now<00:02:44.540> I've<00:02:44.660> got<00:02:44.840> that

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
it to be here so now I've got that

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.720 
it to be here so now I've got that
background<00:02:45.530> pretty<00:02:45.770> much<00:02:45.950> finished<00:02:46.250> up<00:02:46.580> with

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
background pretty much finished up with

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.640 
background pretty much finished up with
the<00:02:46.880> stitching<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.360> everything<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.110> I'm

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
the stitching and everything and I'm

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.520 
the stitching and everything and I'm
going<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.830> add<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.160> cut<00:02:49.370> files<00:02:49.640> now<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.750> I'm

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
going to add the cut files now and I'm

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.229 
going to add the cut files now and I'm
doing<00:02:51.920> that<00:02:52.130> large<00:02:52.370> one<00:02:52.610> there<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.030> center

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
doing that large one there in the center

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.180 
doing that large one there in the center
and<00:02:53.660> then<00:02:54.320> I'm<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:54.620> placing<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.950> two

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
and then I'm just placing the two

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.860 
and then I'm just placing the two
smaller<00:02:55.459> ones<00:02:55.580> on<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:55.970> top<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.300> bottom<00:02:56.420> kind

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
smaller ones on the top and bottom kind

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.600 
smaller ones on the top and bottom kind
of<00:02:56.959> creating<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.410> visual<00:02:57.560> triangle<00:02:58.250> with<00:02:58.400> those

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
of creating a visual triangle with those

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.240 
of creating a visual triangle with those
and<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.810> wanted<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.350> leave<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.709> center<00:03:01.010> part

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
and I wanted to leave that center part

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.190 
and I wanted to leave that center part
open<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.940> to<00:03:02.000> have<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.180> pink<00:03:02.540> show<00:03:02.870> through

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
open just to have that pink show through

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.440 
open just to have that pink show through
and<00:03:03.610> there<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.700> can<00:03:04.730> see<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.970> backside<00:03:05.390> of

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
and there you can see the backside of

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.360 
and there you can see the backside of
that<00:03:05.600> paper<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.290> actually<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.920> don't<00:03:07.280> know

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
that paper and I actually I don't know

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
that paper and I actually I don't know
why<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.550> only<00:03:07.880> ordered<00:03:08.150> one<00:03:08.330> sheet<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.959> one

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
why I only ordered one sheet of that one

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.440 
why I only ordered one sheet of that one
but<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.680> went<00:03:10.220> back<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.580> my<00:03:10.670> scraps<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.239> more
