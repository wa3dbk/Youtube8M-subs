suspended chords the suspended second

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.210 
suspended chords the suspended second
and<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> suspended<00:00:09.960> fourth

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:12.220

suspended<00:00:13.220> courts<00:00:13.610> change<00:00:14.360> the<00:00:14.900> third<00:00:15.290> in<00:00:15.590> a

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
suspended courts change the third in a

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.330 
suspended courts change the third in a
major<00:00:15.889> court<00:00:16.309> to<00:00:16.820> either<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:17.210> second<00:00:17.840> or<00:00:18.410> fourth

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
major court to either a second or fourth

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.370 
major court to either a second or fourth
and<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.150> reason<00:00:20.450> they're<00:00:20.570> called<00:00:20.720> suspended

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
and the reason they're called suspended

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.679 
and the reason they're called suspended
is<00:00:21.529> because<00:00:22.010> the<00:00:22.430> ear<00:00:22.610> wants<00:00:23.119> you<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.300> go<00:00:23.450> back

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
is because the ear wants you to go back

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.470 
is because the ear wants you to go back
to<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.650> full<00:00:24.860> version<00:00:25.040> of<00:00:25.279> the<00:00:25.400> court<00:00:25.700> the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
to the full version of the court the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.390 
to the full version of the court the
easiest<00:00:26.720> way<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:26.930> show<00:00:27.200> this<00:00:27.410> is<00:00:27.619> on<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:27.950> D<00:00:28.189> chord

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
easiest way to show this is on a D chord

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.330 
easiest way to show this is on a D chord
and<00:00:28.750> what<00:00:29.750> I'm<00:00:29.869> playing<00:00:30.079> here<00:00:30.349> is<00:00:30.470> D<00:00:30.770> the<00:00:31.130> root

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
and what I'm playing here is D the root

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.760 
and what I'm playing here is D the root
a<00:00:31.610> is<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.599> fifth<00:00:32.860> DS<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.220> root<00:00:34.399> again<00:00:34.700> and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
a is the fifth DS the root again and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.850 
a is the fifth DS the root again and
this<00:00:36.770> F<00:00:37.130> sharp<00:00:37.579> is<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.970> third<00:00:41.110> okay<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.170> now<00:00:42.590> a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
this F sharp is the third okay so now a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.720 
this F sharp is the third okay so now a
suspended<00:00:43.460> second<00:00:43.969> I<00:00:44.120> replace<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:44.809> F<00:00:44.929> sharp

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
suspended second I replace the F sharp

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.680 
suspended second I replace the F sharp
with<00:00:46.730> E<00:00:47.059> second

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.530 

it's<00:00:51.230> just<00:00:51.470> begging<00:00:51.950> just<00:00:52.850> begging<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.360> go

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
it's just begging just begging to go

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.450 
it's just begging just begging to go
back<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:53.990> third<00:00:56.800> here's<00:00:57.800> a<00:00:57.860> suspended

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
back to the third here's a suspended

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.040 
back to the third here's a suspended
fourth<00:00:58.790> instead<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.510> f-sharp

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
fourth instead of f-sharp

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.790 
fourth instead of f-sharp
I<00:01:00.230> play<00:01:00.740> G

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.620 

when<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:05.980> put<00:01:06.190> them<00:01:06.310> together<00:01:06.460> I've<00:01:07.150> got<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.390> nice

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
when I put them together I've got a nice

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:17.260 
when I put them together I've got a nice
little<00:01:07.930> run

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.590 

now<00:01:18.259> my<00:01:18.500> egg<00:01:20.530> suspended<00:01:21.530> forth

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.310 

spend<00:01:27.600> in<00:01:27.750> second<00:01:28.229> back

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:48.810 

I'm<00:01:35.830> gonna<00:01:36.340> go<00:01:36.550> to<00:01:36.610> gene

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.980 

suspended<00:01:49.820> chords<00:01:50.090> are<00:01:50.210> excellent<00:01:50.840> for

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
suspended chords are excellent for

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.389 
suspended chords are excellent for
transitions<00:01:51.590> I'm<00:01:52.070> going<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.340> play<00:01:52.460> E<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:54.399> D

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
transitions I'm going to play E and D

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.609 
transitions I'm going to play E and D
and<00:01:55.909> I'm<00:01:56.869> going<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.110> show<00:01:57.289> you<00:01:57.350> how

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
and I'm going to show you how

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.429 
and I'm going to show you how
suspensions<00:01:58.399> help<00:01:59.149> me<00:01:59.299> lead<00:01:59.630> from<00:01:59.929> one<00:02:00.140> chord

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
suspensions help me lead from one chord

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.029 
suspensions help me lead from one chord
into<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:00.799> other<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.909> with<00:02:02.030> E<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:03.039> suspended

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
into the other so with E a suspended

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.979 
into the other so with E a suspended
fourth<00:02:04.369> adds<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:05.679> with<00:02:06.679> a<00:02:07.690> suspended<00:02:08.690> fourth

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
fourth adds a with a suspended fourth

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:25.170 
fourth adds a with a suspended fourth
and<00:02:09.200> Steve<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.129> check<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.489> out

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.600 

now<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.360> gonna<00:02:26.480> go<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.250> suspended<00:02:28.250> second

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
now I'm gonna go to the suspended second

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.160 
now I'm gonna go to the suspended second
Indian<00:02:29.030> what<00:02:29.180> does<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.540> give<00:02:29.900> me

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.250 

and<00:02:35.710> he<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> node<00:02:36.490> in<00:02:36.730> both<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.300> D<00:02:37.660> chord<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
and he is a node in both the D chord and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.240 
and he is a node in both the D chord and
the<00:02:38.650> ACORN

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
the ACORN

00:02:39.250 --> 00:03:03.130 
the ACORN
so<00:02:39.580> watch<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:39.970> again

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:10.420 

a<00:03:07.240> suspended<00:03:08.240> second<00:03:08.720> has<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.110> bee<00:03:09.440> in<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.709> which

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
a suspended second has a bee in it which

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.850 
a suspended second has a bee in it which
is<00:03:10.550> an<00:03:10.700> E<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:12.080> more<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.410> know<00:03:12.530> about<00:03:12.560> the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
is an E the more you know about the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.220 
is an E the more you know about the
different<00:03:13.280> notes<00:03:13.520> in<00:03:13.730> each<00:03:14.030> chord<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.990> more

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
different notes in each chord the more

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.230 
different notes in each chord the more
effectively<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.010> use<00:03:16.280> any<00:03:16.550> transition

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
effectively you can use any transition

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.180 
effectively you can use any transition
and<00:03:17.420> that<00:03:17.510> goes<00:03:17.720> for<00:03:17.930> suspensions<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.770> in

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
and that goes for suspensions and in

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.730 
and that goes for suspensions and in
fact<00:03:19.459> suspended<00:03:20.420> chords<00:03:20.810> are<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:21.020> really<00:03:21.560> good

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
fact suspended chords are a really good

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.770 
fact suspended chords are a really good
way<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:21.980> understand<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.090> relationship

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
way to understand the relationship

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.480 
way to understand the relationship
between<00:03:23.810> chords<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:24.770> they're<00:03:25.010> not<00:03:25.160> very

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
between chords because they're not very

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.360 
between chords because they're not very
complicated<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:27.620> start<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.100> see

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
complicated and you can start to see

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.670 
complicated and you can start to see
which<00:03:28.760> notes<00:03:29.090> are<00:03:29.300> shared<00:03:29.780> when<00:03:30.140> you<00:03:30.230> alter<00:03:30.500> a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
which notes are shared when you alter a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.570 
which notes are shared when you alter a
chord<00:03:31.070> slightly

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.640 

you
