00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
right now cuz it is one of the long
number<00:00:40.590> seeds<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.219> no<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> remember

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
number seeds because no one can remember

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
number seeds because no one can remember
the<00:00:42.090> exact<00:00:42.390> C<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:42.750> put<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.140> maybe<00:00:43.290> they

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
possibility too so village number ten is

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.750 
possibility too so village number ten is
again<00:05:01.620> quite<00:05:01.800> close<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.160> village<00:05:02.370> number<00:05:02.460> nine

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
again quite close to village number nine

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.070 
again quite close to village number nine
they're<00:05:02.970> all<00:05:03.090> in<00:05:03.240> actually<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.660> same<00:05:03.870> half

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
they're all in actually the same half

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.870 
they're all in actually the same half
the<00:05:04.260> maps<00:05:04.470> so<00:05:04.770> it's<00:05:04.950> it's<00:05:05.580> pretty<00:05:05.610> interesting

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
the maps so it's it's pretty interesting

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.000 
the maps so it's it's pretty interesting
you<00:05:06.060> could<00:05:06.540> probably<00:05:06.720> get<00:05:06.960> 15<00:05:07.380> or<00:05:07.500> so<00:05:07.650> villages

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
you could probably get 15 or so villages

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.290 
you could probably get 15 or so villages
I'd<00:05:08.220> imagine<00:05:08.550> that's<00:05:08.700> probably<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:08.970> seed<00:05:09.150> out

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
I'd imagine that's probably a seed out

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.210 
I'd imagine that's probably a seed out
there<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:09.570> will<00:05:09.660> do<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:09.960> but<00:05:10.800> yeah<00:05:10.890> so<00:05:11.070> up

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
there that will do that but yeah so up

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.380 
there that will do that but yeah so up
then<00:05:11.460> you<00:05:11.550> head<00:05:11.670> over<00:05:11.700> to<00:05:11.850> here<00:05:12.030> and<00:05:12.210> add<00:05:12.270> you
