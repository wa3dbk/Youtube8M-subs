00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
it has no subsidy lock so I can

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.219

I<00:03:53.480> don't<00:03:53.840> just<00:03:54.079> use<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.099> hand<00:03:56.030> roid<00:03:56.469> phone<00:04:03.250> to

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
I don't just use a hand roid phone to

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.410 
I don't just use a hand roid phone to
tether<00:04:06.159> the<00:04:07.159> reason<00:04:07.519> is<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.819> I<00:04:07.849> I<00:04:08.030> did

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
tether the reason is is I I did

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.849 
tether the reason is is I I did
originally<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:11.560> application<00:04:12.560> was

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
originally and the application was

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.849 
originally and the application was
disabled<00:04:13.489> somehow<00:04:13.670> remotely<00:04:14.739> that's<00:04:15.739> the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
disabled somehow remotely that's the

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:22.230 
disabled somehow remotely that's the
beauty<00:04:16.160> of<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.370> old<00:04:16.690> system<00:04:17.690> here<00:04:18.259> the<00:04:20.709> 6.5<00:04:21.709> is

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
beauty of the old system here the 6.5 is

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.189 
beauty of the old system here the 6.5 is
that<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:25.180> application<00:04:26.180> will<00:04:26.270> remain<00:04:26.660> in<00:04:27.020> my

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
that the application will remain in my

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:30.990 
that the application will remain in my
phone<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:27.800> work<00:04:28.009> and<00:04:28.810> there<00:04:29.810> won't<00:04:29.990> be<00:04:30.199> any

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
phone and work and there won't be any

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.270 
phone and work and there won't be any
external<00:04:33.820> actions<00:04:34.820> taken<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.389> turn<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.930> off

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
external actions taken to turn it off

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.820 
external actions taken to turn it off
not<00:04:37.280> only<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.580> i<00:04:37.789> can<00:04:38.180> swap<00:04:38.780> out<00:04:39.050> my<00:04:40.210> chips
