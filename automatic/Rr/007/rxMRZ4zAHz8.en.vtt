00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
turbine unit as you can see it broke

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.860 
turbine unit as you can see it broke
very<00:00:51.570> easily<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:53.000> as<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.270> said<00:00:54.300> this

very easily just there as I said this

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.860 
very easily just there as I said this
model<00:00:55.289> was<00:00:55.559> actually<00:00:56.160> originally<00:00:56.870> intended

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
model was actually originally intended

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.450 
model was actually originally intended
as<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.129> collector's<00:00:59.129> item<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
as a collector's item not actually a

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.149

age 9 it falls apart very easily
especially<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.189> wind<00:01:20.430> turbine<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.020> see

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
especially the wind turbine so let's see

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.289 
especially the wind turbine so let's see
let's<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.740> into<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.790> looking<00:01:24.210> at

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
let's get into the actually looking at

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.330 
let's get into the actually looking at
this<00:01:24.390> wind<00:01:24.659> turbine<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.420> pop

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340

actual his side looks like as you can
see<00:02:51.599> this<00:02:51.870> basically<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.459> inside<00:02:54.060> of

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
see this basically what the inside of

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.390 
see this basically what the inside of
the<00:02:54.390> model<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.250> really<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.790> frame

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
the model is it's just really a frame

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.430 
the model is it's just really a frame
for<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.640> side<00:03:00.239> panels<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:01.079> get<00:03:01.230> put<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.930> you

for the side panels to get put on if you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.080 
for the side panels to get put on if you
play<00:03:04.769> around<00:03:05.099> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.610> probably<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
play around you can probably get a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.250 
play around you can probably get a
function<00:03:06.769> motor<00:03:07.769> and<00:03:08.280> actually<00:03:09.230> put<00:03:10.230> it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
function motor and actually put it

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.680 
function motor and actually put it
inside<00:03:10.829> of<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.280> so<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:11.819> actually<00:03:12.510> moving<00:03:14.690> but

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
inside of it so it's actually moving but

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.420 
inside of it so it's actually moving but
that<00:03:16.470> takes<00:03:16.769> it<00:03:17.010> out<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.400> idea<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.090> being<00:03:18.660> a

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that takes it out of the idea of being a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.120 
that takes it out of the idea of being a
wind<00:03:20.430> turbine<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:21.389> I'll<00:03:21.510> just<00:03:21.720> quickly<00:03:22.130> attach

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
wind turbine so I'll just quickly attach

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.750 
wind turbine so I'll just quickly attach
it<00:03:23.370> back<00:03:23.549> onto<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.150> side<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.950> we'll<00:03:26.250> zoom<00:03:26.519> in

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
it back onto the side and we'll zoom in

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.129 
it back onto the side and we'll zoom in
else<00:03:26.910> again<00:03:31.609> it's<00:03:32.609> got<00:03:32.819> these<00:03:32.970> big<00:03:33.480> massive

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
else again it's got these big massive

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.479 
else again it's got these big massive
blades<00:03:34.530> as<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.370> see<00:03:36.470> let's<00:03:37.470> say<00:03:37.709> big<00:03:38.040> I've

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
blades as you see let's say big I've

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.830 
blades as you see let's say big I've
been<00:03:38.790> finding<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.599> hard<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.230> film<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:41.840> model

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
been finding it hard to film this model

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.970 
been finding it hard to film this model
as<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.709> can<00:03:44.010> see<00:03:44.220> he's<00:03:44.400> got<00:03:44.609> three<00:03:45.060> giant

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
as you can see he's got three giant

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.479 
as you can see he's got three giant
blades<00:03:46.980> for<00:03:47.489> actually<00:03:47.970> turning<00:03:48.329> around

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
blades for actually turning around

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.339 
blades for actually turning around
having<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.519> function<00:03:50.880> motor<00:03:51.389> so<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.989> probably

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
having the function motor so it probably

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.550 
having the function motor so it probably
would<00:03:52.560> give<00:03:52.889> it<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.069> little<00:03:53.220> bit<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.639> more

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
would give it a little bit of a more

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.949 
would give it a little bit of a more
play<00:03:55.560> value<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.669> something<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.269> had<00:03:57.599> to

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
play value to it something that had to

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.259 
play value to it something that had to
probably<00:03:58.799> put<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.220> functions<00:03:59.910> motor<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.650> it

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
probably put a functions motor on to it

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.809 
probably put a functions motor on to it
they're<00:04:03.269> not<00:04:03.419> that<00:04:03.630> expensive<00:04:03.780> for<00:04:04.500> buying

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
they're not that expensive for buying

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.339 
they're not that expensive for buying
probably<00:04:05.819> it<00:04:05.970> totally<00:04:06.269> just<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.690> little<00:04:07.049> teeny

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
probably it totally just a little teeny

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.759 
probably it totally just a little teeny
tiny<00:04:08.190> one<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:08.760> we<00:04:09.180> would<00:04:09.359> do<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:09.930> just

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
tiny one but we would do it and just

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.780 
tiny one but we would do it and just
hide<00:04:11.069> it<00:04:11.280> in<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.940> shell<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:13.760> turbine<00:04:14.760> up

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
hide it in the shell of the turbine up

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.569 
hide it in the shell of the turbine up
here<00:04:15.239> now<00:04:15.840> now<00:04:16.109> just<00:04:16.440> quickly<00:04:16.650> pull<00:04:17.190> off<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
here now now just quickly pull off the

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.510 
here now now just quickly pull off the
top<00:04:17.849> cuz<00:04:18.239> I'm<00:04:18.630> gonna<00:04:18.959> show<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:21.180> shower

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
top cuz I'm gonna show you the shower

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.890 
top cuz I'm gonna show you the shower
the<00:04:24.509> shark<00:04:24.840> what<00:04:25.110> keeps<00:04:25.409> falling<00:04:26.400> off<00:04:26.879> as<00:04:27.659> you

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
the shark what keeps falling off as you

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.219 
the shark what keeps falling off as you
can<00:04:28.080> see<00:04:28.650> I'll<00:04:29.550> just<00:04:29.879> quickly<00:04:30.240> dissect<00:04:31.050> this

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
can see I'll just quickly dissect this

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.790 
can see I'll just quickly dissect this
shut<00:04:31.529> off<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.039> that's<00:04:32.219> it<00:04:33.020> there's<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.499> whole

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
shut off and that's it there's the whole

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.459 
shut off and that's it there's the whole
shaft<00:04:35.279> there<00:04:35.960> we're<00:04:36.960> going<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.199> quickly

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 
shaft there we're going to quickly

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.929 
shaft there we're going to quickly
dissect<00:04:38.340> this<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:39.029> show<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.330> what<00:04:39.689> its

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
dissect this and show you what its

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:51.909 
dissect this and show you what its
composes<00:04:41.939> of<00:04:45.319> breaking<00:04:46.319> it<00:04:46.680> up<00:04:46.979> at<00:04:47.219> the<00:04:47.370> moment

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.480 

it's<00:04:52.919> deep<00:04:53.699> inside<00:04:53.969> show<00:04:54.659> you<00:04:55.189> what<00:04:56.189> is

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
it's deep inside show you what is

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:05.290 
it's deep inside show you what is
actually<00:04:57.349> inside<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:58.409> show<00:05:01.610> as<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:03.000> can<00:05:03.180> see

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
actually inside the show as you can see

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:14.600 
actually inside the show as you can see
you've<00:05:06.300> got<00:05:06.330> these<00:05:06.719> three<00:05:07.680> bits<00:05:13.610> what

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
you've got these three bits what

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.969 
you've got these three bits what
actually<00:05:15.240> helps<00:05:15.689> strengthen<00:05:16.349> them

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
actually helps strengthen them

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:21.649 
actually helps strengthen them
that's<00:05:17.400> actually<00:05:17.909> the<00:05:18.060> core<00:05:18.389> of<00:05:18.689> the<00:05:19.439> model<00:05:20.659> as

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
that's actually the core of the model as

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.040 
that's actually the core of the model as
you<00:05:21.719> can<00:05:22.139> see<00:05:22.849> look<00:05:23.849> at<00:05:23.969> it<00:05:24.089> I<00:05:24.240> might<00:05:24.479> have<00:05:24.810> to

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
you can see look at it I might have to

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.390 
you can see look at it I might have to
do<00:05:25.259> a<00:05:25.560> fourth<00:05:26.490> video<00:05:27.830> I'm<00:05:28.830> taking<00:05:29.279> a<00:05:29.310> little

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
do a fourth video I'm taking a little

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.420 
do a fourth video I'm taking a little
bit<00:05:29.550> too<00:05:29.639> long<00:05:29.939> to<00:05:30.300> go<00:05:30.750> in<00:05:30.960> detail<00:05:31.529> but<00:05:32.099> as<00:05:32.279> you

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
bit too long to go in detail but as you

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.860 
bit too long to go in detail but as you
can<00:05:32.520> see<00:05:32.580> it's<00:05:32.969> a<00:05:33.060> long<00:05:33.270> long<00:05:34.080> shaft<00:05:35.000> or<00:05:36.000> axle

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
can see it's a long long shaft or axle

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:43.159 
can see it's a long long shaft or axle
as<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.289> caller<00:05:39.110> these<00:05:40.399> components<00:05:41.399> I<00:05:41.610> need<00:05:42.169> to

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
as a caller these components I need to

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.279 
as a caller these components I need to
like<00:05:43.409> I<00:05:43.620> um<00:05:43.979> I<00:05:44.219> think<00:05:45.060> they<00:05:45.629> were<00:05:45.689> brought<00:05:46.110> out

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
like I um I think they were brought out

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.659 
like I um I think they were brought out
in<00:05:46.649> the<00:05:46.949> first<00:05:47.339> version<00:05:47.759> winter<00:05:48.569> well<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.020> was

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
in the first version winter well it was

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.909 
in the first version winter well it was
things<00:05:50.669> worth<00:05:50.969> 500<00:05:51.659> bucks<00:05:51.689> it<00:05:52.289> was<00:05:52.439> actually<00:05:52.889> a

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
things worth 500 bucks it was actually a

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.420 
things worth 500 bucks it was actually a
working<00:05:53.460> model<00:05:54.110> as<00:05:55.110> you<00:05:55.169> can<00:05:55.710> see<00:05:56.159> learning

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
working model as you can see learning

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.200 
working model as you can see learning
zoom<00:05:57.060> in<00:05:57.330> so<00:05:57.569> you<00:05:57.629> can<00:05:57.839> actually<00:05:58.879> see<00:05:59.879> this<00:06:00.149> a

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
zoom in so you can actually see this a

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.200 
zoom in so you can actually see this a
little<00:06:00.659> bit<00:06:00.839> clearly<00:06:01.409> this<00:06:01.949> is<00:06:02.189> one<00:06:03.029> of<00:06:03.060> the

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
little bit clearly this is one of the

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.350 
little bit clearly this is one of the
new<00:06:03.389> elements<00:06:03.629> they<00:06:04.229> poured<00:06:04.589> out<00:06:05.180> to<00:06:06.180> make

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
new elements they poured out to make

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.379 
new elements they poured out to make
what<00:06:06.659> come<00:06:07.189> towers<00:06:08.189> and<00:06:08.520> stuff<00:06:08.849> like<00:06:09.060> that

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
what come towers and stuff like that

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.110 
what come towers and stuff like that
just<00:06:10.460> bring<00:06:11.460> it<00:06:11.610> close<00:06:11.909> up<00:06:12.379> camera<00:06:13.729> as<00:06:14.729> you<00:06:14.969> can

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
just bring it close up camera as you can

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.869 
just bring it close up camera as you can
see<00:06:16.219> you<00:06:17.219> get<00:06:17.310> three<00:06:17.669> bits<00:06:17.939> of<00:06:18.240> that<00:06:18.419> and<00:06:19.879> it

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
see you get three bits of that and it

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:27.220 
see you get three bits of that and it
makes<00:06:21.149> the<00:06:21.979> the<00:06:22.979> shower

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.140 

last<00:06:27.440> but<00:06:28.040> not<00:06:28.070> least<00:06:28.610> is<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.660> bomb<00:06:29.870> bit<00:06:30.730> now<00:06:31.730> I

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
last but not least is the bomb bit now I

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.080 
last but not least is the bomb bit now I
don't<00:06:32.840> think<00:06:33.200> much<00:06:33.710> of<00:06:34.100> the<00:06:34.370> base<00:06:34.580> they<00:06:34.880> could

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
don't think much of the base they could

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.450 
don't think much of the base they could
have<00:06:35.180> put<00:06:35.360> a<00:06:35.390> little<00:06:35.480> bit<00:06:35.720> more<00:06:35.810> effort<00:06:36.470> in<00:06:36.650> but

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
have put a little bit more effort in but

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.610 
have put a little bit more effort in but
if<00:06:37.640> you<00:06:37.670> were<00:06:37.910> gonna<00:06:38.090> build<00:06:38.510> like<00:06:38.720> a<00:06:39.290> proper

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
if you were gonna build like a proper

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.060 
if you were gonna build like a proper
model<00:06:39.980> display<00:06:41.380> you<00:06:42.380> probably<00:06:42.770> would

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
model display you probably would

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.670 
model display you probably would
actually<00:06:44.060> put<00:06:44.270> this<00:06:44.420> on<00:06:44.660> to<00:06:44.900> a<00:06:44.930> proper<00:06:45.440> and

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
actually put this on to a proper and

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.900 
actually put this on to a proper and
green<00:06:46.130> base<00:06:46.430> board<00:06:46.910> but<00:06:47.690> um<00:06:47.960> I<00:06:48.410> find<00:06:48.860> it's<00:06:49.550> not

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
green base board but um I find it's not

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.370 
green base board but um I find it's not
strong<00:06:51.100> it's<00:06:52.120> tipped<00:06:53.120> over<00:06:53.330> a<00:06:53.570> few<00:06:53.870> times<00:06:54.110> as

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380 
strong it's tipped over a few times as

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.260 
strong it's tipped over a few times as
you<00:06:54.500> can<00:06:54.620> see<00:06:54.830> that's<00:06:55.040> where<00:06:55.280> the<00:06:55.490> axle<00:06:56.030> goes

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
you can see that's where the axle goes

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.670 
you can see that's where the axle goes
in<00:06:56.600> to<00:06:56.900> hold<00:06:57.620> it<00:06:57.830> into<00:06:57.950> position<00:06:59.650> make<00:07:00.650> sure

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
in to hold it into position make sure

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.620 
in to hold it into position make sure
when<00:07:01.130> you<00:07:01.220> put<00:07:01.430> that<00:07:01.580> tool<00:07:01.910> in<00:07:02.030> to<00:07:02.270> push<00:07:02.480> it

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630 
when you put that tool in to push it

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.530 
when you put that tool in to push it
down<00:07:02.870> really<00:07:03.410> well<00:07:03.560> or<00:07:04.040> it<00:07:04.580> will<00:07:04.850> fall<00:07:05.480> apart

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
down really well or it will fall apart

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.580 
down really well or it will fall apart
very<00:07:06.140> easily<00:07:06.610> okay<00:07:07.660> I'll<00:07:08.660> have<00:07:08.900> to<00:07:09.080> do<00:07:09.290> the

very easily okay I'll have to do the

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.100 
very easily okay I'll have to do the

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
wind up in there and a third we've got

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.280 
wind up in there and a third we've got
four<00:07:12.350> feet<00:07:12.790> this<00:07:13.790> one<00:07:14.090> I've<00:07:14.360> been<00:07:14.600> yakking<00:07:14.960> on
