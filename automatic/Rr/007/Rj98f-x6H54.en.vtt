00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello with you vilsack iphone in front of you 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 5 5 mini and ipad with retina screen 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.500
 really not the most important 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.330
 today I will show him a little apple 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.580
 Chemistry, while I twist-twist I want to cheat 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.580
 think it over a year to see the screensaver 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 spring apple discounts to all 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.960
 subscribers from partner and apple store 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.330
 just.ru I will tell you about the application 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 which is called a mosaic and me him 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.280
 sent twitter thanks for this let's 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.030
 open mosaic everywhere I have not yet 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.070
 I really see in what context it can 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.690
 practically apply in life but 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.430
 See, that this savkin she is able 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.620
 makes photos and very 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.320
 cool sync system 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.300
 unlockable for example on ipad mini and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.190
 after that to transfer the photo with 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 This and pd this is understandable that it should 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.520
 be running the program we are doing here 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.129
 such a simple gesture and they 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.289
 synchronized and make it very 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 qualitatively if we move 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.820
 it's all on the iphone then we get 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 photograph and here it all 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 synchronized position is taken into account 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 devices where it is common 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 mad thing see that is for example 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.509
 removes put here and perry 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 sync it again then we 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.520
 respectively, everything is synchronized well, I 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 I think that this is if it is not magic then I do not 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.909
 I know that this is actually very cool 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.280
 looks like photos can not be saved 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.729
 so it's not entirely clear why this is 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.490
 need here we have lost face here 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.200
 it seemed to me that if it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.460
 so that it was possible to refine 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.150
 transfer from device to device 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.799
 no files no xiv principle needed 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.240
 what else is there so cool 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.820
 in the same way transfer files through 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.860
 dropbox for example ask vilsakom deep 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.049
 file here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 account friend box not assigned 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.350
 so you can really see 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.240
 simple test after all downloaded 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.369
 This program of course need Wi fi 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 for work there is also a big minus we 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.510
 we have this file on this device and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.700
 on this we have not because she 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.770
 Lost so wonderful 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 write the program in the comments what you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.950
 I personally think about this concept very much 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 like it is clear that you need it 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 bring to mind refining and then 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.620
 can make candy hasan was a temple 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.210
