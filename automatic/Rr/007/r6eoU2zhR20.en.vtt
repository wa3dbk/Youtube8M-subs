00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
an hour from here and if the cuttings in

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.910 
an hour from here and if the cuttings in
the<00:02:32.020> spring<00:02:32.260> okay

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
the spring okay

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.830 
the spring okay
and<00:02:33.040> they<00:02:33.220> route<00:02:33.460> really<00:02:33.760> easy<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.660> would

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and they route really easy and it would

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.200 
and they route really easy and it would
not<00:02:35.050> take<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:36.160> if<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.490> bought<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.820> larger

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
not take for if you bought the larger

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.850 
not take for if you bought the larger
bare-root<00:02:37.630> ones<00:02:37.870> in<00:02:38.080> three<00:02:38.290> years<00:02:38.470> you'd<00:02:38.710> have

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
bare-root ones in three years you'd have

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.890 
bare-root ones in three years you'd have
this<00:02:39.010> wall<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:39.640> unbeliev<00:02:40.030> regular<00:02:40.420> right

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
this wall it's unbeliev regular right

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.240 
this wall it's unbeliev regular right
here<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.230> could<00:02:41.350> just<00:02:41.380> screen<00:02:41.770> it<00:02:41.920> right<00:02:42.040> off

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
here you could just screen it right off

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.800 
here you could just screen it right off
and<00:02:42.460> on<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.880> side<00:02:43.090> of<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.300> Willows<00:02:43.570> would<00:02:43.720> be

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
and on this side of the Willows would be

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.720 
and on this side of the Willows would be
just<00:02:43.990> nothing<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:44.350> rubs<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.710> scrapes<00:02:45.010> -<00:02:45.250> okay

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
just nothing but rubs and scrapes - okay

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.580 
just nothing but rubs and scrapes - okay
and<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.240> you'd<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.420> this<00:02:46.630> activity<00:02:47.170> zone<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
and so you'd have this activity zone you

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.870 
and so you'd have this activity zone you
need<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.800> expect<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.250> deer<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.520> be<00:02:48.640> coming

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
need to expect the deer to be coming

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.270 
need to expect the deer to be coming
from<00:02:49.050> possibly<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.140> south<00:02:50.350> yeah<00:02:51.070> they're

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
from possibly the south yeah they're

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.830 
from possibly the south yeah they're
gonna<00:02:51.370> come<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.760> from<00:02:51.880> yeah<00:02:52.180> that's<00:02:52.660> only

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.220 
gonna they're gonna filter in all across
here<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.390> hillside<00:02:55.660> because

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
here and from that hillside because

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.020 
here and from that hillside because
you've<00:02:56.350> got<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.890> know<00:02:56.950> you've<00:02:57.280> got<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.490> good

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
you've got you know you've got that good

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.310 
you've got you know you've got that good
food<00:02:58.210> plot<00:02:58.510> sure

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
food plot sure

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.570 
food plot sure
more<00:02:59.560> than<00:02:59.620> likely<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:03:00.070> going<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.280> tell<00:03:00.430> you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
more than likely I'm going to tell you

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.040 
more than likely I'm going to tell you
to<00:03:00.640> put<00:03:00.700> betting<00:03:01.270> on<00:03:01.390> that<00:03:01.600> hillside<00:03:01.810> just

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
to put betting on that hillside just

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.020 
to put betting on that hillside just
because<00:03:02.380> that's<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.620> South<00:03:02.860> exposure<00:03:03.310> that's

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
because that's a South exposure that's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.580 
because that's a South exposure that's
going<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.270> connect<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.840> then<00:03:05.440> we'll

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
going to connect to this then we'll

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.020 
going to connect to this then we'll
probably<00:03:05.740> put<00:03:05.980> some<00:03:06.160> very<00:03:06.370> large<00:03:06.610> bedding

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
probably put some very large bedding

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.220 
probably put some very large bedding
areas<00:03:07.360> over<00:03:07.660> there<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:13.480> again<00:03:13.720> it'd<00:03:13.870> be<00:03:13.930> it'll

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
areas over there so again it'd be it'll

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.290
