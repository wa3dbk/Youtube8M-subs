00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.060
 I thought that when they lived and flew that 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:21.970
 me that it was his but good and 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:25.660
 I was not no no if I hit him the 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.340
 stick so no no does not influence at all 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 the issue was that I had to have it 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.550
 done and it is continued with the key to what 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.140
 better but but that does not tarnish anything what 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.710
 what we did during the two matches 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.370
 I think we show that we are here for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.300
 to fight things to be up like 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.710
 we do it so I need the brand of 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.410
 that you could better close it off the key 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.970
 of forgiveness in the previous match 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.030
 and what I did today is a bit more 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.870
 quiet but but it happened it looked like this and 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.820
 unfortunately we arrived at the instance 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.440
 to the penalties where they went were more 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.620
 I hope we have to change 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.620
 this 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.710
 Of course we can not keep thinking what 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.000
 happened today and tomorrow we have to give 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.729
 turn the page because we have a 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.640
 decidor very very very important match 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.200
 for what is coming so you have to give 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.140
 turn the page as I said and 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.170
 we will try to focus what you have 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.149
 it's the championship so we're there and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.409
 we hope we hope the help of the good 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.240
 team because unfortunately we are 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.710
 three points down but but we have to 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.710
 first we do our thing 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.320
 we have to have the ability to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:41.409
 do not influence I think the fact that this 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.030
 group are planted in all the fields of 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.430
 the same way I think it talks about the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.200
 experience of how the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.899
 group so let's hope they do not have 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.170
 flow because if it should happen 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.940
 what I did was we finished 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.549
 championship so hopefully not 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.700
 we have to continue with the same hunger 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.479
 of the place something so let's hope that 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.580
 against galleys, let's continue in the same way 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.009
 giving us completely and in the end the 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.300
 coves taking pÃ©rez if you always stay 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.420
 removed not one is not happy I think 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.420
 what 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.340
 in the first 90 minutes they were a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.390
 thing today was more even the two parties 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.670
 and the two teams made a 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.720
 a match up to the 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.319
 circumstance that we were playing 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.470
 they are in the second goal the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.900
 second time out there deservedly not 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.260
 I know I think it was the result out there 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.260
 fair 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.690
 Y 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.780
 and the penalties are 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.120
 a matter of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.569
 of the moment of luck and we have to stay 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.030
 outside 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.390
 in which particular punishment is something that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.270
 it is not usually practiced 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.520
 no no but everyone chooses 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.450
 he had to err what to look for 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.030
 forward nothing 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.230
 no no no we are not going to analyze the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.390
 performance of the team by 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.250
 criminals I think 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.400
 there are deeper things that there are 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.140
 analyze what penalty shots 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:24.090
 then there are these three endings that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.709
 are left to be able to reach what yes yes 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.680
 we have to go to play calera and do 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:35.120
 a good match to keep adding and 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.120
 Finish the best of the tournament 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.440
 that we deserved to go above all so 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.440
 what we have done per day 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.500
 we did not have such an expensive number of days to 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.070
 Despite that, it had not happened 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.070
 problem 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:03.140
 so obviously this hurts but 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.140
 take out the application all 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.150
 this bitterness and to think about what we have 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.780
 what to gain of the week 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:16.049
 we came to an equal match 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.900
 out there the arbitral difference one what 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.720
 put inside a bow that always play 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.470
 visitor and against those things you are made 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.750
 very uphill 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.990
 we did very well today they play very 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.120
 good game but good until here 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.350
 we have to think about the 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.389
 championship and try to fight until the 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.030
 last subject of the referee there is a play 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.520
 fundamentally yours and in the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.770
 against the stop the Catholic goal that 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.100
 what is what recriminated him I say 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.690
 improves its approach that is not around those 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.210
 small or small details that 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.740
 they make a difference and it happened to dislike 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.510
 see a ball of the sail well the play 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.880
 well the goal 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.650
 we've already lost we're out now 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.870
 focused on the championship in doing what 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.280
 better so that the difference of the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.290
 another match with 14 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.750
 I think it was a match 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.810
 many clear clear situations of goal 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.510
 handles the ball very well 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.070
 we knew that because of the desperation 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.230
 to look for the results and I the truth 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.660
 if they are going to come so it was obvious that the 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:19.030
 party is going to be like that they all came 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.770
 good we did what we could now 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.980
 think about the championship there is already that 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.630
 forget about this close is this 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.210
 notebook and go back to thinking about the 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.200
 championship when you can influence what 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.200
 emotional this defeat 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.440
 I believe that it does not have to strengthen 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:41.120
 strengthen because we made a great a 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.060
 good drink and we can not leave like that 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.800
 down arm down I do not know I have to 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.120
 focus the championship again and 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.360
 after doing the best as we come 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.120
 doing and good but the penalties there are not 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.640
 too much analysis or can not be done 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.800
 too much in the team is kicked cearras 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.430
 azerbaijan hits 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.690
 I think 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.770
 the party had a first time where 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.510
 we attacked we were situations is one 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.810
 time it seems to me that we force ourselves to 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.820
 retreat and it cost us to create danger 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:16.660
 even so, it seems to me that we did not receive 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:20.290
 danger but good individual quality 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.560
 also of the rival footballers weighs 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.870
 weight found the goal and good a 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.780
 eliminator that clear that we 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:33.040
 disappoints to lose but nothing 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:36.040
 reproach everyone's effort had the 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.840
 height and good maybe regret in the 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.140
 first match to have missed so much 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.080
 and despite having scored a goal or not 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.910
 having received it today allowed you to spend 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.570
 because the procedure of the 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.170
 match 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.670
 from the previous one to this I think that because we 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.740
 it cost to find football told us 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:56.200
 find him hernandez especially not 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.520
 we found attack ball is good 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.340
 everything was 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.560
 and 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.169
 long pass then there was no connection 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.050
 with our offensive that not what 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.820
 we meet him in the match 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.060
 previous and good it cost us to generate yet 

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.470
 in the first time when it seems to me 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.840
 well creating danger in the second already 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.540
 we left 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.790
 they did not force us to defend ourselves but 

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.529
 good you have to turn the page 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:27.729
 think about Saturday 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:30.819
 forget and leave behind and rethink the 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:35.679
 new objective or chip change to 

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:37.809
 face the league we will try to what is 

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:39.699
 as evidently losing or for the 

00:07:37.809 --> 00:07:41.180
 definition itself by penalties and those 

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:44.340
 issues 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.420
 It can be frustrating but 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.370
 We will try not to give 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.890
 back to the page and well we did 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.370
 our best effort and now I thought 

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.370
 in championships
