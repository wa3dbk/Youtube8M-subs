00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
back over here so we do anyway this is

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.380 
back over here so we do anyway this is
an<00:03:08.020> optional<00:03:08.560> part<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:09.850> particular

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
an optional part of this particular

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.320 
an optional part of this particular
drink<00:03:11.190> take<00:03:12.190> that<00:03:12.370> top<00:03:12.580> off<00:03:12.790> there<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:13.150> just

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
drink take that top off there it's just

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.180 
drink take that top off there it's just
a<00:03:13.420> powder<00:03:13.720> and<00:03:14.050> what<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.650> its<00:03:14.890> high<00:03:15.160> and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
a powder and what this is its high and

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.970 
a powder and what this is its high and
naturally<00:03:15.940> occurring<00:03:16.000> lactose<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.260> I'm<00:03:17.860> going

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
naturally occurring lactose so I'm going

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.430 
naturally occurring lactose so I'm going
to<00:03:18.040> use<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> scoop<00:03:18.580> of<00:03:18.700> that<00:03:19.200> right<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.350> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
to use a scoop of that right in the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.490 
to use a scoop of that right in the
drink<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:21.820> can<00:03:22.030> actually<00:03:22.300> feed<00:03:22.870> lacto

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
drink that can actually feed lacto

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.350 
drink that can actually feed lacto
bacteria<00:03:23.950> because<00:03:24.100> they<00:03:24.190> love<00:03:24.490> lactose<00:03:25.000> and

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
bacteria because they love lactose and

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.200 
bacteria because they love lactose and
they<00:03:25.810> love<00:03:25.990> the<00:03:26.140> starches<00:03:26.740> that<00:03:27.310> are<00:03:27.430> actually

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
they love the starches that are actually

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.030 
they love the starches that are actually
not<00:03:28.450> fully<00:03:28.690> digested<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.560> brown<00:03:29.800> rice

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
not fully digested in that brown rice

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.320 
not fully digested in that brown rice
because<00:03:30.160> it's<00:03:30.400> going<00:03:30.490> to<00:03:30.580> be<00:03:30.700> cold<00:03:31.030> it's

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
because it's going to be cold it's

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.420 
because it's going to be cold it's
called<00:03:31.510> resistant<00:03:32.110> starch<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.980> reaches<00:03:33.400> the

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
called resistant starch that reaches the

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.820 
called resistant starch that reaches the
colon<00:03:33.850> -<00:03:34.030> so<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.240> got<00:03:34.420> a<00:03:34.450> one-two<00:03:34.930> punch<00:03:34.960> for

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
colon - so you got a one-two punch for

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.640 
colon - so you got a one-two punch for
colon<00:03:36.250> health<00:03:36.430> as<00:03:36.790> well<00:03:37.570> as<00:03:37.630> psyllium<00:03:38.530> which

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
colon health as well as psyllium which

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.290 
colon health as well as psyllium which
is<00:03:38.800> fiber<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.280> can<00:03:39.400> pull<00:03:39.580> out<00:03:39.730> cholesterol

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
is fiber that can pull out cholesterol

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.730 
is fiber that can pull out cholesterol
and<00:03:40.420> various<00:03:40.720> things<00:03:40.930> right<00:03:41.200> out<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.410> your

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
and various things right out of your

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.920 
and various things right out of your
colon<00:03:42.100> okay<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:42.940> we<00:03:43.000> got<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.270> banana<00:03:43.600> we<00:03:43.750> got

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
colon okay so we got the banana we got

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.020 
colon okay so we got the banana we got
all<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.260> in<00:03:44.470> there<00:03:44.710> now<00:03:44.890> let<00:03:45.520> me<00:03:45.610> grab<00:03:45.790> some

right here we go we're gonna put in

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.780 
right here we go we're gonna put in
seven<00:04:05.200> ice<00:04:05.350> cubes<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:05.740> make<00:04:05.830> it<00:04:05.950> nice<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.460> icy
