could think it's a just a team of two so

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.290 
could think it's a just a team of two so
we<00:03:30.830> should<00:03:31.040> actually<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.580> fine<00:03:31.850> fighting

we should actually be fine fighting
these<00:03:32.450> people<00:03:32.930> here<00:03:33.080> they<00:03:33.260> don't<00:03:33.440> actually

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
these people here they don't actually

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.870 
these people here they don't actually
have<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:33.980> most<00:03:34.130> look<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.489> person<00:03:34.820> we

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
have the most look this person we

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.580 
have the most look this person we
actually<00:03:35.120> wanted<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.360> kill<00:03:35.600> up<00:03:35.720> cornucopia

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
actually wanted to kill up cornucopia

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.710 
actually wanted to kill up cornucopia
here<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.190> maybe<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:38.000> we<00:03:38.060> can<00:03:38.209> take<00:03:38.360> them<00:03:38.540> out

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
here so maybe that we can take them out

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.170 
here so maybe that we can take them out
a<00:03:38.900> little<00:03:39.140> buddy<00:03:39.380> there<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.459> go<00:03:40.580> we<00:03:40.700> took<00:03:40.880> bow

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180

a little buddy there we go we took bow
to<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.420> amount<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.840> taking<00:03:42.019> them<00:03:42.290> out<00:03:42.410> before

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
to the amount and taking them out before

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.850 
to the amount and taking them out before
they're<00:03:42.980> strong<00:03:43.280> as<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.910> know<00:03:44.030> our<00:03:44.180> motto<00:03:44.450> now

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
they're strong as you know our motto now

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.710 
they're strong as you know our motto now
take<00:03:45.860> them<00:03:45.980> out<00:03:46.100> older<00:03:46.430> week<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:48.140> that<00:03:48.170> up<00:03:49.720> and

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
take them out older week so that up and

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.330 
take them out older week so that up and
then<00:03:50.959> we<00:03:51.050> can<00:03:51.200> go<00:03:51.230> ahead<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.440> craft<00:03:51.800> a<00:03:51.950> diamond

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
then we can go ahead and craft a diamond

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.640 
then we can go ahead and craft a diamond
sword<00:03:52.610> as<00:03:52.790> well<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.360> want<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.080> actually<00:03:54.320> run

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
sword as well I want to actually run

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.810 
sword as well I want to actually run
this<00:03:54.800> route<00:03:55.010> though<00:03:55.190> so<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.400> can<00:03:55.580> get<00:03:55.670> that

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
this route though so I can get that

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.449 
this route though so I can get that
chest<00:03:56.090> plate<00:03:56.360> but<00:03:57.230> might<00:03:57.680> we<00:03:58.100> might<00:03:58.130> actually

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
chest plate but might we might actually

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.910 
chest plate but might we might actually
not<00:03:58.670> be<00:03:58.820> able<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.269> though<00:03:59.480> because

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
not be able to do that though because

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.190 
not be able to do that though because
then<00:04:00.920> they'll<00:04:01.550> probably<00:04:01.970> have<00:04:02.200> deathmatch

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
then they'll probably have deathmatch

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.620 
then they'll probably have deathmatch
button<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:03.769> when<00:04:04.730> actually<00:04:05.030> want<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.209> do<00:04:05.360> is<00:04:05.480> go

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
button so when actually want to do is go

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.810 
button so when actually want to do is go
here<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.560> go<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:06.890> cornucopia<00:04:07.550> and

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
here and you know go to cornucopia and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.470 
here and you know go to cornucopia and
do<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.389> yoozh

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
do the yoozh

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.259 
do the yoozh
actually<00:04:10.110> over<00:04:10.349> here<00:04:10.790> make<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.940> diamond

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
actually over here make the diamond

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.750 
actually over here make the diamond
sword<00:04:12.569> when<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.260> hungry<00:04:13.560> games<00:04:13.709> and<00:04:14.159> I<00:04:14.459> think

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
sword when the hungry games and I think

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.960 
sword when the hungry games and I think
I'm<00:04:15.060> actually<00:04:15.680> probably<00:04:16.699> not<00:04:17.699> going<00:04:17.910> to

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
I'm actually probably not going to

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.240 
I'm actually probably not going to
