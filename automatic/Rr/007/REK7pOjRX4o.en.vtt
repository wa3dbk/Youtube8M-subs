meister<00:00:18.420> fusion<00:00:18.930> but<00:00:19.800> there's<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> lot<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
meister fusion but there's a lot of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.700 
meister fusion but there's a lot of
other<00:00:20.369> packages<00:00:20.880> out<00:00:21.029> there<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.990> does<00:00:22.260> vary<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
other packages out there it does vary a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.340 
other packages out there it does vary a

lot compared with other DJ packages from
the<00:00:25.439> point<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.740> view<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.460> timeline

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the point of view that it's a timeline

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.019 
the point of view that it's a timeline
based<00:00:27.390> system<00:00:27.930> rather<00:00:28.230> than<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.619> twin<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.250> core

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
based system rather than a twin or core

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.560 
based system rather than a twin or core
deck<00:00:30.420> system<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.740> something<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.610> Virtual<00:00:33.450> DJ

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
deck system so something like Virtual DJ

here<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.649> take<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> up<00:01:02.180> file<00:01:03.769> add<00:01:04.820> files<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
here so we take it up file add files to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.550 
here so we take it up file add files to
the<00:01:06.180> library<00:01:08.270> this<00:01:09.270> frame<00:01:09.540> comes<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the library this frame comes up at a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.480 
the library this frame comes up at a
single<00:01:11.010> file<00:01:11.310> an<00:01:11.610> entire<00:01:12.570> folder<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.170> files

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
single file an entire folder of files

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.539 
single file an entire folder of files
and<00:01:15.409> automatically<00:01:16.409> add<00:01:16.530> files<00:01:16.830> by

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
and automatically add files by

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
and automatically add files by
monitoring<00:01:18.060> folders<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
monitoring folders which we do that at a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
monitoring folders which we do that at a
later<00:01:19.740> date<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
later date but for now we're going to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.160 
later date but for now we're going to
add<00:01:21.630> entire<00:01:22.200> folder<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> files<00:01:23.689> if<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.810> go<00:01:24.960> down

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
add entire folder of files if we go down

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.060 
add entire folder of files if we go down
to<00:01:25.229> okay<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.680> view<00:01:28.920> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to okay and then you have the view that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.460 
to okay and then you have the view that
you're<00:01:29.220> probably<00:01:29.400> quite<00:01:29.729> familiar<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:31.020> in

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
you're probably quite familiar with in

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.020 
you're probably quite familiar with in
my<00:01:32.310> case<00:01:33.619> most<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:34.860> music<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.700> hard

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.840 
my case most of my music is on my hard
drive<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> we'll<00:01:38.070> find<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:40.220> coming<00:01:41.220> down

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.770 

here<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.690> my<00:01:46.230> book<00:01:46.440> age<00:01:46.620> so<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
here we go my book age so to do that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.750 
here we go my book age so to do that
music<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:50.130> away<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.610> go

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
music and away we go

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.540 
music and away we go
we<00:01:51.120> would<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.390> press<00:01:51.600> okay<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.290> I've<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.400> so

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
we would then press okay and I've got so

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.180 
we would then press okay and I've got so
much<00:01:53.700> music<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.210> does<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.720> about<00:01:55.080> 40<00:01:55.860> minutes

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
much music it does take about 40 minutes

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.210 
much music it does take about 40 minutes

the<00:01:59.520> tracks<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.970> have<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.750> hard<00:02:00.960> drive

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the tracks I have on that hard drive

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.140 
the tracks I have on that hard drive
and<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> top<00:02:01.830> left-hand<00:02:02.130> corner<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.000> have

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
and the top left-hand corner you have

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.650 
and the top left-hand corner you have
this<00:02:03.330> search<00:02:03.900> section<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.550> is<00:02:05.670> simple<00:02:06.150> as

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.410 

move<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.899> through<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.320> tracks<00:02:14.150> such<00:02:15.150> all

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
move down through the tracks such all

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.420 
move down through the tracks such all
search<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.560> let's<00:02:16.590> just<00:02:17.040> search<00:02:17.220> for

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
search so let's just search for

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.760 
search so let's just search for
something<00:02:20.209> Billie<00:02:21.209> Jane<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.720> here<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.650> have

with another track I've just done

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.069 
with another track I've just done
something<00:02:57.450> randomly<00:02:58.110> here<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.630> now<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.840> can

other<00:03:07.230> moments<00:03:07.650> set<00:03:07.829> up<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> simple

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
other moments set up for a simple

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.479 
other moments set up for a simple
crossfade<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.709> we're<00:03:11.010> gonna<00:03:11.100> hear<00:03:11.340> what<00:03:11.430> that

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
crossfade and we're gonna hear what that

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:23.380 
crossfade and we're gonna hear what that
sounds<00:03:11.970> like

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.030 

that's<00:03:24.390> not<00:03:24.569> absolutely<00:03:25.140> brilliant<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.770> we're

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
that's not absolutely brilliant so we're

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.420 
that's not absolutely brilliant so we're
going<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.190> try<00:03:26.370> something<00:03:26.700> else<00:03:28.310> we're<00:03:29.310> gonna

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
going to try something else we're gonna

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.670 
going to try something else we're gonna
change<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.410> just<00:03:31.410> beat<00:03:31.560> mix<00:03:31.830> eight<00:03:32.130> beat<00:03:32.430> mix

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
change that just beat mix eight beat mix

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:57.040 
change that just beat mix eight beat mix
so<00:03:34.680> if<00:03:34.739> that's<00:03:34.830> any<00:03:34.980> better

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.160 

now<00:03:58.050> it's<00:03:58.200> not<00:03:58.350> bad<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:58.830> not<00:03:58.890> perfect<00:04:00.140> what<00:04:01.140> I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
now it's not bad it's not perfect what I

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.530 
now it's not bad it's not perfect what I
actually<00:04:01.410> think<00:04:01.770> is<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.550> volume<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.180> some<00:04:03.450> of

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
actually think is the volume on some of

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.880 
actually think is the volume on some of
this<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.810> bit<00:04:04.020> low<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.530> I'm<00:04:04.650> going<00:04:04.860> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
this is a bit low so I'm going to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.650 
this is a bit low so I'm going to
increase<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.550> volume<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.030> it's<00:04:06.209> simple<00:04:06.540> as

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
increase the volume and it's simple as

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.760 
increase the volume and it's simple as
drag-and-drop<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:08.069> little<00:04:09.319> round<00:04:10.319> blobs

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
drag-and-drop these little round blobs

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.740 
drag-and-drop these little round blobs
on<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.310> on<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.880> sound<00:04:12.150> volume<00:04:12.990> line<00:04:14.750> and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
on that on the sound volume line and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.470 
on that on the sound volume line and
we're<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:15.990> going<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.760> come<00:04:17.760> up<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.209> little<00:04:18.239> bit

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
we're just going to come up a little bit

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.970 
we're just going to come up a little bit
on<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:19.410> we<00:04:19.560> go

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
on that there we go

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:43.809 
on that there we go
my<00:04:20.760> try<00:04:20.970> again

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.339 

so<00:04:44.819> I<00:04:44.849> hope<00:04:44.969> you<00:04:45.119> found<00:04:45.269> this<00:04:45.419> an<00:04:45.569> interesting

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349 
so I hope you found this an interesting

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.379 
so I hope you found this an interesting
and<00:04:46.649> useful<00:04:46.860> introduction<00:04:47.579> into<00:04:47.969> mixed<00:04:48.239> Maya

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
and useful introduction into mixed Maya

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.809 
and useful introduction into mixed Maya
fusion<00:04:49.349> in<00:04:49.469> this<00:04:49.619> case<00:04:49.860> we're<00:04:50.489> going<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.669> take

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
fusion in this case we're going to take

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.219 
fusion in this case we're going to take
a<00:04:50.849> look<00:04:51.059> at<00:04:51.269> some<00:04:51.449> of<00:04:51.509> the<00:04:51.569> other<00:04:51.719> program

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
a look at some of the other program

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.259 
a look at some of the other program
features<00:04:52.889> and<00:04:53.069> some<00:04:53.489> of<00:04:53.579> the<00:04:53.639> tasks<00:04:53.879> so<00:04:54.119> that

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:54.269 
features and some of the tasks so that

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:55.639 
features and some of the tasks so that
it<00:04:54.329> really<00:04:54.599> gets<00:04:54.779> you<00:04:54.839> up<00:04:55.019> and<00:04:55.199> running<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:55.619> you

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:55.649 
it really gets you up and running so you

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.469 
it really gets you up and running so you
can<00:04:55.829> use<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.099> for<00:04:56.339> performance<00:04:56.909> and<00:04:57.059> if

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
can use it for performance and if

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.209 
can use it for performance and if
nothing<00:04:57.809> else<00:04:57.929> it<00:04:58.499> will<00:04:58.679> make<00:04:58.799> you<00:04:58.919> decide

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
nothing else it will make you decide

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.619 
nothing else it will make you decide
whether<00:04:59.489> it<00:04:59.789> would<00:04:59.939> be<00:04:59.969> a<00:05:00.089> useful<00:05:00.329> bit<00:05:00.569> of

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
whether it would be a useful bit of

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:04.729 
whether it would be a useful bit of
software<00:05:01.079> for<00:05:01.289> you<00:05:01.439> well<00:05:02.039> until<00:05:02.309> next<00:05:02.429> time
