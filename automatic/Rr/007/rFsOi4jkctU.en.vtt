00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello I have a very nice day what 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.839
 I am sending my hair not my hair 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 but the cut that he made me 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.219
 hairdresser that was appears a little bit 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.700
 stuck in the 90s but in a bad way 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.369
 and he left me and bangs around here 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 for something that was used about 15 years ago 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.779
 back and I feel like it's a bit 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.390
 flattering is left to me as crushed here 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.039
 and super bulky down here but I 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.289
 they are going to say your hair is always like this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.990
 no but now it 's worse I do not like it but 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 well I hope the hair grows in some 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.850
 moment and that can not be a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.399
 impediment for this video to reach 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.540
 be uploaded on the internet so good we 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.520
 can show the things that I have finished 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.040
 in the last time and I'm going to start 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.050
 also for some hair this is the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
 conditioner looks at it towards the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 maximum of the baby list mark of the line 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.520
 of argan oil this I bought it the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.829
 last year because I had supposedly 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.739
 made the straightening 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.179
 of keratin the Brazilian cocoa actually 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.739
 I think it was not that I think I 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.920
 they cheated and it was anything else was 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.110
 the bottle stuffed in order the grace of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.689
 this line is that it does not have sulfates like that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.060
 that do not vote the chemicals like that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.000
 as silicones or if you did the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 smoothed those and iu things but I do not 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.960
 I liked it I would not buy it again because 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.060
 I feel that I leave my hair neither too soft nor 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.439
 very hydrated or anything I hope 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 of a conditioner 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.509
 this here is a night mask 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.450
 of the baby phat brand I think it's 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.310
 says this was a gift this line of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.259
 lemon has the grace that is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 supposedly as it helps to whiten your 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.840
 skin to pull out not to pull out completely but 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.330
 that diminish the spots by brands 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.220
 of acne by the sun for age all this 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.159
 series of spots is not that there is 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.840
 finished I have a little bit left but now 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 has this product for almost a year then 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.580
 I believe that it must already be defeated no longer 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.709
 It gives me confidence to use it my skin comes out 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.899
 you can not buy by ebay sale 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.640
 as between 7 thousand to 8 thousand pesos and in 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.890
 reality is a huge amount is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 I do not know of family size also in 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.360
 category products expired or no longer 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.119
 it gives me confidence to use it is this tonic of 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.850
 the mark my love this is a good brand 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.190
 has a page and the grace of these 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.920
 products is that they are 100% natural and you 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.750
 you can customize them so there's a 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.400
 questionnaire you fill in according to the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.800
 characteristics of your skin and what are 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.300
 the effects you want and that's how you put your 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.430
 own ingredients they gave me 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.100
 this out of courtesy along with a gel of 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.480
 cleaning I have the good impression already 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.100
 it's been many months so it has 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.380
 to be beaten because it's something super 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.750
 natural and one day I was not brought in 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.060
 trip and there was too much color and I feel 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.280
 that was cut that has an aroma as well 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.530
 that I do not trust to use it in my house 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.500
 so that's why but I think the site 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.660
 It is a super good body proposal 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.550
 I finished this cream I always put the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.150
 reverse good as well 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.650
 this cream of the brand level all 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.630
 creams that I think of level are 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.910
 spectacular because they are light 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.490
 they absorb super fast and leave the skin 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.680
 with a very long feeling of softness 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.360
 and one of the problems that happens to me with 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.790
 the normal creams is that they are slow 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.290
 heavy I'm given a laziness to use it and 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.360
 besides that when I get in the shower 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.890
 I feel that all the cream comes out or yes 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.830
 that is very hot and with the creams 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.960
 of the level does not happen that so I 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
 I totally recommend this in specific 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.650
 It has no fragrance which can be 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.950
 something good because if it does not compete with your 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.380
 perfume a classic of my finished is 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.440
 the physiological lotion back and gloves 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.240
 the face are being used for years and in 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.430
 my favorite tonic because it does not have 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.070
 alcohol does not irritate my skin and does not even think 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.110
 irritates with all hair tonics 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.630
 I finished this brand treatment 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.820
 kérastase is composed of this first 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.580
 step that is a creampie that you apply 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.490
 from means to ends and a second step that 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.140
 it's like an oil that supposedly 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.220
 he sprayed it but I did not find it like 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.830
 that apply I know that it was 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.880
 directly by hand this line is 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.820
 flame smell 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.300
 slim and what you are looking for is how to maintain your 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.360
 more controlled hair more disciplined more 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.610
 smooth except king lion ' in only five thousand 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.890
 weights each one supposedly reaches 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.140
 for one to two applications depending 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.690
 how much hair you have and how much volume 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.790
 the long but I like I have a little 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.690
 hair reached me for three and the oil 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.700
 milestone left me yes but you to give away 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.250
 twice I applied it, it was the 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.730
 hand with oil and my hair was like 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.650
 but it looks good as if 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.930
 I had butter on it like I did not 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.090
 wash your hair a month if you have bad 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.910
 I go back to wash my hair but I 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.400
 I understand that it is a user error and the 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.380
 time if you have the amount that 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.450
 I had to put the hair down really 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.940
 very nice bright soft and 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.920
 disciplined and finally two things from 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.800
 makeup that are mascara 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.620
 one is this level that is called mega 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.990
 seals seems to me if you give me and I extend them 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.910
 This mask was a gift from Maria 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.340
 Cecilia gave it to me in one of the 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.440
 youtubers boards and subscribers in 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.480
 santiago good and this mask so 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.450
 thank you very much Maria Cecilia has the 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.460
 particularity that has like hairs 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.380
 I am that it sounds a little weird a 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.480
 mask with hair but it is something that several 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.340
 brands have done and in the idea of ​​these 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.170
 hairs that adhere to your lashes and 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.110
 so they look more bulky and more 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.090
 long I love using this one 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.470
 on a mask that is proof of 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.690
 water because it is also low lashes 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.030
 so I can not use it on its own and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.340
 for example the sectional laser of 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.680
 maybelline is a super mask 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.690
 tough you can cry perspire 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.570
 whatever it is and it will keep your lashes 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.130
 curves all day and do not run with 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.500
 nothing really in that super sense 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.240
 good what I do not like much about these 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.730
 masks that tends to leave your eyelashes 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.370
 together not a spider legs effect 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.690
 terrible but without durán you leave effect 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.190
 as well as fan tabs and 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.540
 millions of tabs 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.280
 thank you very much for having seen this 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.870
 video I hope you have between wheat and 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.730
 well I said I have tried some of 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.650
 these products and what were their 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.670
 impressions I send many kisses and 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.670
 see you soon chao
