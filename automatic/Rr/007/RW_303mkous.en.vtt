00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480

 and we're back whoever they are 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.080
 art with a delicious brisket in sauce 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.670
 of sweet pepper I love the recipe 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.740
 because they make two kicks you need 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.220
 many ingredients only a little 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.340
 chicken good chicken breasts and cheese 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.200
 parmesan water salt red pepper 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.270
 these are conserved then not 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.320
 Nazareth in the can keep the caldito and 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.550
 cream and already with this we already have 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.419
 Enough to make some delicious 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.419
 Peppers 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.780
 it's not true they made us good 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 Mars or marry or shipments you look 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.130
 with iu that apart from hear with threads in 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.380
 the cards and now in the cut to eat 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.650
 the good thing cried 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.450
 cried if he hears crying and they came out 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.450
 marmalade tears 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.860
 if the new nickname of cabbages with my 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.560
 desserts and cough and it's a picture for 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.920
 used by courtesy of parakeet like this is 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.430
 to 10 of the effect and we're going to put 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 cook the chicken 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.750
 Saleh support is chicken 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.370
 it smells like that and the other little bitch and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.570
 we are going to feed him 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.570
 also from the other side 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.530
 listen, I need to make a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.990
 clarification before continuing to cook 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.440
 is that articles are coming out 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.680
 everywhere that salt causes 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.350
 hypertension I'll clarify again 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.290
 no no no no no no is the salt is the diet 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.119
 if you eat saturated fat 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.460
 obviously they are going to press 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.650
 arteries of so much cholesterol are not going to 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.170
 to keep getting tighter and tighter 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.119
 blood goes circular less well and then you 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.899
 They blame them no salt salt 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.610
 the fat 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.290
 they came out is not the salt and magazines shells 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.530
 well of these very credible and all the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.080
 roll they took out hardly a reportage that 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.020
 It was very courageous to read because they say yes 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.060
 that increases this episodes of 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.610
 hypoglycemia 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.850
 I put it is needed 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.190
 It really is not that you do not get heart attacks either 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.440
 by salt or actually what 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.560
 causes the infarct what causes 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.020
 really root hypoglycemia or 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.990
 the root problem is cholesterol or 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.800
 the happy ones then you have to try in 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.930
 the problems of talking about the root of the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.900
 what 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.569
 in the salt if it helps to retain water and for 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.709
 the people who have problems like me 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.439
 It's very good for my health because I 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.700
 I have five vagal pieces and then that 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.400
 it helps me have a blood volume 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.530
 but not everyone helps this is a 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.079
 true but you can not blame 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.519
 or point to salt for being guilty of 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.519
 diseases that come from something else 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.850
 blame the blame or be the core of the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.710
 affair 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.550
 I'm going to take a little bit 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.550
 of water nico 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.620
 now he was rejected but not 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.890
 out that the truth because it 's that good 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:37.020
 he accepts them fast 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.020
 and they would already be here picking up all 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.970
 face to face is good to liquefy our 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.700
 delicious sauce that also the pepper 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.420
 I love it because it has so many 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.400
 you get this vitamin beta carotene 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.180
 in the organisms they work like 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.180
 antioxidants 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.580
 it also has vitamins 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.310
 has population 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:11.470
 for those cramps 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:14.709
 22 is good is good food I love 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.709
 and the acacia nano that also spoils you 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.660
 all chilli and help is 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.639
 anticancer what we are going to do 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.430
 Now let's put the salsita here 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.180
 I'm going to do this backwards 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.520
 because this is going to boil 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.410
 and we're going to let the breasts 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.410
 finish cooking in this caldito 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.759
 that they are done here and now 

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:41.470
 then we're going to serve them sprinkled 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:43.870
 with a little Parmesan cheese 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.720

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.849
 what was taking 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.529
 If we're with him, I'll be eating 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.150

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.059
