00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 St 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:12.829
 now had to 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.800
 this ethnic messes up me 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.130
 and now it does not exist 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.940
 he is visible 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.800
 is high 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.800
 that's the way it is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 No 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.310
 that sounds like consequences now 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.310
 good grades 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.650
 he is the mentor Dr 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.450
 that's a big moment 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.590
 i did not have the big benefit thank you 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.230
 the big glacier 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.920
 my big brother is what's up 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 I am glad that you mean that he switched slowly 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.750
 This is only for the whole year 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.380
 these are 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.940
 Analyst Ian 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.780
 the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 so you can nest there 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.620
 we could try it 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.010
 that certainly not 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.669
 It does not have to cost a lot before you start 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:11.609
 I have to dodge the star and Viersen because they are not slower 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:13.709
 do it to her 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.609
 I put 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.010
 the track leads who wins 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.279
 Duisburg 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.660
 the just cause 2 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.879
 Damage by the air 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.009
 already here you will find approx 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.819
 November to 31 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.789
 okay it starts 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.239
 At a signal Soost tries to drive as many doctors as possible 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.479
 that drives the competition again 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:43.479
 Mainz 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.779
 I really need a "little brother" 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.629
 Richard Strauss 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.109
 the sticker of the 12th
