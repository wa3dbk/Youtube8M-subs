hey<00:00:46.890> guys<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.340> Erin<00:00:47.550> Edgar<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> today<00:00:48.360> I'd

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
hey guys I'm Erin Edgar and today I'd

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.690 
hey guys I'm Erin Edgar and today I'd
like<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.780> show<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.200> really<00:00:49.890> simple<00:00:50.070> metric

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
like to show you a really simple metric

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.580 
like to show you a really simple metric
modulation<00:00:50.879> pattern<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.079> know<00:00:52.410> what<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
modulation pattern now I know what you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
modulation pattern now I know what you
think<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> metric<00:00:53.160> modulation<00:00:53.340> sounds<00:00:54.059> scary

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
think in metric modulation sounds scary

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.490 
think in metric modulation sounds scary
you<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> click<00:00:55.020> away<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.350> don't

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you want to click away but don't

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
you want to click away but don't
honestly<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.219> super<00:00:56.550> easy<00:00:56.699> we're<00:00:57.090> gonna<00:00:57.180> get

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
honestly it's super easy we're gonna get

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
honestly it's super easy we're gonna get
there<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.660> literally<00:00:58.079> only<00:00:58.230> three<00:00:58.739> steps<00:00:59.100> now

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
there and literally only three steps now

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.119 
there and literally only three steps now
a<00:00:59.940> metric<00:01:00.239> modulation<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.500> nutshell<00:01:01.680> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
a metric modulation in a nutshell it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.410 
a metric modulation in a nutshell it's
gonna<00:01:02.280> sound<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.609> we're<00:01:02.879> either<00:01:02.969> speeding

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
gonna sound like we're either speeding

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
gonna sound like we're either speeding
up<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.809> slowing<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:04.530> while<00:01:05.040> staying<00:01:05.430> rooted

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
up or slowing down while staying rooted

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
up or slowing down while staying rooted
in<00:01:06.150> our<00:01:06.330> original<00:01:06.810> tempo<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.860> it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
in our original tempo so it's it's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.640 
in our original tempo so it's it's
really<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.970> illusion<00:01:09.330> but<00:01:10.140> again<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
really just an illusion but again I

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 
really just an illusion but again I
can't<00:01:10.830> stress<00:01:11.070> enough<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.340> easy<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
can't stress enough how easy it is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
can't stress enough how easy it is
so<00:01:12.840> three<00:01:13.470> steps<00:01:13.740> let's<00:01:14.280> give<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> try

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
so three steps let's give it a try

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.179 
so three steps let's give it a try
alright<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.750> step<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.290> we're<00:01:16.830> gonna<00:01:16.890> start

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
alright so step one we're gonna start

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.499 
alright so step one we're gonna start
with<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.310> two<00:01:17.549> voices<00:01:17.790> we're<00:01:18.150> gonna<00:01:18.240> start

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
with just two voices we're gonna start

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.060 
with just two voices we're gonna start
with<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:19.049> left<00:01:19.229> foot<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> hi-hat

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
with your left foot on the hi-hat

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.039 
with your left foot on the hi-hat
playing<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.390> quarter<00:01:21.630> notes<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.869> we're<00:01:22.020> just

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
playing just quarter notes so we're just

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
playing just quarter notes so we're just
gonna<00:01:22.200> stay<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> pulse<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> our<00:01:23.580> right

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
gonna stay with the pulse and our right

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
gonna stay with the pulse and our right
hand<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.600> gonna<00:01:25.170> play<00:01:25.409> our<00:01:25.650> change<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
hand is gonna play our change in

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
hand is gonna play our change in
subdivision<00:01:26.759> we're<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.119> gonna<00:01:27.210> go<00:01:27.420> from

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
subdivision we're just gonna go from

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.569 
subdivision we're just gonna go from
straight<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.960> eighth<00:01:28.170> notes<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:29.100> eighth<00:01:29.280> note

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
straight up eighth notes to eighth note

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.819 
straight up eighth notes to eighth note
triplets<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.180> first<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:30.930> our<00:01:31.110> left<00:01:31.350> foot<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
triplets so first up our left foot it's

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
triplets so first up our left foot it's
just<00:01:32.040> super<00:01:32.640> easy<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.270> two<00:01:33.600> three<00:01:34.049> four

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.780 

nothing<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.230> it<00:01:41.320> right<00:01:41.470> okay<00:01:41.980> so<00:01:42.040> now<00:01:42.400> here's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
nothing to it right okay so now here's

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.250 
nothing to it right okay so now here's
where<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.000> gets<00:01:43.120> a<00:01:43.180> little<00:01:43.270> tricky<00:01:43.660> we're

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
where it gets a little tricky we're

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.620 
where it gets a little tricky we're
gonna<00:01:44.410> go<00:01:44.590> from<00:01:44.770> having<00:01:45.160> two<00:01:45.490> notes<00:01:45.760> for<00:01:46.390> every

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
gonna go from having two notes for every

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.210 
gonna go from having two notes for every
one<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.810> those<00:01:46.990> with<00:01:47.230> our<00:01:47.260> right<00:01:47.560> hand<00:01:47.590> two

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
one of those with our right hand two

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.160 
one of those with our right hand two
three<00:01:48.580> notes<00:01:48.820> for<00:01:49.570> every<00:01:49.750> one<00:01:49.870> of<00:01:49.900> these<00:01:50.020> are

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
three notes for every one of these are

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.780 
three notes for every one of these are
the<00:01:50.230> right<00:01:50.440> hand<00:01:50.650> I'll<00:01:50.890> go<00:01:51.070> back<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.520> forth

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
the right hand I'll go back and forth

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:33.770 
the right hand I'll go back and forth
just<00:01:52.750> within<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.140> bar<00:01:53.350> nice<00:01:53.650> and<00:01:53.830> slow<00:01:53.980> for<00:01:54.010> you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.720 

alright<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:34.840> once<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.470> that

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
alright so once you have that

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.190 
alright so once you have that
internalized<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.020> make<00:02:38.170> sure

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
internalized and you have to make sure

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.110 
internalized and you have to make sure
that<00:02:38.770> you<00:02:38.980> have<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.220> really<00:02:39.430> internalized

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
that you have that really internalized

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.940 
that you have that really internalized
cuz<00:02:40.480> we're<00:02:40.930> gonna<00:02:41.020> play<00:02:41.260> some<00:02:41.320> stuff<00:02:41.620> over<00:02:41.890> it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
cuz we're gonna play some stuff over it

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.830 
cuz we're gonna play some stuff over it
that<00:02:42.040> might<00:02:42.220> seem<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> little<00:02:42.550> bit<00:02:42.730> weird<00:02:42.850> then

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
that might seem a little bit weird then

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.600 
that might seem a little bit weird then
it's<00:02:43.989> time<00:02:44.140> for<00:02:44.170> step<00:02:44.500> two<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:45.190> step<00:02:45.370> two

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
it's time for step two for step two

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.940 
it's time for step two for step two
we're<00:02:46.060> gonna<00:02:46.180> add<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.720> bass<00:02:46.900> drum<00:02:47.230> now<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
we're gonna add the bass drum now the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.490 
we're gonna add the bass drum now the
bass<00:02:48.220> drum<00:02:48.520> is<00:02:48.730> going<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.030> play<00:02:49.180> every<00:02:49.720> second

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
bass drum is going to play every second

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.100 
bass drum is going to play every second
note<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.340> right<00:02:51.550> hand<00:02:51.790> plays

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
note that the right hand plays

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.690 
note that the right hand plays
regardless<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> subdivision<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.520> when

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
regardless of the subdivision so when

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.979 
regardless of the subdivision so when
we're<00:02:54.850> playing<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.239> eighth<00:02:55.450> notes<00:02:55.780> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
we're playing with the eighth notes and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.930 
we're playing with the eighth notes and
we're<00:02:56.320> counting<00:02:56.410> one<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.130> two<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.580> three<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
we're counting one and two and three and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.150 
we're counting one and two and three and
four<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.600> it's<00:02:59.230> gonna<00:02:59.350> line<00:02:59.560> up<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.800> all<00:03:00.010> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.370 
numbers so one and two and three and
four<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.730> then<00:03:04.600> when<00:03:04.959> we<00:03:05.050> get<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.290> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
four and then when we get to the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.260 
four and then when we get to the
triplets<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.010> we're<00:03:06.310> counting<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.940> triplet

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
triplets and we're counting one triplet

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630 
triplets and we're counting one triplet
two<00:03:07.480> triplet<00:03:07.720> three<00:03:08.200> triplet<00:03:08.500> four<00:03:08.890> triplet

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
two triplet three triplet four triplet

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.510 
two triplet three triplet four triplet
it's<00:03:10.060> gonna<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.360> every<00:03:10.780> second<00:03:11.560> note<00:03:11.830> starting

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
it's gonna be every second note starting

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.850 
it's gonna be every second note starting
on<00:03:12.670> beat<00:03:12.820> one<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.630> one<00:03:14.050> triplet<00:03:14.380> two<00:03:14.650> triplet

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
on beat one so one triplet two triplet

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.570 
on beat one so one triplet two triplet
three<00:03:15.400> trip<00:03:15.940> four<00:03:16.450> triplet<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:17.230> know<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.280> sounds

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
three trip four triplet I know it sounds

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.280 
three trip four triplet I know it sounds
a<00:03:18.640> little<00:03:18.700> weird<00:03:18.850> just<00:03:19.690> listen<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.050> let's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
a little weird just listen to it let's

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:59.460 
a little weird just listen to it let's
check<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.530> out

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.990 

all<00:04:00.470> right<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:00.830> for<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.220> third<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.730> final

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
all right so for the third and final

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.600 
all right so for the third and final
step<00:04:02.420> we're<00:04:02.750> gonna<00:04:02.840> add<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.680> snare<00:04:03.950> drum<00:04:04.190> now

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
step we're gonna add the snare drum now

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.750 
step we're gonna add the snare drum now
the<00:04:04.670> snare<00:04:04.970> drum<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.330> gonna<00:04:05.510> play<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:05.959> every

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
the snare drum is gonna play on every

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.400 
the snare drum is gonna play on every
second<00:04:07.760> bass<00:04:08.060> drum<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:08.930> essentially<00:04:09.290> we're

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
second bass drum so essentially we're

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.960 
second bass drum so essentially we're
taking<00:04:09.620> a<00:04:09.709> four<00:04:09.890> on<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.100> floor<00:04:10.250> pattern<00:04:10.790> and

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
taking a four on the floor pattern and

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.520 
taking a four on the floor pattern and
we're<00:04:11.510> making<00:04:12.080> it<00:04:12.140> sound<00:04:12.260> like<00:04:12.380> we're

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
we're making it sound like we're

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.650 
we're making it sound like we're
speeding<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:12.980> up<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.209> snare<00:04:14.420> drum<00:04:14.569> is

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
speeding it up so the snare drum is

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.630 
speeding it up so the snare drum is
gonna<00:04:14.810> line<00:04:15.019> up<00:04:15.050> on<00:04:15.350> well<00:04:16.010> beats<00:04:16.220> two<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:16.489> four

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
gonna line up on well beats two and four

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.979 
gonna line up on well beats two and four
when<00:04:16.970> they're<00:04:17.060> doing<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.299> eighth<00:04:17.419> felts<00:04:17.810> so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
when they're doing the eighth felts so

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.090 
when they're doing the eighth felts so
just<00:04:18.200> one<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.680> two<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.489> three<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:20.299> four<00:04:20.630> and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
just one and two and three and four and

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.350 
just one and two and three and four and
but<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:22.220> when<00:04:22.340> we<00:04:22.370> get<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.729> triplets

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
but then when we get to the triplets

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.120 
but then when we get to the triplets
it's<00:04:24.020> a<00:04:24.110> little<00:04:24.380> bit<00:04:24.500> more<00:04:24.620> strange<00:04:24.950> it's

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
it's a little bit more strange it's

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.159 
it's a little bit more strange it's
gonna<00:04:25.250> sound<00:04:25.460> like<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:25.790> one<00:04:26.630> triplet<00:04:26.930> two

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
gonna sound like this one triplet two

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.590 
gonna sound like this one triplet two
triplet<00:04:27.380> three<00:04:27.919> triplet<00:04:28.190> four<00:04:28.669> triplet<00:04:28.910> 1

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
triplet three triplet four triplet 1

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.950 
triplet three triplet four triplet 1
triplet<00:04:29.630> 2<00:04:30.139> triplet<00:04:30.350> 3<00:04:30.860> triplet<00:04:31.100> 4<00:04:31.610> triplet<00:04:31.960> so

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet so

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.540 
triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet so
pay<00:04:33.560> attention<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:34.100> where<00:04:34.250> your<00:04:34.370> bass<00:04:34.520> drum

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
pay attention to where your bass drum

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.850 
pay attention to where your bass drum
goes<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.270> just<00:04:35.479> lands<00:04:35.660> up<00:04:35.810> with<00:04:35.960> every<00:04:36.320> second

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
goes it just lands up with every second

00:04:36.860 --> 00:05:24.550 
goes it just lands up with every second
one<00:04:37.040> of<00:04:37.160> them

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.710 

all<00:05:25.560> right<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:25.889> that's<00:05:26.250> all<00:05:26.580> three<00:05:27.060> steps<00:05:27.360> for

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
all right so that's all three steps for

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.570 
all right so that's all three steps for
putting<00:05:28.169> together<00:05:28.259> this<00:05:28.800> metric<00:05:29.370> modulation

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
putting together this metric modulation

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.760 
putting together this metric modulation
pattern<00:05:30.419> yeah<00:05:30.720> make<00:05:31.020> sure<00:05:31.139> you<00:05:31.289> print<00:05:31.500> out<00:05:31.710> the

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
pattern yeah make sure you print out the

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.920 
pattern yeah make sure you print out the
free<00:05:32.190> PDF<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.820> comes<00:05:32.970> along<00:05:33.240> with<00:05:33.389> this<00:05:33.570> that

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
free PDF that comes along with this that

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.540 
free PDF that comes along with this that
way<00:05:34.020> you<00:05:34.169> can<00:05:34.350> take<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:34.949> your<00:05:35.009> drumset<00:05:35.520> and

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
way you can take it to your drumset and

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.430 
way you can take it to your drumset and
you<00:05:35.910> can<00:05:36.030> really<00:05:36.180> follow<00:05:36.539> along<00:05:36.810> and<00:05:37.020> practice

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
you can really follow along and practice

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.620 
you can really follow along and practice
and<00:05:37.590> make<00:05:37.680> sure<00:05:37.830> everything's<00:05:38.100> lining<00:05:38.340> up

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
and make sure everything's lining up

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.260 
and make sure everything's lining up
another<00:05:39.650> essentially<00:05:40.650> mandatory<00:05:41.490> thing<00:05:41.880> with

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
another essentially mandatory thing with

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.700 
another essentially mandatory thing with
this<00:05:42.389> is<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:42.690> you<00:05:42.750> do<00:05:42.990> these<00:05:43.199> with<00:05:43.680> a

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
this is that you do these with a

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.460 
this is that you do these with a
metronome<00:05:44.479> without<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.509> metronome<00:05:45.870> you'll

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
metronome without a metronome you'll

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.749 
metronome without a metronome you'll
never<00:05:46.650> be<00:05:46.800> a<00:05:46.830> hundred<00:05:47.250> percent<00:05:47.310> sure<00:05:47.550> if

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
never be a hundred percent sure if

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.629 
never be a hundred percent sure if
you're<00:05:47.910> speeding<00:05:48.270> up<00:05:48.389> or<00:05:48.570> slowing<00:05:48.630> down

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
you're speeding up or slowing down

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.040 
you're speeding up or slowing down
exactly<00:05:50.639> where<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:50.970> needs<00:05:51.150> to<00:05:51.360> be<00:05:51.509> and<00:05:51.750> I<00:05:51.900> mean

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
exactly where it needs to be and I mean

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.749 
exactly where it needs to be and I mean
if<00:05:52.650> it<00:05:52.770> doesn't<00:05:52.860> line<00:05:53.100> up<00:05:53.220> exactly<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:53.669> way

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
if it doesn't line up exactly the way

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.980 
if it doesn't line up exactly the way
it's<00:05:53.880> supposed<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.180> be<00:05:54.300> it's<00:05:54.479> just<00:05:54.539> gonna<00:05:54.810> fall

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
it's supposed to be it's just gonna fall

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.420 
it's supposed to be it's just gonna fall
apart<00:05:55.259> when<00:05:55.380> you<00:05:55.440> try<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.740> use<00:05:55.949> it<00:05:55.979> in<00:05:56.220> any

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
apart when you try and use it in any

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.060 
apart when you try and use it in any
sort<00:05:56.669> of<00:05:56.759> application<00:05:57.199> all<00:05:58.199> right<00:05:58.380> so<00:05:58.530> thanks
