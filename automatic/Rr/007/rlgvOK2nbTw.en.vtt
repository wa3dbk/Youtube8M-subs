legs you'll want to make about two dots

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.899 
legs you'll want to make about two dots
then<00:01:23.930> so<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.500> roll<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.700> couple

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
then so that we can roll it up a couple

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.050 
then so that we can roll it up a couple
times<00:01:27.060> you're<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.110> add<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:29.579> two

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
times you're going to add on about two

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
times you're going to add on about two
inches<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:31.049> more<00:01:32.630> this<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.990> only<00:01:34.500> added<00:01:34.860> one

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
inches or more this I only added one

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.539 
inches or more this I only added one
inch<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.890> pair<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.369> bit

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
inch so this is this pair is a bit

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749 
inch so this is this pair is a bit
shorter<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:40.110> here<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> bit

shorter but here I want it to be a bit

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.230 
shorter but here I want it to be a bit
longer<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:43.549> I'm<00:01:44.549> adding<00:01:45.119> two<00:01:45.720> inches<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:47.240> this

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
longer so I'm adding two inches if this

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480 
longer so I'm adding two inches if this

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.009 
we're going to fold up to the first
measurement<00:03:20.900> we<00:03:21.260> made<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.480> first<00:03:23.750> we're

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
measurement we made but first we're

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.699 
measurement we made but first we're
going<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.200> stretch<00:03:24.530> this<00:03:24.799> out<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:27.230> that<00:03:27.260> the
