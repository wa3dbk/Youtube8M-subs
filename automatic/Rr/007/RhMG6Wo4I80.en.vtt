I want to talk to you a little bit about

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.830 
I want to talk to you a little bit about
intervals<00:00:12.250> what<00:00:13.059> is<00:00:13.179> an<00:00:13.330> interval<00:00:13.690> on

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
intervals what is an interval on

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.739 
intervals what is an interval on
interval<00:00:14.530> is<00:00:14.769> the<00:00:14.800> space<00:00:15.400> between<00:00:15.849> two<00:00:16.179> notes

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:18.749 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:25.849 

there<00:00:19.749> we<00:00:19.989> have<00:00:20.199> what<00:00:20.560> is<00:00:20.679> called<00:00:20.890> a<00:00:21.189> second

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859 

that<00:00:26.859> is<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.159> third<00:00:27.550> between<00:00:27.849> C<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.329> E<00:00:28.599> is<00:00:28.809> a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
that is a third between C and E is a

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.010 
that is a third between C and E is a
third<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:30.789> I<00:00:30.939> go<00:00:31.119> from<00:00:31.329> C<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:32.469> F

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
third if I go from C to F

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.730 
third if I go from C to F
there<00:00:34.650> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.780> fourth<00:00:37.610> C<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.850> G<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:40.130> fifth<00:00:42.740> C

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
there we have a fourth C to G a fifth C

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:55.210 
there we have a fourth C to G a fifth C
to<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.960> sixth<00:00:47.600> C<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:49.080> a<00:00:49.820> seventh<00:00:53.540> C<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.720> C

to a a sixth C to be a seventh C to C
it's<00:00:56.220> called<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.610> octave<00:00:56.870> I'm<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.260> to

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
it's called an octave I'm just going to

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's called an octave I'm just going to
stop<00:00:58.530> there<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.040> keep<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.580> up<00:00:59.930> but

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
stop there we can keep going up but

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.470 
stop there we can keep going up but
that's<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.320> basic<00:01:01.920> intervals<00:01:02.340> now<00:01:03.060> each<00:01:03.300> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
that's your basic intervals now each of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
that's your basic intervals now each of
those<00:01:03.600> intervals<00:01:04.760> has<00:01:05.810> within<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.140> it's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
those intervals has within it it's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.800 
those intervals has within it it's
broken<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:08.010> even<00:01:08.370> more<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.850> said<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
broken down even more I said this is the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.280 
broken down even more I said this is the
second<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.130> true<00:01:11.750> well<00:01:12.750> let's<00:01:12.930> start<00:01:13.200> at

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
second that is true well let's start at

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
second that is true well let's start at
the<00:01:13.410> C<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.250> we'll<00:01:14.369> play<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> black<00:01:15.030> key<00:01:15.390> next

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the C and we'll play the black key next

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.100 
the C and we'll play the black key next
to<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.250> C<00:01:17.250> sharp

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
to it C sharp

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.600 
to it C sharp
well<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.440> called<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.950> minor<00:01:20.580> second<00:01:21.350> now<00:01:22.610> C

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
well that is called a minor second now C

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
to D is called a major second so we have

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.140 
to D is called a major second so we have
a<00:01:28.470> minor<00:01:28.800> second<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> major<00:01:30.990> second<00:01:32.150> now

a minor second and a major second now
after<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> second<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.170> played<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.979> third<00:01:36.830> well

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
after a second I played a third well

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.460 
after a second I played a third well
that<00:01:38.009> third<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:38.610> there<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:39.780> called<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.229> major

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
that third right there is called a major

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.070 
that third right there is called a major
third<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.789> play<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.179> black<00:01:42.420> note<00:01:42.780> just

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
third if we play the black note just

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.770 
third if we play the black note just
below<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:45.690> called<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.200> minor<00:01:46.740> third

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
below it that is called a minor third

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.850 
below it that is called a minor third
now<00:01:48.780> let's<00:01:49.020> play<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.229> fourth<00:01:51.350> that<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.590> called

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
now let's play the fourth that is called

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.260 
now let's play the fourth that is called
a<00:01:53.100> perfect<00:01:53.550> fourth<00:01:54.560> now<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.830> play<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a perfect fourth now if we play the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.120 
a perfect fourth now if we play the
black<00:01:57.539> key<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.140> above<00:01:58.470> it<00:01:58.880> it's<00:01:59.880> called<00:02:00.240> an

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
black key just above it it's called an

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.040 
black key just above it it's called an
Augmented<00:02:02.130> fourth<00:02:02.630> augmented<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.899> it's

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
Augmented fourth augmented because it's

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.419 
Augmented fourth augmented because it's
raised<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:05.700> can<00:02:05.880> also<00:02:06.149> call<00:02:06.660> that<00:02:07.429> something

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
raised we can also call that something

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.140 
raised we can also call that something
based<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.060> our<00:02:09.179> next<00:02:09.509> interval<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.080> fifth<00:02:11.150> which

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
based on our next interval a fifth which

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.240 
based on our next interval a fifth which
is<00:02:12.300> also<00:02:12.480> called<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.960> perfect<00:02:13.230> fifth<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.160> we

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
is also called a perfect fifth so we

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.400 
is also called a perfect fifth so we
have<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> perfect<00:02:14.850> fourth

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
have a perfect fourth

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.820 
have a perfect fourth
and<00:02:16.650> I've<00:02:16.980> minted<00:02:17.670> forth<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.900> now<00:02:19.560> we<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.800> a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and I've minted forth and now we have a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.290 
and I've minted forth and now we have a
perfect<00:02:20.340> fit

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
perfect fit

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.210 
perfect fit
just<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.080> throw<00:02:23.260> something<00:02:23.530> little<00:02:23.740> crazy<00:02:24.040> in

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
just to throw something little crazy in

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.310 
just to throw something little crazy in
here<00:02:24.370> we<00:02:24.520> can<00:02:24.700> also<00:02:24.850> call<00:02:25.270> this<00:02:25.600> interval<00:02:26.260> here

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
here we can also call this interval here

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.840 
here we can also call this interval here
a<00:02:27.870> diminished<00:02:28.870> fifth<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> diminished<00:02:30.790> fifth

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
a diminished fifth so a diminished fifth

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.780 
a diminished fifth so a diminished fifth
and<00:02:31.750> an<00:02:32.350> Augmented<00:02:32.860> fourth<00:02:33.100> of<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> same

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
and an Augmented fourth of the same

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.370 
and an Augmented fourth of the same
thing

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
thing

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.100 
thing
stay<00:02:35.380> with<00:02:35.560> me<00:02:35.710> here<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.490> we've<00:02:36.640> gone<00:02:37.110> second

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
stay with me here so we've gone second

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.170 
stay with me here so we've gone second
third<00:02:38.290> fourth<00:02:38.620> fifth<00:02:38.710> so<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.880> have<00:02:40.030> to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
third fourth fifth so then we have to

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
third fourth fifth so then we have to
see<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.430> a<00:02:42.460> major<00:02:42.730> six<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:44.050> I

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
see to the a that is a major six if I

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.480
