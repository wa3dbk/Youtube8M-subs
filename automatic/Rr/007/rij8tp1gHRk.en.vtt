00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.079
 It was the first time so I totally 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.490
 heartbeat came when the call came and it 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.840
 is still so we have ourselves 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.460
 actually deliberately too short care 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.960
 Determined look at work there 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.070
 the sense shone brightly there 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.700
 no matter what you do 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.410
 there is no formula for it you have to 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.410
 want and then we go 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.149
 I'm actually in an age now 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.460
 and at a point where I thought 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.500
 now I have no children anymore 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.120
 are all already independent and do 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860
 but what would it be on the other side? 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 also very boring and mine 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.019
 actually three wanted four children per 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.239
 from the beginning we knew 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.739
 but a second child we saw 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.299
 that around us 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.299
 also here in berlin needy 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.549
 are children and we said okay 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.049
 city ​​itself children to the world too 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:12.470
 The other children also want to bring 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.119
 help 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.640
 who has that in his life always 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.259
 new situations new people 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.600
 to get to know my wife loves completely 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.580
 especially small children so the smaller 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.970
 the better i have such a great one 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.440
 It does not work that way every day 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.000
 but always something new 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:35.360
 exciting the social network is growing 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.759
 So just offer the neighbors 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.929
 out of help 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.509
 the communities in which one stands 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.390
 when they hear that my wife is ill 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.229
 then I can expect that here 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.110
 regularly brought to us with hot 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.060
 that is true though i still think so 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.080
 amazing but that is not so 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.590
 last because of the children 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.179
 tell how bad I cook 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.299
 Somehow what a part of mine 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.570
 the children were alive at the same time 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.570
 grown up 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.100
 She said that it was the family thing and 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.899
 if one says no then it is no 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.110
 because you can only do that as a family 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.819
 Being together makes beautiful is just small 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.970
 Children do not hold themselves 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.580
 can help to help 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.780
 Incidentally, it was missing for that could 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.780
 you do not do it alone 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.760
 the grandma of us is always on 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.890
 leave my husband he does just that 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.890
 like and my girls on 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.970
 this child then goes to another 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.890
 family where it is just as good and 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.870
 then we make a big fire vienna 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.150
 birthday party is out of it then 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.910
 actually for that is a new beginning 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.580
 I have a say my darling 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.970
 book purchased there comes the photo 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.040
 string the story of the child and 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.870
 That I look at it when I am completely 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.110
 I'll be so sad 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.030
 most of the children in relative 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.280
 happy circumstances come and it is 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.750
 I think something great for the kid and 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.209
 for us for our family at home 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.680
 cut for us and find a new one 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.680
 live on section for the child 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 there are situations there you stand 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.220
 Friday afternoon the child is ill 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.930
 become 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.160
 I used to stand up completely then 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.269
 alone there I have a mobile phone 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.160
 my supervisor can call numbers no matter what 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.040
 what questions you have right now 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.109
 you can push yourself to the waves 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.850
 and then you get my speech and 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:44.090
 answer that makes your heart beat 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.190
 with me that i think that now 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.530
 a child has been announced 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.959
 how will that be is we enjoy yes 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.100
 to do that good again and again 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:59.019
 to be with children 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:02.870
 Living a life that looks green 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.459
 and this is contagious on wages 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.019
 not just for one who does not 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.530
 come home and the children smile 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.010
 me on 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.329
 So that's what you can say with words 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.329
 Do not tell that you have to experience
