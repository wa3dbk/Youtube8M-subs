00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.899
 hello marie so van holland shop 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.630
 and today we are going to look at the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.769
 The telis 1 and 2 channels therefore have four of them 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.650
 somfy 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.680
 all recent rts channels so they work 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.910
 only together with fts engines 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.770
 You can of course also use a standard 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.710
 engine and rts engine by one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.970
 external receiver and rts 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.560
 recipient of somfy 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.630
 but it does not work together with others 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.550
 Wireless must hear from other brands 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 nor with the io system from 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.940
 Thumpy so keep that in mind if you like 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.200
 look for which channel you prefer 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.820
 use 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 well they have to watch we have and one 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 tail is one so this that is bill 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 channel channel and this is the second is 4 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.879
 so if they are basically the same channel 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.190
 but with four channels that is 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.840
 your four individual shutters or 4 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.719
 groups of shutters can operate in 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 A group means that is until its in 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.469
 multiple shutters that are on a channel 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.449
 so you can also use it in it 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.949
 to control multiple shutters such as 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.239
 you say well i want i have three euros 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.059
 but I always use them 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.680
 at the same time that is always on the cell 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.630
 time closes just open the babies 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 just have to take a channel or one 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 channel on a during via 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.299
 sender 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 those are many characteristics of the channel they 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.930
 be lived with a hanging eye 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.189
 So it's always handy to have a landline 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.810
 place for you to search because you 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.830
 if you let it swing of course 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.869
 everything can be lost 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.299
 because is not convenient and also natural 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.430
 to view which channel at which 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.840
 heard online if you are different 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.100
 are loose if use of different 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.329
 blinds 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.710
 another tip is also to the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810
 back to use just one 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 sticker 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.280
 with the name of the roll ipod windows one 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.930
 or kitchen window or living room living room 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.759
 So your car knows that if you are different 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.159
 transmitters have three the right at the right 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.229
 place and you can also right 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.939
 operate the device thanks to the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.890
 beyond 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.200
 you have a lot of up and down button and the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.240
 mowing gets up via buttons my 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.219
 he can have two functions as 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.869
 the roller shutter is in motion, the my 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.729
 button sure you can just him 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.630
 stop so he acts as nothing 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.340
 otherwise the girl and at the stop button 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.899
 belong function and that is actually one 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 intermediate position in that is quite unique 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.099
 for the somfy service and that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.670
 can be called freely between positions 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.220
 I freely set 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.690
 and she wants to say that you finally like 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.430
 the roller shutter is standing still 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.530
 press the like button and then go to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 to your preferred position 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.940
 and then I said a state that between the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.650
 fully closed and fully open position 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.569
 and I drove is free choose by even 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.550
 five seconds the button 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.410
 my hold on when there oh nice 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.250
 is in the position where you want it and 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.350
 then it is 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.840
 that position locked that you can hit 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.330
 also always change as the would 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.880
 useful function than what is then one 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.890
 different on the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.239
 telis 4 compared to the thing is one 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.150
 you see the same buttons for the 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.519
 operation for on stop the my function 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.410
 but otherwise you see a selection button 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.239
 and fell slightly and so also determine here 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.590
 which are going to serve online because you 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.660
 so having four channels is this 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.680
 actually the button below the the switch 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.780
 can make channel into a channel 2 so 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.230
 You can also see that I am changing here now 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.230
 of channel 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.910
 as you can see there is a telis 4 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.440
 between his four and valleys but there is also 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.299
 a free where they all sit 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.989
 so actually you have on your five channels 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.989
 available 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.040
 so it's the differences between the 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.840
 two different channels there are the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.030
 other RTS channels too but these are 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.120
 dike the most used search because 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.829
 version of you have a question about peace 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.200
 or know if you have price information 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.180
 need then you can go aww online shop 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.100
 point b

 look in the parts section and there 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.030
 the controls are all listed 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.590
