00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 where we are a video of channel 123 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.280
 physics 1 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.450
 I 'll teach you here how to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.940
 making model airplane wheel paa 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.969
 looks is very soft absorbs better 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.969
 impact 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.820
 I know nowadays they are cheap in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.160
 internet, but it's time that you did not 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.239
 There is the blessed little wheel, right? 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.110
 or is it that you buy her the wrong measure 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:43.680
 such 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:46.770
 You 'll need to call him to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.969
 You go to stationery that is a piece and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.550
 40 30 centimeters 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.180
 cockroach has several far this 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 here is 4mm thick and will 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 giving a wheel with 34 16 will give a 17 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.890
 millimeters by 8.7 inches wide 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:12.360
 Good. You can jog anytime. 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.369
 Size you have to do 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.450
 suppose that here is a cut of 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.360
 paper can be paper week center 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.259
 does an x ​​on paper 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:29.579
 I think center you mark after the center 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 of the wheel then you will need to see the 1 not 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:35.040
 needs wheels and needs a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.240
 paper cut in circumference a 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.720
 lollipop well but not really 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.110
 enjoy the sun path is using the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.200
 favorite because I use people rod of 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.149
 two millimeters and 40 by bicycle 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.570
 then the path will serve to rotate the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.920
 wheel on the axle 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.159
 Come on, let's have a conference around. 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.850
 and you see, we 've already cut off people here 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.410
 to accelerate video clip category 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.320
 It's going to stay like this, it will not stay. 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.170
 perfect still right 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:22.360
 I already put some speed up the video 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.370
 well we have the xi conference we have the ipva 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.270
 the lollipop that in the case of the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.370
 Rod 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.880
 in the case of using the mirim there I think 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:38.440
 little tube is not just outlast 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:42.640
 whether you rode within the next turn 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.070
 of the central axis of that glue 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.240
 cobbler here in the house material 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.910
 construction has a contact glue going 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:58.770
 pass our superbond you strip 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.770
 apple tree is in the wheel welcome it 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.349
 an act that here in the glue on both sides 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.349
 I'm going to touch 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.180
 the one I do with only four 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:28.050
 it is safe to squeeze some glue 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.210
 then contact the next one that has to 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.880
 wait a little bit for them and cellars and 16 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.370
 walkways for 13 minutes five 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:41.520
 minutes there they lie on ipea 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:46.550
 Although always liked the good glue is the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:49.680
 next you can see the one that is ready is 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.740
 she only has this because she thinks she's 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.150
 anything like saying is not circular is 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:00.810
 So you pick up a 150/200 sandpaper. 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.310
 to spend years on the wheel until she 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.630
 lisinha 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.700
 otherwise you run with it not much 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.410
 centralized that will be very smooth 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.190
 here it is also with time that she 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:19.049
 go start here let's do 1 x 1 if 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.160
 You have the ruler and okay I use with 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:27.660
 what else is the rule 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:31.010
 4.2 the half will be doing a 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.010
 fast medium video gets big 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:39.319
 here is the following 

00:04:36.299 --> 00:04:39.319
 I found the center 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:50.509
 I'll stick whatever it is, people. 

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:50.509
 I punctured it out there on the other side. 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:05:00.169
 now, the next thing is to demonstrate 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:05:00.169
 here because there's nothing like me 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:07.979
 in the glue it takes to be each cut 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:12.299
 pilot will glue here inside the 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.099
 hole and pass glue on the curd to dry one 

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:18.509
 A little bit anyway, once 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:21.619
 crosses without right to it not 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.619
 get very crooked 

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:32.249
 the new ready diet will not 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:44.350
 a real one to do if you want to see 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:50.600
 I do not know if the light will help there. 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:52.610
 seven people here you can do the 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.210
 size the size of the wheel you 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.060
 want to 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.880
 sure is the size of the shaft 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.880
 leaves a distance off the wheel 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.220
 because the shaft does not hit aquino 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:14.780
 You'll get two on the street line. 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:19.300
 iron glue around puts it so put 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:23.600
 she also sells glue put it here 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.090
 also in the end it will stay this way because 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.310
 if it suffers the impact of that impact 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:35.240
 in the alley and will not form the good wheel 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:38.120
 We thank everyone there and click 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.310
 I liked it, the channel fx helps there 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.640
 We keep making more video, okay? 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.420
 good 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.420
 thank you all
