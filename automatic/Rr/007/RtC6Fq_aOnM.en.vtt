Aglio olio first thing we need to do is
to<00:00:15.160> start<00:00:15.429> heating<00:00:15.820> our<00:00:15.940> water<00:00:16.180> up<00:00:16.950> we're

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
to start heating our water up we're

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
both of those nice and hot just when

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.910 
both of those nice and hot just when
your<00:00:28.240> water<00:00:28.390> gets<00:00:28.720> hot<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.199> starts<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:29.680> steam

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
your water gets hot and starts to steam

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.450 
your water gets hot and starts to steam
and<00:00:30.130> boil<00:00:30.340> that's<00:00:30.760> when<00:00:30.939> you<00:00:31.060> need<00:00:31.180> to<00:00:31.240> salt<00:00:31.570> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
and boil that's when you need to salt it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.410 
and boil that's when you need to salt it
putting<00:00:33.460> salt<00:00:33.699> in<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:33.940> water<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.330> gonna

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
putting salt in the water is gonna

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.729 
putting salt in the water is gonna
actually<00:00:34.780> raise<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:34.989> boiling<00:00:35.440> temperature

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
actually raise the boiling temperature

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.260 
actually raise the boiling temperature
which<00:00:36.370> mean<00:00:36.550> it's<00:00:36.670> going<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:36.850> take<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.059> little

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
which mean it's going to take a little

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.970 
which mean it's going to take a little
longer<00:00:37.450> to<00:00:37.719> boil<00:00:37.930> that's<00:00:38.380> why<00:00:38.590> you<00:00:38.649> want<00:00:38.890> to

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
longer to boil that's why you want to

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.310 
longer to boil that's why you want to
get<00:00:39.100> it<00:00:39.250> when<00:00:39.460> it's<00:00:39.610> already<00:00:39.760> boiling<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:44.290> now

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
get it when it's already boiling and now

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.229 
get it when it's already boiling and now
that<00:00:44.980> that<00:00:45.129> is<00:00:45.190> boiling<00:00:45.550> we're<00:00:45.940> just<00:00:46.090> going<00:00:46.210> to

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
that that is boiling we're just going to

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:54.510 
that that is boiling we're just going to
drop<00:00:46.480> our<00:00:46.719> linguine<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:49.629> pound<00:00:51.600> right<00:00:52.600> in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
drop our linguine in one pound right in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
after about three minutes you want to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.140 
after about three minutes you want to
give<00:00:56.500> your<00:00:56.590> pasta<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.070> good<00:00:57.250> stir<00:00:57.550> that's<00:00:58.000> the
