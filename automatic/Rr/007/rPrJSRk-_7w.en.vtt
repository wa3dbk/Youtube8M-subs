long as you have the three items in the
crafting<00:00:25.320> table<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:26.369> once<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.640> get<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
crafting table so once you get it you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.450 
crafting table so once you get it you
can<00:00:27.090> also<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.630> spreads<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.380> fast<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.949> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
can also it spreads really fast so it

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.609 
can also it spreads really fast so it
works<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.939> flint<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.359> steel<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.929> it'll

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
works like flint and steel and it'll

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.370 
works like flint and steel and it'll
sprint<00:00:31.890> it'll<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.610> an<00:00:32.700> improved<00:00:33.090> version

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
sprint it'll it's an improved version

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
sprint it'll it's an improved version
but<00:00:34.380> it'll<00:00:34.559> actually<00:00:34.680> spread<00:00:35.399> faster<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
but it'll actually spread faster so

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
but it'll actually spread faster so
let's<00:00:36.300> stop<00:00:36.660> cover<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> up<00:00:37.260> what's<00:00:37.829> good

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
let's stop cover that up what's good

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
let's stop cover that up what's good
about<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.760> also<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.059> shot<00:00:39.329> from

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
about it is it can also be shot from

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.690 
about it is it can also be shot from
dispensers<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:44.149> bullseye<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.930> yeah<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.520> thing

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
dispensers so bullseye so yeah the thing

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.090 
dispensers so bullseye so yeah the thing
will<00:00:47.940> spread<00:00:48.120> pretty<00:00:48.270> fast<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.710> creative

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
will spread pretty fast also in creative

as Ombey or skeleton when they turn will

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.589 
as Ombey or skeleton when they turn will
actually<00:02:06.840> try<00:02:06.990> to

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.259 

here<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:14.349> let's<00:02:14.560> play<00:02:14.800> again<00:02:15.030> run<00:02:16.030> directly

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
here so let's play again run directly

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:26.430 
here so let's play again run directly
write<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:22.319> there<00:02:23.319> really<00:02:24.299> also<00:02:25.299> skeleton<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
write out there really also skeleton and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.520 
write out there really also skeleton and
prove<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:27.430> but<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.360> haven't<00:02:28.720> seen<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.110> yet<00:02:29.260> so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
prove it so but I haven't seen it yet so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.740 
prove it so but I haven't seen it yet so
on<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.069> the<00:02:30.129> next<00:02:30.330> when<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.420> run<00:02:31.599> through

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
on to the next when you run through

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.509 
on to the next when you run through
vines<00:02:32.019> they<00:02:32.290> now<00:02:32.440> slow<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.370> little

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
vines they now slow you just a little

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.050 
vines they now slow you just a little
bit<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:34.680> onto<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.769> new<00:02:35.920> mob<00:02:36.129> it's<00:02:36.459> an<00:02:36.610> o<00:02:36.760> slot

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
bit and onto the new mob it's an o slot

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.059 
bit and onto the new mob it's an o slot
I<00:02:37.239> believe<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.930> how<00:02:38.049> it's<00:02:38.230> pronounced<00:02:38.620> it's

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
I believe this how it's pronounced it's

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.440 
I believe this how it's pronounced it's
a<00:02:39.129> jungle<00:02:39.340> cat<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.790> find<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> jungle

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
a jungle cat you find it in the jungle

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.660 
a jungle cat you find it in the jungle
biomes<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.950> he<00:02:42.040> plates<00:02:42.250> two<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.549> them

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
biomes and if he plates two of them

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.580 
biomes and if he plates two of them
they'll<00:02:43.090> run<00:02:43.299> away<00:02:43.510> really<00:02:43.840> fast<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.500> what

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
they'll run away really fast and so what

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.020 
they'll run away really fast and so what
you<00:02:44.680> need<00:02:44.769> to<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.190> get<00:02:45.430> raw<00:02:45.640> fish<00:02:45.910> in

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you need to do is you get raw fish in

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.690 
you need to do is you get raw fish in
your<00:02:46.060> hand<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.980> stand<00:02:47.980> perfectly<00:02:48.160> still<00:02:48.459> for

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
your hand and stand perfectly still for

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.479 
your hand and stand perfectly still for
like<00:02:49.140> probably<00:02:50.140> like<00:02:50.380> 30<00:02:50.680> seconds<00:02:51.069> until<00:02:51.280> they

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
like probably like 30 seconds until they

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.910 
like probably like 30 seconds until they
finally<00:02:51.790> come<00:02:52.060> near<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.650> best<00:02:53.650> way<00:02:53.799> is

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
finally come near you best way is

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920 
finally come near you best way is
probably<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.310> cage<00:02:54.489> them<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.599> once

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
probably the cage them in and so once

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.350 
probably the cage them in and so once
you've<00:02:56.110> read<00:02:56.260> them<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.280> any<00:02:57.700> colored<00:02:58.120> ones

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.330 
you've read them to the any colored ones
which<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.900> can't<00:02:59.290> read<00:02:59.620> them<00:02:59.739> but<00:02:59.920> apparently

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
which I can't read them but apparently

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.369 
which I can't read them but apparently
