today<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.060> have<00:00:03.240> with<00:00:03.389> me<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.659> HTC<00:00:04.529> Touch<00:00:04.859> HD

today I have with me the HTC Touch HD
and<00:00:05.910> while<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.540> realize<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.109> this<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.770> not<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
and while I realize that this is not a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
brand new device by any stretch I've

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.690 
brand new device by any stretch I've
just<00:00:10.410> been<00:00:10.679> playing<00:00:10.830> around<00:00:11.070> with<00:00:11.340> one<00:00:11.490> for

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
just been playing around with one for

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.580 
just been playing around with one for
the<00:00:11.790> past<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.420> know<00:00:12.509> week<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> half<00:00:13.019> or<00:00:13.380> so

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the past you know week and a half or so

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.810 
the past you know week and a half or so
and<00:00:13.620> I've<00:00:13.889> been<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.250> pleased<00:00:14.429> with<00:00:14.580> it<00:00:14.639> so

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and I've been really pleased with it so

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.460 
and I've been really pleased with it so
I<00:00:14.849> thought<00:00:15.030> might<00:00:15.540> as<00:00:15.630> well<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> video<00:00:16.199> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
I thought might as well do a video and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.720 
I thought might as well do a video and
highlight<00:00:16.859> some<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> features<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
highlight some of the features of it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.370 
highlight some of the features of it
since<00:00:17.880> we<00:00:18.000> haven't<00:00:18.210> done<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> video<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.690> depth

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
since we haven't done a video in depth

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.099 
since we haven't done a video in depth
of<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.740> not<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.340> past<00:00:20.660> as<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:21.930> see

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
of it not in the past as you can see

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.679 
of it not in the past as you can see
very<00:00:22.500> simple<00:00:23.160> design<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.789> device<00:00:24.119> it's

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
very simple design on this device it's

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.429 
very simple design on this device it's
dominated<00:00:25.140> by<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> 3.8<00:00:26.099> inch<00:00:26.240> 800<00:00:27.240> by<00:00:27.330> 480<00:00:27.660> pixel

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
display it's a resistive touchscreen

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.519 
display it's a resistive touchscreen
display<00:00:30.660> which<00:00:30.810> means<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> requires<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.470> little

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
display which means it requires a little

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
display which means it requires a little
bit<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> pressure<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.399> such<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.360> compatible
