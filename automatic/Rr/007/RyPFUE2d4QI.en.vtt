00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.020 
and give it in position before we screw
you<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:51.950> okay<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.190> allows<00:01:53.460> us<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.760> move<00:01:53.880> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you down okay this allows us to move it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.940 
you down okay this allows us to move it
around<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.530> into<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.800> right

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
around and to get into the right

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.490 
around and to get into the right
position<00:01:56.870> now<00:01:57.870> we're<00:01:58.110> having<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> right

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
position now we're having a right

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.230 
position now we're having a right
position

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
position

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.410 
position
next<00:02:00.240> step<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:01.700> spray<00:02:02.700> on<00:02:02.820> top<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.150> your<00:02:03.240> slip

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
next step is spray on top of your slip

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.830 
next step is spray on top of your slip
solution<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.850> don't<00:02:06.000> scuff<00:02:06.660> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
solution this is so we don't scuff the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.810 
solution this is so we don't scuff the
film<00:02:07.080> with<00:02:07.410> our<00:02:07.650> squeegee<00:02:10.430> you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.670> tack

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
film with our squeegee you want to tack

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.290 
film with our squeegee you want to tack
down<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.180> middle<00:02:12.390> first<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.209> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
down the middle first so with the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.420 
down the middle first so with the
squeegee<00:02:15.800> light<00:02:16.800> strokes

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.100 

okay<00:02:20.430> now<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.730> center<00:02:21.150> piece<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.570> tacked

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
okay now that center piece is tacked

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.320 
okay now that center piece is tacked
down<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:23.400> get<00:02:23.520> rid<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.730> these<00:02:23.850> creases<00:02:24.180> here

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
down to get rid of these creases here

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.610 
down to get rid of these creases here
what<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.660> need<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:25.050> stretch<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> film

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
what we need to do is stretch the film

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.650 
what we need to do is stretch the film
so<00:02:26.340> we<00:02:26.730> stretched<00:02:26.970> at<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.239> end<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.600> little

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
so we stretched at the end just a little

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.530 
so we stretched at the end just a little
bit<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.440> hold<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:28.950> stretch<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.760> we

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
bit and hold that stretch and we

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.050 
bit and hold that stretch and we
squeegee<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.140> across<00:02:31.820> let's<00:02:32.820> make<00:02:33.030> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
squeegee it right across let's make it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.810 
squeegee it right across let's make it
sure<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.600> get<00:02:33.750> all<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.800> slip<00:02:35.250> solution<00:02:35.640> from

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
sure we get all the slip solution from

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.590 
sure we get all the slip solution from
underneath<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.180> film

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.850 

now<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:43.660> repeat<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.110> process<00:02:44.140> in<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.770> other

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
now we repeat the process in the other

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.950 
now we repeat the process in the other
side<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.700> we<00:02:45.730> wish<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.000> fill<00:02:46.180> them<00:02:46.300> up<00:02:46.360> we<00:02:46.720> spray

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
side so we wish to fill them up we spray

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.270 
side so we wish to fill them up we spray
the<00:02:47.080> slip<00:02:47.290> solution<00:02:47.710> again<00:02:47.890> underneath<00:02:48.070> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
the slip solution again underneath the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.580 
the slip solution again underneath the
film<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:49.210> lay<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.390> back<00:02:49.540> down<00:02:49.600> give<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.530> a

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
film and lay it back down give it a

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.170 
film and lay it back down give it a
little<00:02:50.710> bit<00:02:50.860> of<00:02:50.920> stretch<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.520> then<00:02:52.030> we

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
little bit of stretch and then we

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.670 
little bit of stretch and then we
squeegee<00:02:52.570> across<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.350> did<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.620> other

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
squeegee across like we did on the other

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.040 
squeegee across like we did on the other
side<00:02:53.980> making<00:02:54.670> sure<00:02:54.850> there's<00:02:55.000> no<00:02:55.090> bubbles<00:02:55.480> or

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
side making sure there's no bubbles or

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.690 
side making sure there's no bubbles or
air<00:02:56.290> left<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.770> film<00:02:59.250> don't<00:03:00.250> forget<00:03:00.610> to

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
air left in the film don't forget to

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.360 
air left in the film don't forget to
spray<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.090> let<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.300> film<00:03:01.540> again<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:03.100> top

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
spray and let you film again and on top

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.540 
spray and let you film again and on top
so<00:03:03.610> don't<00:03:03.880> stuff<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.070> important<00:03:06.430> to

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
so don't stuff it and it's important to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.010 
so don't stuff it and it's important to
stretch<00:03:06.790> down<00:03:06.820> with<00:03:07.210> this<00:03:07.330> otherwise<00:03:07.720> you'll

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
stretch down with this otherwise you'll

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.900 
stretch down with this otherwise you'll
leave<00:03:08.170> bubbles<00:03:08.530> running<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.490> ledge<00:03:09.700> there

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
leave bubbles running that ledge there

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.020 
leave bubbles running that ledge there
so<00:03:10.180> if<00:03:10.330> you<00:03:10.420> stretch<00:03:10.570> down<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.870> little<00:03:11.050> bit<00:03:11.230> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
so if you stretch down a little bit and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:20.490 
so if you stretch down a little bit and
make<00:03:13.030> sure<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.330> get<00:03:13.450> it<00:03:13.570> right<00:03:13.660> down<00:03:19.500> medium

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
make sure you get it right down medium

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:44.280 
make sure you get it right down medium
pressure<00:03:20.860> with<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.160> squeegee<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.870> wipe<00:03:44.140> it

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
pressure with the squeegee so wipe it

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.140 
pressure with the squeegee so wipe it
down<00:03:44.470> making<00:03:45.310> sure<00:03:45.490> we<00:03:45.700> haven't<00:03:45.880> left<00:03:45.970> any

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
down making sure we haven't left any

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.220 
down making sure we haven't left any
