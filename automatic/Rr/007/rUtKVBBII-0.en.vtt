00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.510
 Today we are moving the threads of the 80s 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.010
 I wonder if that is for a part of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.929
 Right viewpoint is the country today 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.609
 is basically me already 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:42.989
 think so what do you need for 80 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.050
 years need hooded sweater first 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.120
 original not from the 80s the salt 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.780
 the inter i'm not in the synonymous 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.180
 80's because we have here now 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.070
 70 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.090
 cause and now we get to sounds 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090
 around and tunes 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 the word jakob expresses the ramp 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.680
 and meanwhile 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.680
 if here 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.630
 sounds like 80 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:36.140
 to explain the thing here this time 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:38.970
 here is an original 5 of 1985 or 86 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.180
 original on ebay bought by the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 both of them and shouted down there in 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.990
 because of the darkness all the time 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.390
 just had huge in the had 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.410
 just then every sound was the exit 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.810
 here you can also individually 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.830
 meddle and you could do whole songs 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.170
 So create it here 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.610
 Petkovic priming and knew together 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.690
 let her play and then later 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.700

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
 another track and there was a 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.580
 funny effect and we go this way and that 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.440
 write that in a new tip and 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.940
 then it came in a new tip and on 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.739
 once other drums things came 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.840
