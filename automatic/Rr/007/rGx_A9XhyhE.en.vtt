00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.640
We will divide the chocolate you want to temper into 75% and 25%

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.300
This time we will explain with 150 g and 50 g

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.620
Minute 50 g chocolate as possible

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.160
Melt 150 g of chocolate

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.160
Adjust the melted chocolate to 45 ° C (318.15 K)

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060
Add 50 g of chopped chocolate adjusted to 45 ° C (318.15 K)

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.460
Mix lightly

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.940
A fine chocolate grain is left

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
About 2 minutes, I will leave this

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.420
Heat is transferred to fine chocolate by leaving it, and it slowly melts

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.220
In 2 minutes

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.120
Mix the whole

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840
It will be completed if the chocolate granules melt completely and reach 32 ° C (305.15 K)

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.100
Chocolate grains melted completely

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200
It became 32 ℃ (305.15K)

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.060
Now that the tempering has been completed,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I will add a little to a spat or the like and test if it is solidified properly

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720
I will leave it for a while.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.900
In a few minutes

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600
Chocolate is slightly cloudy a while ago and it looks like glossy appearance

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680
There are no speckles etc. that appear when you fail the tempering

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.540
It is properly consolidated, it is successful

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Easy! What?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.700
Come, please try it, again!
