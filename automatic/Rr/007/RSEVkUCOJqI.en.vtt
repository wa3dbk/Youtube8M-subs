University<00:00:03.779> the<00:00:04.779> jazz<00:00:05.020> studio<00:00:05.560> is<00:00:05.890> the

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:06.129 
University the jazz studio is the

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:08.160 
University the jazz studio is the
state-of-the-art<00:00:06.580> teaching<00:00:06.910> facility<00:00:07.629> where

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
state-of-the-art teaching facility where

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.530 
state-of-the-art teaching facility where
we<00:00:08.349> use<00:00:08.610> technology<00:00:09.610> with<00:00:10.030> traditional

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
we use technology with traditional

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.810 
we use technology with traditional
teaching<00:00:10.929> methods<00:00:10.960> as<00:00:11.440> a<00:00:11.469> new<00:00:12.040> way<00:00:12.190> of<00:00:12.219> trying

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
teaching methods as a new way of trying

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.240 
teaching methods as a new way of trying
to<00:00:12.880> reach<00:00:13.210> the<00:00:13.360> students<00:00:13.719> what<00:00:14.620> we<00:00:14.740> have<00:00:14.920> here

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
to reach the students what we have here

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.690 
to reach the students what we have here
is<00:00:15.429> essentially<00:00:15.969> a<00:00:16.810> smart<00:00:17.350> classroom<00:00:17.500> so<00:00:18.490> we

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
is essentially a smart classroom so we

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.720 
is essentially a smart classroom so we
use<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:19.030> smart<00:00:19.300> board<00:00:19.570> along<00:00:20.140> with

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
use the smart board along with

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.200 
use the smart board along with
state-of-the-art

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
state-of-the-art

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.450 
state-of-the-art
recording<00:00:22.840> technology<00:00:23.410> and<00:00:23.650> we<00:00:23.800> fuse<00:00:24.280> these

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
recording technology and we fuse these

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.950 
recording technology and we fuse these
things<00:00:24.700> together<00:00:25.030> as<00:00:25.270> a<00:00:25.300> way<00:00:25.450> of<00:00:25.480> teaching

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
things together as a way of teaching

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.340 
things together as a way of teaching
students<00:00:26.350> about<00:00:27.240> traditional<00:00:28.240> jazz<00:00:28.510> but<00:00:29.200> in

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
students about traditional jazz but in

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.040 
students about traditional jazz but in
slightly<00:00:29.920> a<00:00:30.190> non-traditional<00:00:30.790> way<00:00:31.240> for

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
slightly a non-traditional way for

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.210 
slightly a non-traditional way for
example<00:00:32.500> we<00:00:32.680> use<00:00:34.500> Sibelius<00:00:35.500> which<00:00:35.680> is<00:00:35.830> a<00:00:35.860> music

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
example we use Sibelius which is a music

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.760 
example we use Sibelius which is a music
notation<00:00:36.550> program<00:00:36.910> that's<00:00:37.380> really<00:00:38.380> neat

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
notation program that's really neat

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.400 
notation program that's really neat
because<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.520> can<00:00:39.820> actually<00:00:40.690> put<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.140> music

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
because we can actually put the music

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.440 
because we can actually put the music
into<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.800> score<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.490> also<00:00:43.060> have<00:00:43.300> the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
into the score and also have the

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:55.550 
into the score and also have the
computer<00:00:43.900> to<00:00:44.500> play<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.920> music<00:00:45.190> back<00:00:45.370> for<00:00:45.670> us

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.680 

so<00:00:56.670> depending<00:00:57.670> on<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.850> simplicity<00:00:58.270> or<00:00:58.540> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
so depending on the simplicity or the

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.630 
so depending on the simplicity or the
complexity<00:00:59.110> of<00:00:59.230> the<00:00:59.410> score<00:00:59.770> we<00:01:00.310> can<00:01:00.489> do<00:01:00.610> a

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
complexity of the score we can do a

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.490 
complexity of the score we can do a
number<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:01.060> different<00:01:01.329> things<00:01:01.480> also<00:01:01.930> another

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
number of different things also another

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.740 
number of different things also another
neat<00:01:02.770> advantage<00:01:03.190> to<00:01:03.340> this<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:04.330> will<00:01:04.449> also

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
neat advantage to this is it will also

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.690 
neat advantage to this is it will also
record<00:01:05.110> anything<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.800> play<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.490> if<00:01:09.610> I

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
record anything that I play so that if I

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.580 
record anything that I play so that if I
wanted<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.060> record<00:01:10.210> this

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.310 

and<00:01:18.790> then<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:20.000> records<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.570> annotative<00:01:20.840> on

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
and then it records that annotative on

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.270 
and then it records that annotative on
the<00:01:21.410> score<00:01:22.000> another<00:01:23.000> program<00:01:23.360> that<00:01:23.390> we<00:01:23.630> use<00:01:24.280> is

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the score another program that we use is

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.040 
the score another program that we use is
the<00:01:25.520> sequencing<00:01:26.000> program<00:01:26.360> and<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:26.660> gives<00:01:26.870> me

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
the sequencing program and this gives me

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.990 
the sequencing program and this gives me
a<00:01:27.080> way<00:01:27.260> of<00:01:27.410> being<00:01:27.560> able<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.860> create<00:01:28.160> practice

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
a way of being able to create practice

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.050 
a way of being able to create practice
tracks<00:01:29.300> so<00:01:29.750> that<00:01:29.780> students<00:01:30.350> can<00:01:30.500> play<00:01:30.650> along

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
tracks so that students can play along

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.450 
tracks so that students can play along
with<00:01:32.230> with<00:01:33.230> the<00:01:33.320> practice<00:01:33.680> tracks<00:01:33.980> so<00:01:34.220> for

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
with with the practice tracks so for

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.920 
with with the practice tracks so for
example<00:01:34.790> if<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.940> wanted<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:35.240> have<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.390> pianist<00:01:35.810> to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
example if I wanted to have a pianist to

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.230 
example if I wanted to have a pianist to
play<00:01:36.080> along<00:01:36.350> with<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.670> could<00:01:37.970> have<00:01:38.000> them

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
play along with this I could have them

00:01:38.240 --> 00:02:01.480 
play along with this I could have them
do<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:59.020> so<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.170> makes<00:02:00.410> a<00:02:00.530> very<00:02:00.770> wonderful

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
do that so this makes a very wonderful

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.040 
do that so this makes a very wonderful
practice<00:02:01.850> vehicle<00:02:02.450> because<00:02:02.690> if<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.870> have<00:02:03.020> a

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
practice vehicle because if I have a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.390 
practice vehicle because if I have a
bassist<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.620> needs<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.890> play<00:02:04.040> along<00:02:04.250> with

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
bassist that needs to play along with

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.070 
bassist that needs to play along with
this<00:02:04.520> I<00:02:04.700> can<00:02:04.880> put<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.120> piano<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.960> take

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
this I can put the piano and and take

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.510 
this I can put the piano and and take
the<00:02:06.200> bass<00:02:06.350> out<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.830> bass<00:02:07.010> player<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.400> play

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
the bass out and bass player can play

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.969 
the bass out and bass player can play
along<00:02:07.729> with<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.000> drums<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.540> the<00:02:09.290> piano<00:02:09.320> or<00:02:09.860> if

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
along with the drums and the piano or if

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.080 
along with the drums and the piano or if
I<00:02:10.040> have<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> drum<00:02:10.460> Road<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.760> wants<00:02:11.030> to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I have a drum Road that wants to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.580 
I have a drum Road that wants to
practice<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.600> can<00:02:11.660> have<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> drummer<00:02:12.170> come<00:02:12.440> in

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
practice I can have a drummer come in

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.780 
practice I can have a drummer come in
and<00:02:12.740> he<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:12.950> play<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.310> bass<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.490> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
and he can play with the bass in the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.790 
and he can play with the bass in the
piano<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:15.410> also<00:02:15.590> teach<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.100> students<00:02:16.550> about

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
piano we also teach the students about

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.160 
piano we also teach the students about
recording<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:18.980> how<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.700> do<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.630> small<00:02:20.959> group

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
recording and how to do a small group

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.520 
recording and how to do a small group
recording<00:02:21.680> here<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.130> use<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:23.530> recording

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
recording here so we use a recording

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.680 
recording here so we use a recording
software<00:02:24.980> actually<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.180> freeware<00:02:26.540> it's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
software actually this is freeware it's

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.530 
software actually this is freeware it's
called<00:02:26.840> audacity<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:28.040> use<00:02:28.220> this<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:29.360> teach

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
called audacity and we use this to teach

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.510 
called audacity and we use this to teach
them<00:02:29.750> about<00:02:29.780> recording<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.650> this<00:02:31.010> gives<00:02:31.400> me

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
them about recording and this gives me

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.500 
them about recording and this gives me
the<00:02:31.610> ability<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:33.790> do<00:02:34.790> different<00:02:35.150> types<00:02:35.180> of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the ability to do different types of

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.920 
the ability to do different types of
recording<00:02:36.380> here

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.110 

again<00:02:44.930> how<00:02:45.740> we<00:02:45.800> combine<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.340> with<00:02:46.400> smart

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
again how we combine this with smart

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.610 
again how we combine this with smart
technology<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.900> when<00:02:48.080> we're<00:02:48.230> talking<00:02:48.380> about

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
technology is when we're talking about

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.590 
technology is when we're talking about
digital<00:02:49.010> editing<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.850> manipulation<00:02:50.480> of

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
digital editing and manipulation of

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.720 
digital editing and manipulation of
waveforms<00:02:51.200> then<00:02:51.770> we're<00:02:51.980> able<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.370> do<00:02:52.520> that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
waveforms then we're able to do that

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.180 
waveforms then we're able to do that
again<00:02:53.720> directly<00:02:54.110> from<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.500> board<00:02:54.770> we<00:02:55.040> can

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
again directly from the board we can

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.680 
again directly from the board we can
actually<00:02:55.340> go<00:02:55.640> up<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:55.880> real<00:02:56.090> time<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:56.540> make

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
actually go up in real time and make

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.530 
actually go up in real time and make
changes<00:02:57.110> using<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.340> smart<00:02:58.640> board<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.360> we're

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
changes using the smart board so we're

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.000 
changes using the smart board so we're
using<00:02:59.720> smart<00:03:00.140> technology<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.830> very

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
using smart technology in a very

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.920 
using smart technology in a very
specific<00:03:01.250> way<00:03:01.580> with<00:03:02.060> this<00:03:02.240> software<00:03:02.630> and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
specific way with this software and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.570 
specific way with this software and
again<00:03:03.560> what<00:03:03.800> we're<00:03:03.950> doing<00:03:04.190> here<00:03:04.370> is<00:03:04.430> we're

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
again what we're doing here is we're

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.730 
again what we're doing here is we're
teaching<00:03:04.760> students<00:03:05.300> about<00:03:05.390> traditional<00:03:06.140> jazz

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
teaching students about traditional jazz

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.520 
teaching students about traditional jazz
but<00:03:07.610> as<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.850> said<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.270> non-traditional<00:03:08.600> way

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
