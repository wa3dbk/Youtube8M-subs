Hi, everyone! This is Keith's Toy Box!

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.309
And today we're going to show you the
Sesame Street LOL Laugh Out Loud

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.750
ELMO by Playskool!

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.980
Elmo is available at Amazon for about
twenty dollars.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.020
We can press his foot to make him start laughing

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.020
or tickle his tummy!

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.290
[sound of Elmo laughing] Very Cute!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.520
Elmo can even tell jokes!

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.890
So now let's take Elmo out and try him!

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:05.960
Elmo comes in the "Try Me" mode

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.460
so we have to turn him to the "On" mode. 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.140
His back opens up to reveal the switch and the batteries. 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.979
He requires four (4) AA batteries

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.980
So we switch it to "On"

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.980
Elmo talking:  Hello!  Ready to laugh with Elmo?

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.140
Elmo: It's tickle time! Please make Elmo laugh out loud!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.099
haha

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.280
Elmo: Hahahaha!  You're just silly!

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.900
Elmo:  Hahahaha!

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.130
Tickle, tickle!  Elmo: That tickles!  Hahaha!

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.510
Elmo:  Ahhh hahahaha!

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.100
Hehehe

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.500
Note that this is not a soft toy

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.800
He has a furry outer layer. But inside

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.630
is a tough inner plastic case.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.180
the back of his head neck

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.200
are tough too

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.360
But his hands and feet are not as hard

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.220
So you can still hug him, bring him around or cuddle with him in bed!

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.460
Elmo: That tickles!

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.440
Elmo: Make a silly noise to make Elmo laugh!

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.120
we can also activate Elmo

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.040
using Dorothy's fishbowl that comes with the package.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.260
Simply press his foot,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.220
hold the fishbowl about 6 inches away from Elmo and squeeze!

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.820
[Squeek!]

00:03:14.872 --> 00:03:16.152
Elmo:  Ah hahahaha!

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.520
[Squeek!]

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.060
Elmo:  Hehe

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.760
[Squeek! Squeek Squeek!]

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.320
Elmo:  Ah hahahaha!

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.760
Any other squeeker toy will do, too, like this rubber duckie!

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.420
[Squeek!]

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.240
Elmo:  Ah hahaha!

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.780
[Squeek! Squeek!]

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.000
Elmo:  That's so funny!

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.720
[Squeek! Squeek! Squeek!]

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.580
Elmo:  Ahh hahahahaha!

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.860
Or any other sharp sound

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.760
[paper ripping]

00:03:46.255 --> 00:03:47.375
Elmo:  Ah hahaha!

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.040

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.780

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.420
Just press and hold Elmo's foot for three seconds

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.400
Elmo:  Elmo knows some funny jokes!

00:04:07.443 --> 00:04:09.763
Elmo:  What do cows like to dance to?

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.060
Elmo: MOO-sic!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.579
What do cows like to dance to?

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.899
MOO-sic!

00:04:19.672 --> 00:04:22.872
Elmo:  Why did the cookie have to go to the doctor?

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:27.658
Elmo:  Because it felt "crumby!"  Ah hahaha!

00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:29.032
Elmo:  That's hilarious!

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.160
Elmo:  What fish do you see at night?

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:37.055
Elmo:  A STARfish!

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.340
What fish do you see at night?  A STARfish!

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.900

Elmo:  What do you call a fish that tells jokes?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.900
Elmo:  A clown fish!  Ah hahaha!

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.100
Elmo turns off automatically if you leave him for a while

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.760
