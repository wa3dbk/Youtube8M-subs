the<00:00:01.140> last<00:00:01.350> segment<00:00:01.589> of<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.890> day<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.220> amazing

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
the last segment of the day the amazing

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:14.690 
the last segment of the day the amazing
rav4<00:00:03.560> this<00:00:04.560> is<00:00:05.029> an<00:00:06.029> on-demand<00:00:13.700> four-wheel

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
rav4 this is an on-demand four-wheel

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.620 
rav4 this is an on-demand four-wheel
drive<00:00:15.330> system<00:00:16.310> very<00:00:17.310> similar<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> Venza

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
drive system very similar to the Venza

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.269 
drive system very similar to the Venza
and<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.289> Sienna<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.730> wheel<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:22.279> this

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and the Sienna if this wheel and this

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.230 
and the Sienna if this wheel and this
wheel<00:00:24.050> this<00:00:25.050> wheel<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:26.550> wheel<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:27.000> all

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
wheel this wheel and this wheel are all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.390 
wheel this wheel and this wheel are all
turning<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> same<00:00:28.080> rate<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
turning at the same rate then this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.729 
turning at the same rate then this
vehicle<00:00:29.820> wants<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.980> 100%<00:00:33.739> front-wheel

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
vehicle wants to be 100% front-wheel

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.330 
vehicle wants to be 100% front-wheel
drive<00:00:35.510> it<00:00:36.510> has<00:00:36.660> two<00:00:36.960> modes<00:00:37.170> auto<00:00:37.680> mode<00:00:38.100> and

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
drive it has two modes auto mode and

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
drive it has two modes auto mode and
lock<00:00:38.910> mode<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.719> anytime<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> vehicle<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
lock mode so anytime the vehicle is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.970 
lock mode so anytime the vehicle is
going<00:00:40.770> straight<00:00:44.600> we're<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.690> get

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
going straight we're gonna get

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.020 
going straight we're gonna get
front-wheel<00:00:46.980> drive<00:00:48.890> if<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.399> speeds<00:00:50.789> up

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
front-wheel drive if this will speeds up

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.240 
front-wheel drive if this will speeds up
and<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:53.640> wheel<00:00:53.820> slows<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:55.100> obviously<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and this wheel slows down obviously this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.470 
and this wheel slows down obviously this
vehicle<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.760> attempting<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
vehicle is attempting to make a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.520 
vehicle is attempting to make a
right-hand<00:00:57.780> turn

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
right-hand turn

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.279 
right-hand turn
again<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> same<00:00:59.789> as<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.420> did<00:01:00.449> earlier<00:01:00.809> if

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
again the same as we did earlier if

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.369 
again the same as we did earlier if
that's<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.649> little<00:01:01.829> faster<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.229> that's<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that's a little faster and that's a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.219 
that's a little faster and that's a
little<00:01:04.650> slower<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> turn<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.689> even

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
little slower then the turn is even

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.010 
little slower then the turn is even
sharper<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.369> rav4<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:09.270> measure<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.990> angle

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
sharper the rav4 can measure the angle

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.670 
sharper the rav4 can measure the angle
of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> turn<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.250> start<00:01:11.939> adding<00:01:12.180> power

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
of the turn and start adding power

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.679 
of the turn and start adding power
through<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> front<00:01:14.070> differential<00:01:14.689> through

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
through the front differential through

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.340 
through the front differential through
the<00:01:15.840> EC<00:01:16.729> adding<00:01:17.729> power<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.570> example<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
the EC adding power in this example a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.280 
the EC adding power in this example a
little<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.580> more<00:01:20.970> power<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> outside

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
little bit more power to the outside

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.859 
little bit more power to the outside
wheel<00:01:22.590> because<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.549> turning<00:01:23.939> at<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> widest

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
wheel because it's turning at the widest

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
wheel because it's turning at the widest
arc<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.770> anytime<00:01:26.159> there's<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> turn<00:01:28.880> we're

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
arc so anytime there's a turn we're

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:38.459 
arc so anytime there's a turn we're
going<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> call<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.390> variable<00:01:30.780> Drive

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.419 

if<00:01:39.469> a<00:01:39.590> wheel<00:01:39.770> slips<00:01:41.469> under<00:01:42.469> power<00:01:42.679> so<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
if a wheel slips under power so the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:45.120 
if a wheel slips under power so the
front<00:01:43.640> wheels<00:01:43.850> slip<00:01:44.240> under<00:01:44.479> power

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
front wheels slip under power

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.520 
front wheels slip under power
immediately<00:01:46.130> it's<00:01:46.909> gonna<00:01:47.090> be<00:01:47.270> all<00:01:47.530> wheel

light off-road work with the vehicle the
first<00:02:15.319> thing<00:02:15.470> happens<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.069> look<00:02:16.220> at<00:02:16.340> a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
first thing happens is look at a

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.080 
first thing happens is look at a

important it simulates on the right sim
it<00:02:27.560> simulates<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:30.160> lot<00:02:33.430> center<00:02:35.470> differential

there's not a lot center differential
but<00:02:39.109> as<00:02:39.200> we<00:02:39.349> said<00:02:39.590> earlier<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.220> some<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.519> the

but as we said earlier in some of the

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.660 
but as we said earlier in some of the
other<00:02:40.989> programs<00:02:41.989> what<00:02:42.650> we've<00:02:42.829> said<00:02:43.069> is<00:02:43.310> that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
other programs what we've said is that

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.250 
other programs what we've said is that
anything<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.359> can<00:02:44.480> be<00:02:44.569> done<00:02:44.720> mechanically

anything that can be done mechanically
in<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.470> past<00:02:45.680> can<00:02:45.920> now<00:02:46.040> be<00:02:46.250> simulated
