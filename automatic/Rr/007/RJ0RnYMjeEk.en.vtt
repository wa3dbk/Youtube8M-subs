00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
today I'm going to show you how to blaze

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.019 
today I'm going to show you how to blaze
on<00:00:18.760> watercolor<00:00:19.570> paper<00:00:19.780> I<00:00:20.440> use<00:00:22.050> 200<00:00:23.050> pound

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
on watercolor paper I use 200 pound

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.210 
on watercolor paper I use 200 pound
paper<00:00:25.029> because<00:00:25.660> it<00:00:25.810> doesn't<00:00:26.170> buckle<00:00:26.500> so<00:00:26.980> much

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
paper because it doesn't buckle so much

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.250 
paper because it doesn't buckle so much
and<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:29.380> also<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:30.220> less<00:00:30.730> absorbent<00:00:31.690> than<00:00:31.990> the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
and it also is less absorbent than the

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.070 
and it also is less absorbent than the
300<00:00:32.800> pound<00:00:32.980> paper<00:00:33.280> which<00:00:33.640> really<00:00:34.480> is<00:00:34.840> what

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
300 pound paper which really is what

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.040 
300 pound paper which really is what
these<00:00:35.920> cardboard<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:38.070> wet<00:00:39.070> it<00:00:39.480> thorough<00:00:40.480> as<00:00:40.809> you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
these cardboard I wet it thorough as you

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.390

can<00:00:41.199> see<00:00:41.440> lots<00:00:41.770> of<00:00:42.070> water<00:00:42.400> on<00:00:43.590> both<00:00:44.590> sides<00:00:44.979> and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
can see lots of water on both sides and

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.500 
can see lots of water on both sides and
stick<00:00:46.120> it<00:00:46.239> down<00:00:46.449> to<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:48.030> non-absorbent<00:00:49.030> surface

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
stick it down to a non-absorbent surface

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.060 
stick it down to a non-absorbent surface
it<00:00:49.690> just<00:00:49.930> literally<00:00:50.470> is<00:00:50.920> like<00:00:50.949> a<00:00:51.159> magnet<00:00:51.699> I<00:00:53.070> use

of the white paper show through and I'm
going<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:24.310> add<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.430> little<00:01:24.690> opera<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:26.520> you

going to add a little opera to that you

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.140 
going to add a little opera to that you
don't<00:01:27.670> want<00:01:27.820> them<00:01:28.000> too<00:01:28.300> thick<00:01:28.660> so<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.850> paper

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
don't want them too thick so your paper

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.200 
don't want them too thick so your paper
will<00:01:31.450> be<00:01:31.480> very<00:01:31.870> dark<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.580> if<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:33.790> want<00:01:34.060> it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
will be very dark and if you want it

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.590 
will be very dark and if you want it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
dark

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.320 
dark
I<00:01:34.690> suggest<00:01:35.380> glazing<00:01:36.160> light<00:01:36.460> glazes<00:01:37.030> over

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
I suggest glazing light glazes over

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.710 
I suggest glazing light glazes over
light<00:01:37.510> glazes<00:01:38.110> over<00:01:38.140> light<00:01:38.620> glazes<00:01:39.360> until<00:01:40.360> it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
light glazes over light glazes until it

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.830 
light glazes over light glazes until it
is<00:01:41.050> like<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.100> want<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.930> like<00:01:43.930> to<00:01:44.290> leave<00:01:44.860> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
is like you want it I like to leave it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.300 
is like you want it I like to leave it
leave<00:01:46.840> some<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.230> color<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.830> first<00:01:48.070> color

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
leave some of the color the first color

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.780 
leave some of the color the first color
show<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.810> there's<00:01:50.650> a<00:01:50.770> variation<00:01:51.160> in<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
show so that there's a variation in the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
show so that there's a variation in the
glaze<00:01:55.650> at<00:01:56.650> this<00:01:57.370> point<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:57.880> dry<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.240> paper

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
glaze at this point I dry the paper

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.800 
glaze at this point I dry the paper
because<00:01:59.890> if<00:02:00.010> I<00:02:00.130> put<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.460> blue<00:02:00.760> on<00:02:00.790> now<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.659> will

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
because if I put the blue on now it will

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.330 
because if I put the blue on now it will
all<00:02:01.930> turn<00:02:02.170> gray<00:02:02.560> because<00:02:02.770> red<00:02:03.010> yellow<00:02:03.220> and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
all turn gray because red yellow and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.990 
all turn gray because red yellow and
blue<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.970> make<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.600> very<00:02:04.810> grey<00:02:05.170> color<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.670> I

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
blue can make a very grey color so I

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.080 
blue can make a very grey color so I
will<00:02:07.390> use<00:02:08.379> my<00:02:08.590> hair<00:02:08.830> dryer<00:02:09.129> and<00:02:09.399> blow<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:10.360> dry

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.390 

as<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.629> see<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:19.599> paper<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.319> drying<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
as you can see the paper is drying and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.149 
as you can see the paper is drying and
is<00:02:22.360> coming<00:02:22.750> up<00:02:22.900> from<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.319> surfaces<00:02:23.890> still

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
is coming up from the surfaces still

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.479 
is coming up from the surfaces still
damp<00:02:24.430> underneath<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.299> this<00:02:25.959> is<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.400> cotton<00:02:27.400> or

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
damp underneath and this is a cotton or

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.449 
damp underneath and this is a cotton or
a<00:02:27.549> linen<00:02:27.879> fibre<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.720> shrinks<00:02:29.159> but<00:02:30.159> when<00:02:30.340> you

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
a linen fibre so it shrinks but when you

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.940 
a linen fibre so it shrinks but when you
add<00:02:30.670> water<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.390> again<00:02:33.569> gently<00:02:34.569> with<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.950> soft

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
add water to it again gently with a soft

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.330 
add water to it again gently with a soft
wash<00:02:36.250> brush<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:37.420> expands<00:02:38.290> again<00:02:38.590> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.129> top

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
wash brush it expands again on the top

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.300 
wash brush it expands again on the top
side<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.269> lay<00:02:40.390> flat<00:02:40.420> again<00:02:41.099> so<00:02:42.099> there's

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
side and will lay flat again so there's

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.110 
side and will lay flat again so there's
no<00:02:42.489> need<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.730> worry<00:02:43.150> about<00:02:43.810> its<00:02:44.409> buckling<00:02:45.120> now

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
no need to worry about its buckling now

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.720 
no need to worry about its buckling now
I<00:02:46.180> have<00:02:46.420> pre<00:02:46.720> wet<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.079> paper<00:02:47.459> I'm<00:02:48.459> going<00:02:48.670> to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
I have pre wet the paper I'm going to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.210 
I have pre wet the paper I'm going to
put<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:48.910> light<00:02:49.150> glaze<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.750> blue<00:02:50.019> on<00:02:50.319> at<00:02:50.680> random

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
put a light glaze of blue on at random

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.020 
put a light glaze of blue on at random
because<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:51.970> don't<00:02:52.180> want<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:53.400> solid<00:02:54.400> you

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
because I don't want it to be solid you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.900 
because I don't want it to be solid you
have<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.569> option<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:56.170> making<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.650> solid<00:02:57.160> but

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
have that option of making it solid but

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.910 
have that option of making it solid but
I<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.209> some<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.780> other<00:02:59.019> colors<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.709> show

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
I like some of the other colors to show

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.130 
I like some of the other colors to show
through<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.459> really<00:03:01.090> puts<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.480> nice<00:03:04.019> color<00:03:05.019> on

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
through that really puts a nice color on

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.190 
through that really puts a nice color on
your<00:03:05.470> paper<00:03:05.769> and<00:03:09.269> as<00:03:10.269> this<00:03:10.510> drive<00:03:10.840> some<00:03:11.170> of

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
your paper and as this drive some of

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.380 
your paper and as this drive some of
this<00:03:11.379> will<00:03:11.620> run<00:03:11.769> together<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.579> can<00:03:13.060> make<00:03:13.239> it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
this will run together I can make it

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:26.540 
this will run together I can make it
darker<00:03:13.569> if<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.019> wish<00:03:14.640> or<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.700> can<00:03:16.239> leave<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.540> light

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.630 

you

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.920 

now<00:03:32.210> you<00:03:32.270> can<00:03:32.750> begin<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.320> see<00:03:34.180> how<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.240> colors

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
now you can begin to see how the colors

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.280 
now you can begin to see how the colors
are<00:03:37.030> leaving<00:03:38.030> a<00:03:38.180> beautiful<00:03:38.450> glow<00:03:38.960> on<00:03:38.990> the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
are leaving a beautiful glow on the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.280 
are leaving a beautiful glow on the
paper<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.920> it's<00:03:40.550> dried<00:03:41.390> the<00:03:41.600> surface<00:03:42.050> it's

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
I don't always rewedding can go over

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.970 
I don't always rewedding can go over
this<00:04:02.870> if<00:04:03.080> you<00:04:03.200> want<00:04:03.440> much<00:04:03.650> darker<00:04:04.190> wash<00:04:04.690> or

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
this if you want much darker wash or

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.790 
this if you want much darker wash or
different<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.130> can<00:04:07.790> add<00:04:08.000> another<00:04:08.930> layer<00:04:09.410> of<00:04:09.650> the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
different I can add another layer of the

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.790 
different I can add another layer of the
yellow<00:04:10.360> at<00:04:11.360> random<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.050> I'm<00:04:12.140> just<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:12.680> know

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
yellow at random and I'm just you know

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.320 
yellow at random and I'm just you know
mixed<00:04:13.220> very<00:04:13.490> light<00:04:14.709> washes<00:04:15.709> with<00:04:16.160> some<00:04:16.400> paint

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
mixed very light washes with some paint

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.650 
mixed very light washes with some paint
and<00:04:18.459> lots<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.580> water<00:04:19.880> so<00:04:20.330> that<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.540> don't

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
and lots of water so that I don't

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.800 
and lots of water so that I don't
overload<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.530> paper<00:04:21.890> all<00:04:22.790> at<00:04:23.180> once<00:04:23.420> with

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
overload the paper all at once with

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.860 
overload the paper all at once with
color<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:27.650> add<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.130> pink<00:04:28.400> again<00:04:28.820> because<00:04:29.720> I

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
color you add the pink again because I

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.720 
color you add the pink again because I
find<00:04:30.140> that<00:04:30.290> adding<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.950> pink<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.550> the<00:04:31.700> yellow

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
find that adding the pink and the yellow

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.540 
find that adding the pink and the yellow
together<00:04:32.210> is<00:04:32.660> okay<00:04:33.140> when<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.530> go<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.310> blue

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
together is okay when I go to the blue

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.650 
together is okay when I go to the blue
it<00:04:35.420> can<00:04:36.230> really<00:04:36.680> mess<00:04:37.280> up<00:04:37.490> things<00:04:37.730> if<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.480> don't

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
it can really mess up things if I don't

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.220 
it can really mess up things if I don't
dry<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:38.990> first<00:04:39.700> so<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.730> always<00:04:41.000> add<00:04:41.390> those<00:04:41.720> as

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
dry it first so I always add those as

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.680 
dry it first so I always add those as
and<00:04:42.530> this<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.800> called<00:04:43.040> wet<00:04:43.250> glazing<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:47.419> that's

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
and this is called wet glazing so that's

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.600 
and this is called wet glazing so that's
the<00:04:48.110> next<00:04:49.180> layer<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.210> color<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.130> then<00:04:52.130> when<00:04:52.580> I

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
the next layer of color and then when I

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:01.350 
the next layer of color and then when I
dry<00:04:52.910> this<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.270> will<00:04:53.450> add<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.720> blue<00:04:53.930> again

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.550 

remember<00:05:02.360> when<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:03.050> are<00:05:03.230> glazing<00:05:05.290> to<00:05:06.290> keep

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
remember when you are glazing to keep

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.970 
remember when you are glazing to keep
your<00:05:06.770> your<00:05:07.390> washes<00:05:08.390> very<00:05:09.970> pale<00:05:11.470> so<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.800> you

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
your your washes very pale so that you

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.720 
your your washes very pale so that you
do<00:05:13.190> not<00:05:13.450> hide<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:15.230> glow<00:05:15.590> coming<00:05:16.130> from<00:05:16.280> the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
do not hide the glow coming from the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.720 
do not hide the glow coming from the
underlying<00:05:17.090> colors<00:05:18.100> so<00:05:19.100> that's<00:05:19.310> another

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
underlying colors so that's another

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.000 
underlying colors so that's another
reason<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:20.510> would<00:05:20.720> pre<00:05:21.380> wet<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.740> paper

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
reason that I would pre wet the paper

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.430 
reason that I would pre wet the paper
each<00:05:22.370> time<00:05:23.230> after<00:05:24.230> I<00:05:24.650> have<00:05:24.920> dried<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.900> if<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.140> put

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
each time after I have dried it if I put

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.900 
each time after I have dried it if I put
too<00:05:27.740> much<00:05:27.770> color<00:05:28.460> on<00:05:28.780> then<00:05:29.780> I<00:05:30.050> will<00:05:30.410> only<00:05:30.910> hide

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
too much color on then I will only hide

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.600 
too much color on then I will only hide
the<00:05:32.840> beautiful<00:05:33.290> glow<00:05:33.590> that<00:05:33.620> you<00:05:33.980> can<00:05:34.220> get<00:05:34.430> from

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
the beautiful glow that you can get from

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.630 
the beautiful glow that you can get from
glazing<00:05:35.180> now<00:05:35.660> you<00:05:35.780> can<00:05:35.930> do<00:05:36.080> solid<00:05:36.380> glazes<00:05:37.160> if

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
glazing now you can do solid glazes if

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.180 
glazing now you can do solid glazes if
you<00:05:37.880> want<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.240> solid<00:05:38.540> dark<00:05:39.020> color<00:05:39.140> that's<00:05:39.800> fine

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
you want a solid dark color that's fine

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.910 
you want a solid dark color that's fine
you<00:05:40.400> just<00:05:40.430> lay<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.630> color<00:05:41.930> evenly<00:05:42.470> over<00:05:42.590> the

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
you just lay the color evenly over the

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.810 
you just lay the color evenly over the
paper<00:05:43.160> I<00:05:44.500> don't<00:05:45.500> do<00:05:45.740> that<00:05:45.950> because<00:05:46.190> I<00:05:46.460> like<00:05:46.670> to

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
paper I don't do that because I like to

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.840 
paper I don't do that because I like to
see<00:05:47.000> the<00:05:47.120> variation<00:05:47.890> from<00:05:48.890> the<00:05:49.190> yellow<00:05:49.640> to<00:05:49.700> the

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
see the variation from the yellow to the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.230 
see the variation from the yellow to the
pink<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.300> the<00:05:50.390> blue<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:51.610> then<00:05:52.610> when<00:05:52.880> this<00:05:53.030> is
