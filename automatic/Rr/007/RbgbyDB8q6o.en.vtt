00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
actually grow I've actually grown to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.260 
actually grow I've actually grown to
like<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.950> might<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> was<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> quite<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> nice

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
like this might be I was a quite a nice

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
like this might be I was a quite a nice
floor<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.560> know<00:01:37.590> work<00:01:37.920> away

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
floor to it if you you know work away

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
floor to it if you you know work away
around<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.790> right<00:01:39.030> instead<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:39.960> you

know sprinting in the middle because if

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.260 
know sprinting in the middle because if
you<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.490> straight<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> middle<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.210> my

deaths or something six or seven deaths
from<00:02:00.030> like<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> first<00:02:00.689> minute<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> me<00:02:01.229> just

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
from like the first minute of me just

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.170 
from like the first minute of me just
running<00:02:01.710> about<00:02:01.829> getting<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.520> sniped<00:02:02.909> by

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
running about getting you know sniped by

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
running about getting you know sniped by
snipers<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:03.689> middle<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> math<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.860> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
snipers in middle of math which is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.380 
snipers in middle of math which is
really<00:02:05.310> really<00:02:05.520> frustrating<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.299> are

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
really really frustrating so if you are

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.580 
really really frustrating so if you are
gonna<00:02:06.509> play<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.840> map<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.259> definitely

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
gonna play this map I definitely

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
gonna play this map I definitely
definitely<00:02:08.009> recommend<00:02:08.729> sticking<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.629> the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
definitely recommend sticking to the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
definitely recommend sticking to the
outskirts<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> definitely<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.580> those<00:02:11.879> are

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
outskirts and definitely they those are

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.670 
outskirts and definitely they those are
the<00:02:12.150> most<00:02:12.300> Clause<00:02:12.989> areas<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the most Clause areas the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.050 
the most Clause areas the
now<00:02:13.739> I'm<00:02:13.829> going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> talk<00:02:14.129> about<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
now I'm going to talk about the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.670 
now I'm going to talk about the
Peacekeeper<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> bit<00:02:16.049> because<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.500> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
Peacekeeper a bit because this is the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.190 
Peacekeeper a bit because this is the
new<00:02:17.329> assumption<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.510> they've<00:02:18.629> added<00:02:18.989> two

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
new assumption and they've added two

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
new assumption and they've added two
black<00:02:19.799> ops<00:02:20.040> 2<00:02:20.219> the<00:02:20.430> first<00:02:20.730> ever<00:02:21.000> time<00:02:21.180> they've

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
black ops 2 the first ever time they've

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.050 
black ops 2 the first ever time they've
actually<00:02:21.599> added<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:22.549> weapon<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.879> game

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
actually added a weapon to the game

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.670 
actually added a weapon to the game
people<00:02:24.689> have<00:02:24.780> been<00:02:24.810> asking<00:02:25.079> for<00:02:25.409> this<00:02:25.439> for<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
people have been asking for this for a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.640 
people have been asking for this for a
long<00:02:25.739> long<00:02:26.129> time<00:02:26.189> they<00:02:26.609> finally<00:02:27.090> did<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.269> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
long long time they finally did it and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.050 
long long time they finally did it and
I've<00:02:28.650> used<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.250> quite<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.489> bit<00:02:29.579> from<00:02:29.819> what<00:02:29.909> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
I've used it quite a bit from what I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.190 
I've used it quite a bit from what I
picked<00:02:30.239> up<00:02:30.359> I<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.480> I've<00:02:30.659> got<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.900> 500

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
picked up I think I've got like 500

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.500 
picked up I think I've got like 500
kills<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.159> it<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:33.030> probably<00:02:33.209> not<00:02:33.420> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
kills with it well probably not that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.679 
kills with it well probably not that
many<00:02:33.629> people<00:02:33.719> like<00:02:34.049> 300-400<00:02:34.829> kills<00:02:35.219> with<00:02:35.459> it

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
many people like 300-400 kills with it

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.039 
many people like 300-400 kills with it
so<00:02:36.689> far<00:02:36.719> and<00:02:37.879> it's<00:02:38.879> kind<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.299> a<00:02:39.359> 50-50

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
so far and it's kind of like a 50-50

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.039 
so far and it's kind of like a 50-50
thing<00:02:40.079> for<00:02:40.439> me<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.280> would<00:02:42.209> much<00:02:42.540> prefer<00:02:42.599> to

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
thing for me like I would much prefer to

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.860 
thing for me like I would much prefer to
use<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.769> PDW<00:02:44.370> or<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.670> MSMC<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.599> like

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
use like the PDW or the MSMC in like

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.869 
use like the PDW or the MSMC in like
really<00:02:46.169> close<00:02:46.319> range<00:02:46.769> engagements<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.700> this

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
really close range engagements but this

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.970 
really close range engagements but this
gone<00:02:48.150> as<00:02:48.419> they<00:02:48.930> said<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:49.379> know<00:02:49.500> before<00:02:49.859> they

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
gone as they said you know before they

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.890 
gone as they said you know before they
released<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.609> it's<00:02:51.030> going<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.419> kind<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.840> a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
released it it's going to be kind of a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.379 
released it it's going to be kind of a
hybrid<00:02:52.169> between<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:53.040> weapons<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.669> it's<00:02:54.180> kind

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
hybrid between all weapons so it's kind

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.210 
hybrid between all weapons so it's kind
of<00:02:54.419> like<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.569> cross<00:02:54.750> between<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:55.530> submachine<00:02:56.010> gun

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
of like a cross between a submachine gun

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.099 
of like a cross between a submachine gun
and<00:02:56.430> assault<00:02:56.909> on<00:02:57.030> an<00:02:57.180> assault<00:02:57.419> rifle<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.870> not

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
and assault on an assault rifle so not

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.140 
and assault on an assault rifle so not
only<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.469> it<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:59.099> know<00:02:59.219> pretty<00:02:59.250> average<00:02:59.669> at

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
only is it you know pretty average at

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.000 
only is it you know pretty average at
close<00:03:00.419> range<00:03:00.719> it's<00:03:00.840> also<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.139> pretty<00:03:01.469> average<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
close range it's also a pretty average a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.119 
close range it's also a pretty average a
longer<00:03:02.700> distance<00:03:02.849> so<00:03:03.419> if<00:03:03.689> you<00:03:04.379> are<00:03:04.560> unlike

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
longer distance so if you are unlike
