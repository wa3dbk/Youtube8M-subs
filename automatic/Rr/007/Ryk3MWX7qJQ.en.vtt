00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
between the two sides in which each

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.010

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.810 
attempts to find a way to a solution and
I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> issues<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I think the issues that are now on the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.500 
I think the issues that are now on the
