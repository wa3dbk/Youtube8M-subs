 silly 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.230
 if you share your own so 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 I hope to see you as I told you once 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.159

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.379

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:27.939
 this folder and supports various types of 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.239
 formats avi to sf mov mp4 mpg double mpg 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.980
 md and other quanta so good once 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.719
 that you select the video you give to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.120
 open now we are going to select 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.950
 with these points the region that we 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.560
 we want it to appear in our gif 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.919
 I want this to appear obviously 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.989
 the gentleman's butt we work here 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.609
 can I give you the coordinates or 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.379
 movements that you want good once 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.540
 that we choose the sector we will choose 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:55.659
 from where we want to start good 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.430
 just up the pool is perfect 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.630
 and finish 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.510
 for a little bit more here 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.950
 when I played them there I want 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.050
 go out and finished the gif good something else 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.810
 What we need is to choose a width for 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.540
 This gif or motion image is 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.310
 choose a good width the hard width 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.460
 can finish I want for example a 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.540
 hundred and 200 wide and the high that state 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.490
 it will be predetermined only depending 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.980
 of the dimension of the image we could 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.380
 say that the act will adapt to the width 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.790
 of the image that we will put 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.710
 now that if we want it to be repeated then 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.010
 we're always going to click on infinity 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.390
 look and then let's explain it the 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.490
 Another option that I recommend is that 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.740
 Take out the high quality so that they weigh 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.340
 minus the file and where it says frames by 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.400
 second 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.140
 let's choose 10 that the highest so the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.880
 video will look good once fluid 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.430
 configured the options we are going to give 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.349
 click on your avatar or start 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.109
 if you notice the process is pretty 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:03.370
 fast saves very little delay 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:06.730
 almost 20% call and we get a time 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.950
 estimated completion that of 30 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:14.109
 seconds since it was more or less in my 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.449
 case 35 36 and that depends on your image 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.400
 obviously from your video so good 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.650
 this same is delayed quite a few 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.270
 programs is pretty good and I'll 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.070
 I recommend 100% there it's going to end and 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.560
 adapt the products if we want to see in 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:33.870
 the video generated or the 10 that we made 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.870
 obviously we will answer yes 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.880
 was downloading commands from the browser and back 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.830
 it means to be there well I hope that you 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.980
 have liked this video is quite 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.230
 good the dif and I hope you share it 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.050
 also if possible I commented on 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.060
 well I like it and obviously the essential 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.330
 is that you learn to make your 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.710
 own or own animated images 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.770
 again I thank you for watching the video 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.880
 and thank you very much take care and greetings to 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.880
 all blessings
