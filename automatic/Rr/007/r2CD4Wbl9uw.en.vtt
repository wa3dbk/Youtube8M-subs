know who's driving right in front of the
carrier<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:59.359> so<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.629> mean<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
carrier I was just like so I mean that

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.510 
carrier I was just like so I mean that
was<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.379> first<00:01:01.620> experience<00:01:01.859> ever<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.309> night

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
was my first experience ever at night

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.170 
was my first experience ever at night
and<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.059> oh

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.719 

exactly<00:01:07.180> so<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.890> have<00:01:12.039> all<00:01:12.219> different<00:01:12.460> type<00:01:12.700> of

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
exactly so we have all different type of

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.760 
exactly so we have all different type of
weapons<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.210> we<00:01:13.329> can<00:01:13.509> carry<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.530> we<00:01:14.649> can

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
weapons that we can carry so we can

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.830 
weapons that we can carry so we can
carry<00:01:14.979> everything<00:01:15.340> from<00:01:15.700> GPS<00:01:16.299> guided<00:01:16.659> bombs

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
carry everything from GPS guided bombs

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.039 
carry everything from GPS guided bombs
laser-guided<00:01:17.530> bombs<00:01:18.210> dummy<00:01:19.210> bomb<00:01:19.509> so<00:01:19.780> meaning

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
laser-guided bombs dummy bomb so meaning

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.109 
laser-guided bombs dummy bomb so meaning
like<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.439> drop<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.069> off<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.579> goes<00:01:21.789> wherever

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
like I drop it off and it goes wherever

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.990 
like I drop it off and it goes wherever
but<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.740> know<00:01:23.829> I<00:01:23.860> can<00:01:24.100> guide<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.399> but<00:01:24.789> not

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
but you know I can guide it but not

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.929 
but you know I can guide it but not
after<00:01:25.299> it<00:01:25.569> comes<00:01:25.689> off<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.899> aircraft<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.340> then

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
after it comes off the aircraft and then

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.880 
after it comes off the aircraft and then
I<00:01:27.969> also<00:01:28.179> have<00:01:28.509> bullets<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.469> notes<00:01:29.710> so<00:01:29.860> i

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
I also have bullets in the notes so i

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.169 
I also have bullets in the notes so i
have<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.420> basically<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.689> minigun<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:33.030> nose<00:01:34.030> of

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
have a basically a minigun the nose of

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.539 
have a basically a minigun the nose of
the<00:01:34.210> aircraft<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.750> shoots<00:01:35.130> 20<00:01:36.130> millimeter

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
the aircraft that shoots 20 millimeter

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.850 
the aircraft that shoots 20 millimeter
bullets<00:01:37.000> out<00:01:37.209> of<00:01:37.539> it<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:37.959> then<00:01:38.409> i<00:01:38.439> can<00:01:38.740> also

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
bullets out of it and then i can also

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.539 
bullets out of it and then i can also
get<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.159> air-to-air<00:01:39.729> mode<00:01:40.090> meaning<00:01:40.720> i<00:01:40.959> can<00:01:41.140> get

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
get a air-to-air mode meaning i can get

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.069 
get a air-to-air mode meaning i can get
you<00:01:42.549> know<00:01:42.579> missiles<00:01:43.090> air-to-air<00:01:43.539> missiles<00:01:43.929> on

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
you know missiles air-to-air missiles on

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.899 
you know missiles air-to-air missiles on
the<00:01:44.200> aircraft<00:01:44.319> heat-seeking<00:01:45.280> missiles<00:01:45.789> and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
the aircraft heat-seeking missiles and

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.359 
the aircraft heat-seeking missiles and
everything<00:01:46.179> like<00:01:46.329> that<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.979> all<00:01:48.130> depends

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
everything like that so it all depends

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.130 
everything like that so it all depends
on<00:01:48.520> what<00:01:48.670> type<00:01:48.819> of<00:01:48.849> load<00:01:49.090> out<00:01:49.239> I<00:01:49.270> need<00:01:49.450> and<00:01:50.020> what

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
on what type of load out I need and what

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.740 
on what type of load out I need and what
