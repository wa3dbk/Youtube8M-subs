disappointments<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.010> Poland<00:01:26.570> one<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.690> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
disappointments of Poland one is the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
disappointments of Poland one is the
roads<00:01:28.050> I<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.280> looking<00:01:29.430> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> map

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
roads I don't like looking on the map

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.420 
roads I don't like looking on the map
and<00:01:30.180> thinking<00:01:30.480> there's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.690> motorway<00:01:31.080> between

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
and thinking there's a motorway between

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.890 
and thinking there's a motorway between
Warsaw<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> Gdansk<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.300> then<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.480> see<00:01:33.690> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
Warsaw and Gdansk and then I see that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.470 
Warsaw and Gdansk and then I see that
there<00:01:34.320> isn't<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:36.060> other<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.240> my

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
there isn't one and the other one my

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.200 
there isn't one and the other one my
other<00:01:36.570> disappointment<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.260> actually<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.210> think

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
other disappointment is actually I think

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.060 
other disappointment is actually I think
Poland<00:01:39.690> could<00:01:39.960> should<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.590> hosted<00:01:40.980> this

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
Poland could should have hosted this

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.250 
Poland could should have hosted this
tournament<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.670> their<00:01:41.910> own<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.330> think<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.140> have

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
tournament on their own I think you have

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.750 
tournament on their own I think you have
another<00:01:43.470> beautiful<00:01:43.950> Stadium<00:01:44.340> here<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.520> Warsaw

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
another beautiful Stadium here in Warsaw

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.460 
another beautiful Stadium here in Warsaw
you<00:01:45.510> could<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.720> had<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> stadium<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.290> which

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
you could have had a stadium in which

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.520 
you could have had a stadium in which
you<00:01:46.830> could<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.070> had<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> stadium<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.530> in

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you could have had a stadium in in in

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.400 
you could have had a stadium in in in
Krakov<00:01:49.890> maybe<00:01:50.580> Katowice<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.300> well<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.750> then

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
Krakov maybe Katowice as well and then

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.620 
Krakov maybe Katowice as well and then
boom<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.160> eight<00:01:53.340> stadiums<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.060> think

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
boom you have eight stadiums I think

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.760 
boom you have eight stadiums I think
that<00:01:54.780> would<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.050> made<00:01:55.260> for<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.560> better

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that would have made for a better

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.790 
that would have made for a better
experience<00:01:56.330> easier<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.510> travel<00:01:57.780> between<00:01:58.110> you

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
experience easier to travel between you

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.210 
experience easier to travel between you
know<00:01:58.920> between<00:01:59.730> cities<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
know between cities and you know and

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.340 
know between cities and you know and
Ukraine<00:02:02.760> or<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:03.870> also<00:02:03.930> host<00:02:04.260> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Ukraine or I could also host a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.330 
Ukraine or I could also host a
tournament<00:02:04.620> on<00:02:04.800> their<00:02:04.920> own<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.190> maybe

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
tournament on their own and maybe

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.809 
tournament on their own and maybe
another<00:02:06.060> time<00:02:06.300> if<00:02:07.260> I<00:02:07.440> compared<00:02:07.800> to<00:02:08.009> South

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
another time if I compared to South

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.230 
another time if I compared to South
Africa<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:10.310> pollen<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.460> better<00:02:11.730> because

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
Africa I think pollen is better because

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.330 
Africa I think pollen is better because
the<00:02:12.900> distance<00:02:13.320> are

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
the distance are

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.089 
the distance are
now<00:02:14.489> I'm<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.480> big<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.170> South<00:02:16.349> Africa<00:02:16.890> in

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
now I'm not as big as in South Africa in

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.100 
now I'm not as big as in South Africa in
the<00:02:17.129> World<00:02:17.400> Cup<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.660> say<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> same

the World Cup and you can say the same

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.220 
the World Cup and you can say the same
for<00:02:19.170> for<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.069> Ukraine<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:21.060> big<00:02:21.510> difference

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
for for a Ukraine a big difference

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.300 
for for a Ukraine a big difference
these<00:02:22.650> bit<00:02:23.400> distances<00:02:23.910> between<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.750> cities

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
in Poland quite a few times because I

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.960 
in Poland quite a few times because I
write<00:03:03.540> about<00:03:03.690> Poland<00:03:04.230> normally<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:04.890> it<00:03:05.730> was

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
write about Poland normally so it was

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.720 
write about Poland normally so it was
nothing<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.420> surprised<00:03:07.079> me<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.709> was<00:03:07.890> like

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
nothing that surprised me it was like

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.110 
nothing that surprised me it was like
expected<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:09.629> perhaps<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.829> many<00:03:11.819> of<00:03:11.970> those

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
expected and perhaps I many of those

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.400 
expected and perhaps I many of those
roads<00:03:12.510> weren't<00:03:12.870> burnt<00:03:13.410> finished<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
roads weren't burnt finished and and I

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.289 
roads weren't burnt finished and and I
don't<00:03:16.650> think<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.069> had<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.640> much<00:03:17.819> effect

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
don't think that had so much effect

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.000 
don't think that had so much effect
because<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.780> think<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.079> support<00:03:19.470> some<00:03:19.709> fans

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
because I think to support some fans

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.680 
because I think to support some fans
there<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.489> by<00:03:20.609> train<00:03:20.880> or<00:03:20.940> they<00:03:21.209> going<00:03:21.420> by

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
there going by train or they going by

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.140 
there going by train or they going by
plane<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.799> haven't<00:03:23.370> seen<00:03:23.549> some<00:03:23.760> I've<00:03:24.000> been

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
plane and I haven't seen some I've been

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.849 
plane and I haven't seen some I've been
driving<00:03:24.540> myself<00:03:24.569> but<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.200> haven't<00:03:25.530> seen<00:03:25.680> so

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
driving myself but I haven't seen so

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.920 
driving myself but I haven't seen so
many<00:03:25.980> foreign<00:03:26.340> cars<00:03:26.549> on<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.910> road<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.660> don't

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
many foreign cars on the road so I don't

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.800 
many foreign cars on the road so I don't
think<00:03:28.109> that<00:03:28.290> has<00:03:28.950> any<00:03:29.310> effect<00:03:29.609> at<00:03:30.030> all<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.510> think

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
think that has any effect at all I think

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:41.390 
think that has any effect at all I think
the<00:03:31.380> bus<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.209> train<00:03:33.599> is<00:03:33.989> an<00:03:37.340> very<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:40.400> think

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
the bus and the train is an very I think

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.659 
the bus and the train is an very I think
it's<00:03:41.730> very<00:03:41.849> good<00:03:42.120> but<00:03:42.650> before<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.859> every

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
it's very good but before the every

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.900 
it's very good but before the every
match<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:46.109> tree<00:03:46.410> and<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.889> past<00:03:47.099> can<00:03:47.519> get

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
match and the tree and the past can get

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.830 
match and the tree and the past can get
to<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.450> stadium<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.500> we<00:03:50.340> will<00:03:51.500> we<00:03:52.500> will<00:03:53.840> walk

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
to the stadium and we will we will walk

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.190 
to the stadium and we will we will walk
so<00:03:55.470> far<00:03:55.950> away<00:03:56.130> from<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.209> bus<00:03:57.419> station<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.169> think

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
so far away from the bus station I think

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.539 
so far away from the bus station I think
is<00:03:58.769> too<00:03:59.069> tired

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
is too tired

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.610 
is too tired
I<00:03:59.849> think<00:04:00.889> if<00:04:01.889> have<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.959> opportunity<00:04:03.959> next<00:04:04.260> time

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
I think if have a opportunity next time

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.140 
I think if have a opportunity next time
the<00:04:06.459> past<00:04:06.790> can<00:04:07.300> get<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.500> stadium<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.370> that

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
the past can get to the stadium and that

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.050 
the past can get to the stadium and that
then<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.610> walk<00:04:13.260> near<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.860> what<00:04:15.519> did<00:04:15.940> you

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
then we can walk near and what did you

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.520 
then we can walk near and what did you
like<00:04:16.239> in<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.750> tournament<00:04:17.260> in<00:04:17.949> Poland<00:04:19.320> mm<00:04:20.320> I

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530
