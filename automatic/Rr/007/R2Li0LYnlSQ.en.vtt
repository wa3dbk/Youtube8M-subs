00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.630
 hello friends how are we here today 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.029
 more time recording and then good more than 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.060
 a recipe this time I want to share 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.210
 a Mexican appetizer that good those who 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.009
 they are from the federal district because they will give me 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.559
 know if I'm in error but the 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.320
 put this street above all here in 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:37.010
 mexico potatoes are very popular 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.790
 French and good as far as I know I 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.950
 I ate them with yellow cheese they put 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.450
 cream is also exposed capsule and sauce 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:54.360
 spicy sauce and good the way is to be 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:58.080
 I have potatoes here I have peeled 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.560
 and so we are going to cut this way 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.590
 long 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.680
 they can do the same with shell and 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.390
 Well, I recommend that you do not 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.070
 they are oxidized or if they want to have them in 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.940
 the refrigerator lists a day for 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.610
 another or from a while to another then 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.910
 put the word and so they will not get 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.590
 blacks or if they have left over this metal is 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.200
 the refrigerator covered with a plastic 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.050
 Well they came here with the cheese 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.740
 How can I do a little bit? Nothing else is a 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.710
 craving as I tell you then nothing more 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.280
 this dissolved what are two slices 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.650
 of American cheese 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.430
 with a little bit of milk that will be two 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.140
 teaspoons of milk and already 25 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.950
 seconds to the microwave and it's already in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 account and what is my pan with oil 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.729
 and well I think it's better good I 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.470
 I suggest you make these chips and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.979
 prepare them for your children or for one 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.560
 same as better than in the house the oil 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.380
 Well, they use it 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 the oil is not so pink or is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.690
 this 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.610
 clean and well I know that they sell them 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.080
 on the street also in restaurants but 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.560
 the oils are already too many 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.480
 pink true and well as I do them 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.480
 I said in this channel there's going to be a whole 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.790
 little also to how I cook sometimes 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.989
 healthy meals for good suddenly 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.510
 you have to satisfy us with some 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.730
 good snacks I will try if the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.730
 oil is already hot 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:40.210
 and so good today was one day of that 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.840
 of snacks and if a hot one is already 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.840
 cock like that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.640
 and I tell them not to be so hot 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.810
 oil because if it is very hot what 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.210
 only thing they are going to do is 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.540
 and 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.880
 burn like they're going to look golden 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.060
 but they are not going to be done in the good middle 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.060
 height 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.299
 I'm telling you because I'm passing, look, they 're 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.900
 the first ones that I think I was 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.450
 super hot and it looks like they're 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:15.689
 cooked but not as well known by the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.689
 medium and apart they do not have a pretty color 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.860
 and so with the average temperature 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.860
 that is to see people warm their oil well 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.760
 and how are they going to 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.099
 to put here in the oil already they lower the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.099
 average temperature medium fire 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.579
 at this point you have to have a little 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.069
 of patience I tell you because fire does not 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:51.420
 it's high then I want it to be sewn 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.420
 slowly look 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:59.129
 then I am going to put it in a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.129
 solvent napkin 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.739
 to remove a little excess 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.739
 oil 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.550
 and well, the hotter the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.709
 oil also because less fat are going to 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.890
 consume also although it is impossible 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.890
 obvious truth that if you consume oil 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.120
 and I'm going to clean them a little bit like that with 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.120
 the same paper 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:41.779
 and good and what remains for me nothing more here 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:41.779
 is preparing them 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.620
 and well you will say good potatoes 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.100
 anyone can cook them 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.630
 I know but only trying to give a 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.020
 idea 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:57.430
 as the same in each in each is 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.430
 depending on our country of origin 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:03.090
 they prepare them differently and all 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:06.330
 snacks because they are different if you 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.730
 if in your country of origin or the place where 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.010
 where they are prepared differently from 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.010
 melo to comment 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.970
 and well, they will always learn 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.030
 new things here I'm throwing the cheese 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:24.470
 yellow face 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.470
 and well, the cream 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.220
 and as I tell you, I'm just 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:37.600
 trying to give an idea because since 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:41.200
 It will never leave the same as to 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.110
 like this one they do traditionally and 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.300
 apart from anyone who brings things 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.950
 to start the cheese the cheese then I 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.190
 I do not know what kind of cheese they put there 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.660
 in mexico 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.879
 because there is no other because one is 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.550
 ingenie the truth then I guess that 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:59.580
 It can be from the nachos but well 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.550
 why am I going to buy the big pot of 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.919
 cheese with nothing else is for a little bit and 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.449
 good and the sauce well to taste true 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.789
 Well friends, I do not have more than 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:14.520
 say goodbye and well, leave me your 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:19.389
