we<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.369> hold<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> win<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.720> way

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
we can hold on to the win all the way

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 
we can hold on to the win all the way
until<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> end<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.470> unfortunately<00:01:38.130> Urbana

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
until the end but unfortunately Urbana

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
until the end but unfortunately Urbana
makes<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.119> horrible<00:01:39.720> mistake<00:01:39.840> not<00:01:40.350> heading

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
makes a horrible mistake not heading

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.530 
makes a horrible mistake not heading
that<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:40.979> away<00:01:41.070> goes<00:01:41.700> through<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.329> think

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
that one away goes through and I think

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.670 
that one away goes through and I think
that's<00:01:42.659> sold<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.079> dough<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.290> ends<00:01:43.619> up

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that's sold a dough that ends up

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.289 
that's sold a dough that ends up
converting<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.280> while<00:01:44.430> making<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> 22<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
converting that while making it 22 and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.880 
converting that while making it 22 and
then<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> stroke<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> end<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
then on the stroke of the end of the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
then on the stroke of the end of the
game<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.250> managed<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.850> score<00:01:48.240> again<00:01:48.750> from

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
game he managed to score again from

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.539

from<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.129> team<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:43.180> may<00:02:43.360> be<00:02:43.420> now<00:02:43.720> time<00:02:44.080> to

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
from the team and it may be now time to

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.470

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
probably the most no coming for me it's

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.900 
probably the most no coming for me it's
crazy<00:04:27.290> but<00:04:27.770> he<00:04:27.890> has<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.100> most<00:04:28.220> kuebler<00:04:28.700> face

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.650 
and we do of course end up conceding the
penalty<00:04:34.010> which<00:04:34.430> means<00:04:34.670> it's<00:04:34.820> 32<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.330> him<00:04:35.480> and
