 beginner tutorial and in today's video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.440
 we will address the subject on the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.120
 magical and human 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.650
 in the first video I explained what it was 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.570
 medical war without putting too 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.830
 no rule in question and today I go 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.330
 make a very simple introduction 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
 explaining to you what are the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.199
 magic that is human and how plays 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.430
 Let's go magic 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.430
 Mr. japan care teams 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.460
 powder 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.809
 basically at jett's doctor me 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.699
 There are two types of kata that are 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.290
 magic and the grounds 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 Now I ask you one question. 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.300
 instinctive question this question is whether 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.700
 you were a wizard what you would need 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.640
 to launch their magic following the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.070
 obvious logic of rpgs nos out there you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.690
 needs and if there is a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.670
 Jett doctor comes just one week 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.229
 of the lands not of us strange 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.170
 specific human 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.659
 there are five basic types of land 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.979
 lands that are not basic to this 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.690
 Beginner tutorial I'll take in 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.360
 considered exclusively by the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:35.280
 basic basic external terms are ok 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.100
 daughter plain mountain forest and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.130
 swamp from where we extracted 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 respectively human blue is the special 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.229
 Where I put it but we're in the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.610
 blue 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.800
 We are there, human black people. 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.509
 works human red green and human 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.350
 white beauty 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.060
 besides the magic we have as a whole 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.520
 seven kinds of magic 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 magic cards can be magic 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.470
 magic spell creature 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.920
 magic instant of enchantment 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:10.729
 magic magical artifacts and the 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.729
 equipment magic is this 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.560
 another extremely important detail is 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.780
 that the lands they add human 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.290
 however the grounds are not human 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.420
 you know how important something else is 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.760
 players should know the grounds they 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.920
 the land is not 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.349
 human and despite the land add 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000
 in colored or colorless manas in case 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.760
 of the basic lands they add 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.670
 human beings, the lands do not 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.590
 colors colors only the magic can 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.870
 to keep in mind also that the marks 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.670
 may have more than one color and the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.340
 also may not have color 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.690
 some of them can without card colors 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.280
 physician and IMF 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.050
 you can simply play your 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.569
 lands by taking them out of their 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.069
 putting them into play and turning those 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.450
 plots to illustrate that you are 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.890
 generating human with them 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 already the magic has a rule 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.460
 specific to be played 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.750
 I'll give some examples here let's go 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.790
 for example the number 1 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.090
 Gray I want you to see that 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.640
 in the top right corner of the tasting 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.980
 a symbol and there is also a number o 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.570
 that symbol means that symbol 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.910
 it represents specific human being 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.830
 needs to be played the number represents 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.709
 a mana of any color that can be 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.440
 played for you to understand this cost 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.900
 just take the number of symbols from the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.340
 letter and add it to the other 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.160
 example in the case of the gray bear letter 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.140
 she needs a green human and a year 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.239
 and so fill it for two weeks 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.530
 you just have to turn a forest to 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.420
 represent that you are generating a 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.489
 green spot plus any terrain 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.950
 to generate a mana of any color and 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.330
 play the gray card of your mother game 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.280
 let's go to the next chandra example 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.530
 fire the master finds for the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.110
 master has two mana symbols 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.070
 red and number two what this 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.530
 means 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.150
 it means it costs four years 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.209
 to be put into play and for this 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.950
 you need to turn a mountain two 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.500
 mountains to generate two mangoes 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.390
 red and two more 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.680
 to generate more human of any color 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.600
 Let's go to our third party now. 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.060
 example the bird shape letter in the area 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.940
 cut off area fires can see them 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.400
 has a green zone a red spot and 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.500
 a number 1 that means it costs 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.360
 three weeks to be played for you 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.550
 play fireworks of maria you need 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.380
 turn a forest from the 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.970
 green castor a mountain to add 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.950
 human population and any terrain 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.140
 human professional of any color 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.360
 note how the letter f Mayan R it is 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.430
 in fact golden, which means that 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.680
 she is multicolored what color is the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.330
 multicolored letters is exactly the color 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.940
 that appears in the week symbol to play 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.820
 the letter letters such as projects 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.590
 which have all 55 weeks only 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.440
 indicate that the letter has all the 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.419
 five colors and beauty there are also 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.370
 magic that has no color like for 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.710
 example the sword feast equipment 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.690
 famine for the famine feast costs only 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.000
