00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.820
 all in one as all welcome to the 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.470
 bacon channel x-35 today I bring you a 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.450
 new gta 5 video in which I'm going to 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.099
 teach them a couple of tricks to take out 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.590
 photos to your vehicle in a way 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.180
 different and I think you're going to like it 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.000
 Well first of all what I recommend 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.220
 do is modify or change the color of 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.780
 your vehicle with a hidden color that 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.550
 already shows you in a previous video and 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.070
 you will have an annotation in case you want 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.630
 go to visit that video and just 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.760
 when you have already painted your 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.100
 vehicle with the color that you like 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.510
 Well, let's do the following trick 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.420
 what would be the reduction of 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.370
 suspension of your car and for that 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.989
 you just have to point to the center 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.030
 of the wheels shoot until you see 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.429
 that the suspension be lowered and once 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.109
 may have lowered suspension as 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.850
 let's perform the following trick that 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.370
 is where I wanted to focus on this 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.440
 video and I wanted to teach it's about opening 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.810
 the rear and front hood of this 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.340
 vehicle each vehicle is different there 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.440
 vehicles that can not open the hood 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.270
 rear but the front hood and 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.250
 almost the entire vehicle is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.440
 they can open the front hood but that 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.610
 yes each vehicle is different and can 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.280
 that does not open 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.220
 but I'm going to show you in this video on 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.060
 this case you have to select the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.380
 sniper with all vehicles 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.880
 you have to select the sniper 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.920
 to be able to open the hood 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.860
 we have to aim what is in the area 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.080
 of the hinges on the hood and you 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.610
 will open in this case in this vehicle is 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.920
 a little different you have to aim a 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.140
 little closer than it is the focus 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.240
 front of the vehicle and you will see that 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.520
 will open simply you have to try with 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.310
 the vehicle that most interests you for 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.800
 know how to open the hood and once 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.920
 you have the half open hood 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.780
 the vehicle accelerates and the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.090
 hood once done this can you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.009
 just take a picture with the hood 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.869
 forward if that's what you're interested in doing 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.180
 but I also wanted to show you how 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.770
 open the rear hood for it you have 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.149
 that put on one side one of the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.430
 windows and point with the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.590
 sniper to the back of what 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.080
 which is the hood and shoot a couple of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.910
 times and maybe three until the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.950
 hood automatically there's no need to 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.480
 get on the vehicle or anything 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.370
 they just shoot until it 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.130
 open and once you have the hood of 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.470
 Front the rear hood suspension 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.420
 reduced 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.160
 hidden in your vehicle I think that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.340
 the car is ready to be able 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.769
 take a photo and so have not be a 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.620
 different and special photo that I think 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.709
 it looks pretty good and you can share it 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.019
 with your friends no more with this already 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.959
 I say goodbye, you can send me the photos that 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.769
 get your vehicle to my twitter 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.799
 that would be bacon x 35 in which I 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.870
 receive those photos very grateful and if 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.599
 you want I can put it in a video 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.880
 that goes up tomorrow or the day after tomorrow depends 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.190

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.860

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.019
