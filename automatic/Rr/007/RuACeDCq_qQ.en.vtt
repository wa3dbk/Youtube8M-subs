00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 english mostly from minecraft 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.820
 minecraft that beat the focus of that channel 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.680
 and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.930
 we are going to be the focus of the non- channel 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.730
 It's going to be only a manifesto. We're going to record. 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 several other games there that we find 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.150
 going to be buying team games for 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.600
 You and I know you have to talk. 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:38.080

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:43.020
 make a game play also of bf3 portal 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.580
 2 as much as possible and yes people are 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.880
 I should have offered you that. 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:54.750
 because otherwise I adore 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:02:01.150
 So, people, first of all, happy. 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:03.160
 Christmas has gone hungry now and we 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.369
 I had recorded you will go to the 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.130
 people are between us and we have failed to 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.170
 recording did not go out there unfortunately 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.020
 the audio did not come out but we 're going 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.489
 beginning the channel series account 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.030
 Minecraft I think you already know 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.410
 already face we're so leaves much 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.870
 This will start to make a 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.030
 consequently we will invent the tale 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.150
 will record everything had edited in 2001 to 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.060
 I'll spend half an hour there for you and it depends 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.070
 ideas will insert the points there 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.080
 When the idea is over, we 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.030
 back when the idea is we are still 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.930
 and that's it people want to talk more 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.549
 something 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.340
 the pasta is all too expensive 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.380
 and is now shifting focus to channel I 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.390
 I think we'll make a special 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.970
 New port also like that side 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.880
 Friday the 13th that I did on the channel and 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.980
 because I live good feedback there and I saw 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.739
 I get out I'll make a doc I think 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.019
 that she then there they are now that 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.010
 with the first point of the mark is first 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.760
 against minecraft and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.010
 I think that when it's with s, that's what I said 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.010
 I'll tell you the next time and worth the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.360
 Christmas is a time of year when 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.050

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.180

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.980
 everyone wins gifts and every day they go 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.660
 learning more the secrets of life 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.640
 today we are going to show the story of a 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.840
 dreamer who obeyed no one and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.000
 it hurt badly 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.390
 Oops today I can not forget to pick up 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.390

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.470

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:49.320

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.260

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.070

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.950

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:12.180

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.810
 to make me sick I think I'm going to lie down 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.750
 a little 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.150

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.190
 He preferred death instead of life. 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.580
 now he's the spirit called hair o 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:56.040
 brain that killed the boys I'll have 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.810

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.160

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.230
 the miners who stole my diamond 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.670
 meanwhile in the depths of the mines 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.820
