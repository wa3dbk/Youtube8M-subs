some family health issues at the moment

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.070 
some family health issues at the moment
so<00:00:04.799> they<00:00:05.310> take<00:00:05.549> precedence<00:00:06.299> over<00:00:06.480> playing

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
so they take precedence over playing

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.680 
so they take precedence over playing
some<00:00:07.319> silly<00:00:07.560> space<00:00:07.919> games<00:00:08.250> but<00:00:08.580> I've<00:00:09.120> quickly

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
some silly space games but I've quickly

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.440 
some silly space games but I've quickly
knocked<00:00:09.990> together<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:11.190> new<00:00:11.730> part<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.269> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
knocked together a new part of this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.900 
knocked together a new part of this
project<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:13.530> i<00:00:13.559> thought<00:00:13.830> i'd<00:00:14.009> show<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.639> just

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
project so i thought i'd show you just

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.910 
project so i thought i'd show you just
to<00:00:15.030> assure<00:00:15.179> people<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.440> know<00:00:16.529> still

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
to assure people that I'm you know still

doing this I haven't done anything to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
doing this I haven't done anything to
the<00:00:19.710> large<00:00:20.220> ship<00:00:20.580> over<00:00:20.939> here<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the large ship over here in the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109 
the large ship over here in the
background<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:23.189> read<00:00:23.490> your<00:00:23.519> feedback

background but I have read your feedback

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
background but I have read your feedback
and<00:00:24.359> there's<00:00:24.689> some<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.050> great<00:00:25.350> ideas<00:00:25.410> in

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and there's some really great ideas in

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.529 
and there's some really great ideas in
there<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.519> i<00:00:26.550> look<00:00:26.760> forward<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.090> tinkering

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
there that i look forward to tinkering

there that i look forward to tinkering
with<00:00:27.650> there's<00:00:28.650> also<00:00:28.740> been<00:00:29.070> two<00:00:29.400> updates<00:00:29.849> since

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
with there's also been two updates since

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.790 
with there's also been two updates since
I<00:00:30.480> built<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:30.900> there's<00:00:31.260> some<00:00:31.410> new<00:00:31.590> features

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I built it so there's some new features

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190 
I built it so there's some new features
to<00:00:32.009> play<00:00:32.279> around<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.850> well<00:00:33.030> however<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
to play around with as well however I

to play around with as well however I
just<00:00:34.230> filled<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> template<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
just filled in the template of this

this<00:00:38.910> isn't<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.930> finalized

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
this isn't going to be the finalized

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
aesthetic there are bits of it I'm not

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.619 
aesthetic there are bits of it I'm not
entirely<00:00:43.440> happy<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.860> plus<00:00:44.370> also<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.480> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
detailing to make it look better so it's

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.400 
detailing to make it look better so it's
not<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:48.180> oddly<00:00:48.899> shaped<00:00:48.930> polygon<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
not just an oddly shaped polygon but I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.360 
not just an oddly shaped polygon but I
anyway<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> keep<00:00:52.949> telling<00:00:53.129> myself

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
anyway I have to keep telling myself

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
anyway I have to keep telling myself
that<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.090> meant<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.629> functional<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
that this is meant to be functional so

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.729 
that this is meant to be functional so
it's<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.010> important<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
it's not that important what is

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.770 
it's not that important what is
important<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> faster<00:01:00.750> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
important is that this is a faster and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
important is that this is a faster and
more<00:01:01.230> agile<00:01:01.530> ship<00:01:02.070> than<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> other<00:01:02.640> one

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
more agile ship than that other one

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.200 
more agile ship than that other one
capable<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.780> dropping<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:05.189> pod<00:01:05.580> full<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
capable of dropping that one pod full of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.350 
capable of dropping that one pod full of
troops<00:01:06.510> accurately<00:01:07.229> at<00:01:07.500> speed<00:01:08.090> unlike<00:01:09.090> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
troops accurately at speed unlike the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.050 
troops accurately at speed unlike the
large<00:01:09.689> one<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.200> isn't<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> full<00:01:11.580> frontal

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
large one this isn't for a full frontal

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.719 
large one this isn't for a full frontal
attack<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.659> more<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.229> ship<00:01:14.010> capable<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
attack it's more of a ship capable of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
attack it's more of a ship capable of
dropping<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.210> strike<00:01:15.570> team<00:01:15.840> whilst<00:01:16.350> also<00:01:16.710> being

a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.400> bit<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:21.299> also<00:01:21.840> wouldn't<00:01:22.229> mind<00:01:22.380> having

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
a little bit I also wouldn't mind having

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.670 
a little bit I also wouldn't mind having

situations where you don't need the

situations where you don't need the
added<00:01:30.000> defenses<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.829> this

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
added defenses and you know all this

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.510 
added defenses and you know all this
horrendously<00:01:32.939> ugly<00:01:33.720> heavy<00:01:34.020> armor<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:35.400> can

horrendously ugly heavy armor as we can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
horrendously ugly heavy armor as we can
see<00:01:35.700> there's<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.000> pod<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> frontier<00:01:37.110> with

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
see there's a pod of the frontier with

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
see there's a pod of the frontier with
the<00:01:37.740> ship<00:01:37.920> angled<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.640> round<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> direction

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the ship angled a round of the direction

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
the ship angled a round of the direction
in<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.229> will<00:01:40.439> draw<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:41.150> testing<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.180> pod

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
in which it will draw in testing the pod

in which it will draw in testing the pod
does<00:01:42.930> not<00:01:43.110> come<00:01:43.409> into<00:01:43.619> contact<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.220> anything

does not come into contact with anything

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.380 
does not come into contact with anything
and<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.479> such<00:01:45.720> nothing<00:01:46.320> gets<00:01:46.500> damaged<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.850> is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and as such nothing gets damaged it is

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
and as such nothing gets damaged it is
much<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:48.810> vulnerable<00:01:49.320> than<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> other<00:01:50.250> one

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
much more vulnerable than the other one

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.880 
much more vulnerable than the other one

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
but again it's not made for the same

but again it's not made for the same

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
sort of conditions the pod is one block

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.870 
sort of conditions the pod is one block
wider<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:58.200> accommodate<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.979> symmetrical

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
wider to accommodate the symmetrical

requirements<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> ship<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.680> could

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
requirements of the ship but it could

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.910 
requirements of the ship but it could
also<00:02:01.860> be<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.399> block<00:02:02.939> less<00:02:03.390> deep<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.500> wanted

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
also be one block less deep if I wanted

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
also be one block less deep if I wanted
to<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:05.909> matter<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.329> could<00:02:06.450> also<00:02:06.600> be

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to for that matter it could also be

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
to for that matter it could also be
bigger<00:02:07.500> doesn't<00:02:08.069> really<00:02:08.220> infringe<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
bigger doesn't really infringe on the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
ship as a whole so we'll quickly have a

ship as a whole so we'll quickly have a
look<00:02:12.450> inside<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:14.040> there's<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.430> door<00:02:16.760> there's

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
down in here anyway I'm going to copy

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.050 
down in here anyway I'm going to copy
this<00:02:54.510> into<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.500> easy<00:02:55.860> start<00:02:56.340> world<00:02:56.610> with<00:02:57.030> that

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
this into the easy start world with that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.600 
this into the easy start world with that
large<00:02:57.750> station<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:58.770> I<00:02:58.830> can<00:02:58.950> give<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.220> go<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
large station so I can give it a go and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.480 
large station so I can give it a go and
see<00:02:59.670> if<00:02:59.880> I<00:02:59.970> can't<00:03:00.210> drop<00:03:00.420> myself<00:03:00.840> onto<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.290> I

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
see if I can't drop myself onto it I

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.040 
see if I can't drop myself onto it I
don't<00:03:02.490> hold<00:03:02.850> high<00:03:03.180> hopes<00:03:03.450> at<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.780> stage

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
don't hold high hopes at this stage

there so here we are a while out from
the<00:03:06.870> station<00:03:07.140> I'm<00:03:07.920> going<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.550> moving<00:03:09.000> back

the station I'm going to be moving back
in<00:03:09.630> once<00:03:09.870> i<00:03:10.020> get<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> bit<00:03:10.350> further<00:03:10.530> out<00:03:10.830> and

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
in once i get a bit further out and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.160 
in once i get a bit further out and
cruise<00:03:11.460> in<00:03:11.730> at<00:03:11.850> about<00:03:11.940> 30<00:03:12.330> meters<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> second

my thrusters then my inertial dampeners
and<00:03:23.610> land<00:03:24.180> without<00:03:24.360> too<00:03:24.720> much<00:03:24.870> damage<00:03:25.310> quite<00:03:26.310> a

and land without too much damage quite a

and land without too much damage quite a
few<00:03:26.430> people<00:03:26.610> talked<00:03:27.240> about<00:03:27.510> putting<00:03:27.780> landing

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
few people talked about putting landing

gear on this pod personally I'm not

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.440 
gear on this pod personally I'm not
really<00:03:31.620> sure<00:03:31.709> why<00:03:32.370> as<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.910> pod<00:03:33.180> is

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
really sure why as this pod is

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.330 
really sure why as this pod is
disposable<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.470> bit<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.709> damage<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
armor from a rough landing doesn't

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.350 
armor from a rough landing doesn't
really<00:03:37.050> concern<00:03:37.320> me<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.330> least

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
really concern me but you know at least

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.910 
really concern me but you know at least
it<00:03:39.660> will<00:03:39.720> give<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.930> bit<00:03:40.170> more<00:03:40.200> of<00:03:40.380> a<00:03:40.530> crumple

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
it will give a bit more of a crumple

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.850 
it will give a bit more of a crumple
zone<00:03:41.130> i<00:03:41.310> guess<00:03:41.690> i'll<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:43.050> back<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> when

zone i guess i'll get back to you when

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.110 
zone i guess i'll get back to you when
I'm<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.430> position<00:03:45.920> ok<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.280> we<00:03:47.310> are<00:03:47.580> we're

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
I'm in position ok here we are we're

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.930 
I'm in position ok here we are we're
coming<00:03:48.570> across<00:03:49.050> for<00:03:49.470> about<00:03:49.650> 1,500<00:03:50.160> meters<00:03:50.760> out

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
coming across for about 1,500 meters out

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.210 
coming across for about 1,500 meters out
traveling<00:03:51.570> at<00:03:51.750> just<00:03:51.959> over<00:03:52.170> 30<00:03:52.709> meters<00:03:53.190> a

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
traveling at just over 30 meters a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.710 
traveling at just over 30 meters a
second<00:03:55.730> ok<00:03:56.730> we're<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.270> to<00:03:57.330> make<00:03:57.450> sure

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
second ok we're just going to make sure

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.850 
second ok we're just going to make sure
a<00:03:58.050> bit<00:03:58.440> over<00:03:58.860> a<00:03:58.890> little<00:03:59.190> bit<00:03:59.340> more<00:03:59.640> now<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.590> pod

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
a bit over a little bit more now the pod

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.770 
a bit over a little bit more now the pod
will<00:04:02.250> not<00:04:02.459> just<00:04:02.670> go<00:04:02.850> straight<00:04:03.180> down<00:04:03.209> either

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
will not just go straight down either

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.630 
will not just go straight down either
because<00:04:04.200> we<00:04:04.320> do<00:04:04.470> have<00:04:04.620> some<00:04:04.830> inertia<00:04:05.100> Iran<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
because we do have some inertia Iran and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.850 
because we do have some inertia Iran and
the<00:04:05.700> inertial<00:04:06.090> dampeners<00:04:06.510> are<00:04:06.690> off<00:04:06.959> which<00:04:07.830> is

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
the inertial dampeners are off which is

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.150 
the inertial dampeners are off which is
what<00:04:08.040> I<00:04:08.400> intend<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.720> use<00:04:10.080> didn't<00:04:10.920> need<00:04:11.040> to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
what I intend to use didn't need to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.070 
what I intend to use didn't need to
speed<00:04:11.430> up<00:04:11.459> there<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:12.030> think<00:04:12.570> we're<00:04:12.660> going<00:04:12.780> up<00:04:12.989> a

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
speed up there I think we're going up a

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.900 
speed up there I think we're going up a
little<00:04:13.320> bit<00:04:13.440> now<00:04:14.750> ok<00:04:15.750> so<00:04:16.290> we're<00:04:16.980> going<00:04:17.280> here<00:04:17.520> we

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
little bit now ok so we're going here we

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.909 
little bit now ok so we're going here we
need<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.330> artificial<00:04:19.080> masters<00:04:19.560> on<00:04:19.739> they're

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
need the artificial masters on they're

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.760 
need the artificial masters on they're
going<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.190> pull<00:04:20.400> down<00:04:20.669> but<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.120> release<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.930> it

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
going to pull down but we release and it

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.810 
going to pull down but we release and it
took<00:04:22.950> me<00:04:23.100> out<00:04:23.190> of<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
took me out of the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.380 
took me out of the
thing<00:04:24.420> that<00:04:24.750> might<00:04:24.990> be<00:04:25.200> bad<00:04:26.150> okay<00:04:27.150> here<00:04:27.300> we<00:04:27.330> go

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
thing that might be bad okay here we go

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.380 
thing that might be bad okay here we go
I<00:04:27.980> can't<00:04:28.980> see<00:04:29.190> oh<00:04:31.370> my<00:04:32.370> adapt<00:04:32.700> dampeners<00:04:33.240> were

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
I can't see oh my adapt dampeners were

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.710 
I can't see oh my adapt dampeners were
on<00:04:33.540> okay<00:04:34.250> so<00:04:35.250> apparently<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.970> dampness<00:04:36.300> don't

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
on okay so apparently the dampness don't

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.840 
on okay so apparently the dampness don't
stay<00:04:37.230> off<00:04:37.950> oh<00:04:39.860> I<00:04:40.860> forgot<00:04:41.250> to<00:04:41.520> turn<00:04:41.640> off<00:04:41.700> my

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
stay off oh I forgot to turn off my

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.660 
stay off oh I forgot to turn off my
artificial<00:04:42.600> masses<00:04:43.080> well<00:04:44.570> we<00:04:45.570> didn't<00:04:45.840> die

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.970 

well<00:04:50.670> at<00:04:50.790> least<00:04:50.910> I<00:04:51.120> was<00:04:51.270> able<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.570> aim<00:04:51.810> so<00:04:52.620> I

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
well at least I was able to aim so I

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.160 
well at least I was able to aim so I
think<00:04:53.550> that's<00:04:53.850> more<00:04:54.090> successful<00:04:54.810> than<00:04:54.960> I

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
think that's more successful than I

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.610 
think that's more successful than I
intended<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.370> be<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.780> well<00:04:59.450> we<00:05:00.450> missed<00:05:01.380> the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
intended it to be so well we missed the

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.140 
intended it to be so well we missed the
state<00:05:01.860> oh<00:05:01.890> come<00:05:02.250> on<00:05:02.340> let's<00:05:02.580> get<00:05:02.760> at<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:02.940> store

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
state oh come on let's get at the store

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.000 
state oh come on let's get at the store
miss<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.900> station<00:05:04.290> went<00:05:04.560> through<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.830> hole

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
miss the station went through the hole

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.030 
miss the station went through the hole
in<00:05:05.040> the<00:05:05.310> middle<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.680> couple<00:05:07.920> little

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
in the middle it's a couple little

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.250 
in the middle it's a couple little
problems<00:05:08.580> there<00:05:08.850> I<00:05:09.120> thought<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:09.840> because

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
problems there I thought that because

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.650 
problems there I thought that because
the<00:05:10.500> ship's<00:05:11.070> inertial<00:05:11.940> dampeners<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.420> have<00:05:12.510> no

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
the ship's inertial dampeners I have no

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.330 
the ship's inertial dampeners I have no
idea<00:05:12.900> where<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.050> ship<00:05:13.230> went<00:05:13.470> but<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.100> thought

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
idea where the ship went but I thought

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.450 
idea where the ship went but I thought
that<00:05:14.610> because<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.860> ship's<00:05:16.860> inertial

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
that because of the the ship's inertial

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.870 
that because of the the ship's inertial
dampeners<00:05:17.820> were<00:05:17.970> off<00:05:18.560> that<00:05:19.560> the<00:05:20.040> pod<00:05:20.490> when

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
dampeners were off that the pod when

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.880 
dampeners were off that the pod when
released<00:05:21.300> would<00:05:21.690> also<00:05:21.930> have<00:05:22.260> its<00:05:22.470> inertial

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
released would also have its inertial

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.020 
released would also have its inertial
dampeners<00:05:23.280> off<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.550> just<00:05:23.580> sort<00:05:23.850> of<00:05:23.880> assumed

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
dampeners off I just sort of assumed

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.350 
dampeners off I just sort of assumed
that<00:05:24.600> but<00:05:25.110> obviously<00:05:25.470> I<00:05:25.560> was<00:05:25.680> wrong<00:05:25.830> so<00:05:26.700> as

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
that but obviously I was wrong so as

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.510 
that but obviously I was wrong so as
soon<00:05:27.570> as<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.870> went<00:05:28.410> outside<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.160> gravity

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
soon as I went outside of the gravity

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520 
soon as I went outside of the gravity
field<00:05:29.670> I<00:05:29.910> just<00:05:30.150> sort<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.330> slowly<00:05:31.080> came<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.500> a

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
field I just sort of slowly came to a

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.770 
field I just sort of slowly came to a
stop<00:05:31.830> which<00:05:32.130> was<00:05:32.340> up<00:05:32.610> higher<00:05:33.240> than<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:33.600> intended

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
stop which was up higher than I intended

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.020 
stop which was up higher than I intended
and<00:05:34.320> if<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.100> weren't<00:05:35.310> for<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.550> fact<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.850> I

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
and if it weren't for the fact that I

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.660 
and if it weren't for the fact that I
stupidly<00:05:36.750> left<00:05:37.050> my<00:05:37.350> artificial<00:05:37.740> masses<00:05:38.250> on<00:05:38.400> as

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
stupidly left my artificial masses on as

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.580 
stupidly left my artificial masses on as
well<00:05:38.910> I<00:05:39.150> am<00:05:39.630> going<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:39.990> have<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.230> work<00:05:40.350> out<00:05:40.560> a

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
well I am going to have to work out a

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.550 
well I am going to have to work out a
way<00:05:40.830> to<00:05:41.280> sort<00:05:41.520> of<00:05:41.610> refine<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.360> system<00:05:42.870> down<00:05:43.530> a

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
way to sort of refine that system down a

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.090 
way to sort of refine that system down a
little<00:05:43.920> bit<00:05:44.390> so<00:05:45.390> that<00:05:45.420> I<00:05:45.750> am<00:05:45.930> am<00:05:46.380> NOT<00:05:46.620> sort<00:05:47.040> of

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
the terminal this thing flicked off as

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.590 
the terminal this thing flicked off as
soon<00:05:55.950> as<00:05:56.100> I<00:05:56.190> released<00:05:56.520> as<00:05:56.730> well<00:05:56.940> which<00:05:57.390> is<00:05:57.420> a

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
soon as I released as well which is a

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.890 
soon as I released as well which is a
little<00:05:58.170> bit<00:05:58.290> annoying<00:05:58.790> as<00:05:59.790> I<00:06:00.450> said<00:06:00.690> in<00:06:00.870> the

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
little bit annoying as I said in the

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.920 
little bit annoying as I said in the
last<00:06:01.110> video<00:06:01.410> I<00:06:01.620> would<00:06:01.890> like<00:06:01.950> for<00:06:02.370> there<00:06:02.640> to<00:06:02.670> be

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
last video I would like for there to be

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.260 
last video I would like for there to be
you<00:06:03.930> know<00:06:04.080> more<00:06:04.440> than<00:06:04.500> one<00:06:05.130> person

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
you know more than one person

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.880 
you know more than one person
controlling<00:06:06.270> that<00:06:06.600> pot<00:06:06.870> at<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.140> time<00:06:07.410> so<00:06:07.800> you

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
controlling that pot at a time so you

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.350 
controlling that pot at a time so you
would<00:06:08.040> have<00:06:08.220> put<00:06:08.400> one<00:06:08.610> person<00:06:09.030> sort<00:06:09.270> of

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
would have put one person sort of

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.750 
would have put one person sort of
steering<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.020> flying<00:06:10.350> so<00:06:11.070> they're<00:06:11.280> all<00:06:11.430> set

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
steering and flying so they're all set

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.460 
steering and flying so they're all set
just<00:06:12.090> focusing<00:06:12.870> on<00:06:12.990> that<00:06:13.140> and<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.440> other

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
just focusing on that and the other

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.460 
just focusing on that and the other
person<00:06:14.010> would<00:06:14.160> be<00:06:14.960> switching<00:06:15.960> in<00:06:16.200> the

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
person would be switching in the

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.380 
person would be switching in the
terminal<00:06:16.890> switching<00:06:17.460> things<00:06:17.550> on<00:06:17.850> and<00:06:18.030> off<00:06:18.120> as

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390 
terminal switching things on and off as

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.950 
terminal switching things on and off as
the<00:06:18.780> pilot<00:06:19.760> orders<00:06:20.760> them<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:20.970> I<00:06:21.390> think<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:21.750> key

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
the pilot orders them to I think the key

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.600 
the pilot orders them to I think the key
will<00:06:22.260> be<00:06:22.470> to<00:06:22.500> have<00:06:22.890> more<00:06:23.190> than<00:06:23.370> one<00:06:23.580> person

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
will be to have more than one person

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.000 
will be to have more than one person
flying<00:06:24.510> at<00:06:24.660> a<00:06:24.870> time<00:06:25.080> because<00:06:25.290> that<00:06:25.830> was<00:06:25.980> a

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
flying at a time because that was a

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.350 
flying at a time because that was a
little<00:06:26.190> bit<00:06:26.370> too<00:06:26.610> difficult<00:06:27.090> for<00:06:27.120> me<00:06:27.270> to

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
little bit too difficult for me to

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.480 
little bit too difficult for me to
handle<00:06:27.510> that<00:06:28.200> wasn't<00:06:28.500> my<00:06:28.620> first<00:06:28.890> test<00:06:29.220> either

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.490 
handle that wasn't my first test either

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.490 
handle that wasn't my first test either
I've<00:06:29.850> done<00:06:30.060> quite<00:06:30.360> a<00:06:30.810> few<00:06:30.900> of<00:06:31.110> them<00:06:31.230> that's<00:06:31.410> all

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
I've done quite a few of them that's all

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.720 
I've done quite a few of them that's all
I've<00:06:31.650> got<00:06:31.680> time<00:06:31.980> for<00:06:32.220> today<00:06:32.490> though

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
I've got time for today though

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.519 
I've got time for today though
unfortunately<00:06:33.060> I<00:06:33.930> don't<00:06:34.230> know<00:06:34.500> if<00:06:34.620> you<00:06:34.770> saw

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
unfortunately I don't know if you saw

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.009 
unfortunately I don't know if you saw
just<00:06:35.829> at<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.099> hint<00:06:36.339> there<00:06:36.519> that<00:06:36.789> I

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:37.019 
just at the hint there that I

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.299 
just at the hint there that I
accidentally<00:06:38.019> left<00:06:38.199> autosave<00:06:38.709> on<00:06:38.919> this<00:06:39.099> world

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:39.309 
accidentally left autosave on this world

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:41.969 
accidentally left autosave on this world
so<00:06:39.609> I<00:06:39.819> can't<00:06:40.359> just<00:06:40.509> quickly<00:06:40.719> reset<00:06:41.169> I've<00:06:41.529> got

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
so I can't just quickly reset I've got

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.329 
so I can't just quickly reset I've got
to<00:06:42.009> go<00:06:42.189> now<00:06:42.369> but<00:06:42.669> as<00:06:43.329> I<00:06:43.779> said<00:06:43.839> I've<00:06:44.379> got<00:06:44.829> some

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:45.339 
to go now but as I said I've got some

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.499 
to go now but as I said I've got some
things<00:06:45.549> happening<00:06:45.969> in<00:06:45.999> my<00:06:46.119> life<00:06:46.149> at<00:06:46.449> the

things happening in my life at the

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.349 
things happening in my life at the

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:49.359 
moment so my upload frequency is going

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:50.999 
moment so my upload frequency is going
to<00:06:49.449> be<00:06:49.539> a<00:06:49.569> bit<00:06:49.749> lower<00:06:50.049> than<00:06:50.289> I'd<00:06:50.439> like<00:06:50.709> for<00:06:50.949> the
