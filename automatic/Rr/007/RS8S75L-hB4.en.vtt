my<00:01:34.799> vision<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.310> helps<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.970> they're<00:01:36.479> able<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
my vision it helps if they're able to

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.210 
my vision it helps if they're able to
see<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.409> you're<00:01:37.590> thinking<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
see like what you're thinking so the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.980 
see like what you're thinking so the
more<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> help<00:01:39.000> preserve<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
more you can do to help preserve the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.510 
more you can do to help preserve the
vision<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.829> shot<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.460> better

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
vision of your shot the better

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.640 
vision of your shot the better
so<00:01:44.520> take<00:01:44.790> these<00:01:44.970> three<00:01:45.180> elements<00:01:45.300> these<00:01:46.140> basic

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
so take these three elements these basic

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.070 
so take these three elements these basic
principles<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:47.370> camera<00:01:47.880> settings<00:01:48.270> lighting

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
principles of camera settings lighting

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.920 
principles of camera settings lighting
and<00:01:49.290> Composition<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.760> get<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:51.870> at

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and Composition and get really good at

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.750 
and Composition and get really good at
that<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.680> way<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.070> I've<00:01:53.160> showed<00:01:53.370> you<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.580> set

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
that the way that I've showed you to set

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.190 
that the way that I've showed you to set
your<00:01:53.850> camera<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.630> lighting<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.080> do

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
your camera up do the lighting and do

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.810 
your camera up do the lighting and do
the<00:01:55.290> composition<00:01:55.860> they're<00:01:56.010> just<00:01:56.280> principles

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
the composition they're just principles

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.880 
the composition they're just principles
you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.420> work<00:01:57.630> outside<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.140> these<00:01:58.350> principles

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you can work outside of these principles
