play<00:00:02.820> some<00:00:03.000> basketball<00:00:03.319> you<00:00:04.319> know<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.890> is

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
play some basketball you know this is

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.230 
play some basketball you know this is
not<00:00:05.130> another<00:00:05.430> video<00:00:05.670> dribbling<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.089> ball

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
not another video dribbling the ball

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.089 
not another video dribbling the ball
shooting<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.779> gong<00:00:06.960> with<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> Glock<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.980> don't

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
shooting the gong with a Glock I don't

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.879 
shooting the gong with a Glock I don't
think<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.280> did<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.610> once<00:00:08.760> they're<00:00:08.970> not<00:00:09.889> you

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
think I did that once they're not you

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.390 
think I did that once they're not you
know<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:11.370> objects<00:00:11.820> most<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:13.009> are<00:00:14.009> more

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
know that objects most of you are more

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.369 
know that objects most of you are more
they're<00:00:15.089> better<00:00:15.360> stabilized<00:00:15.960> if<00:00:16.230> they're

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
they're better stabilized if they're

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.740 
they're better stabilized if they're
spinning<00:00:16.770> correct<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.480> know<00:00:18.570> most

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
spinning correct and you know most

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
spinning correct and you know most
people<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.080> they<00:00:19.170> shoot<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.439> basketball<00:00:19.890> in

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
people when they shoot a basketball in

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.070 
people when they shoot a basketball in
fact<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.699> know<00:00:20.760> they<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.480> ball<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.810> spinning

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
fact you know they the ball is spinning

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
fact you know they the ball is spinning
although<00:00:22.890> some<00:00:23.160> people<00:00:23.250> shoot<00:00:23.550> kind<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
although some people shoot kind of a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
although some people shoot kind of a
brick<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.930> pretty<00:00:25.170> well<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.619> know

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
brick and do do pretty well you know

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.269 
brick and do do pretty well you know
without<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> spin<00:00:27.050> but<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.320> stabilizes<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
without a spin but it stabilizes the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 
without a spin but it stabilizes the
ball<00:00:29.460> better<00:00:29.730> or<00:00:30.029> an<00:00:30.510> object<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> know<00:00:31.140> for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
ball better or an object you know for

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.670 
ball better or an object you know for
example<00:00:31.610> it<00:00:32.610> would<00:00:32.759> be<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.329> difficult<00:00:33.680> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
example it would be really difficult to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.610 
example it would be really difficult to
to<00:00:35.250> balance<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.760> basketball<00:00:36.420> when<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.380> your

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to balance a basketball when you do your

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.639 
to balance a basketball when you do your
finger<00:00:38.010> very<00:00:38.340> long<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.480> however<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
finger very long like that however if it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.709 
finger very long like that however if it
is<00:00:40.680> spinning<00:00:41.270> whoa

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
is spinning whoa

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.430 
is spinning whoa
then<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.820> up<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.260> then<00:00:46.260> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
then if you can get it up there then it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.720 
then if you can get it up there then it
will<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.680> stabilized<00:00:48.739> so<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.219> spinning

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
will be stabilized so it's the spinning

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
will be stabilized so it's the spinning
motion<00:00:51.770> gyroscopic<00:00:52.770> effect<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.280> don't<00:00:53.309> know

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
motion gyroscopic effect I don't know

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.500 
motion gyroscopic effect I don't know
what's<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> called<00:00:54.739> okay<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.300> stabilizes<00:00:57.300> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
what's it called okay it stabilizes it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.670 
what's it called okay it stabilizes it
it<00:00:58.170> will<00:00:58.350> stay<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.770> okay<00:00:59.430> just<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it will stay there okay just like the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.579 
it will stay there okay just like the
planet<00:01:02.160> right<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.989> helps

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
planet right so that helps

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.679 
planet right so that helps
just<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> frisbee<00:01:05.670> let's<00:01:06.570> get

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just like with a frisbee let's get

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.390 
just like with a frisbee let's get
another<00:01:06.840> object<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.619> through<00:01:08.250> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
another object here through the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.490 
another object here through the
basketball<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.780> take<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> frisbee

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
basketball you know if I take a frisbee

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370 
basketball you know if I take a frisbee
and<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.310> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.600> pull<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.869> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
and I just kind of pull it like that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.700 
and I just kind of pull it like that
was<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> wonderful<00:01:14.250> throw<00:01:15.439> that<00:01:16.439> tells

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
was that a wonderful throw that tells

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
was that a wonderful throw that tells
you<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> did<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.369> college<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.880> study<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
you all I did in college of study I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.280 
you all I did in college of study I
didn't<00:01:18.450> spend<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> time<00:01:19.020> throwing

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
didn't spend a lot of time throwing

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.649 
didn't spend a lot of time throwing
frisbees<00:01:19.650> back<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> 60s<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.570> I

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
frisbees back in the 60s right but if I

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.440 
frisbees back in the 60s right but if I
spin<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:23.040> put<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> little<00:01:23.700> spin<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.060> its

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
spin the thing put a little spin on its

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.240 
spin the thing put a little spin on its
going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> least<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.590> link<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
going to least the link that's going to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
going to least the link that's going to
fly<00:01:26.840> accurately<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> be

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
fly accurately and it's going to be

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.960 
fly accurately and it's going to be
stabilized<00:01:28.860> I'll<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.430> hit<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.729> red

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
stabilized I'll see if I hit that red

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.429 
stabilized I'll see if I hit that red
hangman's<00:01:30.450> hard<00:01:30.659> here<00:01:30.869> come<00:01:31.079> closer

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
hangman's hard here come closer

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.280 
hangman's hard here come closer
Oh<00:01:34.460> hawlucha<00:01:35.460> team<00:01:35.759> okay<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.780> least<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.079> saw

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
Oh hawlucha team okay at least you saw

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.249 
Oh hawlucha team okay at least you saw
it<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.220> moved<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.970> stabilized<00:01:39.540> man<00:01:39.810> okay

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it it it moved in a stabilized man okay

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
it it it moved in a stabilized man okay
because<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.860> spinning<00:01:41.100> well<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> same

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
because it's spinning well the same

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
because it's spinning well the same
thing<00:01:42.329> same<00:01:42.689> principle<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> bullet<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
thing same principle with a bullet you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
thing same principle with a bullet you
know<00:01:44.880> when<00:01:45.030> you've<00:01:45.180> probably<00:01:45.479> heard<00:01:45.930> some<00:01:46.500> of

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
know when you've probably heard some of

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
know when you've probably heard some of
you<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.090> brown<00:01:48.299> vest

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you you know like my the brown vest

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
you you know like my the brown vest
rifle<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.680> smoothbore<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:51.479> you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
rifle was a smoothbore and when you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.359 
rifle was a smoothbore and when you
shoot<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> ball<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.070> not

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
shoot a ball out of that it's it's not

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.760 
shoot a ball out of that it's it's not
totally<00:01:53.880> inaccurate<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:55.140> it'd<00:01:55.259> be<00:01:55.439> hard<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
totally inaccurate but it'd be hard to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.120 
totally inaccurate but it'd be hard to
pick<00:01:56.009> off

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
pick off

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.590 
pick off
apples<00:01:57.369> over<00:01:57.670> there<00:01:57.790> on<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.939> far<00:01:58.119> Hill<00:01:58.360> with

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
apples over there on the far Hill with

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.060 
apples over there on the far Hill with
the<00:01:58.630> thing<00:01:58.899> you<00:01:59.229> know<00:01:59.320> even<00:01:59.680> in<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.860> vice

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
the thing you know even in a vice

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.800 
the thing you know even in a vice
because<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.060> don't<00:02:01.180> have<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.360> rifling

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
because you don't have the rifling

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.020 
because you don't have the rifling
effect<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.409> stabilize<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.520> bullet<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:03.909> give

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
effect to stabilize the bullet to give

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.080 
effect to stabilize the bullet to give
that<00:02:04.210> spin<00:02:04.630> as<00:02:04.930> it's<00:02:05.470> leaving<00:02:05.740> okay<00:02:06.579> now<00:02:06.880> some

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
that spin as it's leaving okay now some

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.580 
that spin as it's leaving okay now some

relatives<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.510> Kentucky<00:02:19.959> probably<00:02:20.230> don't

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
relatives in Kentucky probably don't

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.330 
relatives in Kentucky probably don't
know<00:02:20.410> what<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:20.680> that's<00:02:20.800> about<00:02:20.950> all<00:02:21.190> right

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
know what all that's about all right

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.170 
know what all that's about all right
well<00:02:22.769> we're<00:02:23.769> going<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.920> look<00:02:24.069> at<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.970> is

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
well we're going to look at this this is

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
well we're going to look at this this is
a<00:02:25.209> rifle<00:02:25.510> barrel<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.860> rifled<00:02:27.220> this<00:02:27.489> is

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
a rifle barrel and it is rifled this is

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.670 
a rifle barrel and it is rifled this is
out<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.880> 1911<00:02:28.239> we're<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.260> try<00:02:29.410> to<00:02:29.470> give

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
out of a 1911 we're going to try to give

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.020 
out of a 1911 we're going to try to give
you<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.830> look<00:02:30.069> down<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.519> barrel<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:30.910> not

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
you a look down that barrel it's not

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.530 
you a look down that barrel it's not
easy<00:02:31.269> I'll<00:02:31.989> try<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> hold<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.560> steady<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.540> even

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
easy I'll try to hold it steady and even

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.390 
easy I'll try to hold it steady and even
if<00:02:34.930> it's<00:02:35.049> a<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.349> blurred<00:02:35.739> or<00:02:35.769> whatever<00:02:36.280> you

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
if it's a little blurred or whatever you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.190 
if it's a little blurred or whatever you
can<00:02:36.580> see<00:02:36.849> that<00:02:37.209> there's<00:02:37.390> rifling<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.049> there

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
can see that there's rifling in there

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.800 
can see that there's rifling in there
those<00:02:38.349> grooves<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.910> is<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> fundamental

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
those grooves this is a fundamental

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.960 
those grooves this is a fundamental
thing<00:02:40.840> of<00:02:41.170> course<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.739> said<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.610> know<00:02:42.760> this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
thing of course I said you know this

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.870 
thing of course I said you know this
quite<00:02:43.269> well<00:02:43.299> but<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.220> what<00:02:45.430> gives<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
quite well but that is what gives the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.130 
quite well but that is what gives the
bullet<00:02:46.180> its<00:02:46.330> spin<00:02:47.099> you<00:02:48.099> notice<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.690> other<00:02:49.690> cut

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
bullet its spin you notice the other cut

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.460 
bullet its spin you notice the other cut
there<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:52.150> course<00:02:52.390> almost<00:02:52.660> all<00:02:53.019> barrels

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
there and of course almost all barrels

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.500 
there and of course almost all barrels
have<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.980> nowadays<00:02:54.160> other<00:02:54.700> than<00:02:54.880> shotgun

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
have that nowadays other than shotgun

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.800 
have that nowadays other than shotgun
barrels<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.440> have<00:02:56.590> rifling<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.489> that<00:02:57.810> I'm

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
barrels you have rifling like that I'm

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
barrels you have rifling like that I'm
shaking<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> little<00:02:59.380> bit<00:02:59.470> but<00:02:59.709> so<00:03:00.430> doesn't<00:03:01.060> have

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
shaking a little bit but so doesn't have

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.880 
shaking a little bit but so doesn't have
to<00:03:01.269> tell<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.540> probably<00:03:01.930> you've<00:03:02.260> got<00:03:02.440> rifling

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
to tell you probably you've got rifling

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.460 
to tell you probably you've got rifling
in<00:03:03.010> there<00:03:03.250> whatever<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.790> barrel<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.540> it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
in there whatever the barrel is and it

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.500 
in there whatever the barrel is and it
gives<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.769> barrel<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.370> bullet<00:03:06.670> rather<00:03:06.790> that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
gives the barrel the bullet rather that

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.740 
gives the barrel the bullet rather that
spin<00:03:08.470> as<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:08.920> launches<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.549> all<00:03:10.150> right<00:03:10.329> that's

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
spin as it launches it all right that's

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.539 
spin as it launches it all right that's
why<00:03:10.989> it's<00:03:11.170> stabilized<00:03:11.739> for<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> long<00:03:12.340> way

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
why it's stabilized for a long way

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.520 
why it's stabilized for a long way
you've<00:03:12.880> seen<00:03:13.180> me<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.359> hopefully<00:03:13.690> shoot<00:03:14.260> on<00:03:14.410> this

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
you've seen me a hopefully shoot on this

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.259 
you've seen me a hopefully shoot on this
hill<00:03:14.769> even<00:03:14.980> have<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.310> 230<00:03:15.819> yards<00:03:16.000> with

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
hill even have the 230 yards with

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.629 
hill even have the 230 yards with
handguns<00:03:16.720> even<00:03:17.049> short<00:03:17.319> handguns<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
handguns even short handguns and the

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.660 
handguns even short handguns and the
bullets<00:03:18.910> fly<00:03:19.120> very<00:03:19.959> true<00:03:20.380> they<00:03:21.010> really<00:03:21.280> do<00:03:21.430> you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
bullets fly very true they really do you

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.160 
bullets fly very true they really do you
know<00:03:21.790> it's<00:03:21.940> just<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.510> biggest<00:03:22.660> variables

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
know it's just the the biggest variables

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.740 
know it's just the the biggest variables
me<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.739> nut<00:03:23.950> behind<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.519> trigger<00:03:25.120> trying

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
me the nut behind the trigger trying

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.840 
me the nut behind the trigger trying
hold<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> gun<00:03:26.170> state<00:03:26.410> all<00:03:26.829> right<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.819> I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
hold the gun state all right so I

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.770 
hold the gun state all right so I
thought<00:03:28.090> another<00:03:28.299> way<00:03:28.480> would<00:03:28.600> demonstrate

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
thought another way would demonstrate

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.120 
thought another way would demonstrate
this<00:03:29.260> maybe<00:03:30.030> twist<00:03:31.030> rate<00:03:31.269> is<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.739> some<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.010> you

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
this maybe twist rate is and some of you

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.340 
this maybe twist rate is and some of you
have<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:34.540> understand<00:03:34.930> what<00:03:35.109> we've<00:03:35.200> talked

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
have you understand what we've talked

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.030 
have you understand what we've talked
about<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.769> far

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
about so far

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.069 
about so far
you<00:03:36.280> know<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.609> fine<00:03:36.819> but<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.540> still<00:03:37.840> want<00:03:38.019> to

what's twist rate let's set the oh I
hear<00:03:39.760> people<00:03:40.030> arguing<00:03:40.209> about<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.750> best<00:03:40.959> twist

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
hear people arguing about the best twist

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.229 
hear people arguing about the best twist
rate<00:03:41.470> especially<00:03:41.829> in<00:03:42.160> an<00:03:42.220> AR<00:03:42.489> barrel<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.150> know

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.550 
rate especially in an AR barrel you know
that's<00:03:43.540> seem<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.750> be<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> bigger<00:03:44.109> issue<00:03:44.290> with

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
that's seem to be a bigger issue with

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.699 
that's seem to be a bigger issue with
the<00:03:44.680> AR<00:03:44.920> 15s<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.549> that<00:03:45.670> kind<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.000> firearm<00:03:46.709> and

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.220

means<00:03:51.370> you'll<00:03:51.760> see<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.180> stamp<00:03:52.510> on<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.840> on<00:03:53.109> the

means you'll see on stamp on the on the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.470 
means you'll see on stamp on the on the
barrel<00:03:53.530> on<00:03:53.650> AR<00:03:54.099> like<00:03:54.250> one<00:03:54.700> in<00:03:54.849> seven<00:03:55.269> one<00:03:55.450> and

about<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:11.000> rifling<00:04:11.269> is<00:04:11.719> the<00:04:12.709> twist<00:04:13.010> of

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
about that the rifling is the twist of

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.459 
about that the rifling is the twist of
the<00:04:13.280> rifling<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.790> either<00:04:14.120> more<00:04:14.629> or<00:04:14.659> less

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:15.469 
the rifling is either more or less

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:18.009 
the rifling is either more or less
aggressive<00:04:16.220> what<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.579> comes<00:04:16.729> down<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.810> I

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
aggressive what it comes down to and I

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.539 
aggressive what it comes down to and I
found<00:04:18.289> these<00:04:18.410> two<00:04:18.560> bowls<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.009> that's<00:04:19.220> one<00:04:19.430> way

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
found these two bowls so that's one way

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.699 
found these two bowls so that's one way
to<00:04:19.609> demonstrate<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.389> kind<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.289> outside

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.770 
to demonstrate it kind of the outside

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
version of it but for example the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.200 
version of it but for example the
threading<00:04:24.229> on<00:04:24.320> this<00:04:24.530> one<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:25.610> know<00:04:25.669> that's<00:04:26.060> a

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
threading on this one you know that's a

that nut is going to have to turn now I

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.480 
that nut is going to have to turn now I
don't<00:04:29.270> know<00:04:29.419> 20<00:04:29.660> 30<00:04:29.900> times<00:04:29.990> to<00:04:30.500> get<00:04:30.650> from<00:04:31.310> there

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
know twist rate okay whereas this one if

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.860 
know twist rate okay whereas this one if
we<00:04:40.340> had<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.610> nut<00:04:40.940> that<00:04:41.060> would<00:04:41.210> fit<00:04:41.360> on<00:04:41.389> that<00:04:41.660> make

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
we had a nut that would fit on that make

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.909 
we had a nut that would fit on that make
sure<00:04:41.900> what<00:04:42.139> that's<00:04:42.289> for<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.560> bought<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:42.860> in

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
sure what that's for I bought it in

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.719 
sure what that's for I bought it in
hardware<00:04:43.160> store<00:04:43.490> for<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:43.880> guys<00:04:44.199> but<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.729> see

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
hardware store for you guys but you see

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.240 
hardware store for you guys but you see
the<00:04:46.880> twist<00:04:47.150> rate<00:04:47.449> of<00:04:47.660> that<00:04:47.840> threading<00:04:48.410> if<00:04:48.830> I

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
the twist rate of that threading if I

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.370 
the twist rate of that threading if I
had<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.490> nut<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.000> would<00:04:50.090> fit<00:04:50.300> on<00:04:50.330> that<00:04:50.479> that's

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
had a nut that would fit on that that's

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.170 
had a nut that would fit on that that's
actually<00:04:51.620> some<00:04:51.860> kind<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.130> screw<00:04:52.520> kind<00:04:53.120> of

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
actually some kind of screw kind of

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.300 
actually some kind of screw kind of
thing<00:04:53.300> but<00:04:53.419> it<00:04:53.990> would<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:54.830> would<00:04:54.979> really<00:04:55.190> just

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
thing but it would it would really just

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.659 
thing but it would it would really just
turn<00:04:55.759> maybe<00:04:56.389> once<00:04:56.750> or<00:04:57.110> twice<00:04:57.169> from<00:04:58.070> here<00:04:58.460> to

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
turn maybe once or twice from here to

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.980 
turn maybe once or twice from here to
here<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:58.970> they're<00:04:59.120> about<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.449> same<00:04:59.660> length

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
here and they're about the same length

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.650 
here and they're about the same length
say<00:05:00.770> so<00:05:01.370> if<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:01.639> had<00:05:01.789> a<00:05:01.820> nut<00:05:02.090> and<00:05:02.300> vision<00:05:02.570> that

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
say so if I had a nut and vision that

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.320 
say so if I had a nut and vision that
nut<00:05:02.960> actually<00:05:03.889> on<00:05:03.979> here<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.759> would<00:05:04.970> turn<00:05:05.150> me

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
nut actually on here it would turn me

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.990 
nut actually on here it would turn me
once<00:05:05.570> or<00:05:05.720> twice<00:05:05.930> from<00:05:06.470> here<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.800> here<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:07.849> that

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
once or twice from here to here so that

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.480 
once or twice from here to here so that
would<00:05:08.090> be<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.210> very<00:05:08.449> slow<00:05:08.660> twist<00:05:09.440> rate<00:05:09.680> not<00:05:10.250> very

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
would be a very slow twist rate not very

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.189 
would be a very slow twist rate not very
fast<00:05:10.759> whereas<00:05:11.300> if<00:05:11.389> this<00:05:11.539> thing<00:05:11.720> was<00:05:11.840> threaded

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
fast whereas if this thing was threaded

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.050 
fast whereas if this thing was threaded
all<00:05:12.289> the<00:05:12.320> way<00:05:12.470> back<00:05:12.710> you<00:05:13.400> know<00:05:13.460> at<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:13.820> rate

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
all the way back you know at that rate

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.860 
all the way back you know at that rate
that's<00:05:14.479> a<00:05:14.630> very<00:05:14.810> fast<00:05:15.760> twist<00:05:16.760> rate<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.510> nut

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
that's a very fast twist rate this nut

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.159 
that's a very fast twist rate this nut
would<00:05:18.229> turn<00:05:18.880> you<00:05:19.880> guess<00:05:20.120> I<00:05:20.360> don't<00:05:20.539> know<00:05:20.630> six

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
would turn you guess I don't know six

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.529 
would turn you guess I don't know six
eight<00:05:21.289> nine<00:05:21.349> times<00:05:21.830> see<00:05:22.639> would<00:05:22.880> actually<00:05:23.180> so

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
eight nine times see would actually so

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.570 
eight nine times see would actually so
envision<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.960> bullet<00:05:24.320> same<00:05:24.590> thing<00:05:24.860> you<00:05:25.400> got<00:05:25.550> a

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
envision a bullet same thing you got a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.689 
envision a bullet same thing you got a
rifle<00:05:26.150> barrel<00:05:26.750> that<00:05:27.199> has<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.560> very<00:05:27.979> fast<00:05:28.340> rate

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
rifle barrel that has a very fast rate

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.399 
rifle barrel that has a very fast rate
of<00:05:28.729> twist<00:05:29.210> it's<00:05:29.479> going<00:05:29.659> to<00:05:29.720> spin<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.139> bullet

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
of twist it's going to spin the bullet

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.810 
of twist it's going to spin the bullet
faster<00:05:30.729> you<00:05:31.729> know<00:05:31.789> and<00:05:32.620> Enzo<00:05:33.620> okay<00:05:33.889> well<00:05:34.220> why

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
faster you know and Enzo okay well why

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.640 
faster you know and Enzo okay well why
is<00:05:34.880> there<00:05:35.150> even<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.419> difference<00:05:35.810> looks<00:05:36.380> to<00:05:36.530> me

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
is there even a difference looks to me

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.159 
is there even a difference looks to me
like<00:05:36.680> as<00:05:37.070> long<00:05:37.220> as<00:05:37.280> you<00:05:37.460> have<00:05:37.639> rifling<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.419> it

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
like as long as you have rifling and it

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.710 
like as long as you have rifling and it
is<00:05:39.349> does<00:05:39.770> have<00:05:39.919> a<00:05:39.979> twist<00:05:40.280> rate<00:05:40.570> gets<00:05:41.570> the

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
is does have a twist rate gets the

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.719 
is does have a twist rate gets the
bullet<00:05:41.870> turning<00:05:42.470> spinning<00:05:42.770> as<00:05:43.159> it<00:05:43.370> leaves<00:05:43.520> the

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
bullet turning spinning as it leaves the

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.839 
bullet turning spinning as it leaves the
muzzle<00:05:44.110> what<00:05:45.110> else<00:05:45.260> do<00:05:45.349> you<00:05:45.409> need<00:05:45.669> well<00:05:46.669> I'm

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
muzzle what else do you need well I'm

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.570 
muzzle what else do you need well I'm
not<00:05:46.970> an<00:05:47.120> expert<00:05:47.419> on<00:05:47.479> that<00:05:47.720> but<00:05:48.460> people<00:05:49.460> who

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
not an expert on that but people who

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.770 
not an expert on that but people who
probably<00:05:49.820> should<00:05:50.150> be<00:05:50.270> interesting<00:05:50.750> to

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
probably should be interesting to

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.810 
probably should be interesting to
discuss<00:05:51.710> this<00:05:51.860> at<00:05:52.039> link<00:05:52.220> but<00:05:52.400> that's<00:05:52.580> not<00:05:52.699> what

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
discuss this at link but that's not what

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.110 
discuss this at link but that's not what
this<00:05:52.909> is<00:05:52.970> about<00:05:53.860> generally<00:05:54.860> speaking

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
this is about generally speaking

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.719 
this is about generally speaking
generally<00:05:56.120> speaking<00:05:56.570> a<00:05:57.190> faster<00:05:58.190> twist<00:05:58.490> rate

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
generally speaking a faster twist rate

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.719 
generally speaking a faster twist rate
is<00:05:58.909> what<00:05:59.270> you<00:05:59.389> want<00:05:59.599> for<00:05:59.780> a<00:05:59.840> heavier<00:06:00.199> bullet

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
is what you want for a heavier bullet

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.730 
is what you want for a heavier bullet
okay<00:06:01.729> it<00:06:01.909> takes<00:06:02.090> a<00:06:02.300> faster<00:06:02.780> twist<00:06:03.080> rate<00:06:03.320> to

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
okay it takes a faster twist rate to

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.430 
okay it takes a faster twist rate to
stabilize<00:06:04.340> a<00:06:04.669> heavier<00:06:05.330> bullet<00:06:05.780> that's<00:06:06.110> kind

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
stabilize a heavier bullet that's kind

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.110 
stabilize a heavier bullet that's kind
of<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.590> generalization<00:06:07.340> there<00:06:07.520> so<00:06:07.880> a<00:06:07.909> lot<00:06:08.090> of

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
of the generalization there so a lot of

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.330 
of the generalization there so a lot of
barrels<00:06:08.509> like<00:06:08.659> like<00:06:09.229> AR<00:06:09.590> is<00:06:09.740> what<00:06:09.889> I<00:06:09.919> look<00:06:10.130> for

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
barrels like like AR is what I look for

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.439 
barrels like like AR is what I look for
something<00:06:10.759> kind<00:06:10.970> of<00:06:11.030> in<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.150> middle<00:06:11.330> of<00:06:11.360> the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
something kind of in the middle of the

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:14.050 
something kind of in the middle of the
road<00:06:11.630> that<00:06:12.229> will<00:06:12.530> stabilize<00:06:12.889> a<00:06:13.159> heavy<00:06:13.639> bullet

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
road that will stabilize a heavy bullet

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.730 
road that will stabilize a heavy bullet
pretty<00:06:14.270> well<00:06:14.479> and<00:06:14.900> even<00:06:15.020> a<00:06:15.169> light<00:06:15.349> bullet<00:06:15.650> and

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
pretty well and even a light bullet and

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.230 
pretty well and even a light bullet and
do<00:06:15.800> fine<00:06:16.039> with<00:06:16.220> that<00:06:16.430> you<00:06:16.820> know<00:06:16.909> so<00:06:17.090> that's

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
do fine with that you know so that's

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.629 
do fine with that you know so that's
kind<00:06:17.479> of<00:06:17.509> what<00:06:17.659> I<00:06:17.690> look<00:06:17.960> for<00:06:18.200> but<00:06:18.770> that's<00:06:19.460> what

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
kind of what I look for but that's what

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.760 
kind of what I look for but that's what
that<00:06:19.789> has<00:06:19.909> to<00:06:20.029> do<00:06:20.150> with<00:06:20.270> mostly<00:06:20.750> you<00:06:21.560> need<00:06:21.740> a

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
that has to do with mostly you need a

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.480 
that has to do with mostly you need a
faster<00:06:22.460> twist<00:06:22.729> rate<00:06:22.940> for

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
faster twist rate for

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.189 
faster twist rate for
for<00:06:23.580> example<00:06:23.910> if<00:06:24.120> your<00:06:24.240> target<00:06:24.660> shooting<00:06:24.930> you

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
for example if your target shooting you

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.129 
for example if your target shooting you
want<00:06:25.410> dream<00:06:26.069> accuracy<00:06:26.639> out<00:06:26.669> of<00:06:26.880> a<00:06:26.970> arm<00:06:27.270> you're

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
want dream accuracy out of a arm you're

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.870 
want dream accuracy out of a arm you're
going<00:06:28.229> to<00:06:28.289> shoot<00:06:28.440> those<00:06:28.620> 62-grain<00:06:29.190> or<00:06:29.610> even

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
going to shoot those 62-grain or even

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.900 
going to shoot those 62-grain or even
heavier<00:06:30.240> bullets<00:06:30.949> at<00:06:31.949> long<00:06:32.220> range

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 
heavier bullets at long range

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.580 
heavier bullets at long range
maybe<00:06:33.240> you're<00:06:33.389> competing<00:06:33.810> at<00:06:33.900> Camp<00:06:34.139> Perry<00:06:34.380> or

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
maybe you're competing at Camp Perry or

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.620 
maybe you're competing at Camp Perry or
something<00:06:34.949> then<00:06:35.669> you're<00:06:35.910> probably<00:06:36.150> going<00:06:36.449> to

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
something then you're probably going to

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.689 
something then you're probably going to
find<00:06:36.870> in<00:06:37.440> a<00:06:37.530> gun<00:06:37.770> that's<00:06:37.979> designed<00:06:38.280> for<00:06:38.400> that

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
find in a gun that's designed for that

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.749 
find in a gun that's designed for that
competition<00:06:39.120> of<00:06:39.690> a<00:06:39.900> faster<00:06:40.440> twist<00:06:40.740> rate<00:06:40.979> okay

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 
competition of a faster twist rate okay

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.820 
competition of a faster twist rate okay
so<00:06:42.270> in<00:06:42.840> other<00:06:42.990> words<00:06:43.169> that<00:06:43.259> bullets<00:06:43.620> going<00:06:43.740> to

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
so in other words that bullets going to

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.790 
so in other words that bullets going to
spend<00:06:44.190> more<00:06:44.400> times<00:06:45.080> before<00:06:46.080> it<00:06:46.410> leaves<00:06:46.590> the

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
spend more times before it leaves the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.830 
spend more times before it leaves the
barrel<00:06:47.009> so<00:06:47.460> to<00:06:47.520> be<00:06:47.729> better<00:06:48.150> stabilized

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
barrel so to be better stabilized

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.020 
barrel so to be better stabilized
alright<00:06:49.530> and<00:06:49.800> in<00:06:50.220> their<00:06:50.370> situations<00:06:50.940> you

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
alright and in their situations you

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.550 
alright and in their situations you
don't<00:06:51.240> want<00:06:51.419> the<00:06:51.539> bullet<00:06:51.690> all<00:06:51.930> that<00:06:52.319> well

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
don't want the bullet all that well

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.409 
don't want the bullet all that well
stabilized<00:06:53.099> for<00:06:53.430> example<00:06:53.759> they<00:06:53.819> are<00:06:53.970> the<00:06:54.300> two

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.419 
stabilized for example they are the two

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:56.659 
stabilized for example they are the two

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
it we won't get into all that but that's

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.360 
it we won't get into all that but that's
what<00:07:06.330> twist<00:07:06.599> rate<00:07:06.810> is<00:07:07.050> this<00:07:07.979> is<00:07:08.099> just<00:07:08.280> the

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
what twist rate is this is just the

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.089 
what twist rate is this is just the
basics<00:07:08.909> for<00:07:09.539> folks<00:07:09.750> who<00:07:09.900> who<00:07:10.349> just<00:07:10.650> have

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
basics for folks who who just have

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.159 
basics for folks who who just have
wondered<00:07:11.370> about<00:07:11.490> that<00:07:11.610> it's<00:07:12.330> how<00:07:12.599> many<00:07:12.659> times

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
wondered about that it's how many times

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.430 
wondered about that it's how many times
that<00:07:13.470> bullet<00:07:13.800> spins<00:07:14.130> per<00:07:14.940> inch<00:07:15.210> of<00:07:15.599> travel<00:07:16.289> in

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 
that bullet spins per inch of travel in

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.710 
that bullet spins per inch of travel in
the<00:07:16.620> barrel<00:07:16.949> okay<00:07:17.340> fast<00:07:18.030> twist<00:07:18.330> rate<00:07:18.569> it's

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 
the barrel okay fast twist rate it's

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.390 
the barrel okay fast twist rate it's
going<00:07:18.840> to<00:07:18.930> spend<00:07:19.139> more<00:07:19.229> time<00:07:19.500> slow<00:07:19.889> twist<00:07:20.190> rate

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
going to spend more time slow twist rate

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.129 
going to spend more time slow twist rate
it's<00:07:20.819> going<00:07:21.000> to<00:07:21.090> spend<00:07:21.300> fewer<00:07:21.569> times<00:07:21.840> and

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 
it's going to spend fewer times and

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.800 
it's going to spend fewer times and
maybe<00:07:23.009> not<00:07:23.310> be<00:07:23.370> quite<00:07:23.729> as<00:07:23.819> stable<00:07:24.030> if<00:07:24.569> it's<00:07:24.720> a

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
maybe not be quite as stable if it's a

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.839 
maybe not be quite as stable if it's a
heavy<00:07:24.990> bullet<00:07:25.380> so<00:07:26.069> that's<00:07:26.310> what<00:07:26.460> that's<00:07:26.639> all

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849 
heavy bullet so that's what that's all

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:28.939 
heavy bullet so that's what that's all
about<00:07:26.880> the<00:07:27.389> twist<00:07:27.630> rate<00:07:27.900> in<00:07:28.380> a<00:07:28.500> rifle<00:07:28.650> barrel

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:28.949 
about the twist rate in a rifle barrel

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:32.029 
about the twist rate in a rifle barrel
or<00:07:29.190> even<00:07:29.400> a<00:07:29.460> pistol<00:07:29.820> barrel<00:07:29.969> so<00:07:31.039> hopefully

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 
or even a pistol barrel so hopefully

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:33.980 
or even a pistol barrel so hopefully
that<00:07:32.699> was<00:07:32.820> helpful<00:07:32.880> to<00:07:33.210> you<00:07:33.330> if<00:07:33.599> you<00:07:33.750> didn't

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
that was helpful to you if you didn't

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.659 
that was helpful to you if you didn't
know<00:07:34.080> really<00:07:34.380> what<00:07:34.590> that<00:07:34.650> was<00:07:34.889> all<00:07:35.039> about<00:07:35.070> and

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 
know really what that was all about and

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.820 
know really what that was all about and
I<00:07:36.060> didn't<00:07:36.419> confuse<00:07:36.750> you<00:07:36.840> even<00:07:37.169> further<00:07:37.380> and

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
I didn't confuse you even further and

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.840 
I didn't confuse you even further and
all<00:07:38.669> I<00:07:38.729> can<00:07:38.969> say<00:07:39.120> is<00:07:39.240> life<00:07:39.449> is<00:07:39.630> good
