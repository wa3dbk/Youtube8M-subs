kilobits<00:01:56.040> somebody<00:01:56.939> say<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.270> bit<00:01:57.420> high

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
kilobits somebody say that's a bit high

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.740 
kilobits somebody say that's a bit high
but<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.049> pretty<00:01:58.710> good<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.479> works

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
but it's pretty good for this it works

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.719 
but it's pretty good for this it works
well<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.680> file<00:02:01.860> size<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.159> think<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.520> bad

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
well and the file size I think that bad

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.639 
well and the file size I think that bad
at<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.060> bitrate<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:04.380> we're<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
at that bitrate now we're going to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.649 
at that bitrate now we're going to
choose<00:02:04.799> our<00:02:04.950> resolution<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:05.969> your<00:02:06.180> resolution

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
choose our resolution if your resolution

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.119 
choose our resolution if your resolution
you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.079> go<00:02:07.259> higher<00:02:07.530> than<00:02:07.770> what<00:02:07.920> I'm<00:02:08.009> gonna

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
you can go higher than what I'm gonna

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can go higher than what I'm gonna
recommend<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.840> storage<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
recommend if you have the storage and

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.530 
recommend if you have the storage and
can<00:02:10.649> afford<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> but<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.030> our<00:02:12.120> case<00:02:12.330> we're

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
can afford it but in our case we're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.100 
can afford it but in our case we're
going<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.690> choose<00:02:12.980> 320<00:02:13.980> by

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
going to choose 320 by

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.440 
going to choose 320 by
forty-four<00:02:16.110> our<00:02:16.379> resolution<00:02:17.129> 320<00:02:17.670> by<00:02:17.760> 240<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
forty-four our resolution 320 by 240 and

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.750 
forty-four our resolution 320 by 240 and
then<00:02:18.560> we<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.800> choose<00:02:19.980> how<00:02:20.129> many<00:02:20.190> passes

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
then we have to choose how many passes

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.089 
then we have to choose how many passes
we<00:02:20.910> want<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.629> a<00:02:21.660> multi<00:02:22.140> passes<00:02:22.709> which<00:02:22.950> is

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
we want what a multi passes which is

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.970 
we want what a multi passes which is
more<00:02:23.280> than<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.610> pass<00:02:23.879> is<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:25.260> first<00:02:25.590> time<00:02:25.830> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
more than one pass is the first time it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.470 
more than one pass is the first time it
goes<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.489> program<00:02:26.940> will<00:02:27.090> go<00:02:27.180> through<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
goes the program will go through the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.990 
goes the program will go through the
video<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.780> analyze<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.160> second<00:02:29.550> time<00:02:29.580> it

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
video and analyze it the second time it

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.940 
video and analyze it the second time it
will<00:02:30.120> actually<00:02:30.239> use<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:30.989> saw<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.470> create

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
will actually use what it saw and create

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.890 
will actually use what it saw and create
an<00:02:32.040> output<00:02:32.430> file<00:02:32.700> that's<00:02:33.299> pretty<00:02:33.660> much<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
an output file that's pretty much the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.770 
an output file that's pretty much the
easiest<00:02:34.049> way<00:02:34.379> to<00:02:34.410> explain<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.580> course<00:02:36.299> if

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
easiest way to explain that of course if

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660 
easiest way to explain that of course if
you<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.080> better<00:02:37.650> way<00:02:37.860> feel<00:02:38.250> free<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.519> leave

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you have a better way feel free to leave

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
you have a better way feel free to leave
it<00:02:38.819> in<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:38.970> comments<00:02:39.450> or<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.959> show<00:02:40.080> notes

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
it in the comments or on the show notes

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.580 
it in the comments or on the show notes
and<00:02:41.160> now<00:02:41.879> we<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.239> choose<00:02:42.450> our<00:02:42.750> frame<00:02:43.379> rate

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
and now we have to choose our frame rate

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.780 
and now we have to choose our frame rate
let's<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.489> leave<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.030> 29<00:02:45.450> woah<00:02:46.790> 29.9

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
let's just leave it to 29 woah 29.9

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.460 
let's just leave it to 29 woah 29.9
center<00:02:48.030> frames<00:02:48.269> per<00:02:48.480> second<00:02:48.840> which<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.319> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
center frames per second which is the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.300 
center frames per second which is the
standard<00:02:50.209> frame<00:02:51.209> rate<00:02:51.390> for<00:02:51.750> television<00:02:52.680> so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
standard frame rate for television so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430 
standard frame rate for television so
that's<00:02:53.640> basically<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.360> want<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.200> that's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that's basically what we want so that's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.350 
that's basically what we want so that's
what<00:02:55.530> we're<00:02:55.620> going<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.769> choose<00:02:56.120> now<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.239> have

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
what we're going to choose now we have

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.600 
what we're going to choose now we have
to<00:02:57.480> choose<00:02:57.630> our<00:02:57.840> audio<00:02:58.349> settings<00:02:58.860> what<00:02:59.519> we're

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
to choose our audio settings what we're

go too high up in sound quality or it's

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.089 
go too high up in sound quality or it's

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
gonna take up a big file size even

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.670 
gonna take up a big file size even
around<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.519> 190<00:03:18.000> areas<00:03:18.239> may<00:03:18.480> fit<00:03:18.720> too<00:03:18.900> much<00:03:19.079> so

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
around the 190 areas may fit too much so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.270 
around the 190 areas may fit too much so
maybe<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.670> know<00:03:20.790> 128<00:03:21.630> or<00:03:21.780> 160<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.950> should<00:03:23.190> be

maybe you know 128 or 160 that should be

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.920 
maybe you know 128 or 160 that should be
good<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:24.209> really<00:03:24.600> want<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.840> high

sample rate how it is and choose our
channels<00:03:42.660> we<00:03:43.139> couldn't<00:03:43.650> save<00:03:43.859> space<00:03:44.220> by<00:03:44.489> doing

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
channels we couldn't save space by doing

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.420 
channels we couldn't save space by doing
one<00:03:45.810> channel<00:03:46.169> of<00:03:46.349> audio<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.220> case

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
one channel of audio so in that case

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.000 
one channel of audio so in that case
let's<00:03:47.700> choose<00:03:47.910> mono<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.709> also<00:03:49.709> if<00:03:49.889> you're

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
let's choose mono and also if you're

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.949 
let's choose mono and also if you're
like<00:03:50.190> me<00:03:50.400> I<00:03:50.430> think<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.910> video<00:03:51.180> playback<00:03:51.569> on

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
like me I think the video playback on

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.710 
like me I think the video playback on
the<00:03:52.019> PSP<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.919> loud<00:03:53.280> enough<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:54.389> we<00:03:54.540> can

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the PSP is not loud enough so we can

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.650 
the PSP is not loud enough so we can
raise<00:03:54.930> this<00:03:55.169> volume<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.680> few<00:03:55.859> bars<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.569> have

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
raise this volume a few bars so we have

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.270 
raise this volume a few bars so we have
the<00:03:57.780> option<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.139> going<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.680> bit<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.099> louder

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the option of going a bit and louder

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.030 
the option of going a bit and louder
than<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.269> normally<00:04:00.419> would<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.739> now<00:04:01.859> we're

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
than it normally would so now we're

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.979 
than it normally would so now we're
going<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.220> do<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.459> click<00:04:02.609> apply<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.419> now<00:04:03.450> we

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
going to do is click apply and now we

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.559 
going to do is click apply and now we
have<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.470> save<00:04:04.859> as<00:04:05.069> a<00:04:05.099> profile<00:04:05.669> so<00:04:06.209> let's<00:04:06.389> go
