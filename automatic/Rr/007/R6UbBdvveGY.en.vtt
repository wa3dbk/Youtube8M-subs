of my paintings I've scraped down and I

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.829 
of my paintings I've scraped down and I
look<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.379> large<00:00:58.679> masses<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> value<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.600> when

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
look for large masses of value now when

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.290 
look for large masses of value now when
I<00:01:00.929> squint<00:01:01.230> down<00:01:01.410> her<00:01:01.649> hair<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.910> plant

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
of the eye and yet it'll look like an

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.880 
of the eye and yet it'll look like an
eye<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.840> we<00:01:28.929> didn't<00:01:29.170> see<00:01:29.319> any<00:01:29.469> of<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.679> before

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
eye so we didn't see any of this before
