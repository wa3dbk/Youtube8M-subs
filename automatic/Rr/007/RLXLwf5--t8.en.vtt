00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.400 
yarns and it tells me it didn't see me
as<00:04:11.880> long<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.300> do<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:12.600> time<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:12.990> might<00:04:13.290> have

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
as long to do it this time I might have

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.540 
as long to do it this time I might have
made<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> slightly<00:04:14.160> bigger<00:04:14.930> um<00:04:16.190> but<00:04:17.190> not<00:04:17.400> by

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
made a slightly bigger um but not by

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.360 
made a slightly bigger um but not by
much<00:04:17.760> or<00:04:18.660> maybe<00:04:19.530> because<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:20.040> just<00:04:20.220> got<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
much or maybe because I just got a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.770 
much or maybe because I just got a
little<00:04:20.460> faster<00:04:20.940> since<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.270> wasn't<00:04:21.420> my<00:04:21.600> first

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
