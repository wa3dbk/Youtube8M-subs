that<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.710> made<00:05:29.920> this<00:05:30.010> little<00:05:30.220> pad<00:05:30.520> because<00:05:31.180> it

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
that I made this little pad because it

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.870 
that I made this little pad because it
takes<00:05:31.660> like<00:05:31.990> excess<00:05:32.710> product<00:05:33.160> that<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.580> don't

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
takes like excess product that you don't

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.710 
takes like excess product that you don't
need<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.390> can<00:05:34.570> blend<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:35.080> I<00:05:36.480> think<00:05:37.480> this

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
need so you can blend it I think this

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:46.170 
need so you can blend it I think this
says<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:39.510> little<00:05:40.510> bit<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:41.080> same<00:05:41.500> amount<00:05:44.280> yes<00:05:45.280> so

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180
