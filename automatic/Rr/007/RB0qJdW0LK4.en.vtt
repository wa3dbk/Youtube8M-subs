Korea to get contact lenses no but I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.229

like protein on it

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.650 
like protein on it
like<00:01:58.260> washing<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.130> our<00:01:59.970> in<00:02:00.210> singing<00:02:00.510> and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
like washing it with our in singing and

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.090 
like washing it with our in singing and
cleaning<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.050> with<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:01.350> multi-purpose

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
cleaning it with the multi-purpose

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.580 
cleaning it with the multi-purpose
solution<00:02:02.220> whatever<00:02:03.110> after<00:02:04.110> Jun<00:02:04.290> once<00:02:04.440> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
solution whatever after Jun once it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.210 
solution whatever after Jun once it's
done<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.390> these<00:02:06.390> contacts<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.860> rigid

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
done so these contacts are more rigid

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.830 
done so these contacts are more rigid
they're<00:02:08.820> not<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.440> soft<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:11.300> normal<00:02:12.300> context

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
they're not like soft as normal context

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.990 
they're not like soft as normal context
that<00:02:12.960> I<00:02:13.200> guess<00:02:13.380> no<00:02:13.650> people<00:02:14.070> not<00:02:14.490> normal<00:02:14.730> people

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that I guess no people not normal people

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.810 
that I guess no people not normal people
but<00:02:15.390> most<00:02:15.630> people<00:02:15.960> are<00:02:16.140> accustomed<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
but most people are accustomed to so it

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.490 
but most people are accustomed to so it
took<00:02:18.000> them<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.240> two<00:02:18.510> or<00:02:18.630> three<00:02:18.660> days<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.380> get

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
took them like two or three days to get

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.230 
took them like two or three days to get
used<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.100> fact<00:02:20.340> that<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.670> was<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> little

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
used to the fact that it was a little

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.110 
used to the fact that it was a little
bit<00:02:21.480> more<00:02:21.860> not<00:02:22.860> as<00:02:23.070> soft<00:02:23.370> but<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.820> not<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
bit more not as soft but it's not like a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.530 
bit more not as soft but it's not like a
hard<00:02:24.570> plastic<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:25.320> just<00:02:25.530> more<00:02:26.390> sturdy<00:02:27.390> I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
hard plastic it's just more sturdy I

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.630 
hard plastic it's just more sturdy I
guess<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.960> want<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.230> say<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:29.040> think<00:02:29.070> that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
guess you want to say and I think that

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.810 
guess you want to say and I think that
might<00:02:29.940> contribute<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.750> fact<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.260> why<00:02:31.820> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
might contribute to the fact of why the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.530 
might contribute to the fact of why the
contacts<00:02:33.360> lasts<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.170> lot<00:02:34.470> longer<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.300> this

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
contacts lasts a lot longer so the this

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.000 
contacts lasts a lot longer so the this
color<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.140> called

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
color is called

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.930 
color is called
