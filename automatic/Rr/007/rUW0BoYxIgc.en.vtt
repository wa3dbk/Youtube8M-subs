00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.910 
like nothing's happened I've read in
like<00:02:06.180> hinted<00:02:06.540> against<00:02:06.870> a<00:02:06.960> tree<00:02:07.200> by<00:02:07.380> accident

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
like hinted against a tree by accident

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.160 
like hinted against a tree by accident
and<00:02:08.039> stuff<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.149> still<00:02:09.539> pretty<00:02:09.810> solidly

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and stuff it's like still pretty solidly

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.070 
and stuff it's like still pretty solidly
built<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.040> said<00:02:14.660> it's<00:02:15.660> completely

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
built so like I said it's completely

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.820 
built so like I said it's completely
full<00:02:16.830> metal<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:18.390> entire<00:02:18.690> body<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.260> all<00:02:19.530> metal

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
full metal the entire body is all metal

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.180 
full metal the entire body is all metal
and<00:02:20.810> your<00:02:21.810> your<00:02:21.959> selector<00:02:22.380> switch<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.860> pretty

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and your your selector switch is pretty

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.430 
and your your selector switch is pretty
loose<00:02:23.459> when<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:25.170> stiff

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
loose when you it's a really stiff

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.470 
loose when you it's a really stiff
action<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.920> first<00:02:26.130> get<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:27.209> screw

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
action you first get it and the screw

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.020 
action you first get it and the screw
edge<00:02:27.630> here<00:02:27.959> we'll<00:02:28.920> listen<00:02:29.130> up<00:02:29.430> after<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> while

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
edge here we'll listen up after a while

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.710 
edge here we'll listen up after a while
and<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.060> tightened<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:33.630> you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
and so I just tightened and when you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.660 
and so I just tightened and when you
listen<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.709> literally<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.280> even

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
listen it up it literally can just even

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
listen it up it literally can just even
put<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:35.970> here<00:02:36.180> it'll<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:37.140> fall<00:02:37.260> down

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
put it up here it'll just fall down

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.110 
put it up here it'll just fall down
there<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.920> actually<00:02:38.040> this<00:02:38.459> part<00:02:38.730> will<00:02:38.880> come

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
there and actually this part will come

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960 
there and actually this part will come
off<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.930> hanging<00:02:40.140> down<00:02:40.470> here<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.610> I

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
off and just be hanging down here so I

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.550 
off and just be hanging down here so I
just<00:02:42.150> tightened<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.750> make<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.380> that's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
just tightened it to make it so that's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.550 
just tightened it to make it so that's
just<00:02:43.890> fine<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.959> lotta<00:02:49.320> there

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
just fine you have this is a lotta there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.100 
just fine you have this is a lotta there
shouldn't<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.800> any<00:02:49.950> battery<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:51.110> then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
shouldn't be any battery in it and then

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.100 
shouldn't be any battery in it and then
semi-auto

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110

battery goes in this talk has a small
connector<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.360> want<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.660> like<00:03:30.780> many<00:03:30.989> types

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
connector so you want to like many types

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.500 
connector so you want to like many types
in<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.860> can<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.610> large<00:03:33.060> step<00:03:33.299> won't

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
in it but you can in a large step won't

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.650 
in it but you can in a large step won't
fit<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.769> FPS<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.850> high<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.239> thing

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
fit and the FPS is so high on this thing

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.050 
fit and the FPS is so high on this thing
it<00:03:36.930> takes<00:03:37.049> like<00:03:37.380> it'll<00:03:38.070> get<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.280> 500<00:03:38.549> rounds

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
it takes like it'll get like 500 rounds

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.630 
it takes like it'll get like 500 rounds
per<00:03:39.330> minute<00:03:39.450> 15<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.049> just<00:03:40.230> using<00:03:40.500> 8.4<00:03:41.100> so

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
per minute 15 you just using 8.4 so

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.280 
per minute 15 you just using 8.4 so
you're<00:03:41.760> going<00:03:41.940> into<00:03:42.120> 9.6<00:03:42.780> will<00:03:42.959> give<00:03:43.200> you

net<00:03:46.410> with<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> 9.6<00:03:47.250> minute<00:03:47.610> I'd<00:03:47.760> battery<00:03:48.120> in

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
net with a 9.6 minute I'd battery in

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.449 
net with a 9.6 minute I'd battery in
here<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.680> said<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.920> small<00:03:50.160> connector

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
here and like I said a small connector

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.800 
here and like I said a small connector
so<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.760> don't<00:03:50.910> need<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.239> an<00:03:51.480> adjustment

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
so you don't need like an adjustment

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.990 
so you don't need like an adjustment
thing<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.620> large<00:03:52.829> toy<00:03:53.010> battery<00:03:53.400> will<00:03:53.790> not

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
thing in a large toy battery will not

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.620 
thing in a large toy battery will not
fit<00:03:54.239> in<00:03:54.299> here<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.570> hardly<00:03:54.810> fits<00:03:55.049> men<00:03:55.320> using<00:03:55.680> so

but I'm just a nine point six mini
that's<00:03:59.430> perfect

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
that's perfect
