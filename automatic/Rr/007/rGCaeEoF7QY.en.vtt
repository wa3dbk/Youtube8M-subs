something else yeah yeah that's what I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
something else yeah yeah that's what I
was<00:00:59.219> planning<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.699> doing<00:00:59.969> yeah<00:01:00.329> all<00:01:00.629> I'd<00:01:00.780> have

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
was planning on doing yeah all I'd have

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.470 
was planning on doing yeah all I'd have
to<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.320> take<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> shields<00:01:02.039> out

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
to do is just take the shields out

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.850 
to do is just take the shields out
basically<00:01:03.480> whether<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.140> decided<00:01:04.680> you're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
basically whether we decided you're

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.679 
basically whether we decided you're
allowed<00:01:05.070> one<00:01:05.100> shield<00:01:05.670> block<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> end<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
allowed one shield block in the end so

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.510 
allowed one shield block in the end so
that<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> looks<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:07.830> shields
