also a lot of Korean guys don't have

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.220 
also a lot of Korean guys don't have
that<00:03:02.220> much<00:03:02.370> confidence<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:03.270> don't<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:03.989> why<00:03:04.170> is

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that much confidence I don't know why is

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.560 
that much confidence I don't know why is
something<00:03:04.709> about<00:03:05.010> us<00:03:05.190> nerds<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:06.239> know<00:03:06.390> we

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
something about us nerds you know we

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.870 
something about us nerds you know we
don't<00:03:06.660> have<00:03:06.810> confidence<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.520> when<00:03:08.520> we<00:03:08.700> wear

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880

don't have confidence and when we wear
earrings<00:03:09.209> I<00:03:09.510> think<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:10.019> boosts<00:03:10.410> our

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
earrings I think it boosts our

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.110 
earrings I think it boosts our
confidence<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.130> know<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.340> think<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.970> look

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
confidence you know you think you look

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.670 
confidence you know you think you look
better<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:12.989> know<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.320> have<00:03:13.530> more

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
better so you know you have more

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.009 
better so you know you have more
confidence<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.310> then<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.700> can<00:03:15.360> maybe<00:03:15.510> go<00:03:15.810> ask

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
confidence and then you can maybe go ask

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.140 
confidence and then you can maybe go ask
that<00:03:16.140> girl<00:03:16.410> for<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> number<00:03:17.550> or<00:03:17.670> something<00:03:18.030> you

but<00:03:28.080> I<00:03:28.110> think<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.190> main<00:03:29.430> reason<00:03:29.850> why

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
but I think the the the main reason why

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.520 
but I think the the the main reason why
a<00:03:30.000> lot<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.239> Koreans<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.080> wear<00:03:31.200> earrings

a lot of Koreans like to wear earrings

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.890 
a lot of Koreans like to wear earrings
is<00:03:31.920> because<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.820> makes<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.360> look<00:03:33.570> a<00:03:33.720> little

more thug you know a little more va and
it's<00:03:38.190> like<00:03:38.430> it's<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.209> what<00:03:39.360> girls<00:03:39.600> look<00:03:39.810> for
