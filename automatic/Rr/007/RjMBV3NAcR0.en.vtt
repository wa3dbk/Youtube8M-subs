00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.900
 in the charter 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.029
 this presents 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 it is this axis but the fight 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 shortly after his victory 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.829
 I do not think so 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.829
 who spoke of an affront 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.460
 in cats and prophets 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 here I think it's because they were with me I call the people 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.279
 and it affects us 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 bongo more 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.130

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 the nikkei index 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.530

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.020
 5000000 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.420
 500 is a little restraint 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.540
 calderon 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.750
 perso I can not everything 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.190
 which is not too expensive 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.160
 the cases are different but also 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.160

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 sail 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.330
 ed biggest rise 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.210

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.210
 from the country 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.800
 it is a site in which she was traveling at very high risk 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.979
 the people 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979

 I will be a candidate 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.789
 the question is whether you feel older children 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.799
 it can be someone special 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.829
 he has made his arms as his trust or rather fresh cat hair 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.409
 I think we did 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.679
 of course what the administrator 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 it's a way of doing things is clear 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:55.859
 lack of agreement 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.729
 you do not speak quite yet 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:59.479
 French dads 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.749
 a few days after that 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:05.769
