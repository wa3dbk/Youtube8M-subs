significant<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> first<00:01:03.510> one<00:01:03.629> would<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.840> when

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
significant the first one would be when

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
significant the first one would be when
he<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.170> brought<00:01:04.500> low<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> failure<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
next following getting kicked out of

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.529 
next following getting kicked out of
Apple<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.679> I<00:01:07.770> think<00:01:07.829> those<00:01:08.549> big<00:01:08.969> failures

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539 
Apple because I think those big failures

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.379 
Apple because I think those big failures
and<00:01:09.810> then<00:01:09.959> setting<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.709> and<00:01:11.039> building<00:01:11.819> Pixar

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:12.389 
and then setting to and building Pixar

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:14.449 
and then setting to and building Pixar
and<00:01:12.719> the<00:01:13.139> great<00:01:13.439> Apple<00:01:13.829> we<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.130> today

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:14.459 
and the great Apple we have today

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:16.069 
and the great Apple we have today
humanized<00:01:15.389> him<00:01:15.539> and<00:01:15.719> taught<00:01:15.869> him<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
humanized him and taught him the

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.629 
humanized him and taught him the
importance<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.649> patience<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.249> playing<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:17.639

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:19.399 
importance of patience in playing the
long<00:01:17.850> game<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.049> without<00:01:19.259> those

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
long game and I think without those

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.569 
long game and I think without those
failures<00:01:19.889> he<00:01:20.069> couldn't<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.399> had<00:01:20.459> his

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:22.289 
successes later the other ones a very

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:23.959 
successes later the other ones a very
precise<00:01:22.709> moment<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.249> when<00:01:23.369> he<00:01:23.459> came<00:01:23.639> back

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969
