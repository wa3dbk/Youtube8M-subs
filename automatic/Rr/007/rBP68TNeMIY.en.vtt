that don't have a scope still give you a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
that don't have a scope still give you a
long<00:00:52.350> range<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> fire<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.250> give<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> large

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
long range of fire and give you a large

shot tenth attack you need to remember

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.030 
shot tenth attack you need to remember
that<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> lot<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.470> range<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> work

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that you have a lot of range to work

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.520 
that you have a lot of range to work
with<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.790> playing<00:01:06.119> defensively<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.080> probably

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with so playing defensively is probably

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
with so playing defensively is probably
the<00:01:07.680> best<00:01:07.920> option<00:01:08.100> taking<00:01:09.030> advantage<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the best option taking advantage of

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.330 
the best option taking advantage of
higher<00:01:09.900> ground<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> splat<00:01:10.890> charger

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
higher ground with the splat charger

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
higher ground with the splat charger
gives<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.060> power<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.810> you'll<00:01:13.110> be

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
gives you a lot of power as you'll be

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.499

the<00:01:44.310> range<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.909> charger<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> best<00:01:46.200> way

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the range of a charger is the best way

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to go with this weapon however there

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
to go with this weapon however there
will<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:48.960> some<00:01:49.290> times<00:01:49.590> where<00:01:49.829> somebody<00:01:50.009> does

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
will be some times where somebody does

with<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.259> clearly<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:56.100> run<00:01:56.280> away<00:01:56.430> so

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
