00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:13.080
 faithful reader of jacques thibon day on 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.330
 is always there with chao maxim in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 live from los angeles to cover the 3 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.949
 2015 and in this new video we are going 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.930
 tell you about uncharted 4 then 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.519
 generally maximum when a game is 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.439
 responsible for concluding the conference with a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.640
 big builders such as sony that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 simply wants to say that there are some 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.920
 in the pants 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 actually she had a big one to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.149
 my opinion because the demo we have at 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 which we attended so sony 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.420
 behind closed doors so re took 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.829
 actually the one we had seen 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 conference but are continuing and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.760
 behind so we got pretty much right 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.250
 about fifteen minutes of gameplay at 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 total so seven minutes more so I 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.539
 am not if you remember stopping at 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.280
 moment when nathan so and and and fired 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.110
 via his grappling hook and lets eat a wall 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.329
 that the sequence continues 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.640
 he arrives on the form he is dragged 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.260
 for a hundred meters in the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 mud so we really see the mud that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.309
 who comes to wear his clothes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.030
 add to these events with lo 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.530
 a really very successful realization and the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.260
 coup we see hoist on the agreement for 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.869
 then reach the vehicle is there 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.570
 follows a session of can not fight or 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 nathan precisely must shoot at 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.540
 enemies which are located on the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.090
 else of the craft one sees it jumping 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
 of a vehicle a bone all that way 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.659
 very fluid with changes of 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.430
 cameras really very smart and 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.299
 staged really mastered this is where 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.049
 that we realize that in fact that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.060
 naughty dog 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.770
 while the console came out there 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 what a year and a half ago already mastery 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.820
 the ps4 really like chefs actually 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.579
 I want to say when what is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.570
 really bluffing is that usually 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.340
 there is a compromise that is done one is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.930
 often says if a game is beautiful ben 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.820
 inevitably the gameplay will feel like it 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.130
 no there not only part of cards 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.049
 is beautiful and more he looks really 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.670
 calibrated what all this passage actually 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.200
 it was co - op direction that made me 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.850
 think a little about god of war iii at 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.060
 agreed with me were appointed 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.049
 in an action from start to finish 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.579
 you do not come back to resume all suffer 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.110
 in fact, are you in the head in the 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.329
 handlebars one can help the action of naxos 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.100
 and that's what god knows what 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.720
 well they would then actually put 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.289
 a lot of people will say well ben that's it 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.660
 it's scripted 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.310
 it's a staging that's ready 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.900
 calculated yes certainly in any case that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.040
 loved him but what a show anyway 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.690
 that's what we know what we want 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.910
 also in the video game it's about 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.430
 take full view and there we know to 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 naughty dog are kings anyway 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.970
 for this kind of game we saw it with 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.950
 uncharted 2 that remains that for many 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.810
 the best episode of the series 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.250
 there I think they will cross a milestone 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.110
 during the question and answer session 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 a newspaper that is asked if it was 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.860
 one of the most 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.150
 amazing of the game or so it was 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.980
 really a sequence that's like 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.900
 as innocent as any other in fact 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.110
 finally told us that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.549
 was actually part low that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.230
 overall ambition had proposed the 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.360
 sequences as strong 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.980
 during the whole game we can do them 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.349
 trust in any case they are they are 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.000
 enough they are strong enough for that no 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.700
 I was really amazed too 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.980
 beyond the graphic quality is 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.630
 that it talks all the time ago 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.940
 always this humorous context and there 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.650
 which makes the department in fact 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.940
 in uncharted 4 either the space in 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.500
 party is always busy always 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.430
 something and then my it's true 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.109
 that we had not paid attention to 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.049
 departure but when they walk around 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.209
 among the local holiday population 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.859
 we can hear French voices in 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.440
 done yeah and we just think that 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.750
 the action takes place in guyana we see in 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.970
 waiting for locals the locals by 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.709
 So the French in my opinion and that is to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.850
 anyway we know because ticad to us 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.209
 to travel in the four corners of 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.239
 world 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.690
 but no it was rather fun what 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.660
 to say other 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.519
 yes in the famous scene precisely the 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.799
 race-pursuit so it's up to continue 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.870
 so with the appearance of his brother 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.239
 who arrived so on to save him 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.730
 so 20 motorcycles his brother who is embodied 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.069
 by troy baker who was himself in 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.350
 the room with hatchet jackson who 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.430
 embody so elie in sauce so 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.810
 both were there to assist 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.870
 so for the first time I believe 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.829
 he wants whoever saw every day 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.120
 the first time they first 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.380
 saw so he was really very 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.019
 also happy with the result both 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.530
 so no really a very presentation 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.109
 intense 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.939
 we went out completely stunned sounded 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.459
 of this show of force 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.590
 we can say it we actually thought that 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.390
 the new tomb raider go power 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.819
 actually fill the gap that had between 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.789
 the two series and in fact no he in 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.859
 give a layer not when when the 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:23.260
 crisis happens at the level of cards id is 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.680
 well behind nathan drake obviously 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.080
 lara croft 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.510
 good after lara croft it will not stay there 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.430
 rise of the tomb raider it will remain a 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.530
 very good of we saw it turn yesterday the 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.020
 here is the game is great but hey it's 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.750
 true that naughty dog here to push 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.220
 still the level even more so we 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.440
 risk of seeing the show anyway 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.070
 if we talk a lot about rockstar but 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.110
 naughty dog 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.320
 yeah actually naughty dog ​​the 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.090
 kids that's not it's here 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.090
 Anyway, here's a game of cards 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.820
 is necessarily one 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.340
