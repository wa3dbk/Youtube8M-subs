00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.230
 hello has finally come 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.390
 call of duty black ops 2 it outside 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.260
 I'm going a little bit of 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.260
 play and yes I just looked in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.750
 could see for yourself 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.110
 it has definitely done a lot and 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.190
 city â€‹â€‹now just play the maps 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.790
 country panama city team that with a lot 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.030
 Interesting 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:46.949
 spectacle status yes so optically sees 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 the whole company from beautiful unfortunately 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:01:03.000
 More awaits battlefield 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:01:04.559
 probably okay now and sometimes 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.660
 what surprise the game 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:15.510
 actually the other call of duty 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:18.060
 games and so had loaded I own 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:23.450
 I already own that is surprised 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.450
 now an agent of the 6 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.200
 12 here 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:44.870
 after Israel lies down there everything is very 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.020
 nice the waking bit futuristic 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.670
 but you already knew otherwise 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 actually everything exactly the same 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:04.140
 That's it, that's all 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.140
 is twice as nice 18 already 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.379
 You can overdo it in between 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.379
 are 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300
 then everything comes now 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.030
 because knives that is in any case 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.569
 some faster than the others 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:45.069
 Of course that was nice 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.069
 takes the 110 meter long 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.200
 his attacks but still true 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.160
 that can be seen 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.010
 a very nice game is involved 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.770
 not yet that's the opening one 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.500
 game played quite a bit himself 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.070
 wanted to have an honest opinion 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:17.180
 can 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:19.590
 if the game is really good going on 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.569
 I would appreciate a month then 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:28.350
 if that was really good that only that 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.570
 is not that what grass 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.550
 but in any case already play 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.480
 Very good from the first impression is 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.480
 ever succeeded well 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.069
 how much can a harm do 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.370
 here is every channel 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.170
 measured by the king 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.170
 then you would have to 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.900
 was still playing afterwards 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.949
 he does that afterwards 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.150
 So here with the match com is 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.100
 is clearly already clear just no 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.100
 big difference to the other could 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.430
 I have to say it again 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.300
 you look in quickly 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.300
 but it was to be expected otherwise 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.470
 all the same game series 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.459
 I'm sorry for the neck, I'm sorry 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:59.169
 no more weapons and everything has then 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:59.169
 you can be completely different 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:16.850
 and everything here to be more 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.460
 everything somehow alive 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.460
 just why 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:36.440
 yes to the laughing people sometimes 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:38.570
 very curious how he looks but it 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.910
 clearly the spots seem better 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.670
 to have been 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:47.570
 Hans SeidenstÃ¼cker judge it 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:52.610
 came to no one 3 3 would that be so 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:55.040
 definitely happened when I did 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.710
 I know this is just this 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.040
 Drilling will keep up and direct 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.030
 should die without being able to 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.940
 turns on gets a 2 3 that can 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.480
 but do not be here 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.480
 that was not nice 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:21.350
 rott was the last great financial statements 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:23.240
 always look it up because it gives it 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.690
 analyzing contact points 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.620
 yes I have a first impression of 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.620
 The game of my plaisted then more 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.620
 and
