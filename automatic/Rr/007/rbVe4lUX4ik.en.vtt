 hello and welcome to this video 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.810
 step by step that tells you how 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.500
 use the new economy mode 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.009
 high- performance power from galaxy s 5 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.260
 energy saving mode modes and 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.840
 ultra power saving mode 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 performance extends the standby time 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 while reducing the consumption of the 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.010
 battery to activate mode mode 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 of energy saving brings down the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.830
 status bar from the top of the two-screen 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.350

 when this mode is enabled 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.920
 the functions are limited so 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.500
 to increase the battery life 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.469
 the energy saving mode can 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.379
 also be enabled under parameters

 water and dust 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.330
 follow these tips keep the device at 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.380
 dry and avoid diving into the water 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.590
 wipe gently

 after any contact with a liquid 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.550
 avoiding exposing reciprocate with water 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.560
 under high pressure or use it 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.440
 in situations where water is flowing 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 quickly example in the sea under the 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.500
 shower 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.000
 do not use screen protector 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.820
 this could lead to 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.130
 malfunction of the sensor make sure 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.930
 you that the back cover and the cash of 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.820
 the multifunction socket are 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.740
 perfectly closed otherwise 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.500
 water and dust tightness 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.910
 will not be guaranteed 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.770
 do not open the back cover with the 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.320
 wet hands or when the device is 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.050
 wet this presentation is over 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.970
 you now know how to use the 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.030
 new energy saving mode 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:21.240
