with<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.200> respawning<00:01:52.860> screen<00:01:53.189> I've<00:01:53.399> got<00:01:53.670> our

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
with the respawning screen I've got our

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.870 
with the respawning screen I've got our
there<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.570> go<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:56.009> have<00:01:56.310> actually

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
there we go here we go we have actually

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
there we go here we go we have actually
been<00:01:57.560> reincarnated<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:59.369> voila<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.079> that

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
been reincarnated and voila look at that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.859 
been reincarnated and voila look at that
we<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.189> spawned<00:02:02.700> back<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.840> have

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
we have spawned back in here and we have

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
we have spawned back in here and we have
actually<00:02:04.290> picked<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> two<00:02:04.979> items<00:02:05.159> i<00:02:05.490> was

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
actually picked up the two items i was

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
actually picked up the two items i was
holding<00:02:05.880> before<00:02:06.750> i<00:02:06.780> actually<00:02:07.049> went<00:02:07.439> into<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
holding before i actually went into the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
holding before i actually went into the
storage<00:02:08.310> locator<00:02:08.879> now<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.110> i<00:02:10.140> had

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
storage locator now as you can see i had

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.430 
storage locator now as you can see i had
a<00:02:11.009> instance<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:12.000> myself<00:02:12.450> I'd<00:02:12.660> two<00:02:12.900> instances

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a instance of myself I'd two instances

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.730 
a instance of myself I'd two instances
now

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
now

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.370 
now
one<00:02:13.920> died<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.910> redoing<00:02:15.480> itself<00:02:16.020> so<00:02:16.230> it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
one died and it's redoing itself so it's

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.110 
one died and it's redoing itself so it's
actually<00:02:16.530> rebuilding<00:02:17.310> itself<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:17.970> have

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
actually rebuilding itself and we have

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180 
actually rebuilding itself and we have
five<00:02:18.390> percent<00:02:18.870> complete<00:02:19.230> now<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.770> actual

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
five percent complete now the actual

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.950 
five percent complete now the actual
completion<00:02:20.520> rate<00:02:20.880> actually<00:02:21.090> does<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.780> quite

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
completion rate actually does take quite

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.980 
completion rate actually does take quite
some<00:02:22.290> time<00:02:22.620> actually<00:02:23.520> no<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.720> is

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
some time actually no this is this is

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.140 
some time actually no this is this is
this<00:02:25.260> model<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:25.980> need<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.280> restart<00:02:26.940> this

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
this model and I need to restart this

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.680 
this model and I need to restart this
with<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.630> sink<00:02:28.230> core<00:02:28.670> prick<00:02:29.670> myself<00:02:29.850> again

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
with the sink core prick myself again

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.270 
with the sink core prick myself again
and<00:02:30.900> I'll<00:02:31.140> switch<00:02:31.320> over<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> survival<00:02:32.040> mode<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and I'll switch over to survival mode to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.250 
and I'll switch over to survival mode to
show<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.550> guys<00:02:32.670> once<00:02:32.970> again<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.450> now<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.110> will

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
show you guys once again and now it will

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.350 
show you guys once again and now it will
rebuild<00:02:34.740> start<00:02:35.280> rebuilding<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.910> there<00:02:36.060> we<00:02:36.210> go

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
rebuild start rebuilding and there we go

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.450 
rebuild start rebuilding and there we go
it<00:02:36.600> will<00:02:36.720> rebuild<00:02:37.200> itself<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.100> we'll<00:02:38.280> have

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
it will rebuild itself so we'll have

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.490 
it will rebuild itself so we'll have
multiple<00:02:39.150> characters<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.810> once<00:02:39.990> we<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.320> into

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
multiple characters and once we go into

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.730 
multiple characters and once we go into
our<00:02:40.710> storage<00:02:41.420> shell<00:02:42.420> storage<00:02:42.840> you'll<00:02:43.260> see<00:02:43.560> now

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
our storage shell storage you'll see now

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920 
our storage shell storage you'll see now
we<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:44.100> four<00:02:44.430> characters<00:02:45.000> one<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.480> currently

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
we have four characters one is currently

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.500 
we have four characters one is currently
resting<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.400> done<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:48.330> actually

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
resting this one is done it actually

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.540 
resting this one is done it actually
shows<00:02:48.810> us<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.350> coordinates<00:02:49.710> of<00:02:50.040> where<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.430> is

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
shows us the coordinates of where it is

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.730 
shows us the coordinates of where it is
so<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.150> interlaced<00:02:51.690> between<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
so it can be interlaced between the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.520 
so it can be interlaced between the
nether<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.250> also<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.330> overworld<00:02:54.900> but<00:02:55.260> due<00:02:55.500> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
nether and also the overworld but due to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.470 
nether and also the overworld but due to
technical<00:02:56.100> difficulties<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.940> doesn't<00:02:57.330> work

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
technical difficulties it doesn't work

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.110 
technical difficulties it doesn't work
in<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> end<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.740> also<00:02:58.860> need<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.220> power<00:02:59.760> the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
in the end you also need to power the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.090 
in the end you also need to power the
storage<00:03:00.630> cell<00:03:01.080> you<00:03:01.260> also<00:03:01.530> need<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.710> little<00:03:01.980> bit

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
storage cell you also need a little bit

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.370 
storage cell you also need a little bit
of<00:03:02.130> redstone<00:03:02.610> connection<00:03:03.270> like<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.320> to

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
of redstone connection like so for it to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.410 
of redstone connection like so for it to
power<00:03:04.770> itself<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> guys<00:03:05.790> wondering<00:03:06.240> why

to<00:03:31.050> duel<00:03:31.620> pigs<00:03:32.040> actually<00:03:32.460> simulate<00:03:32.940> or<00:03:33.150> create

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
to duel pigs actually simulate or create

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.720 
to duel pigs actually simulate or create
the<00:03:33.990> player<00:03:34.230> faster<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.040> unfortunate

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
the player faster and the unfortunate

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.940 
the player faster and the unfortunate
answer<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.300> no<00:03:36.480> they<00:03:36.660> don't<00:03:36.930> only<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.440> pig<00:03:37.710> can

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
answer is no they don't only one pig can

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.180 
answer is no they don't only one pig can
harness<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.820> actual<00:03:39.120> spawning<00:03:39.570> capacity<00:03:40.320> so

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
harness the actual spawning capacity so

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.430 
harness the actual spawning capacity so
it<00:03:41.610> won't<00:03:41.880> go<00:03:42.060> any<00:03:42.090> faster<00:03:42.900> as<00:03:43.050> you<00:03:43.110> can<00:03:43.290> see

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it won't go any faster as you can see

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.780 
it won't go any faster as you can see
we'll<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:43.710> pick<00:03:43.830> up<00:03:44.010> these<00:03:44.220> loose<00:03:44.550> items

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
we'll just pick up these loose items

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.480 
we'll just pick up these loose items
over<00:03:45.210> here<00:03:45.450> but<00:03:45.960> let's<00:03:46.680> go<00:03:46.860> let's<00:03:47.100> go<00:03:47.220> die

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
over here but let's go let's go die

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.610 
over here but let's go let's go die
again<00:03:47.760> let's<00:03:48.090> go<00:03:48.240> see<00:03:48.480> what<00:03:48.630> we<00:03:48.720> can<00:03:48.900> conjure

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
again let's go see what we can conjure

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.260 
again let's go see what we can conjure
up<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:49.890> take<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.070> look<00:03:50.250> this<00:03:50.370> awesome<00:03:50.520> animation

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
up so take a look this awesome animation

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.540 
up so take a look this awesome animation
floats<00:03:52.020> us<00:03:52.200> right<00:03:52.560> up<00:03:52.590> into<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.130> area<00:03:53.490> you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
floats us right up into the area you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.610 
floats us right up into the area you
wish<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.820> fire<00:03:54.090> would<00:03:54.390> stop<00:03:54.690> art<00:03:54.960> stop<00:03:55.380> doing

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
wish the fire would stop art stop doing

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.830 
wish the fire would stop art stop doing
that<00:03:55.710> but<00:03:55.860> there<00:03:56.040> we<00:03:56.160> go<00:03:56.310> as<00:03:56.490> we<00:03:56.970> resync<00:03:57.480> there

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
that but there we go as we resync there

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.630 
that but there we go as we resync there
we<00:03:57.990> go<00:03:58.140> very<00:03:58.560> nice<00:03:58.800> and<00:03:59.070> if<00:03:59.160> you<00:03:59.250> want<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.490> go

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
we go very nice and if you want to go

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.730 
we go very nice and if you want to go
back<00:03:59.850> in<00:04:00.090> it'll<00:04:00.600> actually<00:04:00.690> tell<00:04:01.080> us<00:04:01.230> wait<00:04:01.500> let

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
back in it'll actually tell us wait let

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.560 
back in it'll actually tell us wait let
me<00:04:01.770> go<00:04:01.980> up<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.310> stop<00:04:02.610> moving<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.150> it'll

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
me go up and stop moving and it'll

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.940 
me go up and stop moving and it'll
actually<00:04:03.690> tell<00:04:04.020> us<00:04:04.110> when<00:04:04.320> our<00:04:04.440> characters

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
actually tell us when our characters

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.280 
actually tell us when our characters
will<00:04:05.130> be<00:04:05.250> ready<00:04:05.580> so<00:04:06.120> here<00:04:06.360> we<00:04:06.480> have<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:07.020> ten

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
will be ready so here we have to ten

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.470 
will be ready so here we have to ten
percent<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:07.950> one<00:04:08.130> eighteen<00:04:08.640> percent<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.420> you

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
percent and one eighteen percent so you

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.810 
percent and one eighteen percent so you
need<00:04:09.690> you<00:04:09.990> need<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> wait<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> while<00:04:10.920> until<00:04:11.160> these

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
need you need a wait a while until these

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.630 
need you need a wait a while until these
guys<00:04:12.150> can<00:04:12.480> prop<00:04:12.750> up<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.920> get<00:04:14.100> your<00:04:14.250> stuff

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
guys can prop up and you get your stuff

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.020 
guys can prop up and you get your stuff
back<00:04:14.910> basically<00:04:16.190> from<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.310> actual<00:04:17.520> instance

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
back basically from the actual instance

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.420 
back basically from the actual instance
so<00:04:18.209> now<00:04:18.359> what<00:04:18.540> i<00:04:18.570> can<00:04:18.780> do<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.140> i<00:04:19.230> don't<00:04:20.190> have<00:04:20.400> one

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
so now what i can do is i don't have one

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.330 
so now what i can do is i don't have one
ready<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.299> i<00:04:21.540> can't<00:04:21.930> actually<00:04:22.109> go<00:04:22.350> switch<00:04:22.830> but

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
ready so i can't actually go switch but

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.860 
ready so i can't actually go switch but
if<00:04:23.430> i<00:04:23.550> actually<00:04:23.850> had<00:04:23.970> one<00:04:24.000> ready<00:04:24.479> i<00:04:24.540> could

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
if i actually had one ready i could

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.500 
if i actually had one ready i could
switch<00:04:25.290> from<00:04:25.950> one<00:04:26.520> location<00:04:26.729> to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
switch from one location to

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.480 
switch from one location to
other<00:04:27.630> location<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.410> say<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:28.650> example<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:29.340> had

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
other location so say for example I had

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.760 
other location so say for example I had
a<00:04:29.520> base<00:04:29.790> over<00:04:30.150> here<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.140> go<00:04:31.350> into<00:04:31.530> my

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
a base over here and I go into my

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.160 
a base over here and I go into my
storage<00:04:32.100> container<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.820> can<00:04:33.030> teleport<00:04:33.630> all<00:04:33.870> the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
storage container I can teleport all the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.050 
storage container I can teleport all the
way<00:04:34.410> over<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.710> this<00:04:34.980> one<00:04:35.190> like<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.430> was<00:04:35.700> talking

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
way over to this one like I was talking

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.540 
way over to this one like I was talking
about<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.690> nether<00:04:36.960> now<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.560> really<00:04:38.190> do<00:04:38.370> want

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
about in the nether now I really do want

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.700 
about in the nether now I really do want
to<00:04:38.640> test<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.270> out<00:04:39.420> so<00:04:39.720> hopefully<00:04:40.080> let's<00:04:40.590> go

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
to test it out so hopefully let's go

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.650 
to test it out so hopefully let's go
test<00:04:40.950> it<00:04:41.040> out<00:04:41.160> now<00:04:41.400> I've<00:04:41.760> traveled<00:04:42.300> down<00:04:42.420> to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
test it out now I've traveled down to

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.330 
test it out now I've traveled down to
the<00:04:42.810> nether<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.230> test<00:04:43.500> out<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.890> because<00:04:44.310> I

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
the nether to test out this because I

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.980 
the nether to test out this because I
haven't<00:04:44.550> seen<00:04:44.790> any<00:04:45.030> videos<00:04:45.420> on<00:04:45.600> YouTube

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
haven't seen any videos on YouTube

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.570 
haven't seen any videos on YouTube
testing<00:04:46.440> this<00:04:46.530> out<00:04:46.740> yet<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.190> think<00:04:47.310> I'll

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
testing this out yet so I think I'll

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.270 
testing this out yet so I think I'll
might<00:04:47.790> be<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.090> first<00:04:48.470> and<00:04:49.470> here<00:04:49.920> we<00:04:49.950> go<00:04:50.040> we're

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
might be the first and here we go we're

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.920 
might be the first and here we go we're
going<00:04:50.520> into<00:04:50.670> the<00:04:50.760> storage<00:04:51.090> cell<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.750> let's

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
going into the storage cell and let's

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.170 
going into the storage cell and let's
see<00:04:52.110> oh<00:04:52.320> yes<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.800> works<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:53.220> let's<00:04:53.250> go<00:04:53.640> click<00:04:53.970> my

spectacular limit the loading time was

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.110 
spectacular limit the loading time was
so<00:05:04.170> small<00:05:04.950> and<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.490> animation<00:05:06.060> was
