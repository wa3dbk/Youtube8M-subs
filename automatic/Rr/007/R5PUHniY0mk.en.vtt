 such attempt of assault or revenge but indicated of him 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.500
 End of the game

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.479
 she screams at him 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.239
 meanwhile it thinks it's a good month 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.940
 in fact it was not an unfortunate phrase but it happens and 3d televisions displayed 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.190
 personal desire 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.350

 on the eastern side things for me 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.169
 the high 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.130
 also sets the goal 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.349
 until the tip 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.349
 there are a lot of people with nobody said the extreme 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.539
 I was interested 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:15.829
 all 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.169
 nevertheless noted 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.169
 had to talk 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.299
 some time ago 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.889
 very bad 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.219
 It's you, you're killing another, I think it's very wrong. 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.219
 who is man 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.989
 who would say 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.269
 It's ready, but your mother has a car. 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.039
 has no going 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.039
 malik on driving his father and mother 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.239
 which is in line with others if you start 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.249
 but it is he who drives the best of his father and mother 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:54.870
 morrissey by chance the car banged a tire your mother knows to change the 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.869
 car's tire 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.359
 I call you more 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.309
 besides cpfl 

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:05.130
 for this 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.130
 besides go and pick it up 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.209
 No, that's not what I asked for the good of your mother. 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.760
 car 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.740
 not mariana 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.709
 if you leave the field defeated 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.749
 your father if the periodic exchange 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:25.129

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:28.129

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.020
 is giving a lecture 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.300
 despite the 13 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.300
 and I never wanted 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.659
 What was the brand's best seller? 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.659
 the one that brings more playing at home 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:53.279
 in a country where justice is a sham for more 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.539
 it seems easy 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.819
 when the Ferrari had more head 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.509
 after all theory we do not have to do more 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.100
 I received the following you 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.100
 What was more of you than you liked? 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.889
 the rest get calmer 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.330
 although the battle maringÃ¡ 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.789
 I do not care who brands 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.930
 Did you like it the most? 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930
 will give work to the ball musicians 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.020
 Besides that 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.059
 if I do not know not but it's not that 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.589
 What an absurdity 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.370
 on your twitter 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.319
 even with them 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.319
 that's because it's the next 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.160
