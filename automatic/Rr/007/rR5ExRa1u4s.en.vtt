00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.740 
gun here it was kind of troubling to be
having<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.369> shoot<00:01:42.550> them<00:01:42.700> all<00:01:42.850> with<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.119> lil

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
having to shoot them all with a lil

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.690 
having to shoot them all with a lil
because<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.319> didn't<00:01:44.590> do<00:01:44.679> too<00:01:44.710> much<00:01:44.890> damage<00:01:45.069> on

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
because it didn't do too much damage on

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.359 
because it didn't do too much damage on
this<00:01:45.789> round<00:01:46.060> an<00:01:46.630> RPD<00:01:47.289> I<00:01:47.319> found<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.920> be<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.130> best

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
this round an RPD I found to be the best

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.330 
this round an RPD I found to be the best
on<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.640> high<00:01:48.819> rounds<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.649> got<00:01:50.649> a<00:01:50.679> hammer

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
on the high rounds and the got a hammer

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.850 
on the high rounds and the got a hammer
I<00:01:51.700> think<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:52.240> called<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.720> H<00:01:52.869> AMR<00:01:53.500> looks<00:01:53.740> like

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
I think it's called the H AMR looks like

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.830 
I think it's called the H AMR looks like
an<00:01:53.979> oversized<00:01:54.369> scar<00:01:54.789> of<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:54.970> round<00:01:55.270> drum<00:01:55.569> I

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
an oversized scar of the round drum I

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.919 
an oversized scar of the round drum I
found<00:01:56.710> that<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.009> be<00:01:57.039> one<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.819> best<00:01:58.030> doesn't

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
found that to be one of the best doesn't

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.510 
found that to be one of the best doesn't
have<00:01:59.020> as<00:01:59.110> much<00:01:59.200> animal<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.770> rpd<00:02:00.130> but<00:02:00.369> you

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
have as much animal is the rpd but you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.740 
have as much animal is the rpd but you
could<00:02:00.640> spray<00:02:00.909> them<00:02:01.090> down<00:02:01.119> like<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.569> no

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
could spray them down like this no

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.080 
could spray them down like this no
problem<00:02:01.899> and<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.640> wasn't<00:02:03.640> getting<00:02:03.759> too<00:02:04.000> many

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
problem and I wasn't getting too many

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.449 
problem and I wasn't getting too many
macs<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.600> was<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:04.990> game<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.619> just<00:02:06.250> started

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
macs and was this game I just started

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.669 
macs and was this game I just started
getting<00:02:06.670> more<00:02:06.759> Maximos<00:02:07.360> on<00:02:07.539> like<00:02:07.659> 31<00:02:08.319> which<00:02:08.530> is

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
getting more Maximos on like 31 which is

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.289 
getting more Maximos on like 31 which is
pretty<00:02:08.860> disappointing<00:02:09.459> because<00:02:09.549> I<00:02:09.819> was

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
pretty disappointing because I was

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.759 
pretty disappointing because I was
having<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.630> much<00:02:10.720> troubles<00:02:11.260> on<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.440> earlier

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
having so much troubles on the earlier

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.819 
having so much troubles on the earlier

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
rounds I really needed them but um I

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.960 
rounds I really needed them but um I
mean<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.370> always<00:02:15.519> good<00:02:15.640> to<00:02:15.670> have<00:02:15.790> an<00:02:15.910> eye

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
mean it's always good to have an eye

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.310 
mean it's always good to have an eye
exam<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.480> I'm<00:02:16.540> not<00:02:16.660> gonna<00:02:16.750> complain<00:02:17.019> about<00:02:17.170> it

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
frustrated and it was really

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.620 
frustrated and it was really
nerve-wracking<00:02:40.550> like<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.030> didn't<00:02:41.240> want<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.450> die

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
really trying to get like first on the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.370 
really trying to get like first on the
leaderboards<00:02:52.460> which<00:02:53.240> was<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.600> round<00:02:53.810> 40

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
leaderboards which was like round 40

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.590 
leaderboards which was like round 40
something<00:02:54.800> or<00:02:54.920> 50<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.240> was<00:02:56.330> going<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.510> go

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
something or 50 and I was going to go

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.050 
something or 50 and I was going to go
all<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.780> way<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.990> was<00:02:57.170> gonna<00:02:57.320> try<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:57.500> make<00:02:57.800> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
all the way I was gonna try and make it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.360 
all the way I was gonna try and make it
but<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> had<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> feeling<00:02:59.840> as<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.110> die<00:03:00.710> shortly

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
but I had a feeling as a die shortly

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.010 
but I had a feeling as a die shortly
because<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.850> don't<00:03:02.210> quick<00:03:02.390> revive<00:03:02.600> anymore

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
because I don't quick revive anymore

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.800 
because I don't quick revive anymore

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.980 
going to happen but I think I did pretty
well<00:03:08.660> overall<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:10.160> um<00:03:10.510> it's<00:03:11.510> coming<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.900> an
