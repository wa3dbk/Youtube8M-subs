well first I wanted to show you how I

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.140 
well first I wanted to show you how I
discovered<00:00:12.809> these<00:00:13.710> process<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:14.849> what

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
discovered these process or what

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.800 
discovered these process or what
inspired<00:00:15.660> me<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:15.990> search<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:16.890> process<00:00:17.810> I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
inspired me to search for this process I

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.540 
inspired me to search for this process I
believe<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.460> late<00:00:21.710> 70s<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.980> got<00:00:23.340> my

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
believe is in the late 70s I got my

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.900 
believe is in the late 70s I got my
first<00:00:23.820> jump<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.449> pellet<00:00:25.519> after<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> few

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
first jump a pellet after the few

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.470 
first jump a pellet after the few
painting<00:00:27.480> sessions<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.529> found<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.849> natural

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
painting sessions I found the natural

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.100 
painting sessions I found the natural
texture<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.529> rocks<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.399> mountains<00:00:33.110> escapes

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
texture of rocks and mountains escapes

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.160 
texture of rocks and mountains escapes
on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> pellet<00:00:35.010> now<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.149> wanted<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.899> show<00:00:37.110> you

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
on the pellet now I wanted to show you

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.459 
on the pellet now I wanted to show you
how<00:00:38.010> these<00:00:38.280> things<00:00:38.340> happen<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:40.260> that

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
how these things happen now you see that

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.799 
how these things happen now you see that
when<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> pellet<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.550> new<00:00:41.940> when<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.360> brush

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
when the pellet is new when you brush

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.100 
when the pellet is new when you brush
the<00:00:43.020> pain<00:00:43.290> over<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.100> pain<00:00:44.670> repel<00:00:45.239> paint<00:00:45.660> see

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the pain over the pain repel paint see

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.889 
the pain over the pain repel paint see
that<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> surface<00:00:46.680> repeal<00:00:47.430> repeal<00:00:48.270> pain<00:00:48.600> see

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
that the surface repeal repeal pain see

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
that the surface repeal repeal pain see
then<00:00:49.140> okay

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
then okay

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
then okay
those<00:00:50.820> things<00:00:51.420> will<00:00:51.780> create<00:00:52.140> different<00:00:52.440> type

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
those things will create different type

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
those things will create different type
of<00:00:53.030> texture<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.379> that<00:00:55.379> limit<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.550> thing<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
of texture and that limit the thing if I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.819 
of texture and that limit the thing if I
can<00:00:58.829> find<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.489> painting<00:01:00.120> ground<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
can find a painting ground that is a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.770 
can find a painting ground that is a
smooth<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.969> plastic<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.580> that<00:01:05.780> would

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
smooth as plastic and that would

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
smooth as plastic and that would
probably<00:01:07.020> do<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.590> same<00:01:07.619> thing<00:01:07.830> for<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
probably do the same thing for you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.160 
probably do the same thing for you
so<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:10.010> first<00:01:11.010> searched<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.299> local<00:01:12.689> supply

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so I first searched for the local supply

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.249 
so I first searched for the local supply
stores<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.920> found<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:15.270> illustration<00:01:15.990> pole

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
stores and I found the illustration pole

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.499 
stores and I found the illustration pole
I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> hard<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.640> smooth<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I think that is hard and smooth so I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.499 
I think that is hard and smooth so I
tried<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> show<00:01:21.450> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
tried this out I want to now to show you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.789 
tried this out I want to now to show you
the<00:01:22.020> how<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:23.490> coated<00:01:24.180> now<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.080> surface<00:01:25.350> will

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
the how the coated now this surface will

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.179 
the how the coated now this surface will
react<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.850> much<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.450> if<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.350> enhance

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
react but not as much as if I enhance

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.480 
react but not as much as if I enhance
that<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:30.150> quality<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.810> medium<00:01:31.490> acrylic

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that with a quality of medium acrylic

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390 
that with a quality of medium acrylic
glossy<00:01:33.229> germanium<00:01:34.229> will<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.100> surface

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
glossy germanium will make the surface

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.719 
glossy germanium will make the surface
even<00:01:36.270> smoother<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.280> therefore<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.579> will

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
even smoother and therefore it will

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.140 
even smoother and therefore it will
repel<00:01:39.210> paint<00:01:39.710> okay<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> wanted<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> show

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
repel paint okay what I wanted to show

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.179 
repel paint okay what I wanted to show
you<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.079> difference<00:01:43.530> between<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you is that the difference between the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.999 
you is that the difference between the
ear<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.759> area<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.570> caught<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
ear the area that I caught it and the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.819 
ear the area that I caught it and the
area<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.759> did<00:01:47.820> not<00:01:48.149> put<00:01:48.720> any<00:01:48.930> gel<00:01:49.290> medium<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
area I did not put any gel medium on

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.480 
area I did not put any gel medium on
them<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:50.850> gel<00:01:51.329> medium<00:01:51.829> comes<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.220> different

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
them now gel medium comes in different

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.020 
them now gel medium comes in different
forms<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:54.420> there<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.500> paste<00:01:56.430> form<00:01:56.820> like

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
forms now there would be paste form like

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
forms now there would be paste form like
this<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:58.320> then<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.100> would<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.280> sort<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
this and then there would be sort of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.240 
this and then there would be sort of
more<00:01:59.939> liquid<00:02:00.540> type<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.170> know<00:02:01.290> sometimes<00:02:01.799> even

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
more liquid type you know sometimes even

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.740 
more liquid type you know sometimes even
like<00:02:02.430> varnish<00:02:03.090> type<00:02:04.820> liquid<00:02:05.820> test<00:02:06.119> coating

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
like varnish type liquid test coating

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.070 
like varnish type liquid test coating
all<00:02:07.259> these<00:02:07.680> companies<00:02:08.129> produce<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
all these companies produce this but the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.670 
all these companies produce this but the
key<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.649> use<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> glossy<00:02:11.849> one

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
key is that use the glossy one

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.850 
key is that use the glossy one
if<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.250> use<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.819> met<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.480> map<00:02:15.170> by<00:02:15.439> definition

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
if you use the met one map by definition

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.470 
if you use the met one map by definition
what<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.030> zorb

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
what is the zorb

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.979 
what is the zorb
instead<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.140> repair<00:02:18.650> okay<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.400> glossy<00:02:20.299> glossy

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
instead of repair okay so glossy glossy

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.369 
instead of repair okay so glossy glossy
gel<00:02:21.680> medium<00:02:22.599> normally<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.810> don't<00:02:24.019> have<00:02:24.260> to

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
gel medium normally you don't have to

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.920 
gel medium normally you don't have to
use<00:02:24.590> force<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.040> end<00:02:25.310> like<00:02:25.549> this<00:02:25.750> you<00:02:26.750> can

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
use force to end like this you can

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.319 
use force to end like this you can
download<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.310> if<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.640> wanted<00:02:28.939> to<00:02:29.060> try

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
download that but if you wanted to try

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.440 
download that but if you wanted to try
it<00:02:29.359> out<00:02:29.540> first<00:02:29.900> then<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:31.849> could<00:02:32.090> simply

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
it out first then I you could simply

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.599 
it out first then I you could simply
just<00:02:32.480> use<00:02:32.900> force<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.349> end<00:02:33.590> like<00:02:33.799> this<00:02:33.829> in<00:02:34.489> a

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
just use force to end like this in a

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:35.679 
just use force to end like this in a
page<00:02:34.879> format

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
page format

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.160 
page format

now you are not building up impasto you
know<00:02:39.319> relief<00:02:39.799> to<00:02:40.310> get<00:02:40.489> texture<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.569> makin<00:02:41.959> is

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
know relief to get texture the makin is

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:48.039 
know relief to get texture the makin is
as<00:02:42.349> smooth<00:02:42.709> as<00:02:42.950> possible<00:02:45.819> so<00:02:46.819> an<00:02:47.120> impression

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.830 
okay now I'm going to use a little bit
darker<00:04:51.229> color<00:04:51.620> but<00:04:52.400> if<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:52.940> used<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.330> very<00:04:53.360> light

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
darker color but if I used a very light

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.390 
darker color but if I used a very light
color<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.350> probably<00:04:54.710> wouldn't<00:04:55.010> see<00:04:55.039> the

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
color you probably wouldn't see the

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.779 
color you probably wouldn't see the
texture<00:04:55.880> as<00:04:56.060> as<00:04:56.300> much<00:04:56.990> as<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:58.010> target<00:04:58.400> value

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
texture as as much as the target value

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.510 
texture as as much as the target value
so<00:04:59.300> I<00:04:59.330> simply<00:04:59.780> just<00:05:00.199> brought<00:05:00.500> over<00:05:00.830> quickly

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
so I simply just brought over quickly

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.290 
so I simply just brought over quickly
you<00:05:02.479> can<00:05:02.750> see<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.350> reaction<00:05:03.970> see<00:05:04.970> that<00:05:05.150> you

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
you can see the reaction see that you

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.010 
you can see the reaction see that you
can<00:05:05.539> see<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.530> area<00:05:06.979> with<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.400> geo<00:05:07.639> medium<00:05:08.270> we

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
can see the area with the geo medium we

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.700 
can see the area with the geo medium we
add<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:09.620> give<00:05:10.160> you<00:05:10.370> a<00:05:10.639> lot<00:05:10.910> more<00:05:11.120> texture<00:05:11.710> than

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
add and give you a lot more texture than

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.270 
add and give you a lot more texture than
the<00:05:12.740> area<00:05:13.460> that<00:05:14.030> do<00:05:14.270> not<00:05:14.539> have<00:05:14.960> so<00:05:15.710> now<00:05:15.979> I'm

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
the area that do not have so now I'm

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.540 
the area that do not have so now I'm
coming<00:05:16.580> all<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.240> way<00:05:17.270> down<00:05:17.360> here<00:05:18.199> can<00:05:18.949> you<00:05:19.099> can

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
coming all the way down here can you can

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.400 
coming all the way down here can you can
you<00:05:19.639> tell<00:05:19.910> the<00:05:20.060> difference<00:05:20.090> here<00:05:20.720> in<00:05:21.050> here

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
you tell the difference here in here

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.219 
you tell the difference here in here
that's<00:05:21.650> hair<00:05:22.220> line<00:05:22.460> because<00:05:22.970> what<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.539> do<00:05:23.810> not

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
that's hair line because what I do not

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.920 
that's hair line because what I do not
press<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.770> line<00:05:25.250> out<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:26.060> here<00:05:26.570> you<00:05:26.780> don't

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
press the line out and here you don't

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.439 
press the line out and here you don't
see<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.410> you<00:05:27.860> don't<00:05:28.130> see<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.550> the<00:05:28.789> very

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
see that you don't see the the very

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.330 
see that you don't see the the very
monotonous<00:05:29.840> straight<00:05:30.470> hair<00:05:30.770> lines<00:05:31.039> and

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
monotonous straight hair lines and

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.230 
monotonous straight hair lines and
that's<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:32.030> idea<00:05:32.360> of<00:05:32.449> why<00:05:32.720> I<00:05:32.750> did<00:05:33.199> it<00:05:33.380> that<00:05:33.470> way

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
that's the idea of why I did it that way

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.960 
that's the idea of why I did it that way
and<00:05:35.240> you<00:05:36.110> can<00:05:36.320> see<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.650> difference<00:05:37.070> now<00:05:37.250> the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
and you can see the difference now the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.600 
and you can see the difference now the
key<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.270> way<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:39.289> once<00:05:39.889> you<00:05:40.099> apply<00:05:40.580> the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
key to way is that once you apply the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.629 
key to way is that once you apply the
color<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.599> leave<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:42.050> alone<00:05:42.289> if<00:05:43.099> you<00:05:43.370> keep

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
color and leave it alone if you keep

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.120 
color and leave it alone if you keep
embracing<00:05:44.090> let's<00:05:45.080> say<00:05:45.260> for<00:05:45.470> you<00:05:45.620> can't<00:05:45.889> keep

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
embracing let's say for you can't keep

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.909 
embracing let's say for you can't keep
on<00:05:46.310> brushing<00:05:46.940> then<00:05:47.210> what<00:05:47.479> then<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.470> will<00:05:48.680> lose

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
on brushing then what then you will lose

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.420 
on brushing then what then you will lose
the<00:05:49.250> texture<00:05:49.699> alright<00:05:50.599> so<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.289> key<00:05:51.650> to<00:05:52.039> way<00:05:52.190> is

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
the texture alright so the key to way is

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.120 
the texture alright so the key to way is
that<00:05:52.669> generally<00:05:53.270> souheïb<00:05:53.659> it<00:05:53.780> over<00:05:54.050> quickly
