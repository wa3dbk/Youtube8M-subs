00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.500
 Welcome back to what is actually 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:16.660
 Welcome back to one of my first 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.880
 pokémon matches and i want you now 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.790
 I've been up in advance 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.070
 Damn incompetent as far as pokémon is concerned 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.800
 that should hopefully animal meanwhile 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.900
 know if I know you now 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.050
 we play a definitely against 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.390
 few people from our community that 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.609
 team what I here is basically driver 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.649
 also pretty beta if I have that 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.370
 it is still relatively even alpha if I have 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:45.820
 That's why nobody expected 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.339
 high performance techniques to be exact 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
 I'm even so convinced of that 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.909
 I'm not even the incompetent 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.039
 to know elementary by heart 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.539
 Fact is, we are both first throw ourselves 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.269
 once each other tann stone to the head 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.249
 I cry only once so in that 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.579
 he first time i think no i do not like 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:06.180
 more he spits me good last 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.280
 does not take care of that anywhere 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.350
 leaves thinks for you and stomps 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.110
 I do not do anything for a reason 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.820
 brings and it is basically like this 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.910
 little kindergarten celebrates the one 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.560
 Trying to kick the other you know 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.300
 Still problems is it does not work 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.590
 I was a bit too 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.340
 experiment a bit somewhere 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.140
 hurt but if rauszukriegen wall 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.890
 fighting against wall usually wins 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.950
 he keeps on flaming fire or in the outside 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.700
 where I made because at some point thinks me 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.290
 I can do that with flames doner 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 you do that already 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.890
 but of course how should it be otherwise 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.340
 if and sets a stone one attack 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.460
 album 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.850
 I'm dead so much to my flames 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.110
 doner kebab from small on it raised 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.930
 not anymore so it has to be so accurate 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.899
 rules to first was nice with 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.239
 boiling water because I thought why 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.270
 do not question mine, please 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.220
 Pokemon how I train you or what 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.310
 I bring with me I just like it 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.400
 as I think that 's good you are him 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.430
 personally you have in guard that lies 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.440
 it's just because of the fucking top4 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.420
 you know the penner of the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.489
 own a touring bike and be fucked 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.640
 volume ii that and that works 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.890
 of course not so good 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.049
 king shield can even be relative 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.709
 not matter if it a try my 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.000
 That's why my attack puts back strong 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.519
 I thought I would come 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.890
 there you are not far from it is time of 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:55.049
 michael schierack is also one of my 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.489
 pokemon I'm from the start so have 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.910

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.650
 Having begun my monologues ag 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.630
 gallup you know my dino strong 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.340
 Enough to just steal like that 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.030
 to bite the skill he has in about 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.620
 I have that once 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.850
 Sound quality accordingly that you 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.049
 okay is because i have to go this way 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.560
 comment on that as a bit 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.850
 strange 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.350
 I look half pokémon myself 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.500
 understand the hype chatter first 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.769
 really i do not really like it 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.150
 Look blitzer is no shit blitzer 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.930
 is why it is called only once blitzer 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.450
 not at it 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.760
 I have become this system 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.109
 I've gotten admired and exchanged 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.109
 since then I've raised it 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:51.110
 hello love talc skate yes there you are 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.150
 all the scream where we match this 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.959
 shadow is my opponent a bit 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.910
 sortie because my blitzer is 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:05.000
 fucking fast and fucking nasty it 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.500
 you cut ebay talweg I would have 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.430
 used and would have hit who 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.350
 I think even worse 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.800
 went out 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.080
 puma has pokemon is back there peters 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.530
 matan stones off and may there again 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.359
 easy to go where it comes from 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.150
 he immediately notices his team flies like that 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.580
 a gentle wind between tann stein and 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.950
 Thunder back and forth 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.960
 Oh look, labradors, you are too 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.880
 a flight type 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.410
 That must be shit if you suddenly 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.470
 so have a little thunder god before you 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.020

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:44.449
 and pretzel you away 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.789

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:51.449
 well so transfer is yes 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.129
 do not even see a dragon 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.349
 you are not a dragon you are only one 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.550
 the big ones fly the real thing 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.330
 purely theoretical the kite 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.750
 describes however it is relative to me 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.870
 no matter you let the sun go on we 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.349
