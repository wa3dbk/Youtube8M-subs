00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
once you get a free breaker bar that's

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.949 
once you get a free breaker bar that's
it<00:02:45.190> so<00:02:45.640> now<00:02:45.670> once<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.030> get<00:02:46.120> booked<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.690> you

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
brand-new fancy fasteners we decided to

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.460 
brand-new fancy fasteners we decided to
go<00:04:15.310> with<00:04:15.340> Moog<00:04:15.790> on<00:04:16.090> this<00:04:16.330> and<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.930> part<00:04:17.170> number

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
go with Moog on this and the part number

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.650 
go with Moog on this and the part number
for<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:18.480> 2002<00:04:19.480> is<00:04:21.150> right<00:04:22.150> there

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
for the 2002 is right there

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.910 
for the 2002 is right there
so<00:04:23.290> five<00:04:23.530> one<00:04:23.710> five<00:04:23.890> zero<00:04:24.160> five<00:04:24.550> zero<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:26.260> then

brakes<00:04:31.300> back<00:04:32.050> one<00:04:32.350> Capra<00:04:32.800> tighten<00:04:33.220> everything

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
brakes back one Capra tighten everything

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.550 
brakes back one Capra tighten everything
up<00:04:33.700> and<00:04:33.970> then<00:04:34.150> we're<00:04:34.840> gonna<00:04:34.930> go<00:04:35.140> ahead<00:04:35.200> and

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
up and then we're gonna go ahead and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.410 
up and then we're gonna go ahead and
feed<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.950> wire<00:04:36.130> up<00:04:36.400> through<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.790> frame<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:37.330> we

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
feed the wire up through the frame so we

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.660 
feed the wire up through the frame so we
can<00:04:37.450> plug<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.870> back<00:04:37.900> in<00:04:38.230> and<00:04:38.620> put<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.520> wheel

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
can plug it back in and put the wheel

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.790 
can plug it back in and put the wheel
back<00:04:39.700> on<00:04:39.930> pretty<00:04:40.930> much<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.260> can<00:04:41.410> knock<00:04:41.590> out<00:04:41.740> a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
back on pretty much you can knock out a

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.340 
back on pretty much you can knock out a
wheel<00:04:42.040> hub<00:04:42.250> bearing<00:04:42.610> on<00:04:42.850> your<00:04:43.270> Ford
