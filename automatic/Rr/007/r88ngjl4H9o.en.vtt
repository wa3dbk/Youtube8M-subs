you guys how to restore through nandroid
to<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.329> when<00:03:54.480> things<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:54.840> bad<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:55.290> would

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
to this is when things go bad you would

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.560 
to this is when things go bad you would
boot<00:03:55.650> into<00:03:55.799> recovery<00:03:56.180> using<00:03:57.180> what<00:03:57.209> i<00:03:57.329> showed

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
boot into recovery using what i showed

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.960 
boot into recovery using what i showed
you<00:03:57.600> earlier<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.430> let's<00:03:59.430> say<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> boot<00:03:59.820> loop

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
you earlier and let's say a boot loop

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.640 
you earlier and let's say a boot loop
happens<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.600> can't<00:04:00.870> get<00:04:01.079> past<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
happens and you can't get past the

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.259 
happens and you can't get past the
booting<00:04:02.160> screen<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.850> boot<00:04:03.090> into<00:04:03.150> recovery

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
booting screen you boot into recovery

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.410 
booting screen you boot into recovery
