okay so the green team are going to be
using<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.130> same<00:02:02.490> weapon<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.060> they

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
using the same weapon that they

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870 
using the same weapon that they
originally<00:02:03.990> used<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> first<00:02:04.829> round<00:02:05.130> which

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
originally used in the first round which

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.869 
originally used in the first round which
is<00:02:06.180> gravel<00:02:06.930> which<00:02:07.229> basically<00:02:07.649> makes<00:02:08.550> them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
is gravel which basically makes them

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.210 
is gravel which basically makes them
have<00:02:09.300> stones<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.110> throw<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.830> other<00:02:10.950> team

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
have stones to throw at the other team

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.979 
have stones to throw at the other team
which<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.300> probably<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> most

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
which is probably one of the most

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.760 
which is probably one of the most
effective

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
effective

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.900 
effective
happens<00:02:14.390> out<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.450> all<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.760> let's<00:02:17.760> get

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
happens out of all of them so let's get

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.810 
happens out of all of them so let's get
on<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.210> pink<00:02:18.480> team<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:19.050> had<00:02:19.400> slime<00:02:20.400> balls

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
on to the pink team they had slime balls

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.270 
on to the pink team they had slime balls
and<00:02:21.390> some<00:02:22.080> sticks<00:02:23.600> yes<00:02:24.600> sticks<00:02:25.050> basically<00:02:26.040> are

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and some sticks yes sticks basically are

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.120 
and some sticks yes sticks basically are
like<00:02:26.460> swords<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.900> slimeballs<00:02:28.620> kind<00:02:29.040> of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
like swords and the slimeballs kind of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.820 
like swords and the slimeballs kind of
make<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.430> stuck<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.120> place<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.050> make

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
make them stuck in place and like make

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.180 
make them stuck in place and like make
their<00:02:32.130> range<00:02:32.760> better<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:34.080> anyway<00:02:34.590> let's<00:02:34.920> begin

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
their range better so anyway let's begin

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.640 
their range better so anyway let's begin
the<00:02:35.730> first<00:02:36.060> round<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.670> semi-finals<00:02:38.670> and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
the first round of the semi-finals and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
the first round of the semi-finals and
of<00:02:40.650> course<00:02:40.710> let's<00:02:41.190> open<00:02:41.460> up<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.730> middle

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
of course let's open up the middle

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.090 
of course let's open up the middle
treasure<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:45.260> there's<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.320> slime<00:02:46.620> ball<00:02:46.830> there

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
treasure and there's a slime ball there

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.380 
treasure and there's a slime ball there
because<00:02:47.310> I<00:02:47.370> actually<00:02:47.490> recorded<00:02:48.060> this<00:02:48.120> once

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
because I actually recorded this once

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.390 
because I actually recorded this once
but<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.780> realize<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.320> audio<00:02:49.620> wasn't<00:02:50.010> recording

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
but I realize my audio wasn't recording

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.220 
but I realize my audio wasn't recording
so<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:51.030> pick<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.360> quickly<00:02:51.690> before<00:02:51.960> the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
so just pick that up quickly before the

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.380 
so just pick that up quickly before the
green<00:02:52.410> team<00:02:52.590> gets<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.790> they<00:02:53.910> haven't<00:02:54.090> seen

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
green team gets it but they haven't seen

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.380 
green team gets it but they haven't seen
each<00:02:54.450> other<00:02:54.720> yet<00:02:58.190> still<00:02:59.190> waiting<00:02:59.400> that<00:03:00.030> map<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
each other yet still waiting that map is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.390 
each other yet still waiting that map is
a<00:03:00.570> little<00:03:00.840> bit<00:03:00.960> bigger<00:03:01.200> than<00:03:01.380> before<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.160> it

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
a little bit bigger than before so it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.340 
a little bit bigger than before so it
will<00:03:02.700> take<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> little<00:03:03.090> bit<00:03:03.240> longer<00:03:03.480> but<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
will take a little bit longer but the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.620 
will take a little bit longer but the
Green<00:03:04.620> Team<00:03:04.860> has<00:03:04.890> begun<00:03:05.370> their<00:03:05.580> attack<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.210> the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
Green Team has begun their attack on the

Green Team has begun their attack on the
pink<00:03:07.020> as<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:08.610> can<00:03:08.730> see<00:03:08.940> the<00:03:09.060> green<00:03:09.270> team<00:03:09.480> doing

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
pink as you can see the green team doing

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.360 
pink as you can see the green team doing
what<00:03:09.870> they<00:03:09.960> normally<00:03:10.110> do<00:03:10.470> camping<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.220> their

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
what they normally do camping in their

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.450 
what they normally do camping in their
spawn<00:03:12.950> with<00:03:13.950> their<00:03:15.230> with<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.350> rocks<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:17.220> as

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
spawn with their with the rocks just as

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.510 
spawn with their with the rocks just as
a<00:03:18.420> unified<00:03:19.080> group<00:03:19.380> they<00:03:19.620> are<00:03:19.770> charging<00:03:20.250> up<00:03:20.490> the

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
a unified group they are charging up the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.800 
a unified group they are charging up the
map<00:03:20.900> taking<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.050> Pink's<00:03:22.560> as<00:03:22.830> they<00:03:23.010> go<00:03:23.810> the

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
map taking out Pink's as they go the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.780 
map taking out Pink's as they go the
pink<00:03:25.080> team<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.590> mean<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.010> green<00:03:26.220> team<00:03:26.490> are<00:03:26.700> now

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
pink team I mean the green team are now

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.190 
pink team I mean the green team are now
starting<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.300> pick<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.540> some<00:03:27.750> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> slime

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
starting to pick up some of the slime

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040 
starting to pick up some of the slime
balls

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.020 

so<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.770> green<00:03:31.950> team<00:03:32.190> will<00:03:32.310> have<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.610> power<00:03:32.820> of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
so the green team will have the power of

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.860 
so the green team will have the power of
the<00:03:33.950> pink<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.970> gravel<00:03:38.600> seems<00:03:39.600> pretty

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
the pink and the gravel seems pretty

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.970 
the pink and the gravel seems pretty
even<00:03:40.350> right<00:03:40.500> now<00:03:42.080> it<00:03:43.080> seems<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.740> Green

even right now it seems like the Green

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.790 
even right now it seems like the Green
Team<00:03:44.310> has<00:03:44.700> take<00:03:45.330> control<00:03:45.630> of<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.740> this
