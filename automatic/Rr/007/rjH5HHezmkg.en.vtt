card<00:01:38.729> reader<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
card reader and actually this is not the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.820 
card reader and actually this is not the
sim<00:01:40.470> card<00:01:40.500> reader<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> head<00:01:41.759> home

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
sim card reader but for the head home

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.190 
sim card reader but for the head home
this<00:01:43.540> import<00:01:44.540> it's<00:01:44.720> actually<00:01:44.990> here

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
this import it's actually here

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.790 
this import it's actually here
completely<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:47.180> built<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.840> can<00:01:48.020> take<00:01:48.650> it

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
completely and built so you can take it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.180 
completely and built so you can take it
also<00:01:49.130> hours<00:01:49.670> here<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.510> case<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.680> below

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
also hours here with the case so below

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.740 
also hours here with the case so below
the<00:01:52.370> battery<00:01:52.640> will<00:01:52.850> actually<00:01:53.120> find<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.540> sim

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
the battery will actually find the sim

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.300 
the battery will actually find the sim
card<00:01:53.780> reader<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.470> can<00:01:54.500> take<00:01:55.010> out<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.190> battery

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
card reader you can take out the battery

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.240 
card reader you can take out the battery
just<00:01:55.610> by<00:01:55.790> doing<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.660> then<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.230> can<00:01:57.470> pull

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
just by doing this and then you can pull

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.350 
just by doing this and then you can pull
out<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.730> SIM<00:01:58.940> card<00:01:59.180> here<00:01:59.450> which<00:01:59.600> is<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.500> micro

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
out the SIM card here which is a micro

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.210 
out the SIM card here which is a micro
sim<00:02:02.360> card<00:02:02.600> actually<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.620> need<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.890> cut<00:02:04.100> out

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
sim card actually so you need to cut out

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.620 
sim card actually so you need to cut out
your<00:02:04.310> regular<00:02:04.670> sim<00:02:04.850> card<00:02:05.030> if<00:02:05.120> you<00:02:05.150> want<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.510> use

your regular sim card if you want to use

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.780 
your regular sim card if you want to use
this<00:02:05.810> from<00:02:06.410> your<00:02:06.590> older<00:02:06.770> device<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.430> samsung

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
this from your older device the samsung

this from your older device the samsung
galaxy<00:02:07.820> s3<00:02:08.240> still<00:02:08.869> use<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> three<00:02:09.590> mini<00:02:09.800> still

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
galaxy s3 still use a three mini still

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.430 
galaxy s3 still use a three mini still
uses<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.820> standard<00:02:11.630> sim<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:12.200> this<00:02:12.350> is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
uses the standard sim but this is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.570 
uses the standard sim but this is
actually<00:02:12.730> yeah<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.880> brand<00:02:14.150> new<00:02:15.310> design<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
actually yeah the brand new design and

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.640 
actually yeah the brand new design and
it<00:02:16.970> makes<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.450> course<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.900> lot<00:02:18.050> of<00:02:18.290> sense<00:02:18.530> to

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
it makes of course a lot of sense to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.500 
it makes of course a lot of sense to
then<00:02:19.160> give<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.490> more<00:02:19.670> space<00:02:19.880> for<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.210> battery

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
then give you more space for the battery

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.180 
then give you more space for the battery
which<00:02:20.690> as<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.840> said<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.290> one<00:02:21.770> thousand<00:02:22.160> three

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
which as I said as one thousand three

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.130 
which as I said as one thousand three
hundred<00:02:22.370> milliamps<00:02:22.820> now<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> have<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:23.959> course

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
hundred milliamps now I have of course

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.870 
hundred milliamps now I have of course
the<00:02:24.230> device<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.709> which<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:24.890> running<00:02:25.700> right
