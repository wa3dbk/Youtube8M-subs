00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
was watching Mike it's like one of the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.740 
was watching Mike it's like one of the
best<00:01:59.040> it<00:02:00.030> wasn't<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.270> best<00:02:00.390> travel

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
best it wasn't the best travel

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
best it wasn't the best travel
especially<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.290> words<00:02:01.550> because<00:02:02.550> you<00:02:02.760> got<00:02:02.910> to

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
especially in words because you got to

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.110 
especially in words because you got to
get<00:02:03.120> your<00:02:03.210> place<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.570> how<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.960> one<00:02:04.560> black<00:02:04.800> horn
