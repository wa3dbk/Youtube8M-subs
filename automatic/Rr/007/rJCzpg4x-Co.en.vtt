00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799

 new account to this his tila channel 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.309
 this again how to understand a 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.309
 yucateco 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.180
 the beautiful people of the internet let's continue 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.009
 with these little lessons for 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.109
 understand a Yucatecan when he is 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.970
 trying to talk this beautiful 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.980
 combination between Mayan Spanish and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.779
 we say stupid they leave them stunned 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.220
 some people who obviously do not live 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.019
 here in the yucateca peninsula for that 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.580
 I'm leaving you these tutorials that you 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.890
 I want to make it clear and specific 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.350
 that are not Maya classes but 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 simply how we express idioms 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 of Yucatecan people how to understand 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.920
 or Yucatec as the fucking name says 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 above we start with the first 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.110
 word of today and that is the if 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.149
 effectively my friends here in 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.149
 Yucatan is not cold 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700
 usually the people who do not live 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.990
 here in yucatan and that sometimes not 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.870
 they understand what we are saying to them 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.000
 cause grace causes a bit of laughter 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.040
 as we Yucatecans we refer to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.810
 cold as the arrest could believe that it is 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.640
 the same thing but it's not a little 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.800
 different because here has come the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 Yucatec we have a humid climate and like 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.550
 the weather is humid when it is season 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.550
 of cold the cold is not any cold is 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.780
 in tf and because we say salt is 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.240
 possible simply by the humidity 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.729
 makes it penetrate everywhere and it 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.009
 hide even if you put your jacket on 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.869
 your beret with a sweatshirt put your 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.910
 little hat put your pendejada milestones 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.970
 rolled up in the neck play listen 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.100
 cold always and it will reach your body 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.869
 in men it causes his 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.490
 chicken that loves you I detest you 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.770
 as little as the turtle when 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.869
 you also have eat that's what the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.850
 frost cold cold wet that for more than 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.490
 you always get to your lung 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.580
 blessed god here in Yucatan we have 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.380
 some ancestral techniques so that you do not 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.890
 sick so you always oldies 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.080
 they say 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.729
 moneo there is the time with a little 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.050
 newspaper or cardboard below take here 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.100
 so he does not see you and after that the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.960
 lung price when 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.600
 it's going out on the street there's too much 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.910
 Roller says a towel on his head 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.770
 that if you are not going to hit her if so 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.319
 we say it is going to hit the unruly 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:20.030
 Mom name a truth according to 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.920
 word no 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.410
 is a word that we use to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.180
 refer to the one that obviously comes from 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.040
 the degradation of 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.019
 but as we do not educate us 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.390
 like to complicate things much more what 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.959
 we turn into that you have to be sincere 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.730
 the truth I have much more strength than 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.739
 He uses it most of all 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.239
 psychologist not when you want to wake up 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.189
 the baby or when you have to save 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.719
 silence but when you want to see a 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.879
 person who is saying by famed 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.799
 what do you say to your mouth 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.060
 It's that easy that simple if you want 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.060
 to silence someone instead of tele 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.650
 the other day you tell me 500 pesos to take 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.139
 if today when it is my mom has set 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.840
 next word of today for 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:08.879
 sap is a Mayan word that we use 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560
 again because of the climate we have 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.269
 here in Yucatan I do not know if I have any 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.859
 specific translation and if you know it 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.569
 write me in the comments here 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.549
 below the video of how it is told in 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.530
 your country in your state or in your place where 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.510
 is something you want to this one explained 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.790
 sanz is when something has to be 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.340
 golden and crispy like for example a 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.900
 cookie or the popcorn or the two potatoes 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.579
 but because of the humid weather here 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.250
 merida if any of those things the 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.920
 leave open getaway on the table 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.180
 a few hours that's going to be left 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.280
 to stay soft is no longer going to be 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.140
 crispy is going to stay like that with 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.200
 a rather unpleasant texture and 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.160
 also changes a little bit the taste 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.560
 then it means that your cookie 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.370
 Toast or popcorn that is not for 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.090
 example of half are your cookies 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.840
 also with me take cutest thanks 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.840
 What are you 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 the last word of today is 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.020
 youtube youtube youtube 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.720
 it effectively makes like a lens that this 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.990
 fact is a Mayan word that means 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.209
 breasts, breast, butt, and whatever you want 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.440
 say this means youtube like that 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.450
 easy to go is simple but I do 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.730
 emphasis on this word because many 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.040
 jos dreams often confuse with 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:30.300
 another Mayan word that is chichi note the 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.040
 jiji difference youtube and if I go by 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.170
 the opposite chichi is a Mayan word 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.120
 which means grandma then while 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.950
 that yoyo means your chi chi diet 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.420
 means your grandma but in some 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.400
 moment they are going to relate the two 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.230
 ships, obviously you chi chi gave 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.850
 I chuck your mom then when the baby 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.160
 is lactating then here in yucatan 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.810

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.880

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.550
