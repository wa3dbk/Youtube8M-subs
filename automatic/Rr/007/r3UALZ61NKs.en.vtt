I<00:05:42.680> was<00:05:42.889> able<00:05:43.039> to<00:05:43.310> thread<00:05:43.639> it<00:05:43.669> through<00:05:43.820> there

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
I was able to thread it through there

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.950 
I was able to thread it through there
and<00:05:44.860> it's<00:05:45.860> doubled<00:05:46.490> it's<00:05:47.090> doubled<00:05:47.570> up<00:05:47.750> and

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
and it's doubled it's doubled up and

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.430 
and it's doubled it's doubled up and
then<00:05:48.500> I<00:05:48.590> ran<00:05:48.860> it<00:05:49.070> right<00:05:49.220> down<00:05:49.630> through<00:05:50.630> the

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
then I ran it right down through the

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.980 
then I ran it right down through the
leather<00:05:51.680> thongs<00:05:52.009> here<00:05:52.520> which<00:05:52.940> are<00:05:53.150> which<00:05:53.840> are

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
leather thongs here which are which are

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.610 
leather thongs here which are which are
all<00:05:54.139> twisted<00:05:54.440> up<00:05:54.800> right<00:05:55.699> so<00:05:56.270> see<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.199> can<00:05:57.349> see

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
all twisted up right so see you can see

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.740 
all twisted up right so see you can see
it<00:05:57.770> right<00:05:57.949> down<00:05:58.190> in<00:05:58.400> there<00:05:58.720> see<00:05:59.720> that<00:05:59.960> and<00:06:01.750> so

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
it right down in there see that and so

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.379 
it right down in there see that and so
it<00:06:02.900> doesn't<00:06:03.260> really<00:06:03.349> even<00:06:03.590> show<00:06:04.039> and<00:06:04.400> now<00:06:05.330> i

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
it doesn't really even show and now i

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:08.050 
it doesn't really even show and now i
can<00:06:05.750> either<00:06:05.900> dangle<00:06:06.530> it<00:06:06.680> or<00:06:06.979> I<00:06:07.039> left<00:06:07.849> myself

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
can either dangle it or I left myself

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.230 
can either dangle it or I left myself
enough<00:06:08.479> extra<00:06:09.289> here<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:10.430> I<00:06:10.460> just<00:06:10.699> wrapped<00:06:11.060> it

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
enough extra here that I just wrapped it

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.480 
enough extra here that I just wrapped it
around<00:06:11.330> like<00:06:11.750> that<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.770> I<00:06:12.860> think<00:06:13.130> it<00:06:13.280> looks

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
around like that and I think it looks

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.270 
around like that and I think it looks
fairly<00:06:13.789> nice<00:06:14.180> and<00:06:14.599> traditional<00:06:15.229> steel<00:06:15.530> and<00:06:15.830> it

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
fairly nice and traditional steel and it

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.000 
fairly nice and traditional steel and it
basically<00:06:16.490> gives<00:06:17.090> me<00:06:17.389> a<00:06:17.419> belt<00:06:17.960> loop<00:06:18.169> if<00:06:18.409> I

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
basically gives me a belt loop if I

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.010 
basically gives me a belt loop if I
don't<00:06:19.340> want<00:06:19.669> it<00:06:19.760> to<00:06:19.820> dangle<00:06:20.180> if<00:06:20.479> I<00:06:20.630> want<00:06:20.900> it<00:06:20.990> to

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
don't want it to dangle if I want it to

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.950 
don't want it to dangle if I want it to
be<00:06:21.169> you<00:06:21.979> know<00:06:22.070> a<00:06:22.340> little<00:06:22.789> stiffer<00:06:23.389> up<00:06:23.570> on<00:06:23.750> my

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
be you know a little stiffer up on my

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.040 
be you know a little stiffer up on my
hip<00:06:24.710> which<00:06:25.400> sometimes<00:06:25.699> just<00:06:26.659> gives<00:06:26.870> you<00:06:27.020> a

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
hip which sometimes just gives you a

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.510 
hip which sometimes just gives you a
better<00:06:27.229> feeling<00:06:27.620> instead<00:06:28.099> of<00:06:28.220> having<00:06:28.370> it

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
better feeling instead of having it

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.600 
better feeling instead of having it
dangle<00:06:28.940> around<00:06:29.240> it<00:06:30.229> really<00:06:30.740> really<00:06:31.010> works<00:06:31.280> out

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
dangle around it really really works out

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.120 
dangle around it really really works out
