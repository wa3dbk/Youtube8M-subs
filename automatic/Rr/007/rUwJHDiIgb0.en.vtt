 bounce the ball once 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.590
 he then resumes in half volley this 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.490
 balloon of those who had him 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.710
 had been transmitted 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.900
 ousseni cissé who had the rebound can 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.610
 born in germany and requires the winger 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.500
 left auxerrois backward he has this balloon 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.840
 to soyaux deserved not takenaka proof of 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.939
 merits and its frames and it was in 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.990
 the goal-oriented is the first parry in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.520
 this meeting of quentin bunardeau 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.400
 to turn this ball into a corner 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.080
 the answer the auxerrois minutes the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.780
 corner so far by Auxerrois 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.250
 a corner at the ground level is returned by 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.689
 the sarthois on hood capoeira the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.070
 repair surface finds angel bard 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.200
 the manceaux have trouble getting out on 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.490
 clears directly on dennis oliech who 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.020
 can not control super gay from 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.399
 dennis oliech to attack line of 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.070
 background as with the basketball center 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.749
 very strong everything leaves us on the line 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.060
 in front of the goal of bonnardeau and that's 

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:34.229
 deviated to a corner not a sarthois 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.850
 it's a shame because if the Sartois 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.140
 deviated not in a corner just behind and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.460
 cédric anger beating on the ground no 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.230
 but some rather on the court 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640
 his 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.130
 for his central defender mamadou 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.840
 doumbia that completely changes dell who 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.370
 manages to find patrick ekeng ekeng to 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.220
 the fight with acapandié the center that 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.200
 pass the signed recovery again 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.000
 fousseyni cisse and it misses 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.400
 you it's one here that they were going 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.700
 their mother in the extension of the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.710
 vertical line of the surface of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.260
 repair at 20 meters free kick for 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.310
 the right foot of steven langil caen la 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.780
 last week he's going to share the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.790
 kicks stopped with hood it's 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.230
 not bad shot there were two heads 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.300
 auxerroises sign dennis oliech at 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.460
 penalty point it goes pretty 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.750
 largely finally joffrey cuffaut who 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.550
 had the ball in his hands that's fine 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.490
 and many a corner and not touch it 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.980
 play this corner back with as soon as the 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.110
 center second post the ball ahead 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.310
 from the head all and initiates her who 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.760
 control this dale date is half 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.440
 volley it's framed and the sorin parade 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.300
 the second attempt at who is doing 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.310
 go he has spaces dennis oliech 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.450
 he will be able to adjust his center dennis 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.720
 oliech maybe to the second pole for 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.360
 langil city ​​to scratch for captive arc 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:45.220
 the equalization of the act the equalization 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.500
 signed olivier kapo on this center that 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.140
 dennis oliech he was alone 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.480
 all alone in the penalty area 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.560
 olivier kapo and he can mark his 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.959
 second goal of the season 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.790
 in the 36th minute of play I told myself 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.010
 that there was a great shot to play on 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.870
 this overflow left side of dennis 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.950
 oliech he really had time 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.010
 to adjust his center 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.239
 he waited for the last moment aside 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.430
 left not very far from the corner post 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.080
 at the fight with acapandie center of 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.300
 the outside of the foot be careful your dough 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.030
 oh the typing signed terroir that goes to 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.950
 side goals 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.530
 yeah it was there that defender 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.239
 right side of the jsk mans fc and 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.400
 his right foot that will perform this 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.030
 throw in the game we hurry around the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.160
 second post 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.300
 here is irrigate the territory is 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.610
 the goal is rather to have to the 53rd 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.500
 minute of play the corner the free kick 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.720
 pardon shot by jason boyon and head 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.239
 2-2 believe to place this balloon under the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.630
 crossbar with balloon olive 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.910
 sorin touched unfortunately he was unable to 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.739
 than touch that balloon he could not 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.200
 deflect this balloon he could not 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.650
 prevent him from getting into the buses the aj 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.840
 auxerre 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.090
 as in the first half that is done 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.320
 pick a few minutes were going the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.380
 second free kick in blow on blow 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.450
 with boillon who had shot the last 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.910
 decisive smuggler are a few seconds to 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.489
 his roy sides also the scorer 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.940
 boillon indented for thomas who 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:16.430
 strikes the strike is countered and the goal 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.220
 the signed goal one goes the rope and to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.190
 after derrick thomas the ancient auxerrois 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.100
 even if the hit was deflected by a 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.840
 auxerrois in this case it seems to me 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.150
 that it is olive tree kapo who 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.730
 unfortunately on his line of 16 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.650
 meters and comes to touch this shot from 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.840
 frederic thomas and comes to take 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.540
 against his foot olive keeper sorin qu 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.730
 had dipped to his left and who saw 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.889
 the ball go on his right 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.560
 in the space of two minutes the 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.010
 auxerrois finds his nose on the 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.200
 score of 3 goals to a shot from 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.970
 frederic thomas to thomas even if it's 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.690
 true that without this olive deviation 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.670
 kapo and many others frédéric thomas 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.280
 Forgiveness goal and even if without this 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:04.100
 olive deviation kapo attention to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.750
 within almost turn into a nightmare with 7 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.070
 will do little kings ekeng the manceau 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.200
 which passes over the surface of 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.389
 repair 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.190
 we were on a boat to the tallec which 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.960
 take a balloon of the head and nice 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.730
 oliech the exit of Bernardo for that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.560
 boxing the ball of fists the strike 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.180
 then bouncer taking out the balloon 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.620
 fists he's out of his surface of 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.270
 repair and then an attempt to 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.600
 lob of the tallec it goes over 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.310
 goals 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.750
 he was outside his surface of 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.600
 repair when he touches the ball 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.860
 quentin beunardeau and auxerrois who 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.840
 gather around him sir 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.910
 it's just to let people know 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.530
 halle referee of this meeting ago 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.070
 a yellow card that came out against 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.570
 steven langil precisely come to protest 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.980
 he was very clearly outside of his 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.300
 repair area the goalkeeper 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.970
 sarthois when he touched the ball 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.030
 the Sarthe keeper he should have taken 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.080
 at least one yellow card 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.569
 steeven langil caen still does not come back 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.669
 to take a yellow card 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.460
 after going to tell mister us and I 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.569
 review the focus the captain went into 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.979
 game that goes out so we go and that leaves 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.509
 his place at paul george ntep then paul 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.279
 george ntep is a midfielder 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.929
 unfortunately damascus blow he has a 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:11.080
 little tendency to lose all 

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.080
 balloons 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.959
 attention two three stops the sarthois 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.639
 who have are in possession of the ball 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:18.619
 to eliminate banega the strikes to the 20 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.110
 meters the sorin parry to get out this 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:23.449
 ball in corner right that had 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.819
 eliminated banega takes support of midway 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.430
 always hitting it passes over 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:29.509
 second shot after blow for the 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.849
 sarthois in this encounter he saw 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.529
 55 minutes pretty balanced in 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.089
 the whole and then the auxerrois who 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:37.639
 are really been ko who are maybe going 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.469
 take a fourth there with a head to 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.740
 second post fousseyni cissé for 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:45.769
 take a center come from the right the 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.689
 also athletic defense manceau was 

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:49.279
 strong this kick stopped they 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:51.319
 could really create a danger on 

00:06:49.279 --> 00:06:53.240
 this phase of the game and was sure 

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.529
 this second day on this phase of play 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.939
 we took a second goal and we 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.240
 was not far from 4 at the moment 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:58.240
 knocking
