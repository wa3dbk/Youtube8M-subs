00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 and well hi friends is that the pawn 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.160
 jauzion find themselves for a new 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.410
 video on fifa 15 we can say that like 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 that even if it's not going to be on the game that 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.710
 is going to be the presentation of the fifteen 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.570
 new maps legend since lo 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.370
 they were revealed with the stats I 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.599
 will even show you the game statins 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 you guys are going to wonder 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.480
 how did I do not I went on 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.930
 internet and I can find them on 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.699
 a website 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.080
 So here you go to see the stats 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.400
 in-game so I invite you to do some 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 short breaks so we'll start from 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.939
 player in the lowest overall rating 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.099
 to the highest so among the 15 of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.050
 the legend so here is baldÃ© rama so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.399
 it's the one with the lowest rating 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.630
 which 86 of general so I would like 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.430
 really invite you to take breaks 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.719
 to read the stats and to read and its 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.100
 lands at the tuque the game statins 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.480
 because I will not read them to you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.309
 are big enough to read and that would be 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 a bit of a pity that will not help anything 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.219
 you read if you are really 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 interested in a player just breaks 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.730
 and then you will see everything in detail 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.710
 so then we continue with andreas 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.960
 brehme so here he will have five stars 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.550
 bad foot there will be very beautiful 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.850
 stats and it's really not bad because 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.809
 that they really emphasized the side 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.340
 defense on these fifteen news 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.530
 legends because we have on the first 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.579
 on fifa xiv did not like a lot of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.680
 legends and now there will be 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.420
 much more than before 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.070
 then we have a lot of cats that's the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.510
 only who will have the five stars of gesture 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.950
 technical among the new legends 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 frankly not bad we can put it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.270
 with and unique and it'll be something of 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 phew finally we'll see that of course so 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.780
 here are the statins game I invite you 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.850
 really have a little break for 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.380
 see all this in detail if you are 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750
 really interested then one in brian 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.820
 may to the group the norwegian 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 No, it's Danish, Danish, sorry 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.659
 excuse me excuse me I got 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
 deceived so that's what I want too 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.229
 do it like video guys this is the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.579
 video how to connect to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 the web application et cetera because he 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.869
 are a lot of people who have me 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.790
 request 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.740
 so I'm going to do that to myself and in my opinion 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.899
 the web application will come out late 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.310
 week so why not Friday I 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.630
 do not know that I'll hold you of course 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 aware on social networks like 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.829
 so usually why not end of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.450
 week because it's the last timo 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.009
 the one that came out on was 14 so 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.939
 really to follow so I'll be fine 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.790
 obviously aware 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.329
 so I already put the link of the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.640
 web applications in description 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.810
 the look and roberto carlos cons 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.549
 there I invite you really affair pose 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.469
 about statinas game by roberto carlos 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.000
 it's a brothel watching nothing but his 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.810
 card it's a mess it's a mess 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.209
 left defender 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.500
 wow there is no red there is no red 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.009
 look it's a phew thing it's a 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440
 crazy thing 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.700
 so yeah 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.470
 the web application the link is in the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.580
 description is normally tomorrow I 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.440
 make a video how to connect 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.880
 web applications 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.110
 pascal who asked me and so it's 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.660
 I 'm doing a little tutorial here it's going to be 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.250
 a tutorial so there we have right in who will 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.890
 have stages like this he just has a 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.450
 red stat or two really sorry 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.010
 very nice stats plus a very beautiful 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.660
 of two physics so frankly there is 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.440
 really way to have fun with 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.210
 these new legends 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.370
 certainly it will cost quite a lot so there 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.140
 the second brother lahoud group is going 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.820
 to be expensive enough 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.470
 after maybe the price is going to be a 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.060
 little less high since we are not going to 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.800
 buy credit denying any case there are 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.880
 he tried to limit all that, even though 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.740
 I think there are some who will arrive at 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.390
 to fight for anyway we go 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.920
 try with the fifa fists of 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.570
 legendary shopping chopper in a 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.060
 pact has of course the french laurent 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.550
 white we waited all zidane but well 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.960
 sure the license costs a bit too much on 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.890
 not going to talk about it we're not going to talk about 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.060
 angry subjects 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.620
 is not it seriously we're going 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.840
 try easter is a legend that 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.100
 would be a thing of whew frankly that's it 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.960
 I could not there a last since 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.060
 I was most of the time on play3 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.640
 so it was quite difficult to catch 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.830
 caption on ps3 wii that's clear 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.030
 no but seriously yeah if we 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.980
 could not that people who would not be 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.330
 wrong this from the beginning of the game that's it in 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.590
 the group acknowledged that I will do 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.820
 because that I do not know if I wanted 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.440
 already said but I'm going to do a very very 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.000
 big pack opening right out of the game 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.010
 there are some who still have not understood 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.230
 in fact we will be able to connect to 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.270
 the web application before the game so 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.330
 if you have already created an original account 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.250
 a month before the release of the game where I 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.540
 there is something like that I know more 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.190
 exactly when but in any case if 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.350
 you played at a wire 14 normally 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.790
 log in with your account on 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.180
 the web application and then you go 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.370
 power 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.470
 I began to make a team with 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.090
 the starter packs before the game 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.470
 be out here I hope I was 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.640
 pretty clear in his explanations there 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.870
 after that it's something you 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.030
 did not understand come see me in the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.870
 description the look wallahi the ten 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.640
 red hues that's because it's a 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.709
 guardian he will not put him 90 in 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 attack that's clear a quack had for 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.330
 best he could score goal 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.290
 quiet after there is stojkov so I 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.820
 do not know if I took it correctly 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.650
 he also has pretty good stats 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.900
 he has four stars of bad foot and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.280
 really look very nice stats from 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.769
 stable work it's a shame he has a 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.780
 loincloth very very nationality nationality 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.019
 very well known but we can place it 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.580
 with others the gendarmes analysts 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.710
 not very expensive but maybe if 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.330
 still with 1 90-2 general in all 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.000
 case here we come to the front 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.470
 last people so franco baresi there 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.370
 I take a shitty accent while 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.530
 these franco baresi 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.270
 it's Italian Milanese so here we go 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.949
 there are also very very nice stats and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.990
 to finish the gambas see our friend 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.919
 franz beckenbauer so frankly we 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.569
 can be a little hinge 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.210
 maldini beckenbauer i think yara 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.860
 which clearly passing after I know that 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.210
 if you do not have goscinny credits 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.479
 Kabul it will also do that this is 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.150
 clear 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.979
 so here is beckenbauer who is going to be a 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.060
 very very good player too so the 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.530
 I hope this little video 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.849
 you will have liked it's a bit the same 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.919
 principle of videos that I had done with 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.360
 the top 50 players out of 15 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.979
 years ago I wanted you 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.240
 present the new maps of 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.860
 legend so I hope it will have you 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.000
 more guys these little news so 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.199
 frankly take breaks on the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.069
 statins game if you want to see everything 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.840

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.550
 do not forget the little lake that makes 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.229
 always pleasure shared the life of with
