00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
playing or something now I'll do plan on

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.670

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
trying to do some videos as soon as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
trying to do some videos as soon as
possible<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.280> unlike<00:01:11.520> tutorial<00:01:12.060> stuff

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
possible it was unlike tutorial stuff

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
possible it was unlike tutorial stuff
because<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.439> you've<00:01:13.920> never<00:01:14.070> played<00:01:14.220> minecraft

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
because if you've never played minecraft

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.280 
because if you've never played minecraft
and<00:01:15.000> you've<00:01:15.090> used<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.900> an<00:01:16.049> Xbox

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and you've used the like an Xbox

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.660 
and you've used the like an Xbox
controller<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:17.159> quite<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> bit<00:01:17.549> different

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
controller it's quite a bit different

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.160 
controller it's quite a bit different
than<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> would<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.960> like

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
than what you would think of like

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.520 
than what you would think of like
playing<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> pc<00:01:20.790> version<00:01:20.820> obviously

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
playing for the pc version obviously

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.450 
playing for the pc version obviously
it's<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.130> different

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's just a little bit different

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.219 
it's just a little bit different
obviously<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.970> I'll<00:01:24.060> do<00:01:24.180> some<00:01:24.420> tutorials<00:01:24.659> on

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
obviously so I'll do some tutorials on

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
obviously so I'll do some tutorials on
how<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.680> works<00:01:25.830> how<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.369> functions

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
how it actually works how it functions

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.910 
how it actually works how it functions
and<00:01:27.290> one<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.470> things<00:01:28.530> I'm<00:01:28.829> looking

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

and one of the things I'm looking
forward<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.369> most<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.030> entire<00:01:30.270> thing

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.690 
and so you know just trying to keep it
going<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.110> too<00:02:07.170> much<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> haven't

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
going is way too much that I haven't

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.010 
going is way too much that I haven't
been<00:02:08.879> able<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.539> don't<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.810> time

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
been able to do I just don't have time

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.430 
been able to do I just don't have time
for

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
for

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.680 
for
so<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.460> is<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.910> allow<00:02:12.180> him<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.540> able

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
so this is going to allow him to be able

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.350 
so this is going to allow him to be able
to<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.050> becoming<00:02:13.560> kind<00:02:13.710> of<00:02:13.800> cool<00:02:14.330> now<00:02:15.330> I
