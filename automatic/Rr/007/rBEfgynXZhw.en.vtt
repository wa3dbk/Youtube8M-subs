friends with a lot of people snipe but
just<00:01:07.350> ah<00:01:07.740> black<00:01:08.369> ops<00:01:08.549> 2<00:01:08.760> sniping<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> pretty

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
just ah black ops 2 sniping is a pretty

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.359 
just ah black ops 2 sniping is a pretty
ridiculous<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.619> one-shot<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:11.220> pretty

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
ridiculous it's a one-shot from pretty

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330 
ridiculous it's a one-shot from pretty
much<00:01:11.460> anywhere<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> DSR<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.340> everybody

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
much anywhere with the DSR and everybody

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.600 
much anywhere with the DSR and everybody
uses<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> DSR<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:16.130> that's<00:01:17.130> definitely<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
uses the DSR so that's definitely a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.960 
uses the DSR so that's definitely a
problem<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.180> my<00:01:18.390> opinion<00:01:22.580> okay<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> were

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
problem in my opinion okay you were

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
problem in my opinion okay you were
lagging<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:25.070> probably<00:01:26.070> why<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
lagging so it's probably why you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.140 
lagging so it's probably why you
couldn't<00:01:26.610> move<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.180> some<00:01:27.360> reason<00:01:28.909> did<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.000> get

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
people were asking about my sensitivity

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.260 
people were asking about my sensitivity
in<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:12.890> game<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.220> am<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.550> an<00:02:13.700> eight<00:02:13.910> which<00:02:14.210> is

in this game I am on an eight which is
very<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:14.930> low<00:02:15.460> basically<00:02:16.460> in<00:02:16.550> any<00:02:16.670> college

and<00:02:26.450> every<00:02:26.660> game<00:02:26.810> before<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.410> play<00:02:27.710> on

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
and every game before that I play on

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.380 
and every game before that I play on
four<00:02:28.190> basically<00:02:28.610> that's<00:02:28.940> just<00:02:29.030> what<00:02:29.360> I

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
four basically that's just what I

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.340 
four basically that's just what I
normally<00:02:29.480> do<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.520> lower<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:32.350> okay

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
normally do I think the lower this okay

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.330 
normally do I think the lower this okay
I<00:02:33.380> can<00:02:33.590> talk<00:02:33.770> about<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.010> but<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.130> think<00:02:34.220> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
I can talk about it but I think the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.080 
I can talk about it but I think the
lower<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.730> sensitivity<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.900> it's<00:02:36.440> gonna<00:02:36.620> be

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
lower the sensitivity the it's gonna be

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.060 
lower the sensitivity the it's gonna be
I'm<00:02:38.090> gonna<00:02:38.150> jump<00:02:38.420> down<00:02:38.709> please<00:02:39.709> don't<00:02:39.950> follow

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
I'm gonna jump down please don't follow

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.880 
I'm gonna jump down please don't follow
me<00:02:40.190> out<00:02:41.830> he's<00:02:42.830> behind<00:02:42.950> me<00:02:44.590> yeah<00:02:45.620> there's

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
me out he's behind me yeah there's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.870 
me out he's behind me yeah there's
nothing<00:02:46.100> enjoyed<00:02:46.400> there<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.400> corner

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
nothing enjoyed there in that corner

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.840 
nothing enjoyed there in that corner
oh<00:02:52.990> well<00:02:53.990> but<00:02:54.620> I<00:02:54.800> was<00:02:55.100> it's<00:02:55.250> talking<00:02:55.370> about<00:02:55.610> oh

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
oh well but I was it's talking about oh

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.360 
oh well but I was it's talking about oh
yeah<00:02:56.420> lower<00:02:56.900> sensitivity<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.620> think<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.070> for<00:02:58.220> me

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
yeah lower sensitivity I think it for me

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.800 
yeah lower sensitivity I think it for me
personally<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:59.030> think<00:02:59.390> it's<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.540> little<00:02:59.630> bit

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
personally I think it's a little bit

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.420 
personally I think it's a little bit
easier<00:03:00.260> to<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.680> know<00:03:00.800> get<00:03:01.040> your<00:03:01.160> throwing

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
easier to you know get your throwing

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.390 
easier to you know get your throwing
knives<00:03:01.640> on<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.120> combat<00:03:02.450> axes<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:02.840> tomahawks

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
knives on and combat axes and tomahawks

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.979 
knives on and combat axes and tomahawks
especially<00:03:04.400> in<00:03:04.459> black<00:03:04.550> ops<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.970> I<00:03:05.209> have<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.780> lot

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
especially in black ops you I have a lot

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.960 
especially in black ops you I have a lot
of<00:03:06.019> friends<00:03:06.320> who<00:03:06.440> play<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.709> 14<00:03:07.400> sensitivity<00:03:07.880> we

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
of friends who play on 14 sensitivity we

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.880 
of friends who play on 14 sensitivity we
just<00:03:08.120> maxed<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.570> game<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.080> I<00:03:09.500> say<00:03:09.709> this

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
talk about how hard it is to hit combat

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.090 
talk about how hard it is to hit combat
axes<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.850> how<00:03:14.290> annoying<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.530> is<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.800> that<00:03:15.920> it

game<00:03:18.769> they're<00:03:19.370> actually<00:03:19.610> okay

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
game they're actually okay

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.170 
game they're actually okay
and<00:03:21.290> I<00:03:21.500> tell<00:03:21.709> them<00:03:21.890> just<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.400> try<00:03:22.760> turning

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
and I tell them just to try turning

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.449 
and I tell them just to try turning
their<00:03:23.300> sensitivity<00:03:23.810> a<00:03:24.050> bit<00:03:24.380> lower<00:03:24.739> but<00:03:25.190> then

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
their sensitivity a bit lower but then

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.460 
their sensitivity a bit lower but then
they<00:03:26.269> don't<00:03:26.450> want<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.810> because<00:03:27.170> they<00:03:27.410> think

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
they don't want to because they think

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.880 
they don't want to because they think
I'm<00:03:27.769> crazy<00:03:27.920> but<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.870> don't<00:03:29.870> know<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.380> played<00:03:30.769> on

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
I'm crazy but I don't know I I played on

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.920 
I'm crazy but I don't know I I played on
I<00:03:31.220> used<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.519> play<00:03:31.670> on<00:03:31.700> 14<00:03:32.239> which<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.630> max

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
I used to play on 14 which is the max

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.890 
I used to play on 14 which is the max
and<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.620> used<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.980> play<00:03:34.130> on<00:03:34.160> 10<00:03:34.550> and<00:03:34.850> then<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.570> kind

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
and I used to play on 10 and then I kind

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.630 
and I used to play on 10 and then I kind
of<00:03:35.930> realized<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.680> just<00:03:36.769> wasn't<00:03:37.400> hitting

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
of realized that I just wasn't hitting

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.430 
of realized that I just wasn't hitting
them<00:03:37.940> a<00:03:38.060> lot<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.390> my<00:03:38.480> combat<00:03:38.690> axes<00:03:39.110> in<00:03:39.260> black

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
them a lot of my combat axes in black

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.840 
them a lot of my combat axes in black
ops<00:03:39.620> II<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.160> just<00:03:40.370> turned<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.610> down<00:03:40.670> a<00:03:40.730> little

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
ops II so I just turned it down a little

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.850 
ops II so I just turned it down a little
bit<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.209> I'm<00:03:41.450> pretty<00:03:41.900> good<00:03:42.170> at<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.320> now<00:03:42.440> so

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
bit and I'm pretty good at it now so

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.710 
bit and I'm pretty good at it now so
you're<00:03:43.550> gonna<00:03:43.640> stick<00:03:43.940> with<00:03:44.060> eight<00:03:44.330> right<00:03:44.690> now

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
you're gonna stick with eight right now

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.400 
you're gonna stick with eight right now
so<00:03:45.140> that's<00:03:45.440> just<00:03:45.620> one<00:03:45.830> I'm<00:03:45.920> comfortable<00:03:46.280> with

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
so that's just one I'm comfortable with

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.210 
so that's just one I'm comfortable with
but<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.220> final<00:03:49.489> realms<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.330> think

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
but here is the final realms I think

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.310 
but here is the final realms I think
yeah<00:03:52.220> I<00:03:52.459> don't<00:03:52.760> know<00:03:52.850> if<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.330> do<00:03:53.390> well<00:03:53.690> then<00:03:54.050> it's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
yeah I don't know if I do well then it's
