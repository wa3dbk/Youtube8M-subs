irrigation<00:02:18.269> pipe<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.349> back<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
irrigation pipe and back in the I

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.000 
irrigation pipe and back in the I
suppose<00:02:20.489> 30s<00:02:20.939> and<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.209> know<00:02:21.269> in<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> 40s<00:02:22.010> they

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
suppose 30s and I know in the 40s they

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.880 
suppose 30s and I know in the 40s they
used<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.340> lot<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.579> wooden<00:02:23.879> pipe<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.799> you<00:02:25.799> know

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
used a lot of wooden pipe and you know

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.619 
used a lot of wooden pipe and you know
there<00:02:26.040> must<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.310> boat<00:02:26.579> I'd<00:02:26.790> love<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.209> know

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
there must have boat I'd love to know

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.750 
there must have boat I'd love to know
the<00:02:27.780> history<00:02:28.140> on<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.439> factory<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.189> see

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the history on the factory and see

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.160 
the history on the factory and see
pictures<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.209> stuff<00:02:30.569> before<00:02:30.689> they<00:02:30.959> built

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
pictures and stuff before they built

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.099 
pictures and stuff before they built
this<00:02:31.349> stuff<00:02:31.560> because<00:02:31.920> these<00:02:32.720> these<00:02:33.720> staves

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
this stuff because these these staves

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.880 
this stuff because these these staves
are<00:02:36.620> planed

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
are planed

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.000 
are planed
on<00:02:38.430> each<00:02:38.879> side<00:02:39.180> at<00:02:39.659> an<00:02:39.840> angle<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.620> that<00:02:40.650> when

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
on each side at an angle so that when

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.050 
on each side at an angle so that when
you<00:02:41.159> fit<00:02:41.400> them<00:02:41.689> side<00:02:42.689> to<00:02:43.019> side<00:02:43.260> they<00:02:44.220> form<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
you fit them side to side they form a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.710 
you fit them side to side they form a
circle<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:46.319> form<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:46.889> like<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.720> wooden

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
circle they form like a like a wooden

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.430 
circle they form like a like a wooden
barrel<00:02:49.459> wood<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:53.720> then<00:02:54.720> they're<00:02:54.930> wrapped

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
barrel wood and then they're wrapped

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.970 
barrel wood and then they're wrapped
with<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:55.950> wire<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.819> then<00:02:57.780> on<00:02:58.079> each<00:02:58.260> end<00:02:58.590> the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
with that wire and then on each end the

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.729 
with that wire and then on each end the
wire<00:02:59.189> is<00:02:59.639> wrapped<00:03:00.269> several<00:03:00.900> times<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.590> can

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
wire is wrapped several times you can

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.250 
wire is wrapped several times you can
see<00:03:01.950> here<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.670> then<00:03:04.849> they're<00:03:05.849> held<00:03:06.329> in<00:03:06.569> that's

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
see here and then they're held in that's

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.069 
see here and then they're held in that's
that's<00:03:07.620> nailed<00:03:07.889> down<00:03:08.129> by<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.720> staple<00:03:09.720> which<00:03:09.930> you

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
that's nailed down by a staple which you

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.649 
that's nailed down by a staple which you
can<00:03:10.260> see<00:03:10.439> right<00:03:10.470> there<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.389> has

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
can see right there and this one has

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.890 
can see right there and this one has
come<00:03:15.959> loose<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.439> staple<00:03:16.859> had<00:03:17.010> come<00:03:17.280> loose<00:03:17.900> but

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
come loose to staple had come loose but

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.089 
come loose to staple had come loose but
the<00:03:19.799> deal<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.540> these<00:03:21.540> orchards<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.379> had<00:03:22.980> to

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
the deal was these orchards and had to

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.830 
the deal was these orchards and had to
have<00:03:23.190> water<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.760> they'd<00:03:23.879> run<00:03:24.030> water<00:03:24.269> from<00:03:24.750> the

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
have water and they'd run water from the

have water and they'd run water from the
mountains<00:03:25.199> and<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.530> streams<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.430> build

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
mountains and the streams and build

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.270 
mountains and the streams and build
boxes<00:03:27.629> or<00:03:28.139> Weir's<00:03:28.440> whatever<00:03:28.919> they're<00:03:29.040> called

and then divert water into these pipes

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.339 
and then divert water into these pipes
run<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.099> pipelines<00:03:32.549> down<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:34.019> form<00:03:34.260> an

irrigation system and orchards would

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.390 
irrigation system and orchards would
take<00:03:36.209> water<00:03:36.510> out<00:03:37.169> of<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.680> system<00:03:38.099> along<00:03:38.340> the

way with the spill water going back into
the<00:03:42.859> creeks<00:03:43.859> down<00:03:44.190> here<00:03:44.489> that<00:03:44.729> goes<00:03:44.909> down<00:03:45.709> this

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the creeks down here that goes down this

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:53.809 
the creeks down here that goes down this
may<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:48.060> main<00:03:48.269> canyon<00:03:48.810> down<00:03:49.019> there<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:52.819> they

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.420 
as long as you had water in that pipe it
wouldn't<00:04:30.930> leak<00:04:31.080> because<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.650> cedar<00:04:31.979> would

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
wouldn't leak because that cedar would

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.950 
wouldn't leak because that cedar would
swell<00:04:32.880> up<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.330> make<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.660> tight<00:04:33.930> seal<00:04:34.199> and

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
swell up and make a tight seal and

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.920 
swell up and make a tight seal and
that's<00:04:36.960> my<00:04:37.229> that's<00:04:38.130> my<00:04:38.250> story<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:39.180> today<00:04:39.449> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930
