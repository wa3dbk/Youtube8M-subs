and then go in with that blue cord all
the<00:00:42.840> way<00:00:43.020> over<00:00:43.320> its<00:00:43.469> own<00:00:43.649> ring<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.329> then<00:00:45.329> going

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the way over its own ring and then going

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.060 
the way over its own ring and then going
out<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.469> through<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:49.710> way<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
out here and through this way so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.420 
out here and through this way so
clockwise<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.539> black<00:00:51.809> bead<00:00:52.020> cord<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.649> go

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
clockwise this black bead cord here go

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.500 
clockwise this black bead cord here go
back<00:00:53.699> over<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.870> same<00:00:55.140> ring<00:00:55.440> then<00:00:56.430> again<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
back over the same ring then again this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.779 
back over the same ring then again this
blue<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> code<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.340> through<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
blue bit of code here only go through it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.529 
blue bit of code here only go through it
clockwise<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:01.949> through<00:01:02.370> grab<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.510> like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
clockwise the back through grab it like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.920 
clockwise the back through grab it like
that<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.270> back<00:01:06.479> over<00:01:06.659> again

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
that is then going to go back over again

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.370 
that is then going to go back over again
and<00:01:07.350> then<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.220> final<00:01:08.909> move<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.869> series

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and then the final move of this series

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.740 
and then the final move of this series
again<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> know<00:01:11.549> we're<00:01:11.729> solving<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.390> yet

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
again you know we're solving it yet

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.060 
again you know we're solving it yet
this<00:01:13.110> cord<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.680> come<00:01:13.860> up

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this cord is going to come up

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
this cord is going to come up
anti-clockwise<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.659> through<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.930> black

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
anti-clockwise up and through this black

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.370 
anti-clockwise up and through this black
cord<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.759> watch<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.960> through

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cord here again just watch up through

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.760 
cord here again just watch up through
there<00:01:20.509> and<00:01:21.509> pull<00:01:22.250> it<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.470> next

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
there and pull it is that this next

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.399 
there and pull it is that this next
movement<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.390> where<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.540> where<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.080> slack

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
movement here where you where the slack

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.499 
movement here where you where the slack
of<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.619> strings<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.189> absolute<00:01:29.729> limit<00:01:30.090> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of the strings it's absolute limit and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
of the strings it's absolute limit and
it<00:01:30.630> gets<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:30.930> slack<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.530> as<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.770> put<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
it gets much slack on it as I can put it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.100 
it gets much slack on it as I can put it
up<00:01:32.880> through<00:01:33.119> there<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> right

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
up through there get it in the right

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.760 
up through there get it in the right
position

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
position

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.450 
position
pull<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.490> over<00:01:36.259> still<00:01:37.259> Unknowing<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.040> solving

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
pull it over still Unknowing is solving

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.550 
pull it over still Unknowing is solving
it<00:01:39.950> okay<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> position<00:01:41.640> I've<00:01:41.759> got<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.119> now

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
it okay so the position I've got to now

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.580 
it okay so the position I've got to now
should<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.659> pops<00:01:46.320> out

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
should be so this bit here just pops out

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.270 
should be so this bit here just pops out
you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.729> check<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.890> that<00:01:49.890> position

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
and then again I've got this bit of

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.490 
and then again I've got this bit of
black<00:02:31.500> cord<00:02:31.799> here<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.480> go<00:02:33.629> clockwise<00:02:33.989> through

it<00:02:34.879> over<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:35.970> top<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:39.200> like<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.849> again

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
it over the top and out like that again

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.300 
it over the top and out like that again
we're<00:02:42.450> still<00:02:42.720> not<00:02:42.900> done<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.739> should<00:02:43.799> be<00:02:44.129> at<00:02:44.220> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
we're still not done we should be at the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.809 
we're still not done we should be at the
next<00:02:44.459> stage<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.049> I'm<00:02:46.260> unravel<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.160> let<00:02:47.700> it

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
next stage so as I'm unravel it let it

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.770 
next stage so as I'm unravel it let it
fall<00:02:48.000> into<00:02:48.180> its<00:02:48.420> position<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
fall into its position that is a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.009 
fall into its position that is a
position<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:58.349> should<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.890> at

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
position that you should now be at

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.949 
position that you should now be at
you've<00:03:01.019> got<00:03:01.049> these<00:03:01.349> two<00:03:01.620> connected<00:03:02.099> here

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
you've got these two connected here

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.319 
you've got these two connected here
you've<00:03:03.959> got<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.349> bit<00:03:04.730> falling<00:03:05.730> off<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:06.150> want

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
you've got this bit falling off you want

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.210 
you've got this bit falling off you want
to<00:03:06.390> be<00:03:06.450> in<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:06.660> position<00:03:06.810> there<00:03:07.260> now<00:03:08.160> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
to be in that position there now to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.910 
to be in that position there now to
solve<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.180> again<00:03:10.079> relatively<00:03:10.680> simple

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
solve it again relatively simple

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.800 
solve it again relatively simple
compared<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.549> rest<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.970> you<00:03:12.180> want<00:03:12.690> to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
compared to the rest of it you want to

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.650 
compared to the rest of it you want to
pull<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.019> blue<00:03:13.349> cord<00:03:13.650> there<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:15.510> you're

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
pull that blue cord there and you're

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.430 
pull that blue cord there and you're
going<00:03:15.870> over<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.170> top<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:17.370> you're<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.640> part<00:03:17.970> 1

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
going over the top then you're a part 1

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.930 
going over the top then you're a part 1

it we're back looks pretty easy simple

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.020 
it we're back looks pretty easy simple
enough<00:06:17.090> to<00:06:17.300> look<00:06:17.840> at<00:06:18.020> but<00:06:18.620> that<00:06:18.650> is<00:06:19.370> extreme

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
enough to look at but that is extreme

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.479 
enough to look at but that is extreme
