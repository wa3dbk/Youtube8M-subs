00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.920 

I<00:00:04.290> have<00:00:05.290> a<00:00:05.320> static<00:00:05.859> line<00:00:06.130> attached<00:00:06.970> to<00:00:07.180> my<00:00:07.690> back

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
I have a static line attached to my back

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.339 
I have a static line attached to my back
and<00:00:08.640> then<00:00:09.640> on<00:00:10.059> an<00:00:10.210> action<00:00:10.510> I<00:00:10.630> have<00:00:10.750> to<00:00:10.870> jump<00:00:11.140> out

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:11.349 
and then on an action I have to jump out

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.129 
and then on an action I have to jump out
almost<00:00:11.710> like<00:00:12.129> a<00:00:12.429> swan<00:00:12.790> dive<00:00:13.000> until<00:00:13.629> the<00:00:13.960> line

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
almost like a swan dive until the line

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.720 
almost like a swan dive until the line
catches<00:00:14.650> me<00:00:14.769> up<00:00:14.860> and<00:00:15.040> then<00:00:15.129> just<00:00:15.370> do<00:00:15.429> a<00:00:15.459> giant

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
catches me up and then just do a giant

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:37.870 
catches me up and then just do a giant
pendulum<00:00:16.180> burden<00:00:16.540> ether<00:00:16.750> arakata

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.360 

that<00:00:38.390> was<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.570> hell<00:00:38.840> of<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:39.050> pendulum<00:00:39.380> that<00:00:40.250> was

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
that was a hell of a pendulum that was

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.040 
that was a hell of a pendulum that was
going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.610> take<00:00:40.790> me<00:00:40.940> back<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.690> where<00:00:41.840> I<00:00:41.870> just

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
going to take me back to where I just

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.160 
going to take me back to where I just
came<00:00:42.410> from<00:00:42.470> so<00:00:43.310> as<00:00:43.610> I<00:00:43.820> as<00:00:44.480> I<00:00:44.600> hit<00:00:44.810> the<00:00:44.900> bottom<00:00:45.110> of

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
came from so as I as I hit the bottom of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.950 
came from so as I as I hit the bottom of
the<00:00:45.260> pendulum<00:00:45.740> the<00:00:46.430> pile<00:00:47.150> that<00:00:47.360> just<00:00:47.570> took<00:00:47.750> all

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the pendulum the pile that just took all

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.630 
the pendulum the pile that just took all
my<00:00:47.990> momentum<00:00:48.590> out<00:00:48.770> and<00:00:48.980> then<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.310> swung<00:00:49.490> me

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
my momentum out and then just swung me

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.220 
my momentum out and then just swung me
around

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
around

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.420 
around
that's<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.650> one<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.070> I've<00:00:53.160> never

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that's something one that I've never

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
that's something one that I've never
really<00:00:53.760> seen<00:00:53.970> done<00:00:54.270> before<00:00:54.300> until<00:00:55.080> you<00:00:55.590> know

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
really seen done before until you know

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.280 
really seen done before until you know
I've<00:00:55.950> never<00:00:56.250> done<00:00:56.400> anything<00:00:57.060> quite<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.990> hairy

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
I've never done anything quite as hairy

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.950 
I've never done anything quite as hairy
as<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.860> it's<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.450> you<00:01:00.450> jumping<00:01:00.840> into

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as that it's because you jumping into

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.990 
as that it's because you jumping into
the<00:01:01.110> unknown<00:01:04.370> that's<00:01:05.370> the<00:01:05.520> closest<00:01:05.880> I've

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the unknown that's the closest I've

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
the unknown that's the closest I've
actually<00:01:06.180> felt<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.720> plague<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
actually felt a plague but you get the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.719 
actually felt a plague but you get the
wind<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.890> your<00:01:07.920> hair<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> everything<00:01:08.460> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
wind in your hair and everything and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.460 
wind in your hair and everything and
it's<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> rush

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.830 

and<00:01:13.340> we<00:01:13.460> were<00:01:13.580> recording<00:01:14.180> all<00:01:14.270> of<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:14.570> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
and we were recording all of this to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.080 
and we were recording all of this to
look<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.380> know<00:01:15.500> when<00:01:15.920> Batman<00:01:16.160> does<00:01:16.580> do<00:01:16.730> a<00:01:16.760> jump

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
look you know when Batman does do a jump

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.680 
look you know when Batman does do a jump

how<00:01:17.990> would<00:01:18.050> he<00:01:18.290> drop<00:01:18.470> how<00:01:18.710> would<00:01:18.890> he<00:01:18.980> fly<00:01:19.130> how

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
how would he drop how would he fly how

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.969 
how would he drop how would he fly how
would<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.670> work

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.430 

at<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> end<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> day<00:01:23.760> the<00:01:24.510> bureaucratic

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
difficulties of filming in a major city

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.010 
difficulties of filming in a major city
with<00:01:28.229> helicopters<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.880> stunt<00:01:30.270> for

with helicopters to do that stunt for
real<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.470> location<00:01:31.979> proved<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.729> B<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
real on location proved just B to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.359 
real on location proved just B to
impossible<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.440> with<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> restricted<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.220> the

impossible and with a restricted all the
other<00:01:35.790> things<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.210> were<00:01:36.299> trying<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.780> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
other things we were trying to do in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.030 
other things we were trying to do in
Hong<00:01:37.140> Kong<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.840> wound<00:01:40.080> up<00:01:40.259> adopting<00:01:40.770> visual

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
Hong Kong so we wound up adopting visual

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
Hong Kong so we wound up adopting visual
effects<00:01:41.310> approach<00:01:41.759> instead<00:01:42.149> for<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> what

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
effects approach instead for that what

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
effects approach instead for that what
we<00:01:43.710> basically<00:01:43.890> did<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:44.790> shot<00:01:45.060> IMAX

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
we basically did was that we shot IMAX

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.230 
we basically did was that we shot IMAX
tiles<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.380> digital<00:01:46.890> stills<00:01:47.190> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.060> whole

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
tiles and digital stills of the whole

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.630 
tiles and digital stills of the whole
landscape<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.170> Hong<00:01:49.380> Kong<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.130> having<00:01:50.430> shot

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
landscape of Hong Kong and having shot

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
landscape of Hong Kong and having shot
those<00:01:50.940> we<00:01:51.300> then<00:01:51.509> went<00:01:51.990> back<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.409> Coddington

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
those we then went back to Coddington

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040 
those we then went back to Coddington
and<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.580> built<00:01:53.820> an<00:01:53.940> enormous<00:01:54.090> green<00:01:54.479> screen<00:01:54.840> an

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
and we built an enormous green screen an

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.810 
and we built an enormous green screen an
enormous<00:01:55.410> green<00:01:55.619> screen<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.039> pare<00:01:56.250> back<00:01:56.280> down

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
enormous green screen to pare back down

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.570 
enormous green screen to pare back down
below<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.600> did<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> descender<00:01:58.350> die

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580
