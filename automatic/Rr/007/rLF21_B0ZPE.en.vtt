of people have seen it I haven't seen
this<00:01:08.250> until<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.520> recently<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.900> does

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this until just recently and it does

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
this until just recently and it does
taste<00:01:10.260> good<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
taste good as well so it is really it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.070
