00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
on every song you know and especially

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.349 
on every song you know and especially
playing<00:03:21.410> with<00:03:21.650> reckless<00:03:22.340> Kelly<00:03:22.639> it's<00:03:22.850> it's<00:03:23.239> a

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
playing with reckless Kelly it's it's a

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.390 
playing with reckless Kelly it's it's a
rock<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.690> roll<00:03:23.870> band<00:03:23.900> for<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.590> most<00:03:24.799> part<00:03:25.069> so

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
rock and roll band for the most part so

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.309 
rock and roll band for the most part so
that's<00:03:26.150> why<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.329> started<00:03:26.450> playing<00:03:26.840> mandolin

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
that's why I started playing mandolin

that's why I started playing mandolin
playing<00:03:27.769> these<00:03:27.950> electric<00:03:28.400> mandolins<00:03:28.880> it's

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
playing these electric mandolins it's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.449 
playing these electric mandolins it's
just<00:03:30.079> kind<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.290> whatever<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.650> song<00:03:30.859> calls<00:03:31.130> for

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
just kind of whatever the song calls for

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.170 
just kind of whatever the song calls for
is<00:03:32.209> what<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.480> usually<00:03:32.660> go<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.799> really

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
is what I usually go to and it really

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.670 
is what I usually go to and it really
just<00:03:35.180> kind<00:03:35.299> of<00:03:35.420> depends<00:03:35.720> on<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.410> know<00:03:36.530> what

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
just kind of depends on you know what

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.920 
just kind of depends on you know what
the<00:03:36.769> song<00:03:36.950> needs<00:03:36.980> if<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.549> needs<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:38.060> country

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
the song needs if it needs a country

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.870

got<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.690> do<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.200> was<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:33.460> was<00:04:33.490> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
got to do that and that was a that was a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.900 
got to do that and that was a that was a
real<00:04:33.820> treat<00:04:34.060> for<00:04:34.120> us<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:36.310> know<00:04:36.340> hopefully

screaming<00:04:39.310> or<00:04:39.910> anything

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.730 
so I hopefully fans listening to it I
hope<00:05:20.480> they<00:05:20.660> love<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.020> songs<00:05:21.260> I<00:05:21.470> hope<00:05:21.620> they

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
hope they love the songs I hope they

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.680 
hope they love the songs I hope they
love<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.040> performance<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.850> I<00:05:23.270> hope<00:05:23.480> that

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
love the performance and I hope that

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.600

they<00:05:23.870> can<00:05:24.020> really<00:05:24.410> have<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.710> sense<00:05:25.310> of<00:05:25.520> the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
they can really have a sense of the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.580 
they can really have a sense of the
honesty<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.300> think<00:05:26.570> that'd<00:05:26.960> be<00:05:27.050> one<00:05:27.170> of<00:05:27.260> the

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
honesty I think that'd be one of the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.160 
honesty I think that'd be one of the
more<00:05:27.980> important<00:05:28.370> things<00:05:28.750> for<00:05:29.750> them<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:30.050> get

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
more important things for them to get

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.440 
more important things for them to get
out<00:05:30.200> of<00:05:30.440> it<00:05:30.530> because<00:05:30.710> that<00:05:31.220> that's<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.330> kind

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
out of it because that that's the kind

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.910 
out of it because that that's the kind
of<00:05:32.600> band<00:05:32.750> we<00:05:32.870> are<00:05:32.900> we've<00:05:33.200> always<00:05:33.350> tried<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.770> be

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
of band we are we've always tried to be

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.470 
of band we are we've always tried to be
real<00:05:34.100> honest<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:34.700> with<00:05:34.820> this<00:05:35.000> one

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
real honest and with this one

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.260 
real honest and with this one
we're<00:05:35.960> in<00:05:36.500> some<00:05:37.040> ways<00:05:37.280> maybe<00:05:37.610> we're<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.850> little

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
we're in some ways maybe we're a little

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.450 
we're in some ways maybe we're a little
outside<00:05:38.390> of<00:05:38.660> our<00:05:38.840> comfort<00:05:39.200> zone<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:40.310> we're

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
outside of our comfort zone but we're

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.370 
outside of our comfort zone but we're
not<00:05:40.610> we're<00:05:41.270> trying<00:05:41.540> to<00:05:41.600> stay<00:05:41.810> honest<00:05:42.230> and

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
not we're trying to stay honest and

00:05:42.380 --> 00:06:19.159 
not we're trying to stay honest and
comfortable<00:05:42.710> with<00:05:43.160> that<00:05:43.400> so
