00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
good just like it's bigger brother the

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.310 
good just like it's bigger brother the
250f<00:00:39.430> turns<00:00:39.730> great<00:00:40.090> that's<00:00:40.360> definitely

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
250f turns great that's definitely

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.680 
250f turns great that's definitely
Suzuki<00:00:42.040> strong<00:00:42.460> point<00:00:42.730> is<00:00:42.820> turning<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.330> think

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
Suzuki strong point is turning I think

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.880 
Suzuki strong point is turning I think
it<00:00:43.780> lacks<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:44.110> little<00:00:44.230> bit<00:00:44.410> of<00:00:44.530> topping

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
it lacks a little bit of topping

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.320 
it lacks a little bit of topping
compared<00:00:45.250> to<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.490> other<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:45.880> I<00:00:45.910> think<00:00:46.000> that's

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
compared to the other and I think that's

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.510 
compared to the other and I think that's
what<00:00:46.600> everybody<00:00:47.500> kind<00:00:47.770> of<00:00:47.860> put<00:00:48.010> it<00:00:48.130> you<00:00:48.489> know

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
what everybody kind of put it you know

like<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.059> see<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:52.450> but<00:00:52.750> other<00:00:53.230> than<00:00:53.290> that<00:00:53.410> it's

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
like to see it but other than that it's

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.410 
like to see it but other than that it's

a great foreign bike and with a little

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.450 
a great foreign bike and with a little
bit<00:00:55.540> of<00:00:55.630> help<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:55.960> him<00:00:56.140> definitely<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.280> race

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
I dig the electric start the thing

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.530 
I dig the electric start the thing
really<00:01:05.740> got<00:01:05.950> over<00:01:05.980> jumps<00:01:06.460> well<00:01:06.640> but<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.360> seemed

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
really got over jumps well but it seemed

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.240 
really got over jumps well but it seemed
like<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.720> comfort<00:01:08.170> issue<00:01:08.260> there<00:01:08.620> -<00:01:08.860> just<00:01:09.100> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
like a comfort issue there - just the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.860 
like a comfort issue there - just the
fork<00:01:09.520> in<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.760> shock<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.150> could<00:01:10.330> never<00:01:10.540> find<00:01:10.750> a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
fork in the shock I could never find a

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.770 
fork in the shock I could never find a
balance<00:01:11.260> well<00:01:11.560> what's<00:01:11.740> your<00:01:11.800> take<00:01:12.040> on<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.250> KTM

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780

to<00:01:13.780> me<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:13.990> same<00:01:14.140> thing<00:01:14.350> I<00:01:14.470> thought<00:01:14.680> top<00:01:15.250> in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
to me the same thing I thought top in

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.310 
to me the same thing I thought top in
was<00:01:15.610> great<00:01:15.850> but<00:01:16.300> getting<00:01:16.570> up<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.930> there<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.200> was

revving a bike out and I ride on the
higher<00:01:30.880> rpms<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.540> I<00:01:31.570> was<00:01:31.690> really<00:01:31.960> impressed

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
higher rpms and I was really impressed

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.020 
higher rpms and I was really impressed
with<00:01:32.530> how<00:01:32.680> you<00:01:32.950> can<00:01:33.100> hold<00:01:33.340> second<00:01:33.729> or<00:01:33.850> third

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
with how you can hold second or third

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.030 
with how you can hold second or third
gear<00:01:34.210> longer<00:01:34.690> than<00:01:34.840> any<00:01:35.020> other<00:01:35.110> bike<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:35.770> pull

gear longer than any other bike and pull

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.069 
gear longer than any other bike and pull
that<00:01:36.219> you<00:01:36.490> know<00:01:36.610> jump<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.119> it's<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.719> little<00:01:37.960> bit

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
that you know jump it it's a little bit

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.480 
that you know jump it it's a little bit
more<00:01:38.229> of<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.350> stretch<00:01:38.560> on<00:01:38.680> another<00:01:38.979> bike<00:01:39.189> but

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
more of a stretch on another bike but

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.580 
more of a stretch on another bike but
comfortable<00:01:40.119> suspension<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.960> forks<00:01:41.290> just

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
comfortable suspension the forks just

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.500 
comfortable suspension the forks just
isn't<00:01:42.490> up<00:01:42.579> to<00:01:42.610> par<00:01:42.729> work<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.540> you'd<00:01:43.689> be

isn't up to par work that you'd be
held<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:44.930> back<00:01:45.020> on<00:01:45.230> their<00:01:45.470> workplace<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.130> it's

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
held it back on their workplace so it's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.550 
held it back on their workplace so it's
the<00:01:46.730> biggest<00:01:47.060> problem<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:47.600> if<00:01:48.050> they<00:01:48.230> can<00:01:48.440> get

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
the biggest problem but if they can get

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.330 
the biggest problem but if they can get
that<00:01:48.740> figured<00:01:49.010> out

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
that figured out

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.060 
that figured out
Kim<00:01:49.730> top<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.600> chart<00:01:50.810> easily<00:01:51.230> yeah<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.980> I

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
Kim top of the chart easily yeah and I

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.920 
Kim top of the chart easily yeah and I
think<00:01:52.130> all<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.520> bikes<00:01:52.700> are<00:01:52.910> just<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.180> few<00:01:53.390> steps

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
think all the bikes are just a few steps

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.600 
think all the bikes are just a few steps
away<00:01:54.110> from<00:01:54.440> being<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.680> top<00:01:54.920> bike<00:01:55.160> I<00:01:55.190> mean<00:01:55.370> we

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
away from being the top bike I mean we

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.520 
away from being the top bike I mean we
picked<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.600> cow<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:56.960> third<00:01:57.230> and<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:57.410> was

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
picked the the cow in third and I was

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.170 
picked the the cow in third and I was
kind<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.740> surprised<00:01:58.100> by<00:01:58.250> that<00:01:58.400> because<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:59.060> a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
kind of surprised by that because it's a

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.880 
kind of surprised by that because it's a
ripper<00:01:59.390> it's<00:01:59.600> such<00:01:59.720> a<00:01:59.750> good<00:01:59.990> stock<00:02:00.320> race<00:02:00.620> bike

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
ripper it's such a good stock race bike

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.770 
ripper it's such a good stock race bike
got<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.130> box<00:02:01.370> you<00:02:01.820> know<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.180> much<00:02:02.360> torque<00:02:02.630> down

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
got a box you know so much torque down

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.720 
got a box you know so much torque down
low<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.350> suspension<00:02:03.860> performs<00:02:04.430> really<00:02:04.610> well

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
low and suspension performs really well

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.760

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
from last to first because it was such a

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.190 
from last to first because it was such a
old<00:04:01.310> carbureted<00:04:02.000> dated<00:04:02.300> bike<00:04:02.450> before<00:04:02.690> but
