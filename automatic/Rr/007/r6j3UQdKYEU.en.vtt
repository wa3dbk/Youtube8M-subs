we<00:00:01.199> need<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.469> coolant<00:00:01.770> fan<00:00:01.979> control<00:00:02.399> module

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:03.560 
we need a coolant fan control module

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.550 
we need a coolant fan control module
there's<00:00:03.920> two<00:00:04.100> big<00:00:04.310> bugs<00:00:04.840> for<00:00:05.840> one<00:00:06.050> little<00:00:06.200> buzz

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
there's two big bugs for one little buzz

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:14.610 
there's two big bugs for one little buzz
one<00:00:07.069> big<00:00:07.310> bug

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.860 

the<00:00:15.010> bottle

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:19.870 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:28.150 

with<00:00:20.140> a<00:00:20.170> wiring<00:00:20.470> harness<00:00:20.650> bracket

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.210 

what<00:00:28.730> was<00:00:28.880> happening<00:00:29.300> this<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:30.769> temperature

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
what was happening this the temperature

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.200 
what was happening this the temperature
sensor<00:00:31.640> here<00:00:32.020> shorty<00:00:33.250> cause<00:00:34.250> defense<00:00:34.699> to

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
sensor here shorty cause defense to

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.420 
sensor here shorty cause defense to
always<00:00:35.510> be<00:00:35.690> on<00:00:35.870> because<00:00:36.829> it<00:00:37.040> triggered<00:00:37.399> the

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
always be on because it triggered the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.180 
always be on because it triggered the
module<00:00:37.879> keep<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:38.600> fan<00:00:38.809> always<00:00:39.050> on<00:00:39.379> the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
module keep the fan always on the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.120 
module keep the fan always on the
connections<00:00:40.670> inside<00:00:41.030> Bert

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
connections inside Bert

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.890 
connections inside Bert
and<00:00:43.310> would<00:00:43.730> stay<00:00:43.910> on<00:00:43.940> you<00:00:44.270> with<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.600> engine

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
and would stay on you with the engine

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.229 
and would stay on you with the engine
off

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
off

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.540 
off
for<00:00:46.690> this<00:00:46.780> module<00:00:47.020> receives<00:00:47.800> inputs<00:00:48.309> for

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
for this module receives inputs for

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.180 
for this module receives inputs for
various<00:00:48.969> components<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:50.410> trigger<00:00:50.680> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
various components to trigger the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
various components to trigger the
radiator<00:00:51.579> vent<00:00:51.820> to<00:00:52.270> close<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:53.020> switch

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
radiator vent to close the switch

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.180 
radiator vent to close the switch
obviously<00:00:55.930> with<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.230> disconnected<00:00:56.739> these<00:00:56.920> two

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
obviously with it disconnected these two

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.330 
obviously with it disconnected these two
should<00:00:57.519> not<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.850> continuity

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
should not have continuity

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
should not have continuity
because<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.790> relay<00:01:00.120> should<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.450> open<00:01:03.500> zero

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
because the relay should be open zero

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.010 
because the relay should be open zero
this<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.210> continuity

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
this is continuity

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.050 
this is continuity
so<00:01:08.590> radio<00:01:08.950> friends<00:01:09.310> would<00:01:09.490> have<00:01:09.549> been<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.850> by

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
so radio friends would have been on by

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.270 
so radio friends would have been on by
now<00:01:10.329> due<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.350> faulty<00:01:12.280> temperature<00:01:12.759> switch

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
now due to the faulty temperature switch

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.310 
now due to the faulty temperature switch
this<00:01:15.280> guy<00:01:15.520> right<00:01:15.700> here

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this guy right here

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.940 
this guy right here
PC<00:01:17.320> cutout<00:01:17.649> switch

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
PC cutout switch

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.570 
PC cutout switch
so<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.460> guy<00:01:20.580> caused<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> module<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.040> always

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so this guy caused the module to always

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.300 
so this guy caused the module to always
be<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:25.290> trigger<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> module<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
be on or to trigger the module to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.080 
be on or to trigger the module to
trigger<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> fans<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.540> always<00:01:27.840> stay<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
trigger the fans to always stay on and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
trigger the fans to always stay on and
there<00:01:30.090> really<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> basically<00:01:30.720> stuck<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there really is basically stuck in the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.789 
there really is basically stuck in the
closed<00:01:32.220> position<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> fans<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.619> always

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
closed position so the fans would always

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.330 
closed position so the fans would always
run<00:01:35.130> even<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.640> key<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.680> replacing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
run even with the key off so replacing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.260 
run even with the key off so replacing
the<00:01:38.430> module<00:01:38.880> solved<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.020> part<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:41.270> fans

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the module solved that part of it fans

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.300 
the module solved that part of it fans

reindeer<00:03:29.180> defend<00:03:29.510> just<00:03:29.690> went<00:03:29.900> off<00:03:30.400> because

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
reindeer defend just went off because

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.660 
reindeer defend just went off because

the radiator fence which closed or open
up<00:03:34.790> I<00:03:34.940> should<00:03:35.120> say<00:03:36.099> so<00:03:37.099> system<00:03:37.520> back<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.849> normal

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
up I should say so system back to normal

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.690 
up I should say so system back to normal
working<00:03:38.540> good
