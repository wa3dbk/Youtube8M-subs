00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.210
 of the potato chips for powder and 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.210

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.450
 hello everyone here we are again in the 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.460
 rescue I'm going to prepare a cake today 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.690
 apple of the photo that came up long ago 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.340
 Many of you I have asked for the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.410
 recipe and nothing is going to start with the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.670
 ingredients we're going to in the car before 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.640
 you can not use the glass I'm going to use 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.820
 as a meter then we will need a 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.180
 glass two glasses of flour a glass of 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.500
 semi-skimmed milk as whole an envelope 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.920
 of yeast four eggs 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.230
 one on powdered sugar and three 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.760
 apples okay big dating I'm going to 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.340
 use the smallest then I'm going to 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.660
 use as extra 8 and then to 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.510
 decorate them so let's use 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.880
 peach jam and an apple 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.070
 big one and I'm going to use three 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.960
 small is worth so come it 's 8 we're going to 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.300
 it's good, so first we rinse 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.350
 we peel the apples and then we go 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.350
 to cut into slices 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.530
 well, I have nothing ready fruits 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.410
 I'm going to start adding the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.130
 ingredients here we start throwing 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.130
 the 4 eggs 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.410
 or 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.250
 ah 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.410
 and we beat a little with the fork 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.900
 it does not take much because then we're going 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:07.680
 to do with the blender 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.680
 ok we add the two glasses of flour 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.990
 we continue with 2 sugar sorry one of 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.990
 sugar 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.370
 how can I do it 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.360
 i 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.360
 and a right 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.379
 adding very poor yeast 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.840
 and we are throwing here the chopped apple 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.670
 well nothing once added all the 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.420
 ingredients that I've said so far what 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.420
 we beat all 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.670
 just as the dough must remain 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.740
 completely smooth then nothing once 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.740
 let's have it all beaten to the container 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.430
 yapurÃ¡ very well and now I was preparing a 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.140
 peeler a high tin then 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.320
 we take the three little apples or 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.930
 a big what we have and we peel it 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.440
 very carefully to maintain the shape 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.440
 in sheets 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.580
 We are slicing the apples into slices 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.720
 of a thickness or infinity of tourism 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.720
 fat as I am doing 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.800
 and now we are placing the sheet on top 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:05.430
 from the cake 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.430
 it looks nice 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.440
 as well as it should be 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.140
 depending on the container that we use 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.880
 he needed some apples that 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.820
 those that I have used then nothing 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.130
 We preheat the oven to 180 degrees and 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.130
 we put in for an hour 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.210
 to find out we can put the knife and 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.970
 dry prosecutors is ready not for nothing what 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.120
 we take out and let it cool about 20 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.120
 minutes 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.810
 here 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.090
 well, once we have waited 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.880
 20 minutes to cool a bit longer 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.380
 we can decorate we are going to put it 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.020
 on top a layer of marmalade 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.460
 peach would ideally have a cast 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.410
 or something so that the jam come out more 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.400
 liquid but I do not have it then I'm going 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.400
 doing as I can 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.380
 ok let's go together and we cover it all 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.660
 Well, look, I've already put the layer of 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.880
 jam as it has been all 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.820
 you do not have to throw much 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.400
 to cover it and nothing to the fridge and 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.690
 that gets cool 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.800
 well, it's been an hour now, I think 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.210
 this is ready now 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.210
 and as my part 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.360
 all right 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.879
 Well, I'm going to eat as you know 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.710
 I always bring cheap things simple and 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.659
 super good to really try it 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.659
 you will see how rich nothing until the next
