00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.390
 Mr. good manners before the 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.129
 lakes and ponds all thought to freeze 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.769
 I me me for today's go and 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.999
 Although already noticed the right ways 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:25.069
 very careful at the moment therefore one 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.419
 route with which we really completely free 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.669
 can act and maybe still 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.590
 you can then sit down 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:37.719
 reasonable today with the new 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:42.280
 experiment jack very fine class route 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:47.809
 as made for the drophot angel 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.609
 the nexus 25 and a montage without lead 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.719
 start of professional or 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.710
 here we have no star but 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.280
 has mono and then just one 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.280
 little bit 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.989
 With that we want to list the right ones 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.720
 So the route has a very fine 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.200
 tip on weight and have to me 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.590
 think twice to twelve grams so that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.080
 is little to move a peacock 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.580
 perfect for the rest to put 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.790
 maybe not quite so perfect 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.140
 We will do it but the assembly is too 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.740
 easy so I have that before 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.950
 braided 09 again a 25 erdinger 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.530
 Center apartment still popped up and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:35.240
 besides that has mono fold with the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.740
 relatively large chunk offset hook 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.079
 and then I will get the fish very easily 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.600
 offering water may bring you 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:48.560
 the fish we are looking for is fishing 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.820
 Something complicated today is that you 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.170
 See here ice waters are frozen over 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.830
 Now we have to look for a gap 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:03.340
 Chic so behind me you see now 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.340
 a part 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.160
 I hope to stay there now at 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.010
 single real about instructions 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.230
 are caught, there is little water 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.650
 So let's try it 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.940
 Capital Lays is mounted equipment 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.940
 is here and try now 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.209
 they do not want to but it will be one 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.209
 I give it 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:04.690
 we made the pure route 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:16.990
 a montage of a phishing thing for one 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:22.290
 Chunks no idea well 90 had five 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.290
 up to seven kilos absolutely beautiful fish 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.960
 then we really want to join you too 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:40.649
 you see that the experience is 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:42.110
 jack with the book not only two to 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:43.820
 twelve grams 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.560
 a corresponding waters in winter 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.780
 at the drop shadow 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.930
 you are really successful too 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.870
 big fish 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.390
 this combo 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.690
 escape 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.690
 petri market
