00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
kind of see the mounting bolts kind of

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.619 
kind of see the mounting bolts kind of
run<00:00:46.929> all<00:00:47.109> the<00:00:47.199> way<00:00:47.230> up<00:00:47.469> through<00:00:47.710> there<00:00:48.629> through

run all the way up through there through
there<00:00:49.839> straight<00:00:50.559> up<00:00:50.710> we've<00:00:50.890> welded<00:00:51.039> some

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
there straight up we've welded some

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.639 
there straight up we've welded some
little<00:00:51.519> spacer<00:00:51.910> tubes<00:00:52.179> on<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:53.079> the<00:00:53.199> top<00:00:53.410> piece

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
little spacer tubes on to the top piece

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.110 
little spacer tubes on to the top piece
of<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.890> plate<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.309> you'll<00:00:54.730> see<00:00:54.910> what<00:00:55.030> it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
of the plate and you'll see what it

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.000 
of the plate and you'll see what it
looks<00:00:55.300> like<00:00:55.449> from<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.719> top<00:00:55.870> side

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.860 

so<00:01:00.580> we<00:01:00.670> kind<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.940> ran<00:01:01.060> a<00:01:01.090> piece<00:01:01.330> of<00:01:01.450> all<00:01:01.600> thread

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
so we kind of ran a piece of all thread

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.080 
so we kind of ran a piece of all thread
and<00:01:01.990> we<00:01:02.050> made<00:01:02.230> these<00:01:02.380> long<00:01:02.620> bolts<00:01:03.100> these<00:01:03.820> tubes

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.090 
and we made these long bolts these tubes

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.880 
and we made these long bolts these tubes
are<00:01:04.239> all<00:01:04.360> welded<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:04.870> place<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.440> this<00:01:05.650> kind<00:01:05.860> of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
are all welded in place and this kind of

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.410 
are all welded in place and this kind of
provides<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.310> nice<00:01:06.400> kind<00:01:06.670> of<00:01:06.760> standoff<00:01:07.180> because

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
provides a nice kind of standoff because

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.780 
provides a nice kind of standoff because
we<00:01:07.510> put<00:01:07.690> like<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.870> top<00:01:08.170> lid<00:01:08.440> on<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.740> thing<00:01:08.800> but

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
we put like a top lid on this thing but

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.920 
we put like a top lid on this thing but
we<00:01:09.880> kind<00:01:10.060> of<00:01:10.090> figured<00:01:10.360> if<00:01:10.480> people<00:01:10.720> have<00:01:10.810> an

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
we kind of figured if people have an

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.740 
we kind of figured if people have an
idea<00:01:11.380> like<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.250> know<00:01:13.090> what<00:01:13.240> kind<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.480> spare

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
idea like you know what kind of spare

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
up you can kind of see here's the top

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.589 
up you can kind of see here's the top
lid<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:43.159> again<00:05:43.490> this<00:05:43.610> is<00:05:43.759> just<00:05:43.969> some<00:05:44.090> leftover

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
lid and again this is just some leftover

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:45.909 
lid and again this is just some leftover
zinc<00:05:44.930> sheet<00:05:45.139> metal<00:05:45.380> that<00:05:45.500> we<00:05:45.560> kind<00:05:45.770> of<00:05:45.800> had

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
zinc sheet metal that we kind of had

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.730 
zinc sheet metal that we kind of had
kicking<00:05:46.280> around<00:05:46.370> went<00:05:47.240> ahead<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.539> niced<00:05:48.440> it

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
kicking around went ahead and niced it

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.959 
kicking around went ahead and niced it
up<00:05:48.889> by<00:05:49.039> putting<00:05:49.250> this<00:05:49.430> foam<00:05:49.699> weather

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
up by putting this foam weather

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.420 
up by putting this foam weather
stripping<00:05:50.500> and<00:05:51.500> then<00:05:51.680> we<00:05:51.740> even<00:05:51.949> put<00:05:52.099> this<00:05:52.250> like

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
stripping and then we even put this like

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.189 
stripping and then we even put this like
chromed<00:05:52.759> origin<00:05:53.330> without<00:05:53.479> molding<00:05:53.930> on<00:05:54.080> it

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
chromed origin without molding on it

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.860 
chromed origin without molding on it
just<00:05:54.320> really<00:05:54.650> kind<00:05:54.919> of<00:05:55.009> tie<00:05:55.219> the<00:05:55.280> thing<00:05:55.550> off

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
just really kind of tie the thing off

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.969 
just really kind of tie the thing off
but<00:05:56.870> it's<00:05:56.990> set<00:05:57.139> up<00:05:57.169> everything's<00:05:57.530> directional

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
but it's set up everything's directional

00:05:57.979 --> 00:05:59.800 
but it's set up everything's directional
so<00:05:58.099> this<00:05:58.219> thing<00:05:58.370> would<00:05:58.460> go<00:05:58.580> on<00:05:58.759> there<00:05:59.030> like<00:05:59.509> so

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
so this thing would go on there like so

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.839 
so this thing would go on there like so
and<00:06:00.080> then<00:06:00.740> you<00:06:00.860> would<00:06:00.979> basically<00:06:01.099> take<00:06:01.610> some

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
departure from this point forward still

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:31.370 
departure from this point forward still
got<00:06:31.039> plenty
