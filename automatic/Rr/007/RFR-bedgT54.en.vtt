00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:11.806
 And it all starts with a simple question 

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:14.743
 What is God greater in your life? 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.519
 I started sharing my stage life story 

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:22.636
 What I have overcome through Christ "Drug Addiction" 

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:27.386
 People responded, and we began to connect with them in a way never before 

00:00:27.386 --> 00:00:34.366
 And we witness many manifestations of the grace, love and hope of God 

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:44.544
 And every story written by people all over the world, the signs, is the reflection of a unique story 

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:49.524
 A story that crosses all nations, all human history 

00:00:49.524 --> 00:00:52.374
 The Story of God's Love 

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:54.834
 What is your story? 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:57.849
 A documentary by Christafari 

00:00:58.148 --> 00:00:59.548
 Friends of Christafari 

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:27.444
 I am exalted when I exalt you 

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:31.541
 My spirit grows when You are praised 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.859
 I am exalted when I exalt you 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.046
 My spirit grows when You are praised 

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:44.070
 When I exalt you 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.349
 You fill my glass, You fill my glass 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.167
 When I exalt you 

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:58.145
 You fill my glass, Oh Lord You fill my glass 

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:02.085
 He is bigger than my problems. 

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:04.390
 He is greater than my pains. 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.735
 Only God alone can solve them 

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.685
 And in it I will remain 

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.127
 Yes, it is bigger than my diseases 

00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:13.072
 Then I'll call on your name 

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:16.291
 In my weaknesses He is powerful 

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:17.780
 Through Him I will preach 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.400
 Yes he is older 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.524
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.066
 He is older 

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.311
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:28.654
 My God is greater 

00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:31.933
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:33.310
 Yes he is older 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.315
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:02:37.453 --> 00:02:42.240
 Sometimes the afflictions in life can multiply 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.818
 But then I raise my eyes and look at the sky 

00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:51.662
 If You created the whole world and everything in it 

00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:55.336
 Then you are bigger than all my problems 

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:57.878
 God is greater than my judgments 

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:00.330
 And bigger than my fears 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.832
 Just discharge His sufferings 

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:04.841
 And wipe your tears 

00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.207
 God is greater than tomorrow 

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:09.749
 And He will see through your pain 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.846
 For he who kneels before the Lord 

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:13.737
 Can stand against anything 

00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:15.348
 Yes he is older 

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:18.375
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:19.651
 He is older 

00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:22.974
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:24.506
 My God is greater 

00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:25.939
 Yes he is older 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.643
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:29.234
 He is older 

00:03:29.234 --> 00:03:32.435
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:37.749
 I am exalted when You are exalted 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:42.946
 My spirit grows when You are worshiped 

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:47.331
 I am exalted when You are exalted 

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.566
 My spirit grows when You are worshiped 

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:54.882
 When I exalt you 

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:59.480
 You fill my glass, you fill my glass 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.749
 When I exalt you 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:08.719
 You fill my glass, Oh Lord You fill my glass 

00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:12.266
 So I do not want to put my trust in vanity 

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.831
 Do not depend on me 

00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.127
 Do not put my hope in humanity 

00:04:17.127 --> 00:04:19.690
 Because everyone will fail 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.479
 There is only One who lived a perfect life 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.478
 And died to save 

00:04:24.478 --> 00:04:26.523
 Who rose from the grave 

00:04:26.523 --> 00:04:28.472
 There is no one bigger 

00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:29.809
 He is older 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.685
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:34.490
 He is older 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.180
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.849
 My God is greater 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.040
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.531
 He is older 

00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:46.939
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:52.105
 Greater is He that lives in me. 

00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:56.269
 He must grow, and I must decrease 

00:04:56.872 --> 00:05:01.540
 He is older, he is older than me 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.048
 He must grow, and I must decrease

 HE 

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.939
 IS 

00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:41.537
