00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
stealth rocks and seeing as I'm faster

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
to the dis explosion and he actually

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.370 
to the dis explosion and he actually
does<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.890> rapid<00:01:54.370> spin<00:01:54.610> so<00:01:54.910> whatever<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.170> I'm

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
to send out a counter for it to go on a

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.230 
to send out a counter for it to go on a
blizzy<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:37.950> obviously<00:03:38.640> he's<00:03:38.819> going<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.120> go

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
blizzy and obviously he's going to go

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.790 
blizzy and obviously he's going to go
into<00:03:39.390> tyranitar<00:03:40.080> say<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.410> that's<00:03:40.620> what<00:03:40.740> he

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
into tyranitar say so that's what he

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
thinking you know maybe you'll ever

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.310 
thinking you know maybe you'll ever
predict<00:03:54.060> or<00:03:54.270> they<00:03:54.420> get<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.570> pair<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.959> hacks<00:03:55.140> or

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
predict or they get a pair of hacks or

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.050 
predict or they get a pair of hacks or
whatever<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.860> he<00:03:55.980> does<00:03:56.190> go<00:03:56.370> for<00:03:56.550> a<00:03:56.580> superpower

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
whatever but he does go for a superpower

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.770 
whatever but he does go for a superpower
and<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:58.530> live<00:03:58.950> it<00:03:59.130> with<00:03:59.280> 90<00:04:00.060> hit<00:04:00.180> points<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.720> I

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and I live it with 90 hit points and I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.630 
and I live it with 90 hit points and I
do<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.080> just<00:04:01.290> because<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:02.070> really<00:04:02.459> don't<00:04:02.610> have

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
do this just because I really don't have

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.240 
do this just because I really don't have
a<00:04:02.760> safe<00:04:03.000> switch<00:04:03.360> at<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.750> point<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.980> am

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
a safe switch at this point I am

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.340 
a safe switch at this point I am
carrying<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.180> think<00:04:06.390> of<00:04:06.480> alligator<00:04:07.050> in<00:04:07.230> this

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
carrying I think of alligator in this

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.640 
carrying I think of alligator in this
team<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.980> something<00:04:08.640> else<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:10.140> decided<00:04:10.560> to

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
team and something else so I decided to

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.870 
team and something else so I decided to
go<00:04:10.709> for<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:10.860> soft<00:04:11.070> world<00:04:11.310> again<00:04:11.550> kind<00:04:11.820> of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
go for the soft world again kind of

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.750 
go for the soft world again kind of
hoping<00:04:12.030> for<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.239> power<00:04:12.420> hacks<00:04:12.720> or<00:04:13.760> epic

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
hoping for the power hacks or epic

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.270 
hoping for the power hacks or epic
survive<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.600> i<00:04:16.260> actually<00:04:16.680> do<00:04:16.950> survive<00:04:17.250> a

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
survive but i actually do survive a
