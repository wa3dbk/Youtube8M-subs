00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.349
 many Italian cities 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.009
 they have an interesting ancient history 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:12.139
 and in each 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.349
 you can discover something special 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.970
 that goes back in time while still present 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.929
 a cremona for example 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.499
 the city of Lombardy that has a beautiful new 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.769
 lair of the highest bell towers in Italy 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.869
 there is a famous musical tradition 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.399
 linked to exceptional craftsmanship 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.150
 the art of making the day 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.470
 the violin was born right here 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.900
 those first specimens of Andrea Mark and his descendants 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.780
 about four centuries ago 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.590
 it was then perfected by other great artisans 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.180
 including type remember giuseppe guarneri 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.250
 called garnets of the jesus 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.940
 but he added to his most admirable form through antonio stradivari 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.720
 its specimens built between the end of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth century 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.170
 ambrogi an invaluable value 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 to keep them well many people need to play every day 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
 the privilege of listening to the pure sound of a stradivarius 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.520
 it is the surprise that the cremona can reserve for the visitor 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.860
 in the industrial age the artisan tradition 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.000
 which is based on the manual work of very experienced people 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.910
 risk of losing 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.280
 a cremona in order to survive the art of the violin was established one 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.790
 international school of violin making 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.700
 in it one works as the most illustrious shops of past centuries 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.979
 during the four-year course students can learn the secrets of 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.190
 this processing 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.400
 practicing age in the laboratory 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.860
 and building themselves an instrument 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.360
 under the passionate guide 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.580
 the experts also for the violin the quality and the seasoning of the wood 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.700
 they are fundamental 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.040
 we need mainly two types 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.980
 the spruce of the dolomites of the maple of the Balkans 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.050
 with the tables made of the games, the processing is started through 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.660
 a preliminary work of planing the work tools are very similar to 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.859
 those of the past 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:15.109
 those that for example ad antonio stradivari worked in the museum to him 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.379
 dedicated 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.739
 and so the silhouettes 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.379
 which are used to establish the exact form and proportions of the instrument 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.239
 even if derived from the reproduction of ancient ones 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.279
 always in the case of stradivari 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.419
 they had arrived at perfection 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:32.579
 both for the acoustic qualities and for the stars 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.629
 the master carefully follows every operation 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.029
 helping students with tips and advice will then pass ahahah paste 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.969
 the chi parts to fix them by clamps that are applied 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.609
 all around you can then proceed to the final assembly by inserting the jumper 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.629
 and assembling the ropes 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.609
 the raw violin is thus obtained 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:53.550
 that however 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.809
 eh already able to face a soil test 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:00.329
 if the sound is good you put the first one to dry together with the others for a 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.719
 long enough time 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.829
 when the raw violin is ready we move on to the last phase of the processing 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.529
 very delicate which consists of painting 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:14.029
 important both for sound quality 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.730
 both for the beauty of the product 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.769
 and for its durability 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.449
 those who were once school pupils 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.169
 today they are masters 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.639
 it is the stupendous fruit in their hands rightly finds a place in the 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.590
 same museum 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.069
 dedicated to stradivarius
