demonstration on how to letter a page I
use<00:00:17.760> an<00:00:17.880> illustrator<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.449> import<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> colored

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
use an illustrator I import the colored

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.490 
use an illustrator I import the colored
image<00:00:20.369> into<00:00:21.330> illustrator<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.020> then<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.199> start

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
image into illustrator and then I start

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.849 
image into illustrator and then I start
using<00:00:23.029> prefabricated<00:00:24.260> word<00:00:25.260> balloons<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
using prefabricated word balloons that I

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.359 
using prefabricated word balloons that I
use<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:27.000> help<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> dialogue<00:00:29.130> for

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
use to help use it for the dialogue for

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.209 
use to help use it for the dialogue for
this<00:00:29.460> particular<00:00:29.699> page<00:00:30.170> so<00:00:31.170> basically<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
this particular page so basically you

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
this particular page so basically you
just<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:33.059> click<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.360> any<00:00:33.480> word<00:00:34.290> balloon<00:00:34.559> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
just can click on any word balloon that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
just can click on any word balloon that
you<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:34.980> works<00:00:35.160> best<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.760> each<00:00:36.210> character

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you think works best for each character

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.680 
you think works best for each character
to<00:00:36.840> speak<00:00:37.730> basically<00:00:38.730> click<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.090> drag<00:00:39.329> into

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
to speak basically click and drag into

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
to speak basically click and drag into
the<00:00:39.930> next<00:00:40.170> frame<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> can<00:00:41.520> see

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the next frame in there as you can see

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.270 
the next frame in there as you can see
moving<00:00:42.629> into<00:00:42.930> position<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.860> resize<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
moving into position you can resize it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.529 
moving into position you can resize it
to<00:00:45.260> help<00:00:46.260> fit<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> panel<00:00:47.129> itself<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.760> then

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to help fit in the panel itself and then

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.069 
to help fit in the panel itself and then
obviously<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> would<00:00:49.710> type<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:51.079> text

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
obviously you would type in the text

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.490 
obviously you would type in the text
from<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.620> script<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.690> which<00:00:55.379> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
from the script that I use here which is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
from the script that I use here which is
already<00:00:55.710> pre<00:00:56.070> written<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:56.820> so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
already pre written out for me so I just

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
already pre written out for me so I just
go<00:00:57.360> through<00:00:57.629> each<00:00:57.899> page<00:00:58.170> figure<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.039> what

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
go through each page figure out what

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.799 
go through each page figure out what
this<00:00:59.250> script<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.300> figure<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.690> what

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this script is and then figure out what

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
this script is and then figure out what
place<00:01:01.399> best<00:01:02.399> place<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.879> word<00:01:03.000> balloons

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
place best place for the word balloons

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.190 
place best place for the word balloons
too<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:04.890> work<00:01:05.420> as<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.930> each

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
too that would work as you can see each

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.250 
too that would work as you can see each
individual<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:07.860> will<00:01:07.979> pop<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:09.080> through<00:01:10.080> each

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
individual one will pop up through each

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.100 
individual one will pop up through each
layer<00:01:10.530> obviously<00:01:10.950> each<00:01:11.580> individual<00:01:12.420> word

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
layer obviously each individual word

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
layer obviously each individual word
balloon<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.560> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.830> its<00:01:13.950> own<00:01:14.070> separate

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
balloon is going to be its own separate

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
balloon is going to be its own separate
layer<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> way<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> type<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.409> your

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
layer so that way when you type in your

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.300 
layer so that way when you type in your
text<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.460> manipulate<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:19.070> any<00:01:20.070> way<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
text you can manipulate it any way you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.969 
text you can manipulate it any way you
want<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.759> terms<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.119> size<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> text<00:01:22.290> size

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
