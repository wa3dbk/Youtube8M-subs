00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.069 

remember<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.179> is<00:01:34.359> you'll<00:01:34.570> see<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.750> flame

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
remember this is you'll see that flame

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.679 
remember this is you'll see that flame

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
be flat on the bottom right there

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.999

now<00:01:43.689> you<00:01:43.750> could<00:01:44.079> play<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.469> over<00:01:44.619> here<00:01:44.860> if<00:01:44.950> you

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
now you could play it over here if you

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.880 
now you could play it over here if you
want<00:01:45.219> it's<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.549> same<00:01:45.789> three<00:01:46.030> notes<00:01:49.860> but<00:01:50.860> I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
want it's the same three notes but I

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.319 
want it's the same three notes but I
choose<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.310> play<00:01:51.579> it<00:01:51.640> here<00:01:51.909> because<00:01:52.179> it's

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
choose to play it here because it's

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.169 
choose to play it here because it's
closer<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.959> first<00:01:53.319> two<00:01:53.500> chords<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:53.890> played

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
closer to the first two chords I played

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:59.419 
closer to the first two chords I played
and<00:01:55.179> then<00:01:55.420> from<00:01:56.289> here<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.759> up<00:01:57.969> to<00:01:58.149> here<00:01:58.450> so

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
and then from here it's up to here so

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:09.330 
and then from here it's up to here so
move<00:02:00.429> up<00:02:00.610> two<00:02:00.819> steps<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:08.619> this<00:02:09.069> is<00:02:09.220> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
move up two steps so this this is the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.949 
move up two steps so this this is the
same<00:02:09.519> chord<00:02:09.849> progression<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.450> happens<00:02:10.509> for

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
same chord progression that happens for

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.039 
same chord progression that happens for
the<00:02:11.079> first<00:02:11.110> three<00:02:12.150> sort<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.239> lines<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
the first three sort of lines of the

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.910 
the first three sort of lines of the
verse<00:02:15.030> I'll<00:02:16.030> go<00:02:16.239> over<00:02:16.299> that<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.720> second<00:02:17.110> but

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
verse I'll go over that in a second but

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:32.380 
verse I'll go over that in a second but

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.700 

you<00:04:28.699> flat<00:04:28.970> down<00:04:29.150> here<00:04:29.509> and<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:30.500> you're<00:04:30.620> gonna

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
you flat down here and then you're gonna

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
move this down there the second floor

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.929

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:37.939 
then you know so that's a new flat

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.619 
then you know so that's a new flat
it's<00:04:38.150> like<00:04:38.270> a<00:04:38.300> g-minor<00:04:38.960> with<00:04:39.349> the<00:04:39.590> D<00:04:39.860> piece

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
it's like a g-minor with the D piece

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.080 
it's like a g-minor with the D piece
that's<00:04:41.629> the<00:04:41.780> second<00:04:42.080> chord<00:04:42.319> and<00:04:42.560> then<00:04:42.770> e<00:04:43.370> flat

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
seven with a suit sharp right there so

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.370 
seven with a suit sharp right there so
that's<00:04:48.590> here's<00:04:49.189> middle<00:04:49.460> C

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:00.010 

right<00:04:53.920> there<00:04:55.530> flat

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.770 

c-sharp<00:05:01.020> right<00:05:01.379> there<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.039> then<00:05:02.639> an<00:05:02.909> A<00:05:03.569> flat

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
c-sharp right there and then an A flat

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.040 
c-sharp right there and then an A flat
with<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> c'<00:05:04.969> I'll<00:05:05.969> see<00:05:06.240> so<00:05:06.509> you<00:05:06.599> can<00:05:06.629> use<00:05:06.810> that

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
with a c' I'll see so you can use that

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.939 
with a c' I'll see so you can use that
plus<00:05:07.560> B<00:05:08.009> flat<00:05:08.310> E<00:05:08.340> flat<00:05:08.870> C<00:05:09.870> on<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.139> bottom<00:05:10.469> then

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
plus B flat E flat C on the bottom then

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.010 
plus B flat E flat C on the bottom then
just<00:05:11.250> move<00:05:11.400> these<00:05:11.580> two<00:05:11.879> C's<00:05:12.210> down<00:05:12.569> to<00:05:12.810> B's

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
just move these two C's down to B's

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.339 
just move these two C's down to B's
right<00:05:13.590> there<00:05:13.830> then<00:05:14.819> you<00:05:14.879> got<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.240> chord<00:05:15.599> then

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
right there then you got that chord then

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.110 
right there then you got that chord then
you're<00:05:16.500> gonna<00:05:16.590> go<00:05:16.800> back<00:05:16.979> up<00:05:17.189> and<00:05:17.400> play<00:05:17.879> those
