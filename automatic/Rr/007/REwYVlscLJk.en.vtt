peter<00:00:07.859> we're<00:00:08.069> at<00:00:08.160> CES<00:00:08.670> 2014<00:00:09.120> we<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:09.660> got<00:00:09.780> done

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
peter we're at CES 2014 we just got done

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.440 
peter we're at CES 2014 we just got done
checking<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.710> oculus<00:00:11.280> rift<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.300> is

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
checking out the oculus rift but this is

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.180 
checking out the oculus rift but this is
a<00:00:12.480> slightly<00:00:13.080> different<00:00:13.380> one<00:00:13.620> than<00:00:13.740> once<00:00:14.040> we've

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
a slightly different one than once we've

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.499 
a slightly different one than once we've
seen<00:00:14.519> previously<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.420> was

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
seen previously what was what was

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.820 
seen previously what was what was
different<00:00:15.630> about<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:16.020> one<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> brand

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
different about this one so the brand

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.439 
different about this one so the brand
new<00:00:16.949> prototype<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> code<00:00:17.760> named<00:00:17.880> Crystal<00:00:18.270> Cove

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
new prototype is code named Crystal Cove

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.700 
new prototype is code named Crystal Cove
and<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.020> biggest<00:00:19.170> things<00:00:19.439> I've<00:00:19.560> got

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and one of the biggest things I've got

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
and one of the biggest things I've got
going<00:00:20.010> now<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> positional<00:00:20.730> tracking<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
going now is positional tracking in the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
going now is positional tracking in the
past<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> oculus<00:00:22.439> would<00:00:22.650> let<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.949> turn<00:00:23.430> your

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
past the oculus would let you turn your

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.070 
past the oculus would let you turn your
head<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.960> move

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
head a little bit but now you can move

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.099 
head a little bit but now you can move
it<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.350> XY<00:00:25.910> space<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.449> actually<00:00:27.630> see

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
it in XY space and you can actually see

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
it in XY space and you can actually see
that<00:00:28.980> reflected<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> game<00:00:29.910> itself<00:00:30.240> so

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that reflected in the game itself so

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.389 
that reflected in the game itself so
it's<00:00:30.900> pretty<00:00:30.990> important<00:00:31.470> imagine<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> game

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
it's pretty important imagine a game

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.319 
it's pretty important imagine a game
like<00:00:32.550> where<00:00:32.700> you're<00:00:32.790> trying<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.120> cover

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
like where you're trying to take cover

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.000 
like where you're trying to take cover
behind<00:00:33.540> something<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.469> actually<00:00:34.620> move

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
behind something and you actually move

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.319 
behind something and you actually move
before<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.790> wasn't<00:00:36.000> something<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.239> could

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
before that wasn't something you could

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.479 
before that wasn't something you could
do<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.380> demo<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.829> in<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> sort<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> small

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
do and the demo is in a sort of a small

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.950 
do and the demo is in a sort of a small
environment<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:39.059> now<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.719> tech

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
environment but now with that tech

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.299 
environment but now with that tech
that's<00:00:40.350> something<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.649> oculus<00:00:40.950> rift<00:00:41.129> will

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that's something the oculus rift will

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.330 
that's something the oculus rift will
support<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.050> had<00:00:43.200> these<00:00:43.320> kind<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.649> bumps

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
support and that had these kind of bumps

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.770 
support and that had these kind of bumps
all<00:00:44.550> over<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.329> were<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.750> a

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
all over it they were there was a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.970 
all over it they were there was a
specific<00:00:46.230> name<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.860> calling

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
specific name for that I'm just calling

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.319 
specific name for that I'm just calling
a<00:00:47.070> box<00:00:47.250> because<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.610> no<00:00:47.730> idea<00:00:47.969> well<00:00:48.210> it's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
a box because I have no idea well it's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.430 
a box because I have no idea well it's
like<00:00:48.450> motion<00:00:48.629> capture<00:00:49.079> right<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.350> those

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
like motion capture right it's those

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.569 
like motion capture right it's those
little<00:00:49.530> tracking<00:00:49.890> dots<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.430> use<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
little tracking dots and they use a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
little tracking dots and they use a
camera<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.210> they<00:00:51.510> keep<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:52.079> keep<00:00:52.260> track<00:00:52.440> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
camera and they keep they keep track of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
camera and they keep they keep track of
where<00:00:52.739> those<00:00:52.890> are<00:00:53.129> relative<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> camera

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
where those are relative to the camera

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.209 
where those are relative to the camera
lens<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.170> move<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> says<00:00:55.710> okay<00:00:55.980> well

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
lens so as you move it says okay well

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.950 
lens so as you move it says okay well
there<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.670> those<00:00:56.760> dots<00:00:57.030> there<00:00:57.660> goes<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there go those dots there goes the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.959 
there go those dots there goes the
perspective<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> game<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> other

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
perspective in the game one of the other

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.760 
perspective in the game one of the other
things<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.210> added<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> new<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.649> their

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
things they added is a new what their

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
things they added is a new what their
labeling<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.280> improved<00:01:02.760> persistence<00:01:03.390> pixels

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
labeling as improved persistence pixels

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.800 
labeling as improved persistence pixels
now<00:01:04.530> flick<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.880> it's<00:01:06.450> sort<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
now flick on and off and it's sort of a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.480 
now flick on and off and it's sort of a
it's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> different<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.890> buffering<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it's a different way of buffering a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.370 
it's a different way of buffering a
frame<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> past<00:01:09.630> when<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> would<00:01:10.200> say

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
frame so in the past when you would say

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.289 
frame so in the past when you would say
strafe<00:01:10.740> left<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.850> rather<00:01:12.030> turn

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
strafe left and right but rather turn

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.940 
strafe left and right but rather turn
your<00:01:12.479> head<00:01:12.600> left<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.530> looking<00:01:13.830> at

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
your head left it right or looking at

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.350 
your head left it right or looking at
text<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.640> will<00:01:14.670> look<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> blurry<00:01:15.210> but

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
text it will look kind of blurry but

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.460 
text it will look kind of blurry but
things<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> lot<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:15.869> sharper<00:01:16.350> now

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
things are a lot more sharper now

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.070 
things are a lot more sharper now
especially<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.130> you're<00:01:17.280> pivoting<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.790> space

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
especially when you're pivoting in space

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.390 
especially when you're pivoting in space
and<00:01:19.080> for<00:01:19.320> me<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.799> first<00:01:20.189> time<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and for me this is the first time that

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
and for me this is the first time that
I've<00:01:20.610> tried<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> out<00:01:21.030> i<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:22.020> had

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
I've tried it out i have have not had

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
I've tried it out i have have not had
the<00:01:22.380> earlier<00:01:22.770> versions<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.369> which

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the earlier versions of this which

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.490 
the earlier versions of this which
didn't<00:01:23.939> work<00:01:23.970> quite<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.390> same<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
didn't work quite the same way and it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
didn't work quite the same way and it
really<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.430> amazingly<00:01:27.150> immersive

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
really is just this amazingly immersive

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
really is just this amazingly immersive
experience<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.189> look<00:01:29.430> down<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
experience like you you look down and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.819 
experience like you you look down and
you<00:01:29.939> expect<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:30.869> your<00:01:31.020> hands<00:01:31.290> reaching<00:01:31.680> up

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you expect to see your hands reaching up

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
you expect to see your hands reaching up
around<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.909> talking<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> guys

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
around you and talking with the guys

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.210 
around you and talking with the guys
they<00:01:33.750> were<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.020> well<00:01:34.229> yeah<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:35.009> not

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
they were like well yeah we're not

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
they were like well yeah we're not
ruling<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.729> possibility<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.630> but

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
ruling out the possibility of that but

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
ruling out the possibility of that but
it's<00:01:36.900> still<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.320> early<00:01:37.470> days<00:01:37.890> yeah<00:01:38.159> they're

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
it's still very early days yeah they're

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.440 
it's still very early days yeah they're
doing<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> lot<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.670> internal<00:01:38.970> testing<00:01:39.180> but

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
doing a lot of internal testing but

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.730 
doing a lot of internal testing but
right<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> important<00:01:40.409> things<00:01:40.439> is

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
right now one of the important things is

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.069 
right now one of the important things is
really<00:01:40.950> nailing<00:01:41.159> VR<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:42.390> VR<00:01:42.689> every

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
really nailing VR and with VR every

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870 
really nailing VR and with VR every
little<00:01:43.320> every<00:01:43.770> little<00:01:43.979> bit<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> tech<00:01:44.460> counts

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
little every little bit of tech counts

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.149 
little every little bit of tech counts
and<00:01:45.170> they<00:01:46.170> equated<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.649> building<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> house

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
and they equated it to building a house

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.590 
and they equated it to building a house
of<00:01:47.310> cards<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.820> everything<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.479> they're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of cards and everything that they're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.030 
of cards and everything that they're
adding<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> putting<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.439> improve

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
adding and putting the improve

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.130 
adding and putting the improve
persistence<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.079> positional<00:01:52.079> tracking

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
persistence and the positional tracking

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
persistence and the positional tracking
is<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.979> adding<00:01:53.130> another<00:01:53.430> card<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
is just adding another card to that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.429 
is just adding another card to that
house<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> getting<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> bigger<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.229> bigger

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
house and getting it bigger and bigger

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.929 
house and getting it bigger and bigger
until<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.070> full<00:01:56.280> realization<00:01:56.610> of

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
until you have the full realization of

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
until you have the full realization of
the<00:01:57.030> product<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.810> while<00:01:57.990> it'd<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.320> great<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the product so while it'd be great to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.440 
the product so while it'd be great to
have<00:01:58.770> shoulder<00:01:59.640> tracking<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.360> these

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
have shoulder tracking and all these

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.209 
have shoulder tracking and all these
individual<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.110> digits<00:02:01.500> moving<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
individual like digits moving in the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.920 
individual like digits moving in the
game<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.939> still<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> ways<00:02:03.329> off<00:02:03.540> they're<00:02:03.780> still

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
game it's still a ways off they're still

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.149 
game it's still a ways off they're still
working<00:02:04.020> really<00:02:04.320> hard<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.950> finished

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
working really hard to get this finished

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.219 
working really hard to get this finished
and<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.790> Crystal<00:02:06.090> Cove<00:02:06.210> prototype<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.049> they

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and the Crystal Cove prototype that they

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.199 
and the Crystal Cove prototype that they
showed<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:08.160> fragile<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.789> 3d<00:02:09.030> print

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
showed very fragile is like 3d print

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.550 
showed very fragile is like 3d print
display<00:02:09.509> these<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:09.899> things<00:02:09.929> added<00:02:10.349> on<00:02:10.440> to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
display these little things added on to

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.530 
display these little things added on to
it<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.160> we're<00:02:11.310> still<00:02:11.459> far<00:02:11.670> aways<00:02:11.849> away<00:02:11.879> they're

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it so we're still far aways away they're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.900 
it so we're still far aways away they're
not

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
not

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.610 
not

 consumer model yet but all these

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.840 
 consumer model yet but all these
things<00:02:14.830> will<00:02:15.010> be<00:02:15.160> available<00:02:15.400> when<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
things will be available when that

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.610 
things will be available when that
shifts<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.270> thing<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.020> they<00:02:17.110> were<00:02:17.170> using<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
shifts the thing that they were using to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.560 
shifts the thing that they were using to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
field of view yeah you were essentially

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.620 
field of view yeah you were essentially
a<00:02:32.920> player<00:02:33.220> looking<00:02:33.730> over<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> game<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.540> was
