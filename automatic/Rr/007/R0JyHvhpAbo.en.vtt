00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.070 
troops was all sent from my village
because<00:03:50.920> there<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.280> no<00:03:51.459> troops<00:03:51.819> left<00:03:52.569> like

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
because there is no troops left like

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.150 
because there is no troops left like
five<00:03:53.410> Coverly<00:03:54.300> now<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.330> will<00:03:55.930> add<00:03:56.200> just<00:03:56.260> the

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
five Coverly now I will add just the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.290 
five Coverly now I will add just the
true<00:03:57.489> interval<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.950> can<00:03:59.980> do<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.489> on<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.000> start

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
true interval you can do it on the start

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.900 
true interval you can do it on the start
but<00:04:01.540> I<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.230> wanted<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.709> show<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.700> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
but I just wanted to show you that the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.240 
but I just wanted to show you that the
current<00:04:04.239> US<00:04:04.510> target<00:04:04.900> will<00:04:05.080> not<00:04:05.260> change<00:04:05.560> if

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
current US target will not change if

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.650 
current US target will not change if
there<00:04:06.549> will<00:04:06.700> be<00:04:06.760> no<00:04:07.410> units<00:04:08.410> on<00:04:08.560> place<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:09.730> what

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
there will be no units on place so what

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.289 
there will be no units on place so what
will<00:04:10.900> not<00:04:11.140> go<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.560> day<00:04:11.920> level<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:14.580> it<00:04:15.580> actually

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
will not go to day level and it actually

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.979 
will not go to day level and it actually
didn't<00:04:17.079> send<00:04:17.380> any<00:04:17.680> troops<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.780> previous<00:04:19.780> one

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
didn't send any troops to previous one

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.950 
didn't send any troops to previous one
because<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:21.430> were<00:04:21.579> no<00:04:21.850> troops<00:04:22.120> on<00:04:24.600> on<00:04:25.600> the

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
because there were no troops on on the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.480 
because there were no troops on on the
right<00:04:26.169> point<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:28.350> usually<00:04:29.350> set<00:04:29.620> interval<00:04:30.250> to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
right point I usually set interval to

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.409 
right point I usually set interval to
one<00:04:30.520> minute<00:04:31.510> but<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.380> also<00:04:33.190> add<00:04:33.640> random

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
one minute but I also add random

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.140 
one minute but I also add random
interval<00:04:35.200> and<00:04:36.039> I<00:04:36.550> set<00:04:36.850> it<00:04:36.880> from<00:04:37.300> 0<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:39.220> 1<00:04:39.430> which

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
interval and I set it from 0 to 1 which

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.200 
interval and I set it from 0 to 1 which
gives<00:04:40.419> me<00:04:40.710> 60<00:04:41.710> seconds<00:04:42.160> randomly<00:04:43.169> 55<00:04:44.169> 45<00:04:45.210> 20

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
gives me 60 seconds randomly 55 45 20

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.000 
gives me 60 seconds randomly 55 45 20
and<00:04:46.479> so<00:04:46.690> on<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:49.000> will<00:04:49.720> be<00:04:49.930> added<00:04:50.110> every

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
and so on and it will be added every

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:58.469 
and so on and it will be added every
time<00:04:53.340> every<00:04:54.340> time<00:04:54.370> oh<00:04:55.680> okay<00:04:56.710> I<00:04:56.860> said<00:04:57.550> interval

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
time every time oh okay I said interval

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.950 
time every time oh okay I said interval
for<00:04:58.750> all<00:04:58.990> those

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.920 

all<00:05:03.080> those<00:05:05.380> cost<00:05:06.380> argot<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.360> every<00:05:08.360> time<00:05:08.569> what

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
all those cost argot and every time what

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.670 
all those cost argot and every time what
will<00:05:09.229> set<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.889> next<00:05:10.130> task<00:05:10.699> target<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:12.289> will

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
will set the next task target it will

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.999 
will set the next task target it will
add<00:05:13.360> interval<00:05:14.360> as<00:05:14.720> well<00:05:15.110> as<00:05:15.319> random<00:05:16.250> interval

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
add interval as well as random interval

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:23.800 
add interval as well as random interval
which<00:05:19.009> means<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:21.610> but<00:05:22.610> we'll<00:05:22.819> try<00:05:23.000> randomly

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
which means that but we'll try randomly

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.070 
which means that but we'll try randomly
send<00:05:25.930> troops<00:05:27.280> not<00:05:28.280> the<00:05:28.759> if<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.389> want<00:05:29.720> like

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
send troops not the if you want like

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.800 
send troops not the if you want like
random<00:05:30.500> in<00:05:30.620> Java<00:05:31.009> but<00:05:31.400> will<00:05:31.610> try<00:05:31.880> every<00:05:32.569> 1

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
random in Java but will try every 1

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.379 
random in Java but will try every 1
minute<00:05:34.570> every<00:05:35.570> time<00:05:36.259> it<00:05:36.590> will<00:05:36.770> be<00:05:36.919> the<00:05:37.099> same

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
minute every time it will be the same

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.680 
minute every time it will be the same
time<00:05:38.389> span<00:05:39.099> it<00:05:40.099> will<00:05:40.310> be<00:05:40.430> 1<00:05:40.610> minute<00:05:40.940> so<00:05:41.419> it's

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
time span it will be 1 minute so it's

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.010 
time span it will be 1 minute so it's
not<00:05:42.320> very<00:05:42.800> convenient<00:05:43.370> for<00:05:43.820> you<00:05:43.970> because<00:05:44.240> it

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
not very convenient for you because it

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.560 
not very convenient for you because it
can<00:05:45.470> be<00:05:45.710> detected<00:05:46.160> as<00:05:46.759> something<00:05:47.830> unhuman<00:05:49.570> so

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
can be detected as something unhuman so

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.399 
can be detected as something unhuman so
better<00:05:50.930> just<00:05:51.470> at<00:05:52.009> I<00:05:52.550> don't<00:05:53.060> know<00:05:53.270> from<00:05:53.599> 0<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.050> 2

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
better just at I don't know from 0 to 2

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.550 
better just at I don't know from 0 to 2
or<00:05:54.830> 0<00:05:55.130> to<00:05:55.159> 1<00:05:55.490> random<00:05:56.000> interval<00:05:56.449> and<00:05:57.110> then<00:05:57.259> ok

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
or 0 to 1 random interval and then ok

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.140 
or 0 to 1 random interval and then ok
and<00:05:57.590> as<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.370> can<00:05:58.490> see<00:05:58.550> now<00:05:59.979> my<00:06:00.979> test<00:06:01.310> target<00:06:01.909> is

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
and as you can see now my test target is

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.899 
and as you can see now my test target is
we're<00:06:02.780> waiting<00:06:03.349> pending<00:06:04.720> and<00:06:06.460> yeah<00:06:07.460> I<00:06:07.759> just

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:07.909 
we're waiting pending and yeah I just

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:12.700 
we're waiting pending and yeah I just
switched<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:08.930> and<00:06:09.110> it<00:06:10.009> will<00:06:10.310> be<00:06:11.289> but<00:06:12.289> we'll<00:06:12.500> try

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
switched it and it will be but we'll try

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.379 
switched it and it will be but we'll try
to<00:06:12.830> send<00:06:13.250> it<00:06:13.430> a<00:06:13.699> little<00:06:15.280> often

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:23.659 

not<00:06:18.960> previously<00:06:21.590> okay<00:06:22.590> and<00:06:22.830> that's<00:06:23.159> it<00:06:23.370> and

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
not previously okay and that's it and

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.719 
not previously okay and that's it and
that<00:06:23.970> way<00:06:24.150> I<00:06:24.180> form<00:06:24.870> all<00:06:25.229> these<00:06:25.740> villages<00:06:26.250> with

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
that way I form all these villages with

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.950 
that way I form all these villages with
all<00:06:27.090> my<00:06:27.539> groups<00:06:28.349> which<00:06:28.770> I<00:06:28.979> already<00:06:29.340> have<00:06:29.960> yeah

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.219 
all my groups which I already have yeah
my<00:06:31.919> troops<00:06:32.539> just<00:06:33.539> returned<00:06:33.990> from<00:06:34.349> a<00:06:35.159> journey

anyway in that way you can farm

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:43.019 
anyway in that way you can farm
