 even at night five policemen guarded it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.970
 the place is known which is approximately

 Bernard Kozlov reported that the black box 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.310
 which found the day before damaged but 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.110
 you can read the snow data on it yourself 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.360
 fight stored negotiations between 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.430
 pilots experts say that in 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 depending on the state of the black box 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.750
 decryption may take from several 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.600
 days to several weeks 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.610
 but still need to find 2 black box than 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.310
 now and the yoke is busy hence the place 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.680
 but today the Provencal Alps should 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.439
 there will also be leaders of France and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.299

 rahoi their angel merkel 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.009
 it is known that they are waiting for the first group 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.229
 relatives apparently for identification 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.850
 victims as reported by a journalist and who 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.329
 work at the scene 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 Now the representatives of the media are asking to leave 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.890
 from building improvised temporarily them 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.950
 hours to gather relatives as well 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.080
 it is possible without exaggeration to have us 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.459
 international x previously reported that 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.930
 most of the passengers were 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.800
 representatives of germany 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:22.430
 spain and turkey but here are the new data that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.349
 on board were also the game of Britain 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.569
 Mexico and Japan and this agency 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.150
 France-press representatives of Belgium and 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.670
 denmark australia colombia argentina 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.620
 one of the dead is a Soviet opera singer 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.709
 Oleg Bryndak 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.060
 I became known more happy 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.430
 cases and for example 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.310
 women's football team that was 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.290
 in Barcelona at the camp picks tickets 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.690
 it is this rice but in the end 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.319
 preferred other flights that way 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.420
 football players saved their lives from Germany 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.280
 there are reports that a low-fire 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.260
 Jerman Wings was forced to cancel 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.959
 several flights from stuttgart and 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.510
 dusseldorf crews simply fear 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.880
 fly on an airbus x 320 though from this 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.640
 tragedy this model was considered one of 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.319
 safest in the world but the company 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.540
 lufthansa which belongs 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.790
 loukosterov Jerman Wings calls yet 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.010
 not and speculates on the tragedy and wait 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.609
 data investigation suggest to listen 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.859
 opinion of representatives of leganza 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.930
 miss precipitation is a tragic moment for 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.790
 our company first I want 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.930
 express condolences to relatives 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.850
 the dead 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.739
 for lufthansa the main thing now 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.180
 focus on investigating 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.230
 This moment we think it is 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.359
 accident 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.579
 other versions would be speculation 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.590
 if we talk about a half hour delay 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.840
 flight then we find out its reasons 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.220
 I can say one thing if there were 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.609
 technical issues 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:51.650
 type would not be allowed to fly but German 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.230
 building spiegel reports that after all 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.359
 there were some airbus before departure 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.459
 technical problems jammed the door 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.340
 compartment in which is usually removed 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.859
 the nose gear is unclear whether it could 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.840
 somehow affect the flight could become 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:07.609
 cause tragedy now if 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.290
 consider yourself come 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.819
 including even a terrorist attack or some 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.510
 criminal incident on board 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.099
 but according to the leaves 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.629
 this morning's antenna this version 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.720
 can not be called 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:21.329
 mainstream french experts suggested 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.040
 your script what's possible in the cabin and 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.600
 even in the cockpit happened 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.690
 fire caught fire 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.370
 because of the smoke because of the fire the crew could 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.070
 to lose consciousness therefore did not have time 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.020
 nothing sociability I repeat that 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.880
 preliminary data alone 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.229
 decoding found onboard 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.780
 the recorder may take from several 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.419
 days to several weeks 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.520
 Irina thank you bathroom wanted to add that 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.979
 Lufthansa has already said that she will perform 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.389
 terrace and abandoned by the pilot 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.770
 john winx 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.539
 so nothing wrong with flights 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.590
 happen thanks on a direct connection with 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.880
 we were our special correspondent 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.530
 in paris she is boldin and meanwhile on 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.720
 the crash site resumed the search 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.360
 experts work out different versions 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.870
 causes of disaster the main unfortunate 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.419
 happening 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.220
 but the attacks still do not exclude 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.610
 More in detail our European correspondent 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.199
 anastasia popova 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.360
 exploration started at dawn 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.490
 a helicopter of 30 work experts at 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.949
 the mountains flew to the wreck of the liner 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.500
 do not have to define the perimeter of work in 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.449
 the same time 65 gendarmes got the task 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.940
 pave the pedestrian route to the gorge 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.010
 to get there 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.900
 forensics all night in french 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.699
 the Alps it was snowing with rain five 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.310
 gendarmes left in place 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.199
 report scree to me from the slopes where 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.970
 the liner wreckage lies and we don't 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.979
 touched nothing until profit arrived 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.440
 no one touched the investigators 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.150
 there is still work for many days 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.860
 transcript of the negotiations pilots 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.080
 expects to get to the end 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.169
 weeks you can be the key to understanding 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.360
 what happened to the airbus a320 like 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.400
 only he crossed the border of france why 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.949
 within 8 minutes he was down 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.659
 and did not give a distress call 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.120
 depressurization or pilot error but their 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.180
 considered one of the best dishes of hanz for 10 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.949
 years they flew about 6000 hours can 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.320
 they were already unconscious because not 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.820
 responded to the dispatchers' requests for reasons 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.310
 there could be a fire on board 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.050
 bad weather factor power experts 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.300
 fires they are excluded at the time of the crash 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.000
 it was sunny over the french alps 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.710
 visibility is good eyewitnesses have not heard 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.290
 explosions say the plane was flying too 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.870
 low and almost silent as if 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.850
 planned with engines off 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.430
 French authorities are sure this was not a terrorist act 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.380
 priority version is now a failure of equipment 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.330
 the more so since the day before the ship accident 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.300
 already broke it had to be repaired 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.060
 the conflict the plane wrecks are scattered on 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.100
 4 hectares of land at different heights 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.770
 some tend to reach 60 meters 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.020

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.060
 flight barcelona düsseldorf just not 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.600
 there was practically nothing 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.670
 left 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.750

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.270
 two portholes 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.830
 there were 16 schoolchildren among the passengers 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.230
