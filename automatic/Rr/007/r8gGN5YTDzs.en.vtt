keeps cutting off on you these are a few
of<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.949> symptoms<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.820> come<00:00:30.000> from

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
of the symptoms that can come from

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.870 
of the symptoms that can come from
terrible<00:00:30.900> adhesives<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.740> batty<00:00:31.949> sensor<00:00:32.399> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
terrible adhesives or a batty sensor and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180 
terrible adhesives or a batty sensor and
basically<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.020> happens<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> when<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
basically what happens is when the the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.549 
basically what happens is when the the
heat<00:00:35.399> sensor<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.730> bad<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.930> it'll<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
heat sensor is bad what it'll do is

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
heat sensor is bad what it'll do is
it'll<00:00:38.690> it'll<00:00:39.690> trick<00:00:40.050> car<00:00:40.350> into<00:00:40.530> thinking<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it'll it'll trick car into thinking that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.100 
it'll it'll trick car into thinking that
it<00:00:41.040> needs<00:00:41.219> more<00:00:41.430> fuel<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.969> it'll<00:00:42.750> dump<00:00:43.020> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
it needs more fuel and it'll dump a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.360 
it needs more fuel and it'll dump a
whole<00:00:43.290> bunch<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.590> fuel<00:00:43.770> into<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> combustion

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
whole bunch of fuel into the combustion

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.540 
whole bunch of fuel into the combustion
chamber<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.180> ready<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.989> if

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
chamber when it's not ready for it so if

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.500 
chamber when it's not ready for it so if
you've<00:00:47.550> been<00:00:47.579> having<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.030> problem<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.480> can

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
you've been having this problem you can

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
you've been having this problem you can
also<00:00:48.750> mess<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.500> spark<00:00:49.710> plugs

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
also mess up your spark plugs

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.220 
also mess up your spark plugs
maybe<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.270> got<00:00:51.449> needed<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> change<00:00:52.140> your

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
maybe you got needed to change your

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
maybe you got needed to change your
spark<00:00:52.469> plugs<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:52.949> you're<00:00:53.100> done<00:00:53.219> changing

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
spark plugs when you're done changing

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.229 
spark plugs when you're done changing
the<00:00:54.449> speed<00:00:54.660> sensor<00:00:54.840> too<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.940> with<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.030> said

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the speed sensor too so with that said

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
the speed sensor too so with that said
now<00:00:57.870> hopefully<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> little<00:00:58.859> bit

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
now hopefully you know a little bit

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.619 
now hopefully you know a little bit
about<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> problem<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> let's<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.329> ahead<00:01:00.420> and

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
about the problem and let's go ahead and

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.970 
about the problem and let's go ahead and
change<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.899> heat<00:01:01.199> sensor<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.710> see<00:01:01.800> what<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
change that heat sensor and see what it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
change that heat sensor and see what it
does<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.280> your<00:01:02.399> car<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.660> tool<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.140> used

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
does for your car the tool that I used

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.469 
does for your car the tool that I used
for<00:01:04.739> today<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.280> adjustable<00:01:05.909> wrench<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
for today was this adjustable wrench and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
for today was this adjustable wrench and
you<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> 19<00:01:08.369> millimeter

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you could also use a 19 millimeter

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.170 
you could also use a 19 millimeter
wrench<00:01:09.030> instead<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> believe<00:01:10.610> try<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.850> tell

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
wrench instead I believe try it and tell

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.810 
wrench instead I believe try it and tell
me<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> works<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.070> okay<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
me that works out for you okay so the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.130 
me that works out for you okay so the
first<00:01:15.000> thing<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.360> need<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.869> identify

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
first thing we need to do is identify

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.359 
first thing we need to do is identify
the<00:01:16.650> sensor

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the sensor

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
the sensor
now<00:01:17.850> there's<00:01:18.210> three<00:01:18.509> electrical<00:01:19.439> looking

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
now there's three electrical looking

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
now there's three electrical looking
pieces<00:01:19.950> right<00:01:20.220> here's<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.880> piece<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
pieces right here's this piece here to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
pieces right here's this piece here to
the<00:01:21.570> far<00:01:21.720> left<00:01:21.750> bar<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.560> which<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> can

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the far left bar right which you can

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.980 
the far left bar right which you can
actually<00:01:23.130> see<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.610> more<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> vacuum<00:01:24.810> piece

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
actually see is more of a vacuum piece

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.929 
actually see is more of a vacuum piece
it's<00:01:25.229> got<00:01:25.350> vacuum<00:01:25.710> hose<00:01:25.860> attached<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.460> but

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
it's got vacuum hose attached to it but

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.190 
it's got vacuum hose attached to it but
then<00:01:27.119> you've<00:01:27.240> got<00:01:27.390> two<00:01:27.600> electrical

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
then you've got two electrical

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.510 
then you've got two electrical
connectors<00:01:28.619> right<00:01:28.680> here<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.220> we're<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
connectors right here so we're going to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.429 
connectors right here so we're going to
zoom<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> right<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.350> the

you get it out there obviously you're

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.990 
you get it out there obviously you're
getting<00:03:09.030> a<00:03:09.120> drain<00:03:09.450> pin<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:11.640> guys<00:03:11.790> stick

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
getting a drain pin and you guys stick
