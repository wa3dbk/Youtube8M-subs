00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.400
 they are all boys and welcome back to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.590
 this new video is falling fort 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.029
 of the staff of the last team does italia e 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 today we are here with the second episode 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.190
 of the very large series companies 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 understood today we are here in bijoux codes 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.800
 be easy grapes 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.879
 the militant Russian striker in the spartak 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.860
 Moscow 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.440
 then this player but guys but 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.870
 how strong it is but how strong I am 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.940
 said but from the statistics it seems a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.550
 disk a player with 78 speeds at 80 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 of shooting 71 the dribbling pass 70 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.680
 33 of physical defense 84 and an 80 of 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.089
 general value then what it consists of 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.440
 misunderstood legends maybe you don't have 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.150
 got it right 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.290
 we're going to analyze players 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.800
 that in food are not used that cost 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.060
 little 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.700
 therefore juba costs 700 700 credits costs 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.370
 and does not use anyone or alloys 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 Russian I see I always see doumbia 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.840
 modern rondon doumbia muse i dont have 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 never seen sincerely and if either 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.100
 in the red team then where we're going 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.409
 to analyze to this type of player 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.840
 we should say if these players are worth 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 so it's worth using them if they are 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.090
 misunderstood legends understood if you do not understand 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.310
 leave me a little comment that I explain 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.329
 better, however, let's start analyzing 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.859
 dzyuba zimba then we start from 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:50.759
 speed speed that is not very good 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:53.130
 but helped by that very powerful one 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.320
 of very powerful physical strength 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.049
 very powerful player even if he has 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.479
 only a 74 acceleration is an 81 of 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.689
 maximum speed nothing of that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.210
 this is definitely the wow wow shot 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.330
 wow 82 of finalization that it seems 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.380
 much more really a lot more 77's 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.280
 longshot with 83 shooting power then 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.260
 shooting is certainly one of the qualities 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.780
 along with dribbling the header 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.750
 of zuma that struck me most because 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.850
 really you inside the area 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.140
 one out of the area hardly any 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.520
 wrong 1 then we also yes 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.410
 4 stars weak foot 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.170
 yes even of accident we say that not 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.670
 he really misses his shot though 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.220
 player is 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.470
 look I read a comment on ted ziu 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.870
 brahimovic and he is right at 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.209
 the passage is really right 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.480
 of the passage nothing that will do of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.430
 shores maybe even head 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.530
 good passages for wings i 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.290
 I recommend using it as a unique tip 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.239
 given also other than average then 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.760
 it will not be often in midfield but it will be 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.190
 always where thanks also to 79 of 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.410
 positioning the dribbling is one of the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.500
 human factors that I like best 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.810
 because he cries with a lot of fluidity, not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.880
 I know why it is absolutely 30 of agility 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.000
 34 of balance and 60 of jump but he is 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.790
 too agile he is too hadid and thirty 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.360
 of agility in a not existing in heaven 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.959
 nor on earth for then that of stamina 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.630
 Well I really do not get tired there he 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.299
 it must not certainly must not run 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.190
 too, however, as you see in the actions 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.410
 of the clips he will take the ball from 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.480
 three quarters maybe you do 230m onwards there 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.010
 download a violent shot in the door and 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.530
 it's always goals 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.930
 84 and physical wow as I said before with a 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.570
 92 of physical strength precisely this 60 of 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.200
 jump and we have an 86 header 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:56.870
 a precise 86 is a value 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.180
 very good and thanks also to that meter e 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 94 who is tall I don't know what they gave him from 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.790
 eat from this child not here 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.349
 so boh you see that they gave him 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.430
 a whole guinea pig for 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.019
 breakfast I don't know what to say this 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.609
 player is a misunderstood legend 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.509
 I think it's really a legend 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:20.449
 misunderstood we say that it is stronger 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:22.580
 violon don I can't compare it to busa 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.080
 because they have muse and doumbia because they have 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.639
 completely different features 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.490
 he has an area striker of 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.350
 those that break through and usually these 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.960
 strikers in a year so much speed but 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.180
 however he also quite fast 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.250
 I see a good 90 of best rating on fruit 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.490
 and therefore also which su have us 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.320
 seen well and therefore try this 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.240
 player to force you must 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.750
 absolutely try this player 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.970
 because it is because you have to try 700 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.380
 welcome you have a pretty beast seen 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.870
 forget about weapons that this player 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.039
 three-star skill 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.169
 boh I still managed to 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:01.400
 ringing but he certainly is not one 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:04.759
 skill and I recco then as I found myself 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.590
 zuba is definitely promoted on paper 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.539
 very good player look at the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.280
 statistics on twitter because it has not 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:14.659
 too many green mesh values between sold 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:18.080
 on the delicious orange then klose yes 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.020
 klose liuba in play is good you have seen 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.539
 from her clip uncle but for me then company 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.039
 for me it is a very good player 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:29.900
 to any type of ground ball game 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:32.690
 long ball cross and pedal 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.190
 ball in the middle for the wings therefore 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.909
 guys hope this video and movie 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.889
 both liked it 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:38.870
 leave me a nice me and there 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.320
 we hear in a next video bye 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.320
 boys
