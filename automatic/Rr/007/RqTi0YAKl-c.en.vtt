00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.150
 if they lower the high gasoline prices now his secret is more on 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.950
 the ice 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.810
 but you always think somehow too 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.530
 You can not do anything anyway but that's not true because there is already 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.250
 Possibility more fuel costs case a trick to beat them all the way 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.020
 can personally fight against high fuel costs what in the future everything 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.360
 better when we all benefit from the car magazine service of 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.349
 Marius Zimmermann 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.160
 the lienen 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.610
 the oil companies turn again vigorously at the price screw whether holiday or 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.920
 oil crisis has every opportunity to introduce 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.530
 Now motorists are fed up 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.110
 Falling sales in April a minus of eleven percent to the gas stations 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.580
 the company must with the yes-word story if it goes even more often 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.700
 considering getting Gabi Sauter away from 1 10 to 1 2 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 even both a nice extra 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 The fact is there were much less 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.240
 here at the technical University Chemnitz will save new fuel the 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.170
 booked him 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.990
 Last work on a vehicle at the so-called Eco Marathon in 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.519
 Southern France should participate 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.000
 Werner the most fuel-efficient car in the world visits SID an incredible consumption 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.950
 from White lives, says an insider 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.860
 more children with a maximum of 40 made faster progress 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 and both sell about we only come six liters 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.360
 to gasoline for 100 kilometers 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.960
 from the extremely light 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.480
 They want to break records 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.480
 what is possible and that the route starts from him 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.830
 less futuristic but more popular Eko instead of ovation 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.070
 Fuel savings through optimized engine electronics Savings potential 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.070
 allegedly up to 20 percent with every car 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.880
 to take our lives 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.090
 a let's change that 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.160
 a sparrow time 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.470
 when diesel or gasoline time 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.960
 a petrol engine 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.760
 especially threatening optimal combustion 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.090
 one out of 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.990
 Saving how big is the fuel saving potential we were unsure 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.990
 and a test track of one hundred kilometers 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.190
 and apparently 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.540
 all the way to the gas station 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.590
 our consumed 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.249
 they get 4 7 liters of diesel 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.739
 and then to the workshop 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.230
 the mother control unit to connect to the computer read data optimize 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.559
 and get up again 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.819
 after two hours that is authoritarian 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.900
 we go to the second round of testing the same distance in the same 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.930
 Driving time the amazing result 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.790
 Sex com to 5 7 liters a liter or twelve percent saved 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.699
 the question remains 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.650
 why the manufacturers do not set the cars right away with fuel-efficient 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.619
 deliver 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.779
 would the vehicle manufacturer with each other vehicles like this 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.739
 intensively deal with the first duel 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.499
 from the spring makes a kart for his father 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:46.389
 would the market price and paint 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:47.499
 Derad 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.549
 great know-how studs that 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.209
 the end consumer would have to pay with that and drive into the market 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.379
 does justice 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.370
 who wants to save without intervening in the engine electronics yesterday on 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.349
 Alternative fuels such as natural gas and electricity or want to fall back 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.559
 Popular 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.009
 the Jews are 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.979
 how suitable for everyday use and how well the cheap biodiesel fuel is today 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:12.349
 a nine-strong German Belgian team in the last three weeks prove 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.169
 once on the occasion of the night 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.489
 25 thousand kilometers across the Americas a real one 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.819
 proving ground 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.439
 because for the first time the extreme tour should only with alternatives 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.339
 Be coped with fuels 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:30.539
 To create the spectacular route partly only under police protection 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:34.579
 there 15 days and after eleven and a half hours they were at the finish in Argentine 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.210
 Ushuaia the southernmost city in the world 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.639
 world Record 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.109
 save the Chemnitzer fuel and now has a whole in the south of France 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.109
 to pass another test, Barbara HÃ¶ll was to be heard 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.559
 we demand 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:53.129
 how deep can the cards are being sold 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.779
 everything is on the market 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.569
 Features 742 kilometers with 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.469
 for a liter of gasoline 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.529
 good job 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.560
 but it was not enough for the world record 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.560
 less than 3800 kilometers 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.339
 the rule circles 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.609
 no obligation there are alternatives 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.769
 if all three lose and use less fuel the 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.049
 Corporations are reacting and prices finally return from diversity 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.559
 Leading lights 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.680
 the world as a guest with friends 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.030
 That is reality on our roads since there are foreign ones 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.500
 Cars without end but how
