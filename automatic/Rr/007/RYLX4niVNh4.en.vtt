00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.790 
millimeter hole will be i'm using 120
millimeter<00:00:34.760> hole<00:00:34.970> because<00:00:35.470> that<00:00:36.470> will<00:00:36.649> be

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
millimeter hole because that will be

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.950 

just<00:01:43.960> about<00:01:44.200> some<00:01:44.440> work<00:01:45.240> lots<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.390> sanding<00:01:46.840> to

just about some work lots of sanding to

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.800 
just about some work lots of sanding to
do<00:01:47.110> but<00:01:47.909> yeah<00:01:48.909> this<00:01:49.150> is<00:01:49.210> what<00:01:49.420> I'm<00:01:49.510> doing<00:01:49.720> right

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
do but yeah this is what I'm doing right

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.020 
do but yeah this is what I'm doing right
now<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.409> I'm<00:01:51.130> still<00:01:51.370> debating<00:01:51.520> on<00:01:51.850> whether

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
now so I'm still debating on whether

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.370 
now so I'm still debating on whether
it's<00:01:52.210> really<00:01:52.420> going<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.600> be<00:01:52.659> worth<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.140> but<00:01:53.350> I

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
it's really going to be worth it but I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.109 
it's really going to be worth it but I
think<00:01:53.470> in<00:01:53.979> terms<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.580> what<00:01:54.790> it's<00:01:54.940> going<00:01:55.000> to

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
think in terms of what it's going to

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.350 
think in terms of what it's going to
look<00:01:55.210> like<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:57.310> functionality<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.090> it

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
look like and the functionality of it

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.900 
look like and the functionality of it
over<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.950> fact<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.369> whole<00:02:00.550> is<00:02:00.580> going<00:02:00.850> to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
over the fact that the whole is going to

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.330 
over the fact that the whole is going to
be<00:02:01.030> kind<00:02:01.300> of<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.800> mean<00:02:02.800> I'm<00:02:02.979> going<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.160> try<00:02:03.310> to

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
be kind of I mean I'm going to try to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.859 
be kind of I mean I'm going to try to
work<00:02:03.550> around<00:02:03.700> keeping<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.330> feat<00:02:04.690> in<00:02:04.810> the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
work around keeping this feat in the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.980 
work around keeping this feat in the
stock<00:02:05.080> location<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:07.210> like<00:02:07.360> say<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.750> will<00:02:07.900> be

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
stock location so like say this will be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.930 
stock location so like say this will be
right<00:02:08.200> here<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.740> don't<00:02:09.459> have<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.610> totally

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
right here I don't have a totally

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.130 
right here I don't have a totally
measured<00:02:10.270> out<00:02:10.390> yet<00:02:10.660> but<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.899> know<00:02:10.989> I'll<00:02:11.110> have

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
measured out yet but you know I'll have

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.559 
measured out yet but you know I'll have
to<00:02:11.380> go<00:02:11.530> around<00:02:12.030> each<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.180> these<00:02:13.239> because<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
to go around each of these because the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.530 
to go around each of these because the
power<00:02:13.780> supply<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.110> kind<00:02:14.350> of<00:02:14.410> offset<00:02:14.920> because<00:02:15.700> I

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
power supply is kind of offset because I

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.080 
power supply is kind of offset because I
actually<00:02:16.989> be<00:02:17.380> more<00:02:17.560> like<00:02:17.709> yeah<00:02:18.550> be<00:02:18.790> more<00:02:18.940> like

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
actually be more like yeah be more like

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.160 
actually be more like yeah be more like
that<00:02:19.470> because<00:02:20.470> uh<00:02:20.670> mmm<00:02:21.670> feets<00:02:22.630> here<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.080> then

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
that because uh mmm feets here and then

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.170 
that because uh mmm feets here and then
the<00:02:23.260> motherboard<00:02:23.620> tray<00:02:23.800> sits<00:02:24.519> right<00:02:24.700> here<00:02:24.760> so

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
the motherboard tray sits right here so

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.580 
the motherboard tray sits right here so
this<00:02:25.300> will<00:02:25.510> actually<00:02:25.600> be<00:02:25.870> more<00:02:26.080> towards<00:02:26.410> this

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
this will actually be more towards this

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.310 
this will actually be more towards this
side<00:02:26.860> then<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:27.970> will<00:02:28.150> this<00:02:28.300> side<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.050> think

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
side then I will this side so I think

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.610 
side then I will this side so I think
it's<00:02:29.440> something<00:02:29.709> around

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
it's something around

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.500 
it's something around
right<00:02:31.620> there<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.100> believe<00:02:32.250> it'll<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:33.180> something

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
right there I believe it'll be something

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.480 
right there I believe it'll be something
like<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.870> because<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> five<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
like that because this is a five and a

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.100 
like that because this is a five and a
half<00:02:35.550> inch<00:02:35.820> regular<00:02:36.210> power<00:02:36.450> supply<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:36.960> is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
half inch regular power supply this is

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.230 
half inch regular power supply this is
where<00:02:37.260> my<00:02:37.410> power<00:02:37.710> supply<00:02:37.890> sits<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.120> you

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
where my power supply sits and you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.150 
where my power supply sits and you
figure<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.750> ever<00:02:40.050> upgrade<00:02:40.320> or<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:40.860> i<00:02:40.920> sold

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
figure if I ever upgrade or if i sold

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.940 
figure if I ever upgrade or if i sold
this<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.580> someone<00:02:41.730> had<00:02:41.940> like<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.170> corsair<00:02:43.170> 1000

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
this and someone had like a corsair 1000

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.330 
this and someone had like a corsair 1000
that's<00:02:44.820> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.180> off<00:02:45.390> about<00:02:45.570> right<00:02:45.870> here

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
that's going to go off about right here

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.370 
that's going to go off about right here
so<00:02:47.340> i<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.700> figure<00:02:47.880> all<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.120> in<00:02:48.480> so

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
so i have to figure all that in so

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.160 
so i have to figure all that in so
that's<00:02:50.280> about<00:02:50.490> it<00:02:50.610> guys<00:02:50.760> more<00:02:51.750> updates<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
that's about it guys more updates to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.760 
that's about it guys more updates to
come<00:02:52.370> see<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.400> guys<00:02:53.550> later
