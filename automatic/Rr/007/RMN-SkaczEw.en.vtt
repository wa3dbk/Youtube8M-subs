Hey, kids and welcome to PDRsan's Rubbish Bin

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.820
Today I'll be playing Tobacotchi

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.160
I'm guessing it's going to be a game where

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.160
you raise a Tamagotchi with a smoking problem

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.933
Speaking of tobaco

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.585
I used to smoke...

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.132
in university

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.340
for maybe a year or two

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.500
The first group of people I hung out with in uni all smoked

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.820
In between classes they'd all go to the smoking area and I'd go along with them

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.220
Then all of sudden I was smoking too D:

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.221
I wish I never smoked...

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.580
Let's do this

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.540
Definitely not a Tamagotchi game...

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.660
How to play

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.020
Smoke cigarettes and shorten your life

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.740
Keep the game going by smoking the filter end

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.980
If you smoke the end that's lit up game over

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.340
Tap the screen to flip the cigarette around

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.060
So we've got to give this guy lung cancer

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.980
You shortened your life by 16 days

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.760
Pretty meh

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.000
It's crap

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.680
not so crap that it's funny

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.480
and the game actually works

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.460
It's as meh as the first Captain America movie

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.840
I give this game]

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.680
- Meh Latte Nyan Points

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.940
The world is full of crappy apps

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.280
if you know of any please let me know ^^

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.360
Also Chandler may say things like

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.740
but he's wrong! Smoking isn't cool!!!

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.420
and if you are going to smoke

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.460
at least wait until the legal age

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.839
See you tomorrow(^o^)/
