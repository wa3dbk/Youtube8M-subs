00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.310
 and then gang beauty'm here our 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:10.040
 second video in the second class to 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.040
 continue to mount our magic cube there 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 right before we learned to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.330
 cross-mount with the sides with exposed 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.359
 corresponding monthly colors to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.359
 People are going to learn how to ride the kines. 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.070
 is this corner serve 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.640
 from now on the staff already have the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.260
 shapes already have the cake recipe there like 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.120
 I like and follow this cake recipe 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
 from now on there will be no mistake 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 people will already be able to mount the cube 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 right magician 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.850
 so come on 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.629
 first of all the staff to set up a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.660
 the machine we have to find the part is 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.600
 have our orange part here in the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.749
 if it is our base here on top of 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.209
 our base on the case is right orange 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:11.399
 people found an orange piece here that 

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:13.950
 he gets the people knows that the corner 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:18.149
 because it has three colors right or 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.789
 green and white orange 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.249
 What do we have to do first? 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:27.119
 Besides, what do we have to do after 

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:30.899
 find a right machine to put her 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.569
 in the right column for example it is three 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:38.279
 green orange and white colors then 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:41.270
 tac white and orange is the part of 

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:49.799
 The top of us brings her right here. 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:54.179
 green white and orange green and white and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.709
 bringing her to this 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.819
 column here 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:05.630
 this column is right here 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:08.390
 You will follow and if this step now 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.750
 this formula 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:19.819
 it's the right anti-clockwise low 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.060
 counter-clockwise 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.950
 staff right time is before 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.930
 to complete every form I had already mounted 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.440
 up here because I still turned here 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.390
 because this formula is not always you 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.670
 Can you do it first time? 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.670
 not always when you turn three 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.110
 times three times the piece she already in box 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.220
 here then sometimes you have to 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.130
 Continue 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.250
 and ahead you will use again 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.349
 this way then you have to do it there 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.450
 always complete for you to already go 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.750
 getting accustomed understood 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.410
 let's show the next piece that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.060
 here o 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:09.540
 in orange in white and it has blue already 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.889
 is in the corresponding column right in 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.950
 orange blue and white 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:24.109
 For the right blue and white, I'll do it. 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:30.709
 the same formula right counterclockwise 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:37.069
 low anti-clockwise 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:40.190
 Personal and dog clock right here. 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:46.139
 to the next 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:50.609
 This orange here, she's already in 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:52.530
 and is already in the right place in the column 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:55.290
 certain it is not here below but 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.329
 no problem is in color a certain 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.989
 because she has a yellow 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:08.190
 she has the green I have orange there 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:11.329
 right orange yellow is the same step 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:17.570
 when you decorate shape you do so 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:24.800
 counting 1234 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:37.610
 it was me down again 1 234 was not 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:42.740
 again 1 234 it was not again 1 2 3 4 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.640
 I'm when you do this sequence of 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.210
 movements 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:51.610
 the piece she's spinning she's spinning 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:56.210
 so I fit some good people to 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:59.110
 fourth and last piece she's here I 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:05.690
 I bring her to the corresponding column. 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:11.510
 right here is yellow blue and yellow 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:19.010
 blue and orange blue and orange to yellow 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:21.860
 same four movements 1234 worked out 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.020
 It did not work but is seen up 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.810
 in the wrong position I do it again 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:36.320
 one two three four or down 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:43.610
 I'm back 23 40 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:54.820
 I did not give again and did not give 234 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:59.450
 new 1 234 ready to the top right 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:02.570
 I'll leave and in the video the formula to 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:05.240
 who could not get noticed and 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.750
 training personal beauty that was the 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.740
 Our second class in the next class is 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:19.490
 people are going to learn how to set up the 2nd chamber 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:22.270
 from the right cube until the next class spoke 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.270
 hug
