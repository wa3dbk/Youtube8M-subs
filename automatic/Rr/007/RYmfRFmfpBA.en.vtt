daunting<00:00:11.460> process<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.719> what<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:12.960> recommend<00:00:13.290> to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
daunting process but what I recommend to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.279 
daunting process but what I recommend to
my<00:00:13.740> clients<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.700> rather<00:00:15.330> than<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
my clients is rather than going to the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.109 
my clients is rather than going to the
paint<00:00:16.529> store<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:16.830> seeing<00:00:17.250> thousands<00:00:17.970> of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
paint store and seeing thousands of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.019 
paint store and seeing thousands of
colors<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.109> can<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.369> think<00:00:20.910> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
colors as you can see here I think it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.000 
colors as you can see here I think it
would<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.359> an<00:00:21.600> easier<00:00:22.109> process<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
would be an easier process if you

would be to go with this pale gold color
that's<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> background<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.440> fabric

another<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.489> consider<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.719> three

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
another thing to consider is the three

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.150 
another thing to consider is the three
tones<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.739> room

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
tones of a room

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.889 
tones of a room
I<00:00:59.190> suggest<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> floor<00:01:00.420> should<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
I suggest the floor should be the

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
I suggest the floor should be the
darkest<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.559> walls<00:01:01.800> should<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> medium

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
darkest the walls should be a medium

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.759 
darkest the walls should be a medium
tone<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> ceiling<00:01:03.930> should<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
tone and the ceiling should be the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.219 
tone and the ceiling should be the
lightest<00:01:05.250> color<00:01:05.400> gray<00:01:06.299> actually<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.200> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
lightest color gray actually is a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
lightest color gray actually is a

I love this combination another thing to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
I love this combination another thing to
consider<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.630> light<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.680> room<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
consider is the light in a room if you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
consider is the light in a room if you
have<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.759> room<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.390> northeastern<00:01:31.320> exposure

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
have a room with northeastern exposure

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.800 
have a room with northeastern exposure
you're<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.369> going<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.820> getting<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.570> much

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you're not going to be getting that much

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.960 
you're not going to be getting that much
light<00:01:34.159> therefore<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.640> should<00:01:35.850> go

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
light therefore I think you should go

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.179 
light therefore I think you should go
with<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> warmer<00:01:36.689> color<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.920> these

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
with a warmer color so one of these

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.670 
with a warmer color so one of these
colors<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:39.030> work<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> room

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
colors would work if you have a room

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.319 
colors would work if you have a room
with<00:01:40.950> southern<00:01:41.460> exposure<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
with southern exposure you're going to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
with southern exposure you're going to
be<00:01:42.450> getting<00:01:42.630> lots<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.290> light<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.130> could<00:01:44.460> do<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
be getting lots of light you could do a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
cooler color in that case you could do a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.609

something else to think about is a

something else to think about is a
monochromatic<00:01:55.380> color<00:01:55.770> scheme<00:01:56.180> that's<00:01:57.180> using

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
monochromatic color scheme that's using

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.450 
monochromatic color scheme that's using
colors<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.350> close<00:01:58.590> together<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.340> the

colors that are close together on the

colors that are close together on the
color<00:01:59.729> wheel<00:01:59.820> here's<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.840> example<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.640> three

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
blues this would be a very safe color

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.219 
blues this would be a very safe color
scheme<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.869> beautiful<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.399> shades<00:02:08.819> of

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
one color is a monochromatic scheme it's

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.320 
one color is a monochromatic scheme it's
a<00:02:12.230> complicated<00:02:12.769> process<00:02:13.159> to<00:02:13.580> pick<00:02:13.909> out<00:02:14.060> paint

colors<00:02:14.750> for<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:15.019> living<00:02:15.319> room<00:02:15.500> think<00:02:16.040> about<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
colors for a living room think about the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.670 
colors for a living room think about the
light<00:02:16.879> exposure<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.659> the<00:02:17.750> room<00:02:17.959> think<00:02:18.560> about

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
light exposure in the room think about

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.430 
light exposure in the room think about
the<00:02:19.010> flooring<00:02:19.489> if<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:20.000> very<00:02:20.569> dark<00:02:20.989> wood

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
the flooring if you have very dark wood

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.080 
the flooring if you have very dark wood
floors<00:02:21.830> in<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.129> room<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.610> think<00:02:22.670> you'd<00:02:22.970> be

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
floors in the room I think you'd be

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.149 
floors in the room I think you'd be
better<00:02:23.269> off<00:02:23.510> going<00:02:23.690> with<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.989> lighter<00:02:24.440> paint

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
better off going with a lighter paint

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.990 
better off going with a lighter paint
color<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.349> helps<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:28.069> bring<00:02:28.730> an

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
color and if it helps you bring an

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.240 
color and if it helps you bring an
inspiration<00:02:29.840> piece<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.769> paint<00:02:31.040> store
