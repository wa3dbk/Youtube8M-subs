00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.730 
shifts though that I might necessarily
need<00:01:53.729> say<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.299> love<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.079> experience<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
need say I just love the experience of

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.830 
need say I just love the experience of
it<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.460> why<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.329> hey

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.410 

up<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.259> down<00:02:00.439> through<00:02:00.920> those<00:02:01.130> gears

up and down through those gears

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.149 
up and down through those gears
obviously<00:02:02.420> 650s<00:02:03.079> like<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.500> top<00:02:03.710> see<00:02:03.979> you've

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
obviously 650s like the top see you've

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.679 
obviously 650s like the top see you've

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
got the ability to go up and down on

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.749 
got the ability to go up and down on
either<00:02:05.869> side<00:02:06.200> let's<00:02:06.770> go<00:02:06.890> down<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.369> can<00:02:07.399> push

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
either side let's go down you can push

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.210 
either side let's go down you can push
away<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.959> right<00:02:09.140> side<00:02:09.440> to<00:02:09.800> go<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:10.009> you<00:02:10.190> can

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
away on the right side to go up you can

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.540 
away on the right side to go up you can
push<00:02:10.429> away<00:02:10.550> on<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.849> left<00:02:11.030> side

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:03:36.940 

let's<00:02:15.910> just<00:02:16.060> get<00:02:16.240> on

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.350 

this<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.550> where<00:03:37.730> I'm<00:03:37.940> going<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.120> put<00:03:38.240> the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
this is where I'm going to put the

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.750 
this is where I'm going to put the
transmission<00:03:38.840> in<00:03:39.020> to<00:03:39.349> track<00:03:39.620> mode<00:03:39.920> just<00:03:40.580> makes

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
transmission in to track mode just makes

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.610 
transmission in to track mode just makes
the<00:03:40.880> shifts<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.270> little<00:03:41.360> bit<00:03:41.510> more<00:03:42.140> violence

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the shifts a little bit more violence

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.270 
the shifts a little bit more violence
and<00:03:42.770> upgrades<00:03:43.190> here

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
and upgrades here

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.980 
and upgrades here
as<00:03:44.430> well<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.850> intake<00:03:45.120> generates<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.630> toxin

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
as well the intake generates a toxin

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.840 
as well the intake generates a toxin
stop<00:03:46.290> setting<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.670> put<00:03:47.790> the

stop setting and not going to put the

stop setting and not going to put the
suspension<00:03:48.180> mode<00:03:48.540> in<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.930> track<00:03:49.230> though

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
suspension mode in the track though

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.410 
suspension mode in the track though
because<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.830> takes<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.400> DSC<00:03:51.000> off<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> little

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
because that takes a DSC off a little

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.589 
because that takes a DSC off a little
bit

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
bit

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.410 
bit
I<00:03:52.629> know<00:03:53.140> -<00:03:53.379> you<00:03:53.769> know<00:03:53.829> that<00:03:54.159> he<00:03:54.640> is<00:03:54.909> only<00:03:55.120> three

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
I know - you know that he is only three

00:03:55.420 --> 00:06:32.850 
I know - you know that he is only three
degrees<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.590> an<00:03:56.799> elephant

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.950 

there<00:06:33.669> we<00:06:33.789> go<00:06:33.939> then<00:06:34.150> a<00:06:34.180> little<00:06:34.360> bit<00:06:34.539> of<00:06:34.599> a<00:06:34.719> point

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
there we go then a little bit of a point

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.929 
there we go then a little bit of a point
of<00:06:35.110> view<00:06:35.349> look<00:06:35.770> from<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.099> driver's<00:06:36.520> eye<00:06:36.639> what

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:36.939 
of view look from the driver's eye what

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.279 
of view look from the driver's eye what
it's<00:06:37.090> like<00:06:37.210> being<00:06:37.689> at<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:37.900> wheel<00:06:38.050> at<00:06:38.199> the

limit<00:06:51.430> that's<00:06:51.580> the<00:06:51.669> big<00:06:51.819> thing<00:06:52.000> especially

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:52.389 
limit that's the big thing especially

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:54.450 
limit that's the big thing especially
when<00:06:52.990> it's<00:06:53.139> only<00:06:53.289> showing<00:06:53.379> three<00:06:54.129> degrees

when it's only showing three degrees
you've<00:06:54.669> got<00:06:54.759> to<00:06:54.819> be<00:06:54.879> so<00:06:55.030> careful<00:06:55.240> in<00:06:55.479> these

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:55.629 
you've got to be so careful in these

you've got to be so careful in these
cars<00:06:55.900> you<00:06:56.169> know<00:06:56.590> risk<00:06:56.830> getting<00:06:57.099> anything

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
cars you know risk getting anything

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.610 
cars you know risk getting anything
wrong<00:06:57.669> but<00:06:57.969> I<00:06:58.150> love<00:06:58.569> in<00:06:58.750> the<00:06:58.810> ways<00:06:58.960> the<00:06:59.110> 650s

makes<00:06:59.949> a<00:07:00.069> little<00:07:00.219> bit<00:07:00.340> more<00:07:00.460> of<00:07:00.729> an<00:07:00.789> upshift

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
makes a little bit more of an upshift

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.029 
makes a little bit more of an upshift
pot<00:07:01.419> when<00:07:01.659> you<00:07:01.689> flip<00:07:01.960> up<00:07:02.110> at<00:07:02.259> high<00:07:02.379> revs<00:07:02.650> and
