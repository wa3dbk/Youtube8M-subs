and telling Gomez to run and it sounded

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.270

like<00:03:13.650> Mahalo

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
like Mahalo

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.760

bench and started creating issues
we<00:03:50.920> can<00:03:51.129> understand<00:03:51.610> why<00:03:51.819> the<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.510> Braves

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
we can understand why the the Braves

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.610 
we can understand why the the Braves
were<00:03:53.140> upset<00:03:54.209> now<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.360> way<00:03:55.540> Carlos<00:03:55.989> stood

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.509 
were upset now the way Carlos stood
there<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:56.920> watched<00:03:57.160> that<00:03:57.430> one<00:03:59.069> but<00:04:00.069> all<00:04:00.220> three

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
there and watched that one but all three

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.400 
there and watched that one but all three
of<00:04:00.640> them<00:04:00.790> McCann<00:04:01.239> Freddie<00:04:01.780> Freeman<00:04:02.080> and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
of them McCann Freddie Freeman and

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.699 
of them McCann Freddie Freeman and
Mahalo<00:04:02.800> started<00:04:03.430> chirping<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.560> barking<00:04:05.560> at

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
Mahalo started chirping and barking at

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.470 
Mahalo started chirping and barking at
Gomez<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:08.370> so<00:04:09.370> there's<00:04:10.000> going<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.180> be<00:04:10.239> some

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
Gomez and so there's going to be some

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.780 
Gomez and so there's going to be some
objections<00:04:10.989> in<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.470> think<00:04:11.980> Freeman<00:04:12.640> has

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
objections in it I think Freeman has

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.460 
objections in it I think Freeman has
been<00:04:13.000> tossed<00:04:13.330> out<00:04:13.599> as<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.989> way<00:04:14.080> he<00:04:14.230> came
