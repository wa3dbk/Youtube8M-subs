00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.560
 special corner the gameplay to the gamecube 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.030
 my favorite console needed 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.440
 absolutely that I make a rogue leap 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.790
 from the corner you're ready because that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 start this right now we start 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.379
 gently with this ad so little their 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.150
 gamecube unit with accessories on 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.100
 can see on the picture at need for speed 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.840
 run large with a joystick 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.630
 in addition it is unofficial these two 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 pit bull brands this daube for you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 say in cash stores on door 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 all too little a purple gamecube with 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.099
 an official party for a fortnight 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 of euros or 20 euros bah however the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.450
 wind 40 euros it's a little excessive in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.160
 more not guaranteed so it's not worth the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.300
 blow a lot of three new games gamecube 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.950
 to that can be interesting 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.120
 in addition we have good titles need for 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.129
 speed carbon good it's not the most 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.510
 interesting the one who reverse platinum 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.190
 do not push the most interesting yet 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.230
 but what is my interesting I want 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.370
 to say it's the rest of theft 1 on 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.710
 gamecube it can be nice to have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 make sure blister below but when 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.320
 we see the third picture bah it's not 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.149
 in blister 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.489
 the game is open so it contradicts itself 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.010
 the gave and the badger hawai own 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.059
 game cube never owned this game and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 I wish I had it for my 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.519
 collection 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.930
 but I would not put 35 euros for that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
 again it's too expensive I 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.869
 find super mario sunshine seeing 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.659
 photo we can see that it is in very 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.760
 good condition and more is the manual 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.990
 this game has found a couple of times in 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.369
 the empty granaries for 5 euros 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.430
 even in the caches we can find it 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.369
 15 euros but if he sells 55 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 euros to cow but he is crazy kagura 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.170

 aubry and him this pebble all-inclusive friend 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
 80 euros but I will never put this price 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.810
 that's why I know that the oars is 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.100
 it's not even an official thing 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.020
 think of the first announcement that I you 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.200

 group in one cd gamecube it can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.040
 to be very interesting especially when when 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.079
 it's 9 bomb the premium of 150 euros to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.149

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.150
