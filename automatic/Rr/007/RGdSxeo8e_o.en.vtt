 video to show you how to make oil 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.500
 coconut 100% natural at home 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.650
 the rate is because the days ago I did a 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.260
 post on the blog is showing what are the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.300
 best eyes for hair fall one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.520
 of them is coconut oil 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.910
 I had already done another post 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.580
 on metal capillary action and I counted 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.100
 there in that post that my favorite eye 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.320
 for that mequita in the hair is the oil of 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.660
 coconut and some girls ask me 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.250
 where I brutally because they do not 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.480
 they can find very easily 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.629
 in the area where they live is just okay 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.269
 and so I do not buy the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.930
 Coconut oil personal I do at home I 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.120
 I really do, and they asked me to do it. 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.739
 explaining what I do is I solved it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.549
 doing this for video're showing 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.460
 step by step how I do is 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:07.650
 There is no secret, it's super easy. 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 everybody will be able to do hair 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.659
 blue coconut oil at home 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.840
 because I not only in the hair and use in the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.420
 cook also treat braising rice 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.969
 Are you using the salad? I like it. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.829
 enough of the coconut oil flavor then 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.350
 whenever I do I put in two 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.869
 one for the hair and 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.689
 Another one is in the kitchen. It's good. 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.020
 is because coconut oil is much more rounded 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.600
 than soybean oil is that we 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.759
 usually use and therefore 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.979
 Reason I like to be doing 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.929
 well, that's it if you want to know 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.829
 how to make coconut oil going well 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.049

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.270
 good people here is what we are going 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.079
 use even what we're going to need 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.810
 making our coconut oil is just the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.149
 coconut fruit here 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.880
 It's gotta be natural, it can not be 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.149
 those grated coconut bags that the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.049
 we bought you buy the coconut fruit 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.500
 and take the pieces like that, and water 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:13.260
 only this we are going to leave and extracting the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.650
 milk broth you want to call this 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.569
 cocotte and let's take to the fire is just 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.230

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.450

 we'll be all ready in our milk 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.380

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.830
 lining for a few hours and I go 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.050

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.019

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.530
 started doing it 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.169
 It looks like a cream on top of it. 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.630
 but this is normal is and will be 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:33.290

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.630
 near the end, I'll come back to show you 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:44.419
 For you guys, this is personal after 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:47.600

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.780

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.140
 Oil is all here, okay? 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.030
 and here is our personal coconut oil 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.460
 100% natural home made I go 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.650
 wait cool to be able to sing tava 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.669
 let it cool until cool 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.830
 It's after he would be he gets kind a 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.780
 past white benz butter after 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.910
 If I read, I'll come back and show it to you. 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.190
 Did you vote staff now to show the 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.440
 end result of our coconut oil 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.930
 It's already cold in here 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.139
 The way I already told you 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.930
 It looks so white and very thin. 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.060
 type a one butter even paste it 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.270
 do not fall and stick with it's insistence 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.729
 this when you vote using it is only that 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.870
 I know it returns to liquid form 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:32.240
 so I showed before is just is 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.820
 warming up, it's okay, I usually keep the 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.710
 My in the Indian refrigerator you stored 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.380
 yours is also usually when I do 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.900
 For me I do a larger amount 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.759
 Because I already told you I 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.310
 not only use the hair I use for purposes 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.409
 Culinary too but today I know only 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.979
 This little bit is showing to you. 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:54.080
 The process is what you do is if you 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:57.050
 want to make a larger amount only 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.050
 increase the amount of coconut, but 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:02.780
 It 's the same process, it 's okay, I guess. 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.720
 super valid you make your own 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.570
 coconut oil because you will be able to 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.750
 sure you do not have any other 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.639
 product other than coconut oil is fine 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:17.330
 you'll be sure because you 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:19.789
 even though it did and so it will come out much more 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.949
 of what you buy here in the 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:24.139
 My city I paid from 2 to 3 reais 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:27.740
 Coconut kilo that can make this 

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:30.440
 quantity more or less here, it's me 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.500
 I do not see any pound of coconut I know one 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.659
 little less and hewitt is who will play it 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.360
 very large in case that amount 

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:41.419
 here you can do more or less five 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.150
 mutations in my hair then every 

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:46.390
 a riding will leave for less than 50 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.830
 cents so much 

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.230
