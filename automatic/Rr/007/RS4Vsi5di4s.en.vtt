the top left there is a new portal of

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.400 
the top left there is a new portal of
power<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.340> it<00:00:47.340> looks<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.379> has

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
power and it looks way different it has

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
power and it looks way different it has
like<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.309> looks<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> has<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.090> lid

really<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.930> but<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:59.010> probably<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
really know but it's probably a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
really know but it's probably a
prototype<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.719> may<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> final

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
prototype that it may not be the final

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.439 
prototype that it may not be the final
build<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> portal<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.850> power<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.300> keep

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
build of the portal of power to keep

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.190 
build of the portal of power to keep
that<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.719> mind<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.700> figures<00:01:06.270> may

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that in mind and also the figures may

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.170 
that in mind and also the figures may
not<00:01:07.409> be<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.770> final<00:01:08.130> version<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.760> figures

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
not be the final version of the figures

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.679 
not be the final version of the figures
but<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.500> side<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.420> what<00:01:12.420> looked

looks<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.579> core<00:01:32.880> characters<00:01:33.420> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
looks like the little core characters it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
looks like the little core characters it
looks<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.890> below<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> bottom<00:01:36.659> left

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
looks like below them to the bottom left

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
looks like below them to the bottom left
those<00:01:37.290> may<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.159> weapons<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:39.299> are

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
those may be like weapons that are

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.469 
those may be like weapons that are
interchangeable<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.400> instead<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
interchangeable so instead of like you

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
interchangeable so instead of like you
know<00:01:42.509> swapping<00:01:43.079> tops<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.590> bottoms<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:44.220> may

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
know swapping tops and bottoms they may

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.499 
know swapping tops and bottoms they may
actually<00:01:45.470> be<00:01:46.470> swapping<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.979> weapons

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
actually be swapping out weapons

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.429 
actually be swapping out weapons
hopefully<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.659> we'll<00:01:48.780> sell<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> weapon

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
hopefully then we'll sell the weapon

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.740 
hopefully then we'll sell the weapon
separately<00:01:50.090> hopefully<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.540> like

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
separately hopefully that's just like

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.819 
separately hopefully that's just like
