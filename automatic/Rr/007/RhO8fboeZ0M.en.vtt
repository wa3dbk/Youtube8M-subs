00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
but and and I think that it's important

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
but and and I think that it's important
that<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:45.050> comedy<00:00:46.050> comes<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.649> their

that the comedy comes out of their

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.450 
that the comedy comes out of their
relationship<00:00:47.010> rather<00:00:47.760> than<00:00:48.000> set<00:00:48.629> pieces<00:00:49.460> it's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
relationship rather than set pieces it's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.939 
relationship rather than set pieces it's
it's<00:00:51.329> very<00:00:51.629> character-based<00:00:52.500> very

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it's very character-based very

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
place and then somewhere else with TV

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.580 
place and then somewhere else with TV
and<00:01:15.570> film<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.560> very

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and film as you know it's it's a very

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
and film as you know it's it's a very
bitty<00:01:17.369> process<00:01:18.180> you'll<00:01:18.420> often<00:01:18.570> shoe<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> scene

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
bitty process you'll often shoe a scene

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.160 
bitty process you'll often shoe a scene
from<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.430> know<00:01:20.549> later<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> movie<00:01:21.299> first

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
from you know later in the movie first

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.320 
from you know later in the movie first
and<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.920> you're<00:01:23.070> sort<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.060> end<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and so you're sort of the end of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
and so you're sort of the end of
building<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> character<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.380> following<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
building a character and following that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
building a character and following that
character<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.549> journey<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.600> much

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
character on that journey is is much

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.560 
character on that journey is is much
more<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:29.009> fragmented<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.390> think

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
more you know fragmented and I think

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.490 
more you know fragmented and I think
that's<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> exciting<00:01:31.079> things<00:01:31.290> about

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that's one of the exciting things about

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
that's one of the exciting things about
doing<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.799> play<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.310> there's<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.150> drama<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
doing a play if there's this drama and

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.030 
doing a play if there's this drama and
there's<00:01:33.810> mystery<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.500> intrigue<00:01:34.920> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
there's mystery there's intrigue you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
there's mystery there's intrigue you
know<00:01:35.159> there's<00:01:35.400> quite<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.060> different

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
know there's quite a lot of different

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.590 
know there's quite a lot of different
flavors<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.439> textures<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
flavors and textures that go on in this

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.999 
flavors and textures that go on in this
you<00:01:39.600> know<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> hope<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.409> your<00:01:40.799> love<00:01:40.979> but
