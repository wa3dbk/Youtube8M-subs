00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630 
gusts being able to run his offense and
I<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.689> some<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.229> comes<00:01:16.500> from<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
I think some of it comes from just the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.550 
I think some of it comes from just the
last<00:01:18.119> two<00:01:18.420> years<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.020> back-to-back

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
last two years you know back-to-back

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.710 
last two years you know back-to-back
losing<00:01:20.040> seasons<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.729> able<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.119> throw<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> as

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
losing seasons not able to throw it as

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
losing seasons not able to throw it as
consistently<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.770> wanted<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.490> had<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
consistently as you wanted to you had a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
consistently as you wanted to you had a
running<00:01:23.970> quarterback<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
running quarterback and then you get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
running quarterback and then you get
into<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.920> situation<00:01:26.159> where<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:27.210> he's<00:01:27.479> hired

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
into a situation where when he's hired

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.149 
into a situation where when he's hired
he<00:01:27.960> says<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> know<00:01:28.500> we're<00:01:28.650> gonna<00:01:28.770> run<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
hurry up no huddle and in this spring

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.980 
hurry up no huddle and in this spring
you<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.490> different<00:01:33.060> look<00:01:33.240> offense<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you had a different look offense and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.399 
you had a different look offense and
it's<00:01:34.110> evolved<00:01:34.740> into<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.189> different<00:01:35.850> look<00:01:36.119> now

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
it's evolved into a different look now

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.469 
it's evolved into a different look now
what<00:01:37.409> would<00:01:37.619> changed<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
what would changed just in that in the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780 
what would changed just in that in the
evolution<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.009> know<00:01:41.100> from<00:01:41.340> early

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
evolution of the you know from early

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.760 
evolution of the you know from early
from<00:01:41.970> hiring<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:42.600> even<00:01:42.930> Heinen<00:01:43.259> offensive

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
from hiring just even Heinen offensive

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
from hiring just even Heinen offensive
coordinator<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.579> until<00:01:44.729> say<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
coordinator all the way up until say you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600 
coordinator all the way up until say you
know<00:01:45.869> 11<00:01:46.229> games<00:01:46.409> into<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.710> season<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.280> think

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
know 11 games into this season I think

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.929 
know 11 games into this season I think
the<00:01:47.700> biggest<00:01:47.909> thing<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.329> once<00:01:48.600> Gus<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.530> here

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
the biggest thing is once Gus got here

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
the biggest thing is once Gus got here

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
and also coming in there one of the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.370 
and also coming in there one of the
things<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.390> told<00:02:09.450> my<00:02:09.660> said<00:02:09.840> you're<00:02:09.990> gonna<00:02:10.170> find

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
things I told my said you're gonna find

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.680 
things I told my said you're gonna find
out<00:02:10.730> one<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.850> reasons<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.300> didn't<00:02:12.510> throw

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
out one of the reasons we didn't throw

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.560 
out one of the reasons we didn't throw
as<00:02:12.840> much<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.260> because<00:02:13.650> our<00:02:14.190> strength<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:15.030> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
as much is because our strength is the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.780 
as much is because our strength is the
offensive<00:02:15.990> line<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.440> dynamic<00:02:17.130> fat<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.490> Felix

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
offensive line and dynamic fat and Felix

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790 
offensive line and dynamic fat and Felix
Jones<00:02:18.000> Peyton<00:02:18.480> Hillis<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.990> then<00:02:19.680> you're

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
Jones Peyton Hillis and then you're

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.500 
Jones Peyton Hillis and then you're
gonna<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.190> go<00:02:20.340> from<00:02:20.550> there<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.940> then

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
gonna have to go from there and then

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.090 
gonna have to go from there and then
Marcus<00:02:21.840> Mach<00:02:22.080> will<00:02:22.290> give<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> good<00:02:22.830> hand

other<00:02:24.990> guys<00:02:25.170> along<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:25.920> I<00:02:27.110> think<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> biggest

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
other guys along but I think the biggest

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.930 
other guys along but I think the biggest
thing<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:29.239> rumors<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.390> rumors<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.940> you
