00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.230
 moin and welcome to the flights index 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.500
 flight school in the sixth hour of flight 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.019
 which we will graduate now we will be one 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.330
 try a few landings 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.800
 this is already my third attempt 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.050
 Here's how it works now 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.340
 Every time I am relatively gentle 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 put on but despite matt ag I said 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.780
 stay down and get pretty funny 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.270
 if that does not work now, that is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.370
 my last attempt I go 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.370
 Continue because I landed 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.289
 on the 23rd 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.290
 have the control of the plane 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 taken over, they lean back 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.450
 in this hour of flight we will be on the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.810
 fry national airport it is already 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.970
 almost time for dinner and me 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.130
 I heard that there are fantastic 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.960
 fish should give as they have theirs 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.190
 first landing already in the introduction 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.410
 flight behind 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.369
 Today we will have more landings 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.799
 complete 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.210
 and they will be much more about land 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:26.450
 I have the plane on a descent 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.689
 with 7 5 knots set up for this 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.250
 I put the flaps on 10 degrees what 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.399
 at the same time the attitude for the 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.590
 Landing is in this attempt 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.159
 we do not work with fully extended 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.590
 land 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.640
 I think that now they are the tax 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.640
 can take over 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.450
 Note that the engine power is up 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.210
 1900 revolutions is set by 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.990
 we can with a sink rate of 500 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.549
 foot per minute sink I regulate now 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.440
 the longest passion for the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.039
 speed of 7 5 knots 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.319
 to maintain if I felt that 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.490
 I would fly that too high 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.860
 reduce power 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.709
 maybe first by a few hundred 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.930
 turns I should be too low 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.000
 I would increase the performance by a few 100 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.799
 increase revolutions 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.090
 In any case, I would have the performance 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:26.760
 adjust to keep exactly 75 knots 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.440
 the question is just how do I know if 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.129
 I fly too high or too low 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.750
 they probably have the rings 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.760
 noticed by which we fly 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.580
 These rings put those in simulators 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.860
 one to the pilots with for the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.590
 Landing required one familiar to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 make as long as you pass through these rings 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.390
 they land exactly on the fly 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.560
 Runway 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.910
 Do not worry if you are 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.580
 one of the rings stripes 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.099
 These are not our virtual rings 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.110
 Normally we would continue for that 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.620
 Approach and landing on the broad 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.680
 national airport a rectangular 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.299
 standard space round flying 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.099
 Today, however, we have the release for 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.349
 get a direct flight 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.870
 the most important requirement for you 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.329
 first successful landing is that you 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.000
 get help from your flight instructor 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.250
 which of course I would like to do 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.140
 However, they will be the most important part 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.200
 the landing itself take over 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.600
 catch that 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.340
 A tip on the way 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.680
 The game is landing one 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.610
 airplane does not agree 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.610
 heavy burden 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.370
 when you get the plane to the right one 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.410
 Airspeed inside the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.140
 Hold the wings horizontally and 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.860
 easily adjust the benefits 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.420
 airplane practically by itself 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.250
 we maintain this speed 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.300
 until we crossed the threshold 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.420
 and we are 10 to 15 feet above the 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.520
 Runway are located then reduce it 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.680
 the performance and catch the plane for 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.730
 the landing 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.630
 Do not be scared, I'm with them 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.850
 By the way, catching the nose means 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.100
 plane so far to pull up 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.560
 that the main landing gear in front of the book 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.900
 Lower the landing gear to reduce this 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.299
 the power and pull the joystick 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.459
 slightly back leaving the barometer only 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.490
 another drop of at most 100 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.710
 foot per minute to show who then 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.140
 drag the plane further slowed 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.570
 bend your nose down to 14 degrees 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.970
 up and hold the nose in this 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 position until the main speech the floor 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.470
 touch 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.950
 set the power to about 2100 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.620
 revolutions a 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.000
 See the beginning of the runway that 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.160
 is the runway threshold 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.910
 Of course they should always be behind the 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.039
 threshold 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.830
 we are now approaching the skimming height 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.350
 if you are approaching about 100 feet 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.180
 Resist above the runway 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.139
 to pull her up the temptation 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.139
 with this 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.290
 that crashed but
