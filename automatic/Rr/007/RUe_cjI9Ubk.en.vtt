this mic for the Bluetooth and it comes

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.770 
this mic for the Bluetooth and it comes
with<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:32.750> wiring<00:00:33.140> harness<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.570> connect<00:00:35.570> it

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
with this wiring harness to connect it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.389 
with this wiring harness to connect it
to<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.260> stock<00:00:38.109> connectors<00:00:39.109> so<00:00:39.980> basically

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
to the stock connectors so basically

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.970 
to the stock connectors so basically
what<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:41.089> to<00:00:41.239> do<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.780> connect<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:42.769> wiring

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
what I have to do is connect the wiring

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.169 
what I have to do is connect the wiring
up<00:00:44.170> pull<00:00:45.170> out<00:00:45.289> the<00:00:45.499> old<00:00:45.530> radio<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.179> hopefully

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
up pull out the old radio and hopefully

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.040 
up pull out the old radio and hopefully
pop<00:00:47.390> this<00:00:47.629> one<00:00:47.839> in<00:00:49.149> okay<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:50.480> got<00:00:50.659> some<00:00:50.690> new

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
pop this one in okay so we got some new

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.590 
pop this one in okay so we got some new
parts<00:00:51.409> for<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.769> radio<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.339> we<00:00:53.269> have<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
parts for the radio in we have the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.130 
parts for the radio in we have the
connector<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.710> car<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:56.600> also<00:00:56.749> have<00:00:56.989> the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
connector for the car you also have the

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.009 
connector for the car you also have the
amp<00:00:57.350> connector<00:00:57.979> for<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.249> car<00:00:58.749> we<00:00:59.749> have<00:00:59.870> the

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
amp connector for the car we have the

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.450 
amp connector for the car we have the
antenna<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:00.890> we<00:01:01.749> have<00:01:02.859> the<00:01:03.859> tools<00:01:04.190> we're

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
antenna and we have the tools we're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.209 
antenna and we have the tools we're
going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.670> need<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.420> wire<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:08.680> okay<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:09.740> I'm

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:10.219 
going to need to wire this okay so I'm

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.490 
going to need to wire this okay so I'm
going<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:10.579> start<00:01:10.850> wiring<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.840> two<00:01:12.259> harnesses

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
going to start wiring the two harnesses

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.310 
going to start wiring the two harnesses
together<00:01:13.299> basically<00:01:14.299> all<00:01:14.719> you<00:01:14.840> do<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.170> you

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
together basically all you do is you

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.209 
together basically all you do is you
match<00:01:15.500> color<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.159> color<00:01:16.930> so<00:01:17.950> when<00:01:18.950> this<00:01:19.070> video

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
match color to color so when this video

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.069 
match color to color so when this video
comes<00:01:19.549> back<00:01:19.880> everything<00:01:20.509> should<00:01:20.930> be

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
comes back everything should be

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.029 
comes back everything should be
connected<00:01:22.869> okay<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.289> harness<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:24.860> all

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
connected okay so the harness is all

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.670 
connected okay so the harness is all
wired<00:01:25.340> up<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:25.880> time<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.990> go<00:01:27.110> out<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.530> car

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
wired up it's time to go out to the car

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.620 
wired up it's time to go out to the car
okay<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.530> as<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.009> can<00:01:31.189> see<00:01:31.340> we're<00:01:31.700> in<00:01:31.969> the<00:01:32.030> car

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
okay so as you can see we're in the car

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.060 
okay so as you can see we're in the car
I've<00:01:33.109> already<00:01:33.859> taken<00:01:34.130> off<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.810> bezel<00:01:36.320> it's

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
I've already taken off the bezel it's

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.899 
I've already taken off the bezel it's
laying<00:01:37.310> on<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.909> ground<00:01:38.149> right<00:01:38.420> there<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.909> I

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
laying on the ground right there and I

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.080 
laying on the ground right there and I
need<00:01:41.240> both<00:01:41.390> my<00:01:41.600> hands<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.140> I'm<00:01:42.320> going<00:01:42.619> to<00:01:43.090> take

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
need both my hands so I'm going to take

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.599 
need both my hands so I'm going to take
out<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.420> stock<00:01:44.659> stereo<00:01:45.289> take<00:01:46.100> out<00:01:46.310> these

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
out the stock stereo take out these

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.980 
out the stock stereo take out these
climate<00:01:47.299> controls<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.350> then<00:01:49.539> pop<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.719> the<00:01:50.840> new

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
climate controls and then pop in the new

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.410 
climate controls and then pop in the new
radio<00:01:53.170> okay<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.740> stock<00:01:55.039> radio<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.820> finally

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
radio okay so the stock radio is finally

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.609 
radio okay so the stock radio is finally
out<00:01:56.679> there<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.509> okay<00:01:59.509> so<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.899> next<00:02:00.049> step<00:02:00.200> is

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
out there it is okay so the next step is

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.719 
out there it is okay so the next step is
to<00:02:01.340> connect<00:02:01.700> up<00:02:01.909> everything<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:03.490> cross<00:02:04.490> our

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
to connect up everything and cross our

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.430 
to connect up everything and cross our
fingers<00:02:05.890> okay<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.399> I've<00:02:07.820> put<00:02:08.240> everything<00:02:08.810> back

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440
