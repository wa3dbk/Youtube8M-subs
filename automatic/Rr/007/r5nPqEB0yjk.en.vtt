00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 so luciana if I'm with you I 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.410
 I'm a rodrigo and in this video I'm going to make a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 quick comment on the recent 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.480
 release of gameloft o iron man 3 and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.789
 that was released to go out in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.750
 set with the iron man 3 movie in 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.220
 movie theaters 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.140
 but unlike what happened with 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 super heroes like batman the spider man 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.239
 this is not a production of the largest 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.890
 with elaborate phases and gameplay 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.750
 complex 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.760
 on the contrary it follows the style that is 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.340
 common good on platforms 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 furniture that the English runner or better 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.899
 saying that English case flyer which 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.230
 you fly without end to invest 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.969
 no, and that alone would be enough 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.039
 I'm disappointed I think they will not 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.629
 deserved a more complete game 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.879
 only that it is not even the main 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.590
 the fact is that this game despite 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.840
 to have good graphics 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.270
 it has a weird kind of gameplay 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.040
 which loses by far the greater part of 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.500
 in 10 years that we know like 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.140
 currently has a gameplay is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 based on the accelerometer you should move 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.880
 your smartphone or tablet that the sides 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.979
 so that the ironman veers obstacles and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 tap the screen to shoot you in 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.439
 enemies that are appearing the problem is 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.750
 its gameplay is enough and needs the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.299
 controls do not respond the way they 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.400
 you would often have them have a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.380
 delay in the responses that can be 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.850
 outlined with some custom with 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.380
 gameplay but I think for the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.630
 most people it will be a little 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.909
 even irritating and further 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.409
 It's honestly not very clear how it is. 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.930
 that you should interact with things 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.030
 that appear on the screen some enemies by 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 example shoot shots that for you 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 to divert them is a bit strange you do not 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.810
 knows where to stay for 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.399
 should involve your device that is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.590
 as well as what will make you 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.280
 die often without any idea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.280
 exact reason 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.119
 the gameplay really owed 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.830
 very precise and this left me very 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.690
 disappointed he at least is 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.460
 available for free you do not 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.770
 You need to pay nothing to play both 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.630
 android and concluded that until there 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.440
 requires you to spend money on 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.240
 purchases within epp are not two types 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.060
 currency let's say as soon as you 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.310
 uses and both can be achieved 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.500
 with their effort and with the repetition 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.750
 you are taking in the phases that are always 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.150
 the same as in a jetpack from orly 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.610
 life that changes are only the goals that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.200
 the game will deal before the phases and until 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.780
 your goals and I think I 'm a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.150
 confused you're going to get it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.000
 without paying attention to them and they too 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.620
 many are finally they join the i 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.760
 gameplay as something else 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.760
 confused of this game 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.500
 For those who are fans, there is something cool. 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.660
 which is the system of purchase and upgrade of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.820
 armor you can go changing the measure 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.130
 What are you going to do? 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.049
 I think it was even like a 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.120
 a slightly better developed game than 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:11.049
 the ironman in development that goes beyond 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.049
 of good graphics 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.000
 because you must have already noticed that I 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.670
 I was really frustrated with the iron 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.319
 man 3 because I expected a lot from him and 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.430
 I think he delivered very little 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.660
 at least in relation to my 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.400
 expectancy 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.500
 Of course this is a matter of opinion and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.160
 so I'm waiting for the opinion of 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.530
 you 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.819
 What did you think of this game because there? 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.360
 Who knows, we might even have one. 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.360
 counterpoint 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.540
 I hope you liked this video 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.860
 What do you like is cyclical and I liked it. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.780
 This is the first video of my 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.310
 channel that whoever wrote that will 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.510
 follow up on videos on the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.400
 youtube 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.780
 I will stop here to talk to 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.780
 you and said
