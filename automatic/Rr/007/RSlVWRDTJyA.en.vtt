firing<00:03:01.620> test<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:12.180> usual<00:03:12.450> firing<00:03:13.140> or<00:03:13.200> my

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
firing test now as usual firing or my

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.380 
firing test now as usual firing or my
target<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:14.130> when<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.340> did<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.640> unboxing<00:03:14.730> video
