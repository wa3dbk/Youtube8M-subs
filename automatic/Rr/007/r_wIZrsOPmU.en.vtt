is<00:02:01.960> because<00:02:02.109> where<00:02:02.320> you<00:02:02.409> find<00:02:02.649> one<00:02:02.859> you'll

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
is because where you find one you'll

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.980 
is because where you find one you'll
often<00:02:03.219> find<00:02:03.399> others<00:02:03.880> so<00:02:04.149> if<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.750> look<00:02:04.899> around

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
often find others so if I look around

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.359 
often find others so if I look around
kind<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.380> quickly<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.740> noticed<00:02:06.039> under<00:02:06.159> this

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
kind of quickly I noticed under this

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.540 
kind of quickly I noticed under this
there's<00:02:06.969> three<00:02:07.299> there<00:02:08.100> there's<00:02:09.100> another<00:02:09.340> one

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
there's three there there's another one

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.140 
there's three there there's another one
up<00:02:09.670> over<00:02:09.789> here<00:02:11.010> and<00:02:12.010> actually<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.610> big<00:02:12.820> spot

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
up over here and actually the big spot

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.580 
up over here and actually the big spot
is<00:02:13.690> over<00:02:14.050> here<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.580> side<00:02:15.640> there<00:02:16.420> are

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
is over here on this side there are

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.500 
is over here on this side there are
actually<00:02:17.590> some<00:02:17.770> pretty<00:02:17.890> big<00:02:18.160> ones<00:02:18.370> right<00:02:19.300> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
actually some pretty big ones right and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.380 
actually some pretty big ones right and
right<00:02:20.020> down<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:21.040> there<00:02:21.520> if<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.850> can<00:02:22.000> see<00:02:22.180> those

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
right down in there if you can see those

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
right down in there if you can see those
so<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> spot<00:02:23.560> one<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.130> usually<00:02:24.220> find

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
so if you spot one you can usually find

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.940 
so if you spot one you can usually find
several<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.180> same<00:02:25.390> area<00:02:25.840> which<00:02:26.710> is<00:02:26.830> always

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
several in the same area which is always

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.640 
several in the same area which is always
so<00:02:27.630> pick<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> chantrelle<00:02:29.730> clear<00:02:30.730> away<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
so pick in the chantrelle clear away the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.190 
so pick in the chantrelle clear away the
growth<00:02:32.650> here<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.310> little<00:02:33.640> bit<00:02:33.849> as<00:02:34.080> carefully<00:02:35.080> as

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
growth here a little bit as carefully as

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.690 
growth here a little bit as carefully as
possible<00:02:35.319> these<00:02:35.950> are<00:02:36.099> in<00:02:36.220> really<00:02:36.550> good<00:02:36.640> shape

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
possible these are in really good shape

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.320 
possible these are in really good shape
because<00:02:37.150> it's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
because it's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.350 
because it's
early<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.840> season<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:40.000> we<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:40.270> get

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
early in this season see we can get

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.830 
early in this season see we can get
right<00:02:40.540> down<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:41.020> there<00:02:41.580> beautiful

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
right down in there beautiful

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.330 
right down in there beautiful
and<00:02:43.840> what<00:02:43.960> I<00:02:43.990> can<00:02:44.200> do<00:02:44.380> is<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.580> low<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.480> way

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
and what I can do is so low in the way

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.500 
and what I can do is so low in the way
what<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.430> can<00:02:48.580> do<00:02:48.670> is<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:48.850> literally<00:02:49.180> just

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
what I can do is I can literally just

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.300 
what I can do is I can literally just
pluck<00:02:50.020> them<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:50.350> of<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.590> ground<00:02:50.860> like<00:02:50.980> that

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
pluck them out of the ground like that

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.800 
pluck them out of the ground like that
you'll<00:02:51.490> see<00:02:51.700> they've<00:02:51.850> got<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.150> beautiful

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
you'll see they've got that beautiful

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.680 
you'll see they've got that beautiful
shape<00:02:53.650> those<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> gills<00:02:54.460> on<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
shape those are the gills on that and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.810 
shape those are the gills on that and
that's<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.960> cone<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:57.040> I'm<00:02:57.160> gonna<00:02:57.250> pluck<00:02:57.580> all

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
that's the cone and I'm gonna pluck all

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.160 
that's the cone and I'm gonna pluck all
three<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.270> these<00:02:58.830> you<00:02:59.830> know<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.960> don't<00:03:01.960> know

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
three of these you know I don't know

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.710 
three of these you know I don't know
about<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.620> taste<00:03:03.100> for<00:03:03.730> young<00:03:04.090> ones<00:03:04.330> versus

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
about the taste for young ones versus

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.240 
about the taste for young ones versus
older<00:03:05.050> ones<00:03:05.230> these<00:03:05.350> are<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.710> clean<00:03:06.010> it's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
older ones these are so clean it's

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.760 
older ones these are so clean it's
really<00:03:06.580> great<00:03:07.230> they'll<00:03:08.230> often<00:03:08.500> grow<00:03:08.680> in

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
really great they'll often grow in

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.090 
really great they'll often grow in
groups<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.130> two<00:03:09.280> or<00:03:09.310> three<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.800> next<00:03:12.070> step

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
groups of two or three but the next step

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.830 
groups of two or three but the next step
in<00:03:12.370> field<00:03:12.580> cleaning<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.150> actually<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.690> just

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
in field cleaning is actually to just

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.430 
in field cleaning is actually to just
trim<00:03:14.290> off<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.980> bottom<00:03:15.370> part<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.720> usually<00:03:17.260> take

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
trim off the bottom part I usually take

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.720 
trim off the bottom part I usually take
let's<00:03:17.740> see<00:03:17.830> if<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.100> do<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.400> with<00:03:18.610> this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
let's see if I can do this with this

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.760 
let's see if I can do this with this
camera<00:03:19.570> I'm<00:03:19.780> sorry<00:03:20.050> if<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> focus<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.709> a

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
back where I found that mushroom you'll

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.190 
back where I found that mushroom you'll
see<00:03:27.670> us<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.820> little<00:03:27.910> bit<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.150> dirt<00:03:28.330> there<00:03:28.540> when<00:03:29.170> I

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
see us a little bit of dirt there when I

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.830 
see us a little bit of dirt there when I
talked<00:03:29.440> about<00:03:29.620> field<00:03:29.920> cleaning<00:03:30.340> earlier<00:03:30.840> what

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
talked about field cleaning earlier what

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.910 
talked about field cleaning earlier what
you're<00:03:31.959> going<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.290> do<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.500> either<00:03:32.620> take<00:03:32.890> your

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920

little<00:03:35.230> bit<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.590> dirt<00:03:35.800> off<00:03:35.980> because<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.880> will

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
little bit of dirt off because that will

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.699 
little bit of dirt off because that will
get<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.240> other<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.110> other<00:03:38.140> mushrooms

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
get on the other on the other mushrooms

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.720 
get on the other on the other mushrooms
so<00:03:40.800> one<00:03:41.800> of<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.950> nice<00:03:42.100> things<00:03:42.130> about<00:03:42.400> chin

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
so one of the nice things about chin

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.130 
so one of the nice things about chin
trials<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.090> each<00:03:43.269> one<00:03:43.300> is<00:03:43.630> like<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.780> piece<00:03:43.989> of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
trials is each one is like a piece of

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.990 
trials is each one is like a piece of
coral<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:45.010> you'll<00:03:45.310> notice<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.820> get

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000

color stands out the cap design and if

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.430 
color stands out the cap design and if
you<00:03:58.330> look<00:03:58.450> at<00:03:58.570> those<00:03:58.690> gills<00:03:58.989> they're<00:03:59.290> not

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
you look at those gills they're not

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.759 
you look at those gills they're not
fully<00:03:59.769> formed<00:04:00.130> they're<00:04:00.580> kind<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:02.200> don't

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
fully formed they're kind of I don't

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.120 
fully formed they're kind of I don't
know<00:04:02.890> folds<00:04:03.640> more<00:04:04.030> than<00:04:04.209> they<00:04:04.330> are<00:04:04.360> gills

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130

what's on the forest floor normally so I

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.180 
what's on the forest floor normally so I
found<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.110> spot<00:05:29.140> up<00:05:29.500> here<00:05:29.650> in<00:05:29.710> their<00:05:29.830> several

chanterelles this is a nice big Rustler
there's<00:06:13.930> a<00:06:14.020> variety<00:06:14.380> of<00:06:14.440> different<00:06:14.590> types<00:06:14.920> of

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
there's a variety of different types of

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.580 
there's a variety of different types of
rough<00:06:15.250> lows<00:06:15.720> but<00:06:16.720> you<00:06:16.840> can<00:06:16.990> tell<00:06:17.230> it's<00:06:17.500> got

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
rough lows but you can tell it's got

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.370 
rough lows but you can tell it's got
that<00:06:17.830> reddish<00:06:18.190> color<00:06:18.460> top<00:06:18.990> we're<00:06:19.990> gonna<00:06:20.110> pull

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
that reddish color top we're gonna pull

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.300 
that reddish color top we're gonna pull
it<00:06:21.660> now<00:06:22.660> look<00:06:22.840> at<00:06:22.960> that<00:06:22.990> see<00:06:23.590> how<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.800> gills

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
it now look at that see how the gills

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.120 
it now look at that see how the gills
are<00:06:24.610> on<00:06:24.760> the<00:06:24.880> bottom<00:06:25.150> of<00:06:25.300> that<00:06:25.980> how<00:06:26.980> they're

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
are on the bottom of that how they're

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.840 
are on the bottom of that how they're
much<00:06:27.250> deeper<00:06:27.760> and<00:06:28.060> knife-like<00:06:29.400> and<00:06:30.400> the<00:06:30.550> stalk

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
much deeper and knife-like and the stalk

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.070 
much deeper and knife-like and the stalk
actually<00:06:31.660> is<00:06:32.250> kinda<00:06:33.250> like<00:06:33.310> chalk<00:06:33.960> you<00:06:34.960> can

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 
actually is kinda like chalk you can

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.810 
actually is kinda like chalk you can
break<00:06:35.320> it<00:06:35.470> really<00:06:35.680> quickly<00:06:35.920> and<00:06:36.160> chanterelles

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
break it really quickly and chanterelles

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.110 
break it really quickly and chanterelles
is<00:06:36.970> not<00:06:37.120> it<00:06:37.270> not<00:06:37.450> that<00:06:37.600> easily<00:06:37.810> not<00:06:38.350> that<00:06:38.500> easy

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
is not it not that easily not that easy

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.320 
is not it not that easily not that easy
so<00:06:40.120> that<00:06:40.480> is<00:06:40.660> a<00:06:40.690> Rustler<00:06:42.030> this<00:06:43.030> is<00:06:43.300> a

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
so that is a Rustler this is a

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.490 
so that is a Rustler this is a
chantrelle<00:06:44.310> different<00:06:45.450> Rustler<00:06:46.500> chantrelle

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
chantrelle different Rustler chantrelle

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.670 
chantrelle different Rustler chantrelle
don't<00:06:48.280> mistake<00:06:48.520> them

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
don't mistake them

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.409 
don't mistake them
and<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:51.490> other<00:06:51.610> thing<00:06:51.790> is<00:06:51.970> you<00:06:52.300> know

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
and the other thing is you know

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.140 
and the other thing is you know
mushrooms<00:06:52.870> are<00:06:53.139> like<00:06:53.860> apples<00:06:54.280> they're<00:06:54.940> the

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
mushrooms are like apples they're the

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.150 
mushrooms are like apples they're the
fruit<00:06:55.479> of<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:55.990> body<00:06:56.199> that<00:06:56.410> grows<00:06:56.680> under<00:06:56.919> the

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 
fruit of the body that grows under the

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.500 
fruit of the body that grows under the
mycelium<00:06:57.520> that<00:06:57.850> grows<00:06:58.000> underneath<00:06:58.300> the

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
mycelium that grows underneath the

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.570 
mycelium that grows underneath the
ground<00:06:58.720> here<00:06:59.020> so<00:06:59.590> I<00:06:59.620> picked<00:07:00.010> this<00:07:00.130> one<00:07:00.190> I<00:07:00.370> don't

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
ground here so I picked this one I don't

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.040 
ground here so I picked this one I don't
feel<00:07:00.729> that<00:07:00.850> bad<00:07:00.910> about<00:07:01.180> it<00:07:01.449> the<00:07:01.570> spores<00:07:01.900> are

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
feel that bad about it the spores are

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.290 
feel that bad about it the spores are
still<00:07:02.320> gonna<00:07:02.470> get<00:07:03.460> to<00:07:03.610> the<00:07:03.699> ground<00:07:03.880> there<00:07:04.180> it

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
still gonna get to the ground there it

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.129 
still gonna get to the ground there it
should<00:07:04.479> be<00:07:04.600> fine

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:05.139 
should be fine

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.030 
should be fine
so<00:07:06.449> it<00:07:07.449> should<00:07:07.630> be<00:07:07.720> all<00:07:07.870> right<00:07:07.900> and<00:07:08.860> they'll

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
so it should be all right and they'll

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.300 
so it should be all right and they'll
grow<00:07:09.250> in<00:07:09.460> the<00:07:09.580> same<00:07:09.760> spot<00:07:10.120> again<00:07:10.330> next<00:07:10.750> year

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
grow in the same spot again next year

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.250
