00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
sections of the house so we got together

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.460 
sections of the house so we got together
and<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.570> formed<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> search<00:03:06.810> party<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.260> we

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
and we formed a search party and we

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.220 
and we formed a search party and we
looked<00:03:07.650> for<00:03:07.829> this<00:03:07.920> kid<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:09.079> looked<00:03:10.079> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
looked for this kid and we looked and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.789 
looked for this kid and we looked and
looked<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.590> we<00:03:10.739> couldn't<00:03:11.040> find<00:03:11.220> him<00:03:11.430> anywhere

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
looked and we couldn't find him anywhere

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.860 
looked and we couldn't find him anywhere
finally<00:03:13.799> kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:14.880> concluded<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.480> Elizabeth

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
finally kind of concluded that Elizabeth

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.180 
finally kind of concluded that Elizabeth
must<00:03:16.079> have<00:03:16.200> been<00:03:16.290> crazy<00:03:16.530> because<00:03:16.950> there<00:03:17.070> was

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
must have been crazy because there was

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.009 
must have been crazy because there was
no<00:03:17.340> one<00:03:17.459> who<00:03:17.880> would<00:03:18.000> tell<00:03:18.269> me<00:03:18.360> coming<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> claim

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
no one who would tell me coming to claim

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.699 
no one who would tell me coming to claim
a<00:03:19.079> kid

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
a kid

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.320 
a kid
so<00:03:21.709> we<00:03:22.160> figured<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.550> kid<00:03:22.700> probably<00:03:22.849> just

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
so we figured the kid probably just

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.210 
so we figured the kid probably just
rejoined<00:03:23.750> his<00:03:23.930> tour<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.800> was<00:03:24.860> that

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
rejoined his tour and that was that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.699 
rejoined his tour and that was that
turned<00:03:25.730> on<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:25.970> motion<00:03:26.270> sensors<00:03:26.720> and<00:03:27.050> it

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
turned on the motion sensors and it

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.290 
turned on the motion sensors and it
didn't<00:03:27.950> detect<00:03:28.250> anybody<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:28.880> we<00:03:29.030> all<00:03:29.150> went

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
didn't detect anybody so we all went

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.370 
didn't detect anybody so we all went
home<00:03:29.920> okay<00:03:31.150> fast<00:03:32.150> forward<00:03:32.510> two<00:03:32.780> weeks<00:03:33.020> later

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
home okay fast forward two weeks later

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.110 
home okay fast forward two weeks later
