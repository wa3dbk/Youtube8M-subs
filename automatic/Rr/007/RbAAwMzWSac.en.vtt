00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.259
 Nancy Sea Siler: "This is my cousin Elkie" 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.359
 Nancy Sea Siler "What do you think we should do with Brigitte Bard... 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.460
 Do you know Angelina Jolie? 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 With eyes, eyelashes, eyebrows "Elkie: "Too good." 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.429
 Concealer begins 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.880
 Put concealer in your eyes to keep your eyes bright 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 Cover any blue tone 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.830
 Next, use taup eyeshadow 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.609
 Definition 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.300
 Do not wipe 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 You want to dig and push the eye shadow 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.820
 Elkie: "I have an itchy lip" 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 Use soft brush corner 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 And put a lower eye shadow 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.410
 Use gray eye shadow above socket 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.410
 So you can see the depth when you open your eyes 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.800
 Don't forget the eye shadow edge fusion 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.040
 Define the eyebrow brush with a firm angle 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.960
 I am using gray eyeshadow 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.390
 It doesn't look like you have soft eyebrows 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.850
 Like an old man 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 Which one is the best... 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.050
 In order to determine the end of your eyebrows we use 'Folin' MAC Cosmetics 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.190
 It gives you a beautiful end to your forehead 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.280
 So they stick out 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 Use hair spray and clean mascara sticks. 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:18.950
 Next to the Bobby Brown Black Gel Pad and Art Shop Brush. 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.060
 Get the angel's right, the best angle can be from any 0:02:23.060,0:02:29.749 your nose tip or your nostrils to the edge of your forehead, 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.749
 Make sure your eyeliner goes down to the lash line and then what do you want to do 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:39.309
 Once your exercise is to make sure its edges are straight 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:42.400
 No on-line emergence 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.490
 When you are old, you can look at the bad eyeliner. 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.490
 Do not be sad, 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.119
 Use liquid eyeliner 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:07.119
 Open your eyes and mark the angle 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.199
 a small amount of gel pad placed in the eye together with the connecting line 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:24.199
 Just remember that the eyes to be applied are very outside 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.449
 Don't forget to draw a line from the eye to the top 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.319
 So it looks like a seamless line 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.679
 fashion 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.999
 Now we have to clean up our foundation, eyes 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.819
 And put on the moisturizer 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.709
 Next, Foundation makeup 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.589
 In the acrylic foundation brush facing the center 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:02.109
 And work outside the way in your own way 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.749
 Then use a clean brush to naturally split the skin into a fluffy light yellow product. 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:12.549
 If you don't have a foundation brush 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.579
 Use your finger 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.909
 Place a concealer on your fingers with your eyes. Then conceal 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:23.530
 In your nose or have any redness 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.330
 And any mole or pimples 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.979
 Set makeup and take away shine 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.189
 Use loose powder, only when needed 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.349
 So it doesn't look too much 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:50.349
 Use your ring finger on the loose powder mask and set the concealer in your eyes. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.520
 Apple peach blush on cheek 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.020
 Mixed into the tibia. 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.289
 Make sure you are well integrated. 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.360
 For this, the thicker the eyelash, the better. 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.449
 So we have started with our first layer of mascara black 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.050
 Makeup artist's trick while mascara is still wet 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.259
 Loose powder on a brush, eyelashes and its coat 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:46.139
 That will make your eyelashes look thick 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.149
 Ladies don't forget to curl! 

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:55.149
 It makes the eyelashes look longer. 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:05.369
 Now the second layer of mascara 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:13.219
 Combing it out to get any block 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:20.219
 And your mascara is still wet. 

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:30.619
 Now we need to expand the personal whip 

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.669
 They are like little wigs, you put your eyelashes on top 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:47.669
 And sometimes they will stay away from you! 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:52.960
 I have a bad cold. 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.830
 Use the tweezers to put the place, the outer end of your eyelashes 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.280
 Use the black eyeliner below the lower edge of your eye 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.569
 The last layer of black mascara 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.379
 Use a lip liner to make a shadow darker than a natural lip 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:21.379
 Then click on some lip gloss 

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.550
 Nancy Hessler: "Give a big fat kiss!" 

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:42.099
 “Do you like Brigitte Barry?” 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.879
 "OUI!" "Although my smile I sound like a dog!"
