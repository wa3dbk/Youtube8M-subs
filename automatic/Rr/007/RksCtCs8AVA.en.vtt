 mortal from whatever planet you come from 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:53.850
 let's start from the end 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:57.149
 let's start from the end ok to how 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.059
 epitaph you would choose then epitaph 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.129

 seen things you ca n't not 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.229
 for the and the rays flash in the dark 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.630
 near the tannhauser gates to this 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.780
 it is undoubtedly the strangest test that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.560
 I have done company existence and ne 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.990
 I made strange tests on an island 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.960
 presumably you might deserted the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950

 a good book a satellite phone 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.950
 with internet connection my sword 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 laser dynamite to explode i 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.240
 hatches of course a phone 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.579
 with an internet connection 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.130
 so you are the only one who has come up with it 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.289
 something useful to escape but it wasn't 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.009
 to escape simply to stay up 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.020
 Internet 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.009
 clear that maybe I would just like to keep 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.679

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.000
 what the fuck does it matter but I don't know about it 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.040
 let's talk about this test then 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.349
 warns of a special night composed of 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.630
 music changes the romantic dinner one 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.790
 marathon of doraemon halo episodes 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.980

 people with the grain communicates born to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.019

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.400
 plasma is my dream then in a 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.920
 fighting from will be what you would do 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.840
 bush in jeans that to the technique of edges 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.010
 naruto with what he does so that yes 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.380

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.560
 here 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.439

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.989
 much more just a good new album 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:23.030
 to jump to do more a man or mine 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.260
 coffee imagine if he should buy you 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.079
 if you had to buy a computer 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.650
 a mac would be a laptop a computer 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.069
 table top 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.230
 the last cycle but with linux a hal9000 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.419
 obviously then I would opt for a 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.819
 desktop computer that actually is 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.370
 what i have in which reason you should 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.950
 want a laptop only you always use 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.129
 at home I have a computer from 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.129
 table 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.939
 the ringtone that prefers the myths of 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.980

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.959

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.849
 of fans the imperial march well me 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.760
 I would undoubtedly opt for the march 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.040
 imperial confesses the ringtone which 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.439
 identify your garment more than anything else 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.690
 my professor then the two friends 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:08.269
 call to fix the computer go 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.859
 have a drink to jump a prison 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.629
 underground pay more or not me 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.129
 would like to do a marathon of the 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.540
 need television to see the last one 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:19.430
 steven spielberg film 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.229
 well i would say go for a drink 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.810
 make sure they don't do it to get you 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.669
 pay all the rounds then the thing 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.759
 more difficult than you made it understood 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.590
 final of akira evangelion programming 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.770
 that crime assembler follow the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.840
 timeline of lost do 9 pulling 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.550
 10 data to repair my car 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.820
 time but I would say follow the line 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:47.240
 lost time because I tried to 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.800
 see melo on rai.tv 5 6 7 8 years ago not 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.199
 I understood nothing because sometimes I did 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.360
 I lost a bet that is lost already is 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.680
 difficult of his then you also lose one 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.199
 bet becomes practically impossible 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.789
 so I would say laces not even by mistake 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.480
 I don't have the problem 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:03.030
 dick 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.310
 no place is better than talana 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.660
 to amber at home in japan 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.460
 127 ok i guess the first ones i don't know to 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.950
 What is definitely refer a 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:18.360

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.160
 there it actually would be very nice 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.690
 ok the moment of truth has arrived 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.930
 we see the result even though I have 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:37.380
 really scared common mortal ok i think 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.540
 to consider myself lucky to be a 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.120
 common mortal on this game ie with 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.370
 the questions he asked me, I think, is one 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.270
 good thing sad gray without 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.640
