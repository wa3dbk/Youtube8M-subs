00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:28.649 
controller I'm trying to zoom in on

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.279 
controller I'm trying to zoom in on
their<00:00:28.800> logo<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> little<00:00:29.550> bit<00:00:29.699> here<00:00:30.059> but<00:00:30.719> we've

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
their logo a little bit here but we've

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.910 
their logo a little bit here but we've
had<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.919> controller<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:33.110> probably<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.649> few

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
had this controller for probably a few

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.290 
had this controller for probably a few
months<00:00:35.129> now

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
months now

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.180 
months now
and<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.750> haven't<00:00:37.050> taken<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.159> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and we haven't taken the time to do a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560 
and we haven't taken the time to do a
review<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.729> it

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
review on it

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.170 
review on it
partially<00:00:40.229> because<00:00:40.519> we<00:00:41.519> had<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.699> little<00:00:41.940> bit<00:00:42.059> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
partially because we had a little bit of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
partially because we had a little bit of
issue<00:00:42.449> with<00:00:42.690> my<00:00:43.079> controller<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.829> got<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
issue with my controller when we got it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.660 
issue with my controller when we got it
which<00:00:44.339> I'll<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.640> into<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.440> another<00:00:47.399> part<00:00:47.640> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
which I'll go into but another part of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.040 
which I'll go into but another part of
it's<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.000> we've<00:00:48.149> been<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.540> really<00:00:48.839> busy

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's just we've been really really busy

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.079 
it's just we've been really really busy
and<00:00:49.350> another<00:00:50.159> part<00:00:50.400> of<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.549> is<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.790> wanted<00:00:51.000> to

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
and another part of it is we wanted to

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.280 
and another part of it is we wanted to
use<00:00:51.269> them<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.479> a<00:00:51.629> while<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> could

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
use them for a while so that we could

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.410 
use them for a while so that we could
give<00:00:52.409> you<00:00:52.500> guys<00:00:52.650> an<00:00:52.830> accurate<00:00:53.250> review<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
give you guys an accurate review of the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.509 
give you guys an accurate review of the
controller<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.080> without<00:00:56.070> any<00:00:56.220> further<00:00:56.309> ado

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
controller so without any further ado

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:59.329 
controller so without any further ado
let's<00:00:56.699> get<00:00:56.939> into<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.949> these<00:00:58.949> controllers

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
let's get into it so these controllers

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:01.340 
let's get into it so these controllers
are<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.970> comparable<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.809> guess<00:01:01.080> you<00:01:01.199> could

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
are very comparable I guess you could

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.950 
are very comparable I guess you could
say<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.710> scuf<00:01:02.070> gaming<00:01:02.489> controller<00:01:02.960> they

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
say to a scuf gaming controller they

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
say to a scuf gaming controller they
have<00:01:04.140> buttons<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.759> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
have buttons on the back of the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.230 
have buttons on the back of the
controller<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.090> they're

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
controller that is you know that they're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.660 
controller that is you know that they're
in<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.509> like<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> very<00:01:10.049> good<00:01:10.530> position<00:01:10.829> actually

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in a like a very good position actually

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.999 
in a like a very good position actually
I'm<00:01:12.119> gonna<00:01:12.270> try<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.470> zoom<00:01:13.500> in

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
I'm gonna try and see if I can zoom in

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.289 
I'm gonna try and see if I can zoom in
on<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> buttons<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.880> turn<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> just

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
on the buttons here can you turn it just

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
on the buttons here can you turn it just
a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.479> bit<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:15.840> towards<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.079> light<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
a little bit more towards the light the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.899 
a little bit more towards the light the
other<00:01:17.369> direction

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
other direction

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.670 
other direction
no<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.240> would<00:01:18.329> work<00:01:18.420> work<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.439> can<00:01:19.560> see

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
no that would work work so you can see

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.149 
no that would work work so you can see
the<00:01:19.799> buttons<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> buttons

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the buttons right there and the buttons

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.090 
the buttons right there and the buttons
that<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.630> four<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.770> they're<00:01:25.950> in

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that we have we have four but they're in

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
that we have we have four but they're in
like<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.280> perfect<00:01:26.760> position<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> Tiffany's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
like a perfect position and Tiffany's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
like a perfect position and Tiffany's
gonna<00:01:28.440> try<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.920> model<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.090> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
gonna try and model it right there so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.300 
gonna try and model it right there so
the<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.840> where<00:01:31.020> she<00:01:31.229> holds<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.770> button<00:01:32.100> or

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the right where she holds the button or

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.700 
the right where she holds the button or
the<00:01:32.610> controller<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:34.020> buttons<00:01:34.380> are<00:01:34.530> right

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the controller the buttons are right

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
the controller the buttons are right
underneath<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.280> her<00:01:35.370> fingertips<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> they

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
underneath of her fingertips and they

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.960 
underneath of her fingertips and they
actually<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.720> three<00:01:36.960> different<00:01:37.049> locations

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
actually have three different locations

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.130 
actually have three different locations
so<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.030> can<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.690> make<00:01:39.810> them<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> little

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
so you can actually make them a little

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
so you can actually make them a little
bit<00:01:40.350> higher<00:01:40.590> up<00:01:40.799> on<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:40.979> controller<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
bit higher up on the controller the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.640 
bit higher up on the controller the
traditional<00:01:42.630> position<00:01:42.810> which<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> where<00:01:43.500> we

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
traditional position which is where we

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.980 
traditional position which is where we
opted<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.130> ours<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.780> them

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
opted to have ours or you can have them

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870 
opted to have ours or you can have them
lower<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.830> on<00:01:47.010> the<00:01:47.100> controller<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.729> have

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
lower down on the controller if you have

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
lower down on the controller if you have
much<00:01:48.150> bigger<00:01:48.360> hands<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> they<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.430> also<00:01:50.580> do

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
much bigger hands so they can also do

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
much bigger hands so they can also do
you<00:01:51.150> know<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:51.690> sorts<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.080> stuff<00:01:52.260> like

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you know like all sorts of stuff like

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.109 
you know like all sorts of stuff like
obviously<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.100> ours<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.520> chromed<00:01:53.880> out

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
obviously you see ours is chromed out

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.539 
obviously you see ours is chromed out
with<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> blue<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.229> pink<00:01:55.560> look<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
with the blue and pink look for the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.330 
with the blue and pink look for the
husband<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.970> wife<00:01:57.060> kind<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:58.100> theme<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> guess

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
husband and wife kind of theme I guess

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160 
husband and wife kind of theme I guess
you<00:01:59.670> could<00:01:59.820> say<00:02:00.000> Tiffany's<00:02:00.510> controller<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you could say Tiffany's controller that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.429 
you could say Tiffany's controller that
she<00:02:01.290> has<00:02:01.500> sitting<00:02:01.860> down<00:02:02.010> lower<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.689> polar

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
she has sitting down lower is the polar

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.929 
she has sitting down lower is the polar
opposite<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.100> guess<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.369> could<00:02:05.520> say<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> that

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
opposite I guess you could say to that

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.990 
opposite I guess you could say to that
so<00:02:06.570> mine<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.409> blue<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.009> pink<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.519> where

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so mine is the blue and pink and where

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
so mine is the blue and pink and where
hers<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.390> pink<00:02:09.629> mine's<00:02:09.869> blue<00:02:10.049> so<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.860> forth<00:02:11.069> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
hers is pink mine's blue so so forth and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
hers is pink mine's blue so so forth and
so<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.340> hers<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.760> obviously<00:02:12.090> much<00:02:12.239> cleaner

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
so on hers is obviously much cleaner

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
so on hers is obviously much cleaner
than<00:02:12.720> mine<00:02:12.870> looking<00:02:13.170> at<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.209> but<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
than mine looking at that so but the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
than mine looking at that so but the
buttons<00:02:17.430> aren't<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> only<00:02:17.909> thing<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.330> he

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
buttons aren't the only thing that he

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.630 
buttons aren't the only thing that he
can<00:02:18.720> do<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.080> these<00:02:19.170> controllers<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.580> he

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
can do to these controllers so what he

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640 
can do to these controllers so what he
can<00:02:20.790> actually<00:02:21.090> do<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.299> he<00:02:21.599> can<00:02:21.840> tighten<00:02:22.439> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
can actually do is he can tighten the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.550 
can actually do is he can tighten the
thumb<00:02:22.890> sticks<00:02:23.159> now<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.599> thumb<00:02:24.900> stick<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
thumb sticks now so the thumb stick that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.229 
thumb sticks now so the thumb stick that
Tiffany<00:02:25.980> has<00:02:26.129> on<00:02:26.279> her<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:26.700> thumb<00:02:27.029> is

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
Tiffany has on her right thumb is

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.300 
Tiffany has on her right thumb is
actually<00:02:27.779> tighter<00:02:28.409> and<00:02:28.650> it's<00:02:28.829> more<00:02:29.040> similar

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
actually tighter and it's more similar

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.330 
actually tighter and it's more similar
to<00:02:29.489> an<00:02:29.999> Xbox<00:02:30.419> 360<00:02:30.719> thumb<00:02:31.349> stick<00:02:31.560> than<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:32.010> Xbox

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
to an Xbox 360 thumb stick than the Xbox

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.879 
to an Xbox 360 thumb stick than the Xbox
one<00:02:32.579> thumb<00:02:32.790> stick<00:02:35.060> yeah<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.719> the<00:02:37.139> Xbox<00:02:37.590> one

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
one thumb stick yeah so the the Xbox one

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:40.789 
one thumb stick yeah so the the Xbox one
thumb<00:02:38.700> stick<00:02:38.999> is<00:02:39.209> very<00:02:40.049> very<00:02:40.260> loose<00:02:40.529> and<00:02:40.739> it

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
thumb stick is very very loose and it

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.769 
thumb stick is very very loose and it
feels<00:02:41.129> loose<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.299> don't<00:02:42.510> really<00:02:42.629> realize

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:42.779 
feels loose and you don't really realize

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.170 
feels loose and you don't really realize
how<00:02:43.139> loose<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.889> until<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.430> play<00:02:44.760> again

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
how loose it is until you play again

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.759 
how loose it is until you play again
with<00:02:45.389> one<00:02:45.659> that<00:02:45.779> is<00:02:45.930> tighter<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.409> then<00:02:46.680> you

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
with one that is tighter and then you

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.949 
with one that is tighter and then you
try<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.040> go<00:02:47.129> back<00:02:47.310> again<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.849> that's<00:02:48.719> a

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
try and go back again and that's a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.440 
try and go back again and that's a
modification<00:02:49.829> that<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.189> I<00:02:50.879> don't<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.389> I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
modification that I I don't think I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.759 
modification that I I don't think I
could<00:02:51.599> ever<00:02:51.629> play<00:02:52.079> with<00:02:52.260> an<00:02:52.379> Xbox<00:02:52.680> one

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
could ever play with an Xbox one

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.799 
could ever play with an Xbox one
controller<00:02:53.279> again<00:02:53.549> without<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.450> tighten

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:54.809 
controller again without that tighten

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.019 
controller again without that tighten
thumb<00:02:55.049> stick<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.529> he<00:02:56.189> can<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.609> for<00:02:56.879> like

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:57.029 
thumb stick and he can do that for like

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.729 
thumb stick and he can do that for like
ten<00:02:57.389> dollars<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:57.989> really<00:02:58.319> makes<00:02:58.590> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
ten dollars and it really makes a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.289 
ten dollars and it really makes a
significant<00:02:59.340> difference<00:02:59.669> in<00:02:59.760> your<00:02:59.909> shot<00:03:00.150> or

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
significant difference in your shot or

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.860 
significant difference in your shot or
at<00:03:00.359> least<00:03:00.510> for<00:03:00.689> me<00:03:00.809> it<00:03:00.930> felt<00:03:01.079> like<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.409> did<00:03:01.559> and

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
at least for me it felt like it did and

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.149 
at least for me it felt like it did and
the<00:03:03.870> next<00:03:04.139> thing<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.319> they<00:03:04.559> can<00:03:04.739> do<00:03:04.889> is<00:03:05.040> they

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
the next thing that they can do is they

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.399 
the next thing that they can do is they
obviously<00:03:05.340> do<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.939> the<00:03:06.239> triggers<00:03:06.689> they<00:03:07.349> do

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
obviously do the the triggers they do

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.129 
obviously do the the triggers they do
the<00:03:07.739> adjustable<00:03:08.370> hair<00:03:09.180> triggers<00:03:09.540> kind<00:03:09.989> of

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
the adjustable hair triggers kind of

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.140 
the adjustable hair triggers kind of
like<00:03:10.319> scuff<00:03:10.680> does<00:03:10.919> but<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.549> opted<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:11.939> go<00:03:12.120> with

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
like scuff does but we opted to go with

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.879 
like scuff does but we opted to go with
what's<00:03:12.450> called<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.749> smart<00:03:13.049> trigger<00:03:13.379> so<00:03:13.859> you

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
what's called the smart trigger so you

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.470 
what's called the smart trigger so you
can<00:03:14.069> see<00:03:14.219> right<00:03:14.340> now<00:03:14.400> Tiffany<00:03:14.969> is<00:03:15.090> barely

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
can see right now Tiffany is barely

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.809 
can see right now Tiffany is barely
pushing<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.139> that<00:03:16.290> little<00:03:16.739> tiny<00:03:17.069> bit<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.579> as

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
pushing it that little tiny bit is as

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.189 
pushing it that little tiny bit is as
far<00:03:18.090> as<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.359> controller<00:03:18.689> goes<00:03:18.870> down<00:03:19.049> no

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
far as the controller goes down no

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.199 
far as the controller goes down no
matter<00:03:19.349> how<00:03:19.590> hard<00:03:19.859> she<00:03:19.919> pushes<00:03:20.370> on<00:03:20.519> that<00:03:20.669> that

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
matter how hard she pushes on that that

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.220 
matter how hard she pushes on that that
is<00:03:21.329> as<00:03:21.510> far<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.799> controller's<00:03:24.230> trigger

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
is as far as the controller's trigger

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.860 
is as far as the controller's trigger
will<00:03:25.590> actually<00:03:26.069> pull<00:03:26.459> down<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.029> it's<00:03:27.629> because

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
will actually pull down and it's because

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.030 
will actually pull down and it's because
what<00:03:27.989> he's<00:03:28.109> done<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.379> he's<00:03:28.529> turned<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
what he's done is he's turned the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.030 
what he's done is he's turned the
trigger<00:03:29.309> into<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.819> button<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:31.469> button<00:03:31.889> is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
trigger into a button and the button is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.299 
trigger into a button and the button is
actually<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.909> very<00:03:33.540> responsive<00:03:34.260> it's<00:03:34.439> like<00:03:35.069> it

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:35.309 
actually is very responsive it's like it

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.519 
actually is very responsive it's like it
works<00:03:35.669> instantly<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.510> what<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.049> does<00:03:37.230> is<00:03:37.409> it

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:37.529 
works instantly and what it does is it

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.159 
works instantly and what it does is it
makes<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.129> your<00:03:38.579> button<00:03:39.569> or<00:03:39.870> your

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
makes it so that your button or your

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.080 
makes it so that your button or your
controller<00:03:41.010> thinks<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.549> it's<00:03:41.669> being<00:03:41.849> pushed

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
controller thinks that it's being pushed

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.089 
controller thinks that it's being pushed
down<00:03:42.180> at<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.449> hundred<00:03:42.749> percent<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.859> if<00:03:43.980> you've

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
down at a hundred percent so if you've

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.409 
down at a hundred percent so if you've
ever<00:03:44.249> tried<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> play<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.760> game<00:03:44.999> like<00:03:45.150> Grand

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
ever tried to play a game like Grand

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.360 
ever tried to play a game like Grand
Theft<00:03:45.540> Auto<00:03:45.749> for<00:03:46.109> example<00:03:46.499> with<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> scuf

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
Theft Auto for example with a scuf

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.949 
Theft Auto for example with a scuf
controller<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.969> know<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.329> your<00:03:48.449> car<00:03:48.719> won't

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
controller you know that your car won't

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.369 
controller you know that your car won't
go<00:03:49.109> very<00:03:49.439> fast<00:03:49.739> because<00:03:50.549> your<00:03:51.569> scuf

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
go very fast because your scuf

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.929 
go very fast because your scuf
controller<00:03:52.409> doesn't<00:03:53.159> allow<00:03:53.309> you<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.579> depress

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
controller doesn't allow you to depress

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.869 
controller doesn't allow you to depress
the<00:03:54.089> trigger<00:03:54.239> all<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.629> way<00:03:54.749> down<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:56.669> one

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
the trigger all the way down so this one

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:57.979 
the trigger all the way down so this one
actually<00:03:57.029> allows<00:03:57.389> you<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.599> get<00:03:57.749> to<00:03:57.839> a<00:03:57.870> hundred

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
actually allows you to get to a hundred

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.479 
actually allows you to get to a hundred
percent<00:03:58.260> which<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.739> really<00:03:59.069> cool<00:03:59.749> so<00:04:01.159> yeah<00:04:02.159> so

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
percent which is really cool so yeah so

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.579 
percent which is really cool so yeah so
we<00:04:02.730> have<00:04:03.089> really<00:04:03.540> really<00:04:03.900> enjoyed<00:04:04.409> these

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:04.589 
we have really really enjoyed these

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.979 
we have really really enjoyed these
controllers<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.309> think<00:04:05.519> we<00:04:06.419> had<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.719> shark

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
controllers I think we had the shark

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.720 
controllers I think we had the shark
controllers<00:04:07.529> and<00:04:07.769> we<00:04:08.010> were<00:04:08.129> sponsored<00:04:08.699> by

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
controllers and we were sponsored by

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.399 
controllers and we were sponsored by
shark<00:04:09.059> controller<00:04:09.419> they<00:04:09.749> were<00:04:09.809> the<00:04:10.019> first

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
shark controller they were the first

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.349 
shark controller they were the first
company<00:04:10.889> that<00:04:10.919> I'm<00:04:11.129> aware<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.430> at<00:04:11.639> least<00:04:11.760> to

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
company that I'm aware of at least to

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.049 
company that I'm aware of at least to
actually<00:04:12.809> make<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.260> remapped<00:04:13.769> button<00:04:14.279> thumb

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:15.059 
actually make a remapped button thumb

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:17.330 
actually make a remapped button thumb
stick<00:04:15.329> controller<00:04:15.900> type<00:04:16.229> thing<00:04:16.470> and<00:04:17.220> they're

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
stick controller type thing and they're

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.830 
stick controller type thing and they're
good<00:04:17.549> controllers<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.269> would<00:04:18.540> say<00:04:18.690> that

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
good controllers but I would say that

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.650 
good controllers but I would say that
these<00:04:18.930> are<00:04:19.109> definitely<00:04:19.470> superior<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.400> them

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
these are definitely superior to them

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.580 
these are definitely superior to them
primarily<00:04:21.660> because<00:04:22.049> of<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.350> button

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
primarily because of the button

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.350 
primarily because of the button
placement<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.220> just<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.550> customizable

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
placement and just the customizable

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.510 
placement and just the customizable
options<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:25.050> know<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:26.220> button

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
options you know the the button

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.790 
options you know the the button
placement<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.970> good<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.449> triggers<00:04:27.900> really

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
placement is good the triggers really

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.439 
placement is good the triggers really
make<00:04:28.979> a<00:04:29.010> significant<00:04:29.729> difference<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.210> then

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
make a significant difference and then

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.020 
make a significant difference and then
having<00:04:30.900> that<00:04:31.250> adjustable<00:04:32.250> thumb<00:04:32.520> stick<00:04:32.790> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
having that adjustable thumb stick the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.790 
having that adjustable thumb stick the
you<00:04:33.630> know<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.870> tension<00:04:34.230> on<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.350> thumb<00:04:34.590> stick

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you know the tension on the thumb stick

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.290 
you know the tension on the thumb stick
is<00:04:34.920> a<00:04:34.950> big<00:04:35.580> big<00:04:35.820> difference<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:37.640> we<00:04:38.640> really

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
is a big big difference so we really

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.129 
is a big big difference so we really
really<00:04:39.480> have<00:04:40.260> enjoyed<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:41.040> aspect

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
really have enjoyed that aspect

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.600 
really have enjoyed that aspect
it<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:44.090> know<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.270> get<00:04:45.020> into<00:04:45.319> the<00:04:45.979> controller<00:04:46.490> a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
it you know to get into the controller a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.879 
it you know to get into the controller a
little<00:04:46.939> bit<00:04:47.060> more<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:47.539> company<00:04:47.990> itself<00:04:48.439> so

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
little bit more in the company itself so

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.739 
little bit more in the company itself so
I<00:04:48.919> had<00:04:49.310> mentioned<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.759> I<00:04:49.819> had<00:04:50.090> had<00:04:50.240> problems

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:50.749 
I had mentioned that I had had problems

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.439 
I had mentioned that I had had problems
with<00:04:50.960> my<00:04:51.169> controller<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:51.999> what<00:04:52.999> would<00:04:53.270> happen

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
with my controller and what would happen

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.600 
with my controller and what would happen
is<00:04:53.719> I<00:04:53.779> would<00:04:54.110> pull<00:04:54.379> the<00:04:54.949> right<00:04:55.219> thumbstick

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
is I would pull the right thumbstick

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.790 
is I would pull the right thumbstick
down<00:04:56.150> or<00:04:56.629> I'm<00:04:56.810> sorry<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:57.050> right<00:04:57.259> trigger<00:04:57.529> down

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
down or I'm sorry the right trigger down

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.730 
down or I'm sorry the right trigger down
and<00:04:58.479> it<00:04:59.479> would<00:04:59.629> just<00:04:59.659> keep<00:04:59.990> firing<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.590> firing

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and it would just keep firing and firing

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.600 
and it would just keep firing and firing
and<00:05:01.069> firing<00:05:01.189> forever<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.969> I<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.800> didn't<00:05:04.460> really

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
and firing forever and I I didn't really

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.899 
and firing forever and I I didn't really
know<00:05:04.729> why<00:05:04.909> but<00:05:04.939> he<00:05:05.949> took<00:05:06.949> it<00:05:07.099> back<00:05:07.129> and<00:05:07.460> he<00:05:07.699> took

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
know why but he took it back and he took

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.369 
know why but he took it back and he took
a<00:05:07.969> look<00:05:08.120> at<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.449> he<00:05:08.509> said<00:05:08.689> that<00:05:08.870> Microsoft

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:09.379 
a look at it and he said that Microsoft

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:11.739 
a look at it and he said that Microsoft
had<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.620> problem<00:05:09.889> with<00:05:10.189> it<00:05:10.340> when<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.360> when<00:05:11.689> it

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:11.749 
had a problem with it when it when it

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.360 
had a problem with it when it when it
came<00:05:11.960> out<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.199> he<00:05:12.439> fixed<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.830> problem<00:05:13.219> and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
came out and he fixed the problem and

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.929 
came out and he fixed the problem and
unfortunately<00:05:13.729> after<00:05:14.419> that<00:05:14.779> the<00:05:15.110> problem

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
unfortunately after that the problem

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.070 
unfortunately after that the problem
became<00:05:16.939> worse<00:05:17.210> with<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.599> Microsoft

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
became worse with the Microsoft

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.820 
became worse with the Microsoft
controller<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.159> my<00:05:20.169> motherboard<00:05:21.169> type<00:05:21.469> thing

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
controller and my motherboard type thing

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.200 
controller and my motherboard type thing
that's<00:05:22.099> built<00:05:22.460> inside<00:05:22.759> the<00:05:22.819> controller

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
that's built inside the controller

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.809 
that's built inside the controller
actually<00:05:23.419> fried<00:05:23.900> but<00:05:24.620> he<00:05:24.830> sent<00:05:25.099> me<00:05:25.250> a<00:05:25.460> brand

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
actually fried but he sent me a brand

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.709 
actually fried but he sent me a brand

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:39.469 
are completely up to par and just as

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.350 
are completely up to par and just as
good<00:05:39.650> if<00:05:39.830> not<00:05:39.860> better<00:05:40.039> than<00:05:40.490> any<00:05:40.909> controller

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
good if not better than any controller

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.519 
good if not better than any controller
that<00:05:41.509> I've<00:05:41.629> ever<00:05:41.749> used<00:05:41.870> and<00:05:42.110> I've<00:05:42.229> used<00:05:42.379> the

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529 
that I've ever used and I've used the

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:43.600 
that I've ever used and I've used the
shark<00:05:42.770> controller<00:05:43.159> and<00:05:43.310> a<00:05:43.370> scuf<00:05:43.580> controller

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
shark controller and a scuf controller

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.450 
shark controller and a scuf controller
before<00:05:44.180> and<00:05:44.539> so<00:05:45.319> far<00:05:45.589> I<00:05:45.860> would<00:05:45.919> say<00:05:46.189> that<00:05:46.339> this

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
before and so far I would say that this

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.950 
before and so far I would say that this
has<00:05:46.610> been<00:05:46.729> my<00:05:46.909> favorite<00:05:47.150> controller<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:49.039> only

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
has been my favorite controller the only

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.029 
has been my favorite controller the only
downside<00:05:50.960> that<00:05:51.650> I<00:05:51.680> can<00:05:52.039> even<00:05:52.430> remotely

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
downside that I can even remotely

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.010 
downside that I can even remotely
possibly<00:05:55.039> come<00:05:55.339> up<00:05:55.520> with<00:05:55.550> is<00:05:55.969> that<00:05:56.659> these

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
possibly come up with is that these

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.279 
possibly come up with is that these
little<00:05:57.379> buttons<00:05:58.159> on<00:05:58.399> the<00:05:58.669> back<00:05:59.289> will

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
little buttons on the back will

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.679 
little buttons on the back will
occasionally<00:06:01.250> come<00:06:01.879> out<00:06:02.060> and<00:06:02.270> fall<00:06:02.449> out<00:06:02.599> and

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
occasionally come out and fall out and

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:04.389 
occasionally come out and fall out and
right<00:06:02.810> now<00:06:02.930> I<00:06:02.990> can't<00:06:03.229> even<00:06:03.319> get<00:06:03.500> mine<00:06:03.710> out<00:06:03.830> but

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:04.399 
right now I can't even get mine out but

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:06.070 
right now I can't even get mine out but
Tiffany's<00:06:04.849> fell<00:06:05.060> out<00:06:05.240> on<00:06:05.270> her<00:06:05.599> the<00:06:05.839> other<00:06:05.960> day

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
Tiffany's fell out on her the other day

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.139 
Tiffany's fell out on her the other day
when<00:06:06.439> she<00:06:06.620> was<00:06:06.710> pulling<00:06:07.099> on<00:06:07.219> it<00:06:07.250> or<00:06:07.819> not<00:06:08.000> when

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:08.149 
when she was pulling on it or not when

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
when she was pulling on it or not when
she<00:06:08.240> was<00:06:08.270> pulling<00:06:08.569> on<00:06:08.629> it<00:06:08.689> but<00:06:08.870> when<00:06:08.990> she<00:06:09.020> was

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
she was pulling on it but when she was

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.540 
she was pulling on it but when she was
pushing<00:06:09.500> the<00:06:09.560> button<00:06:09.800> and<00:06:09.919> you<00:06:10.069> can<00:06:10.189> see<00:06:10.370> her

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
pushing the button and you can see her

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.709 
pushing the button and you can see her
she<00:06:10.669> just<00:06:10.819> came<00:06:10.969> out<00:06:11.029> right<00:06:11.300> there<00:06:11.419> when<00:06:11.569> she

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
she just came out right there when she

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:13.209 
she just came out right there when she
just<00:06:11.870> pulled<00:06:12.080> on<00:06:12.199> it<00:06:12.319> a<00:06:12.379> little<00:06:12.469> bit<00:06:12.649> so<00:06:13.189> that

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
just pulled on it a little bit so that

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.269 
just pulled on it a little bit so that
is<00:06:13.490> literally<00:06:14.089> the<00:06:14.419> only<00:06:14.560> downside<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:16.159> we

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:16.279 
is literally the only downside that we

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.790 
is literally the only downside that we
have<00:06:16.399> ever<00:06:16.580> had<00:06:16.909> with<00:06:17.509> the<00:06:17.659> controller<00:06:18.050> in

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
have ever had with the controller in

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.469 
have ever had with the controller in
long<00:06:19.189> term<00:06:19.399> she<00:06:19.610> can't<00:06:19.789> get<00:06:19.939> any<00:06:20.120> of<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.360> other

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
long term she can't get any of the other

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.790 
long term she can't get any of the other
ones<00:06:20.689> out<00:06:20.810> but<00:06:21.020> that<00:06:21.169> one<00:06:21.409> right<00:06:21.589> there<00:06:21.770> that

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
ones out but that one right there that

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.929 
ones out but that one right there that
she<00:06:22.039> pushed<00:06:23.080> yeah<00:06:24.759> yeah

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:25.939 
she pushed yeah yeah

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.050 
she pushed yeah yeah
so<00:06:26.120> that<00:06:26.899> is<00:06:27.050> literally<00:06:27.409> the<00:06:27.830> only<00:06:28.460> downside

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
so that is literally the only downside

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.200 
so that is literally the only downside
that<00:06:29.659> I<00:06:29.689> can<00:06:29.960> come<00:06:30.110> up<00:06:30.229> with<00:06:30.490> on<00:06:31.490> top<00:06:31.849> of<00:06:32.000> all<00:06:32.120> of

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
that I can come up with on top of all of

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.309 
that I can come up with on top of all of
these<00:06:32.360> great<00:06:32.659> things<00:06:32.930> that<00:06:33.020> we've<00:06:33.169> already

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
these great things that we've already

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.709 
these great things that we've already
talked<00:06:33.620> about<00:06:33.740> he<00:06:34.430> has<00:06:34.580> excellent<00:06:34.969> prices<00:06:35.389> if

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:35.719 
talked about he has excellent prices if

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:37.809 
talked about he has excellent prices if
you<00:06:35.839> want<00:06:36.020> just<00:06:36.169> a<00:06:36.289> generic<00:06:36.560> black<00:06:37.370> controller

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:37.819 
you want just a generic black controller

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.019 
you want just a generic black controller
with<00:06:38.149> buttons<00:06:38.599> and<00:06:38.810> triggers<00:06:39.789> you're<00:06:40.789> looking

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029

at like 95 to 105 dollars shipped and

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.450 
at like 95 to 105 dollars shipped and
you<00:06:44.899> can't<00:06:45.169> beat<00:06:45.379> that<00:06:45.620> if<00:06:45.770> you<00:06:46.129> want<00:06:46.310> to<00:06:46.370> go

you can't beat that if you want to go

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.610 
you can't beat that if you want to go
with<00:06:46.610> the<00:06:46.699> adjustable<00:06:47.180> thumb<00:06:47.659> stick<00:06:47.960> and<00:06:48.379> the

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
160 bucks I think ours almost fully

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.490 
160 bucks I think ours almost fully
customized<00:06:56.570> with<00:06:56.750> everything<00:06:57.169> that<00:06:57.290> you<00:06:57.380> can

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
customized with everything that you can

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.960

get<00:06:57.680> on<00:06:57.830> it<00:06:57.860> was<00:06:58.370> like<00:06:58.520> a<00:06:58.550> hundred<00:06:58.699> and

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
get on it was like a hundred and

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.960 
get on it was like a hundred and
sixty-five<00:06:59.419> dollars<00:07:00.010> and<00:07:01.010> that's<00:07:01.280> almost<00:07:01.790> the

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
sixty-five dollars and that's almost the

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:07.900 
sixty-five dollars and that's almost the
price<00:07:02.240> of<00:07:02.419> a<00:07:02.600> scuf<00:07:03.790> basic<00:07:04.790> controller<00:07:05.419> so<00:07:06.910> at

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:07.910 
price of a scuf basic controller so at

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.340 
price of a scuf basic controller so at
any<00:07:08.150> rate<00:07:08.360> we<00:07:08.690> really<00:07:08.960> do<00:07:09.050> like<00:07:09.229> this

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:09.350 
any rate we really do like this

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.780 
any rate we really do like this
controller<00:07:09.680> we<00:07:09.860> think<00:07:10.010> it's<00:07:10.160> great<00:07:10.370> I<00:07:10.580> think

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
controller we think it's great I think

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.100
