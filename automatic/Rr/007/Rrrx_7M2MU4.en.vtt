not have existed in like previous

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.380 
not have existed in like previous
generations<00:02:06.920> it's<00:02:07.310> amazing<00:02:07.759> for<00:02:07.790> me<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.240> see

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
generations it's amazing for me to see

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.690 
generations it's amazing for me to see
somebody<00:02:08.600> like<00:02:08.840> Tom<00:02:09.080> at<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.619> age<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.950> 13<00:02:10.429> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
somebody like Tom at the age of 13 and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.729 
somebody like Tom at the age of 13 and
then<00:02:10.910> think<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.209> how<00:02:11.360> we<00:02:11.420> were<00:02:11.720> at<00:02:11.840> 13<00:02:12.200> there's

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
then think of how we were at 13 there's

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:13.630 
then think of how we were at 13 there's
no<00:02:12.920> comparison

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
no comparison

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.940 
no comparison
I<00:02:13.670> mean<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.330> course<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.750> was<00:02:14.870> our<00:02:15.200> generation

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
I mean of course it was our generation

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.410 
I mean of course it was our generation
