pieces<00:03:51.800> -<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.480> guess<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.600> put<00:03:53.720> these<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.110> have<00:03:54.410> to

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
pieces - I guess you put these I have to

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.810 
pieces - I guess you put these I have to
learn<00:03:54.680> more<00:03:54.950> about<00:03:55.040> these<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.519> guess<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.790> just

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
learn more about these I guess you just

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.650 
learn more about these I guess you just
put<00:03:56.120> them<00:03:56.209> together<00:03:56.330> like<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.980> there<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.070> go

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
put them together like that there you go

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.070 
put them together like that there you go
so<00:04:00.070> next<00:04:01.070> let's<00:04:01.489> see<00:04:01.610> what<00:04:01.700> we<00:04:01.790> have<00:04:02.080> should

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
so next let's see what we have should

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.360 
so next let's see what we have should
probably<00:04:03.230> learn<00:04:03.440> more<00:04:03.680> about<00:04:03.769> these<00:04:04.010> before<00:04:04.310> I

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
probably learn more about these before I

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.190 
probably learn more about these before I
do<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:04.610> review<00:04:04.910> right<00:04:05.150> that's<00:04:06.050> what<00:04:06.170> you
