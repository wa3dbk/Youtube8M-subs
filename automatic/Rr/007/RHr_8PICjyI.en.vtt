distinguish<00:03:27.360> between<00:03:27.570> these<00:03:27.959> groups<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.470> we

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
distinguish between these groups so we

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.210 
distinguish between these groups so we
have<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.810> go<00:03:30.810> after<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.200> while<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.130> just
