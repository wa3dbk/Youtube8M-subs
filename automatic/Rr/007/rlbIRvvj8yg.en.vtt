 Are you in the fishery with a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.759
 diversity of records in your studio 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.990
 so you decide to change bait though 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.030
 if you do not have an organization 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.780
 necessary is this type of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.780
 problem occur 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.789
 So people, how did you see the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.109
 video introduction is very common. 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.250
 type of problem occurred with their 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.750
 artificial 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.150
 so it has a nice tip and well 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.379
 quick to show you today I 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.020
 I'm sure it will help soften 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.699
 this kind of problem will turn 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.710
 become more organized in its case in 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.320
 your case and you will have a facility 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.339
 greater convenience to have access to 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.339
 each of its artificial baits 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.269
 pump without further delay and consists of 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.640
 basically you use this kind of 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.839
 elastic to tear up your baits 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.250
 artificial 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.750
 that way it will not roll 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.390
 learn from each other do not know 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.220
 I'm in your fishing box . 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.290
 proved reserves jack finds this 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.879
 elastic rubber type 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.159
 It's pretty easy to find the guys you 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.950
 will at some 99 some shop there any 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.979
 is near your home and asks if you have 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.659
 if that mouth full of brown hair they 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.640
 sell one or two reais 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.340
 He is quite rubbery enough. 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.630
 elastic here you can learn a lot 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.060
 difficult thing and it's already made a 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.590
 video previously you have 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.539
 interest to see is running here in 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.999
 earth the link of the inscription also I 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.670
 I showed a way to tie the baits 

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:36.859
 artificial organize using the garrote 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.569
 gut of me by the mouth full of crying 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.219
 then in this video showing one more 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.409
 option if you do not have access to the 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.399
 can do this too. 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.049
 elastic here 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.869
 Good, how are you going to do well? 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:52.369
 simple and 12 garatéias pick up the elastic 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.219
 passes on one of the cats back and passes in the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.170
 another time until and releases it and says that it will 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.950
 get stuck that right 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.799
 you take another back here O will 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:12.590
 stay firmer around again 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:15.380
 Turn and lock here will get firmer 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.080
 Only this house that is smaller 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.810
 You need to take a few more turns. 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.610
 can you give without problem that will be more 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.580
 firm the artificial bait 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.140
 in the case of the garatéias prea né he already did 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.850
 with several official channels of the 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.170
 fig tree that they organized 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.670
 cute can see very nice zinho is 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.910
 this here in case you can see that it is 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.650
 the thesis is closer 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.140
 so I had to take a few more turns 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.140
 to learn but without any problem 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.989
 But that's it folks for you to have 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.440
