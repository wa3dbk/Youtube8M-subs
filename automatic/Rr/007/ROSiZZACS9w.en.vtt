00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
that layer this is one of them and as

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.630 
that layer this is one of them and as
you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.449> see<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.740> inside<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.520> these

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
you can see there's the inside of these

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.790 
you can see there's the inside of these
poppy<00:00:20.910> flowers<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> outside<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.289> when

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
poppy flowers and the outside and when

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.310 
poppy flowers and the outside and when
you<00:00:22.830> layer<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> two<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.670> them<00:00:23.820> together<00:00:24.320> they

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
you layer the two of them together they

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.160 
you layer the two of them together they
become<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.250> which<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.689> really<00:00:28.050> cool

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
become this which is just really cool

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
become this which is just really cool
and<00:00:28.230> obviously<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.920> use<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
and obviously you can use the just the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.790 
and obviously you can use the just the
insides<00:00:30.300> or<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> outsides<00:00:31.260> if<00:00:31.619> you'd

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
insides or just the outsides if you'd

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.940 
insides or just the outsides if you'd
like<00:00:32.090> another<00:00:33.090> 2-step<00:00:33.840> layering<00:00:34.290> stencil<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
like another 2-step layering stencil is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.360 
like another 2-step layering stencil is
this<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> mix-and-match<00:00:36.210> hearts<00:00:36.930> and

can mix with any of these three designs
and<00:00:44.550> it'll<00:00:45.000> look<00:00:45.149> something<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.140> two

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and it'll look something like the two

and it'll look something like the two
hearts<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.129> tag<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.480> I've

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
hearts on this tag that you can see I've

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.900 
hearts on this tag that you can see I've
done<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.000> two<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.910> four

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
done and then I have two that have four

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330 
done and then I have two that have four
different<00:00:54.870> mix-and-match<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
different mix-and-match this is the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.959 
different mix-and-match this is the
lotus<00:00:56.699> blossom<00:00:56.730> stencil<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:58.829> one<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
lotus blossom stencil and this one you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.939 
lotus blossom stencil and this one you
can<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.750> there's<00:01:01.109> two<00:01:01.289> different<00:01:01.410> outlines

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
can use there's two different outlines

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
can use there's two different outlines
either<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.640> single<00:01:02.820> outline<00:01:03.270> or<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.629> sort<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
either the single outline or the sort of

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
either the single outline or the sort of
woodcut<00:01:04.619> outline<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
woodcut outline and this is the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
woodcut outline and this is the
difference<00:01:06.600> between<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.229> single<00:01:08.070> outline

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
difference between the single outline

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.539 
difference between the single outline
and<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.330> woodcut<00:01:09.930> outline<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:11.189> that's<00:01:11.340> one

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
and the woodcut outline but that's one

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
and the woodcut outline but that's one
of<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.729> faves<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.240> love<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> one

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
of my faves I love that one

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.340 
of my faves I love that one
and<00:01:13.460> finally<00:01:14.460> there<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.540> layered<00:01:15.900> star

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and finally there is the layered star

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.020 
and finally there is the layered star
which<00:01:16.740> comes<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.130> four<00:01:17.340> parts<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.000> can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
which comes in four parts and you can

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.120 
which comes in four parts and you can
actually<00:01:18.270> put<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.869> four<00:01:19.290> parts<00:01:19.619> together<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
actually put all four parts together and

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
actually put all four parts together and
if<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:21.270> looks<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:21.780> something

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
if you do it looks a little something

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
if you do it looks a little something
like<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.500> tag<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.400> I'm<00:01:23.640> gonna<00:01:23.820> show<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> how

like this tag so I'm gonna show you how
to<00:01:24.509> use<00:01:24.900> all<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> these<00:01:25.619> layering<00:01:26.070> templates

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
to use all of these layering templates

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
to use all of these layering templates
I'm<00:01:28.140> using<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.829> poppy<00:01:29.250> stencil<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> tag<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I'm using the poppy stencil on a tag and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.350 
I'm using the poppy stencil on a tag and
a<00:01:31.439> cosmetic<00:01:31.950> sponge<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:33.000> acrylic

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
a cosmetic sponge with some acrylic

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
a cosmetic sponge with some acrylic
paint<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> see<00:01:35.040> I'm<00:01:35.159> putting<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
paint and you can see I'm putting in

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.999 
paint and you can see I'm putting in
green<00:01:35.939> for<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> leaves<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.200> red<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
green for the leaves and red for the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
green for the leaves and red for the
stems<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> could<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
stems now you could do a little bit of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.480 
stems now you could do a little bit of
masking<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.049> really<00:01:40.380> wanted<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.009> keep<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
masking if you really wanted to keep it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.910 
masking if you really wanted to keep it
neat<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.079> messy<00:01:43.470> look

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
neat but I like that kind of messy look

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.789 
neat but I like that kind of messy look
I<00:01:44.159> am<00:01:44.280> drying<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> make<00:01:46.409> sure<00:01:46.619> before

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
black outline around your colored area

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.619 
black outline around your colored area
so<00:02:09.780> we're<00:02:10.200> gonna<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.530> another<00:02:11.629> two-step

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
so we're gonna do another two-step

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.730 
so we're gonna do another two-step
stencil

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
stencil

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
stencil
and<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.730> mix<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.300> match<00:02:15.660> hearts<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and this is the mix and match hearts and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.350 
and this is the mix and match hearts and
I'm<00:02:16.620> using<00:02:16.860> some<00:02:17.310> distress<00:02:17.460> ink<00:02:17.910> with<00:02:18.060> an<00:02:18.180> ink

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
I'm using some distress ink with an ink

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.150 
I'm using some distress ink with an ink
blending<00:02:18.570> tool<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.530> can<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.830> filled

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
blending tool and you can see I filled

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.830 
blending tool and you can see I filled
in<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.340> heart<00:02:20.670> shape<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.210> then<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.810> to

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
in that heart shape and then I like to

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
in that heart shape and then I like to
mix<00:02:22.140> my<00:02:22.320> media<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.100> now<00:02:23.310> I'm<00:02:23.550> switching<00:02:23.790> to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
mix my media so now I'm switching to

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.030 
mix my media so now I'm switching to
some<00:02:24.300> acrylic<00:02:24.660> paint<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.380> again<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.650> could

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
some acrylic paint but again I could

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.620 
some acrylic paint but again I could
have<00:02:26.160> used<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.520> stress<00:02:26.730> ink<00:02:26.910> again<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.240> could

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
have used the stress ink again I could

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.230 
have used the stress ink again I could
use<00:02:27.750> spray<00:02:28.080> ink<00:02:28.290> whatever<00:02:28.800> whatever<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.970> have

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
use spray ink whatever whatever you have

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.540 
use spray ink whatever whatever you have
at<00:02:30.600> hand<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.380> now<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.860> see<00:02:32.070> there<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.400> go

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
at hand and now you can see there you go

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.250 
at hand and now you can see there you go
I<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> decorated<00:02:33.420> heart<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:33.870> there's<00:02:34.110> two

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
I have a decorated heart now there's two

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.900 
I have a decorated heart now there's two
different<00:02:34.410> shape<00:02:34.740> hearts<00:02:35.280> on<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.550> template

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
different shape hearts on this template

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.700 
different shape hearts on this template
so<00:02:36.420> here's<00:02:36.630> an<00:02:36.720> example<00:02:36.810> with<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.530> one

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
so here's an example with the little one

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.320 
so here's an example with the little one
and<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.340> see<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:38.640> using<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.940> Copic

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
and you can see I'm using the Copic

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.960 
and you can see I'm using the Copic
airbrush<00:02:39.510> system<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:41.430> do<00:02:41.490> mask

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
airbrush system there and I do mask

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.210 
airbrush system there and I do mask
things<00:02:42.330> off<00:02:42.570> with<00:02:42.840> post-its<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.770> think<00:02:44.070> that

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
things off with post-its I think that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.280 
things off with post-its I think that
that<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.640> keeps<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.300> little<00:02:45.480> bit<00:02:46.020> neater

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that just keeps it a little bit neater

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.100 
that just keeps it a little bit neater
and<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.430> airbrush<00:02:47.850> gives<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.540> nice<00:02:48.780> soft

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
and the airbrush gives that nice soft

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.780 
and the airbrush gives that nice soft
spray<00:02:49.560> paint<00:02:49.830> look<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.520> do<00:02:50.670> it

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
spray paint look but you can do it

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.030 
spray paint look but you can do it
inside<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.660> some<00:02:51.990> layered<00:02:52.320> hearts

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
inside and there are some layered hearts

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.490 
inside and there are some layered hearts
now<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.000> next<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.600> we're<00:02:54.750> gonna<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:55.140> is

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
now the next one we're gonna do is

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.700 
now the next one we're gonna do is
actually<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.510> four-step<00:02:57.510> process<00:02:57.990> but<00:02:58.620> of

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
actually a four-step process but of

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.680 
actually a four-step process but of
course<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.100> could<00:02:59.250> use<00:02:59.280> any<00:02:59.850> one<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
course you could use any one of the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.230 
course you could use any one of the
image<00:03:00.900> by<00:03:01.110> themselves<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.950> can<00:03:02.430> use<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:03.030> two

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
image by themselves you can use just two

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.390 
image by themselves you can use just two
you<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:03.630> use<00:03:03.780> just<00:03:03.930> three<00:03:04.260> it's<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:04.860> like

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
you can use just three it's really like

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.370 
you can use just three it's really like
a<00:03:05.430> choose-your-own-adventure<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:07.080> get<00:03:07.260> to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
a choose-your-own-adventure you get to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.080 
a choose-your-own-adventure you get to
choose<00:03:07.590> what<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.340> I've<00:03:08.490> just<00:03:08.520> I've

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
choose what you do so I've just I've

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.720 
choose what you do so I've just I've
done<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.690> star<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.650> now<00:03:10.800> I'm<00:03:10.890> adding<00:03:11.100> in<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
done the star and now I'm adding in the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.960 
done the star and now I'm adding in the
polka<00:03:12.090> dots<00:03:12.180> pretty<00:03:12.810> cool<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.500> now<00:03:14.220> I'm<00:03:14.790> gonna

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
polka dots pretty cool and now I'm gonna

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.610 
polka dots pretty cool and now I'm gonna
go<00:03:15.150> ahead<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.450> I'm<00:03:15.750> gonna<00:03:15.870> add<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.380> sort<00:03:16.560> of

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
go ahead and I'm gonna add the sort of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.870 
go ahead and I'm gonna add the sort of
bursts<00:03:16.950> look<00:03:17.340> around

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
bursts look around

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.810 
bursts look around
and<00:03:18.000> because<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.570> stencil<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.340> well

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
and because the stencil is so well

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.050 
and because the stencil is so well
designed<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:21.990> does<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.410> masking<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.340> terms<00:03:23.790> of

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
designed it does the masking in terms of

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.450 
designed it does the masking in terms of
the<00:03:24.180> image<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.020> nothing<00:03:25.740> in<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:25.890> polka<00:03:26.250> dot

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
the image so nothing in that polka dot

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.180 
the image so nothing in that polka dot
star<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.090> all<00:03:27.450> getting<00:03:27.810> touched<00:03:28.170> when<00:03:29.160> I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
star is that all getting touched when I

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.090 
star is that all getting touched when I
go<00:03:29.820> ahead<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.060> spray<00:03:30.570> those<00:03:31.050> rays<00:03:31.380> on<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.890> now

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
go ahead and spray those rays on and now

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.250 
go ahead and spray those rays on and now
I'm<00:03:32.490> using<00:03:32.640> some<00:03:32.910> acrylic<00:03:33.120> paint<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.840> can<00:03:34.020> see

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
I'm using some acrylic paint you can see

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.800 
I'm using some acrylic paint you can see
and<00:03:34.620> we're<00:03:34.920> gonna<00:03:35.040> get<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.280> nice<00:03:35.550> black<00:03:36.120> outline

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and we're gonna get a nice black outline

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
and we're gonna get a nice black outline
sort<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.290> sketchy<00:03:37.740> outline<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
sort of a sketchy outline I think and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.300 
sort of a sketchy outline I think and
there<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.990> finished<00:03:40.290> result<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:41.010> again
