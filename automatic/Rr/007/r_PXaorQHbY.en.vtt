00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.199
Now that you know the ins and outs of how
to use Lightroom and Photoshop together, in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.430
this chapter, I'll put that information to
use in some practical scenarios.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.000
First, we'll look at each of the built-in
workflows for taking multiple images from

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.850
Lightroom to Photoshop.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.050
Then we'll walk through other common scenarios
in which it makes sense to use the two programs

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.070
in an integrated manner, from compositing
to touching to making local corrections and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.070
more.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.260
This is really my favorite part of the course
because it's full of practical applications

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.070
of what we've covered so far.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.160
Let's start with one of the options in Lightroom's
Edit In menu for working with multiple photos,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.199
the Merge to Panorama in Photoshop option.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.629
When there is the scene there you want to
photograph that's too wide or too tall for

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.030
your lens to capture in a single photo, try
taking multiple shots that overlap a little

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.299
and then let Photoshop merge them into a seamless
panorama.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.450
When you shoot for this scenario you don't
really need a tripod, although it can't hurt,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.189
just set your exposure and focus on manual
and keep them the same as you shoot all the

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.189
photos.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.480
Here, I have four photos of a bridge in Paris
that I shot that way.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.500
I'll start with them here in Lightroom, and
if I wanted to make a change to any of these

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.320
photos, I would want to be sure to synchronize
that change to all of them, and not to make

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.460
individual changes to individual photos because
we want them all to match when they're put

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.460
together.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.899
So for example, if I click on this photo and
take it to the Develop module, I see that

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.860
the highlights are little blown out.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.570
So here in the basic panel, I might drag the
Highlights slider over to the left.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.179
And then with that photo selected in the film
strip, I'll hold the Shift key and click on

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.310
the first of the other photos.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.170
The one to which I made the change has a wider
frame than the others.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.329
That means it's the most selected and that
its settings will be synchronized to the others.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.579
So with that all set up, I'll click the Sync
button and I'll click Synchronize with all

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.900
of these check boxes checked, and that applies
the Highlights correction to each of the photos,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.900
as you can see.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.810
If I click on, it each has the same highlights
correction.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.209
So now, what I would like to do is merge the
four images into one wide panorama.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.420
With all four selected, I'll go to the Photo
menu, I'll choose Edit In, and I'll go down

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.250
to the third section here, and I'll choose
Merge to Panorama in Photoshop.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.410
That opens Photoshop's Photomerge dialog box,
with the four files that I selected listed

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.740
here as the source files.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.550
All I have to do here is choose the Layout
method that I want Photoshop to use to fit

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.250
these images together.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.300
In many cases Auto does a good job, but note
the best choice here really varies from example

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.340
to example, and so I urge you to take the
time to test them all out.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.780
I am always surprised when I think, Auto is
great, and then I test some others and I find

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.410
that I like the results better.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.010
For example, here I found that the Cylindrical
method worked best with these images, and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.260
I think that's because there is a long horizontal
element, the bridge, that I wanted to have

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.430
straight, and that's where the cylindrical
method really shines.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.070
So I am going to go with that one.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.900
Here, I'll leave Blend Images Together checked.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.760
That causes Photoshop to add a series of layer
masks to each layer that it's going to create

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.450
in this panorama.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.320
And it uses those layer masks to blend the
images together, much like the Auto Blend

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.730
command in Photoshop's edit menu.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.930
Now if I shot with a wide angle lens, the
lens can sometimes cause vignetting at the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.130
edge of the individual photos and/or lens
related image distortion.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.910
And if that were the case, I would check Vignette
Removal and Geometric Distortion Correction,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.910
too.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.870
But I didn't shoot these photos with a wide
angle lens, so I'll leave those unchecked,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.980
and I'll just click OK.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.680
Photoshop opens all four of the images into
a single file and automatically aligns their

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.040
content so they fit together.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.310
And then it blends the images together, based
on their content, and it creates layer masks

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.100
on each of the layers in the single file.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.060
And there's the result, a panoramic image
of all four of my photos seamlessly blended

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.060
together.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.280
And you can see over in the layers panel how
Photoshop did that, putting each photo on

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.460
a separate layer and adding layer masks for
blending.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.280
On the screen this image may not look all
that impressive, but keep in mind that in

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.639
order to display the entire image, Photoshop
has had to zoom it way out, so it's less than

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.020
10% right now.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.710
And if I look down here at the information
area at the bottom of the document window,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.389
you can see that if I were print this at 240
pixels per inch, it would print at around

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.419
40x12 inches.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.710
So it really is a large file and will make
really impressive print.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.210
Now as a result of fitting the pieces together,
Photoshop left some transparent pixels around

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.860
some of the edges, and that's to be expected.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.180
One way to take care of that is to simply
crop them away.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.750
That can be done here in Photoshop or after
I save the image and go back to Lightroom.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.300
I am going to do it in Lightroom so that if
I change my mind about the crop, which will

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.669
be nondestructive, I'd have one last step
to change it.

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.900
If I did it here in Photoshop, I'd have to
reopen the image in Photoshop using the Edit

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.830
Original option in Lightroom's Edit Photo
dialog.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.370
Since I started with raw files, the document
tab still says DNG, the raw format, although

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.520
Photoshop really is working with the images
in a pixel-based format.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.949
But when I save, Cmd+S on the Mac, Ctrl+S
on the PC, I can see that this really is a

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.020
TIFF file, with a format, and a name, and
photo properties that I chose in Lightroom's

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.110
external editing preferences earlier in the
course.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.819
I'll close the panel in Photoshop and I'll
go back to Lightroom.

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:55.550
Here in the film strip, you can see my original
four raw images, followed by the TIFF that

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.159
I just saved from Photoshop, and here it is
in the document window.

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:03.240
I am going to go over to the tool bar underneath
the histogram in the Develop module, or I

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.560
could just press R on my keyboard to activate
the Crop tool in Lightroom.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.410
And then I'll just click and drag these borders
to just the inside of the image.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:19.990
And I have to be careful that I don't leave
any white pixels on any of the sides here.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.029
And then I'll click Done.

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.029
Now that is an nondestructive crop, so if
I wanted to change it, I could just click

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:30.400
again on the Crop tool and the pixels are
there and I could change the crop, but I am

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.300
going to leave it as it is.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.110
In most cases that's all there is to the process
of making a panorama starting in Lightroom

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.759
and jumping to Photoshop using the Edit In
panorama command.

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.249
But of course you can take this image back
into Photoshop if you have something more

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:45.909
that you want to do to it there.

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:49.610
For example, if you thought that something
in the image still looked a bit distorted,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.289
you might want to take the image back to Photoshop
to apply the adaptive wide angle filter to

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.710
try to straighten out a distortion that may
have resulted from the merge.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.840
If you do that, since you are starting with
a TIFF file, Lightroom's Photo Edit window

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.479
will open and be sure to choose Edit a Copy
with Lightroom Adjustments there.

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:08.669
But I'm happy with this images as it is.

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.809
This Lightroom to Photoshop workflow produces
a unique, large image that I couldn't have

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:23.919
captured all at once in my camera.
