and obviously these 24 pegs on the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.830 
and obviously these 24 pegs on the
actual<00:01:42.210> weight<00:01:46.880> few<00:01:47.880> lads<00:01:48.150> owned<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.630> car

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
actual weight few lads owned the car

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.600 
actual weight few lads owned the car
part<00:01:51.800> we're<00:01:52.800> not<00:01:52.920> looking<00:01:53.190> at<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.430> we're

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
part we're not looking at them we're

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.190 
part we're not looking at them we're
gonna<00:01:53.730> do<00:01:53.910> this<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> getting<00:01:54.690> wider<00:01:54.930> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
gonna do this this is getting wider as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.680 
gonna do this this is getting wider as
we<00:01:55.320> come<00:01:55.500> over<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:56.130> would<00:01:57.120> say<00:01:57.360> slightly

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
we come over here I would say slightly

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.430 
we come over here I would say slightly
wider<00:01:58.050> not<00:01:58.470> much<00:01:58.680> wider<00:01:59.600> might<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.780> me<00:02:01.020> just

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
wider not much wider might be me just

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.390 
wider not much wider might be me just
the<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.590> I'm<00:02:01.740> looking<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.220> but<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:04.400> one

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
the way I'm looking at it but it's one

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.389 
the way I'm looking at it but it's one
of<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.520> two<00:02:05.700> pegs<00:02:05.970> water<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:07.399> slightly

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
of the two pegs water actually slightly

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.930 
of the two pegs water actually slightly
bigger<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.730> think<00:02:08.760> this<00:02:09.830> about<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.010> metre<00:02:11.460> bigger

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
bigger I think this about a metre bigger

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.970 
bigger I think this about a metre bigger
but<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.660> average<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:13.080> about<00:02:13.790> 40<00:02:14.790> meters

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.640 

coming<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.250> 12

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
coming up to 12

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.340 
coming up to 12
here<00:02:22.650> we<00:02:22.740> go<00:02:22.860> up<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> bill<00:02:23.490> ball<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:25.050> have<00:02:25.170> got

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
here we go up the bill ball you have got

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.980 
here we go up the bill ball you have got
the<00:02:25.440> right<00:02:25.590> I've<00:02:26.280> got<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.490> right<00:02:26.700> one

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.670 

that's<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.170> water<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.800> back

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.800 

this<00:02:36.250> looks<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.580> belt<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.060> won't<00:02:37.239> poke<00:02:37.510> 12

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
this looks a belt and this won't poke 12

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:54.030 
this looks a belt and this won't poke 12
karma<00:02:38.769> pegs

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:06.020 

I<00:02:54.129> says<00:02:54.849> well<00:02:55.090> far

it's<00:03:07.030> basically<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.689> same<00:03:09.420> along<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.629> side

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
it's basically the same along this side

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.970 
it's basically the same along this side
but<00:03:11.170> since<00:03:12.129> I'm<00:03:12.310> doing<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.579> video<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.180> it's
