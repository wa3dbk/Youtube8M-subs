00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
very lightweight the bristles are single

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.279 
very lightweight the bristles are single
strand<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.629> can<00:00:50.629> see<00:00:50.870> that<00:00:51.109> they're

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
strand and you can see that they're

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.110 
strand and you can see that they're
inside<00:00:51.829> here<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.309> gray<00:00:52.550> bristles<00:00:52.999> are

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
inside here the gray bristles are

inside here the gray bristles are
recessed<00:00:54.789> this<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.269> give<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.929> scrub<00:00:57.320> in

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
recessed this is to give a scrub in

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.959 
recessed this is to give a scrub in
action<00:00:59.589> the<00:01:00.589> brushes<00:01:00.949> are<00:01:01.100> available<00:01:01.670> in

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
action the brushes are available in

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.920 
action the brushes are available in
three<00:01:02.600> different<00:01:02.629> sizes<00:01:03.520> this<00:01:04.520> is<00:01:04.760> a<00:01:05.000> 40

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
three different sizes this is a 40

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.930 
three different sizes this is a 40
centimeter<00:01:08.080> we<00:01:09.080> also<00:01:09.200> have<00:01:10.270> 27<00:01:12.790> centimeter

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.670 

and<00:01:16.940> there<00:01:17.420> is<00:01:17.510> also<00:01:19.210> an<00:01:20.210> extra-large<00:01:20.720> 60

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
and there is also an extra-large 60

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.250 
and there is also an extra-large 60
centimeter<00:01:22.720> so<00:01:23.720> those<00:01:23.870> are<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.080> three

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
centimeter so those are the three

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.410 
centimeter so those are the three
different<00:01:24.290> sizes<00:01:24.940> we<00:01:25.940> then<00:01:26.090> add<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> few

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
different sizes we then add a few

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.960 
different sizes we then add a few
different<00:01:27.080> types<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:27.620> brushes<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:28.850> also

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
different types of brushes so we also

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.650 
different types of brushes so we also
have<00:01:29.300> we<00:01:29.480> have<00:01:29.510> radius<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:31.850> can<00:01:32.180> see<00:01:32.390> on

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
have we have radius so you can see on

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.410 
have we have radius so you can see on
here<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.200> has<00:01:33.440> a<00:01:35.050> curved<00:01:36.250> radius<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:37.490> enables

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
here this has a curved radius so enables

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.180 
here this has a curved radius so enables
this<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.810> get<00:01:39.020> down<00:01:39.260> onto<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:41.950> sill<00:01:42.950> of

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
this to get down onto the the sill of

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.660 
this to get down onto the the sill of
the<00:01:43.430> window<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.720> obviously<00:01:45.080> to<00:01:45.350> clean<00:01:45.670> right

down<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.120> bottom<00:01:47.590> but<00:01:48.590> then<00:01:48.710> there<00:01:48.860> is

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
down to the bottom but then there is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.910 
down to the bottom but then there is
also<00:01:49.180> rectangular<00:01:50.180> brushes<00:01:50.570> as<00:01:51.500> you<00:01:51.590> can<00:01:51.740> see

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
also rectangular brushes as you can see

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
also rectangular brushes as you can see
here<00:01:52.160> which<00:01:53.170> are<00:01:54.170> slightly<00:01:54.590> less<00:01:54.980> spying<00:01:55.790> in

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
here which are slightly less spying in

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.120 
here which are slightly less spying in
terms<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:57.610> bristles<00:01:58.610> themselves<00:02:00.130> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
of the recesses for the for the jet also

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.480 
of the recesses for the for the jet also
you're<00:02:57.860> able<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:59.110> have<00:03:00.940> combinations<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:04.160> that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
you're able to have combinations so that

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.640 
you're able to have combinations so that
will<00:03:04.610> be<00:03:04.730> standard<00:03:05.240> each<00:03:05.660> brush<00:03:06.050> comes<00:03:06.380> with

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
will be standard each brush comes with

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.530 
will be standard each brush comes with
with<00:03:07.130> two<00:03:07.720> jets<00:03:09.280> so<00:03:10.280> now<00:03:10.430> you<00:03:10.490> can<00:03:10.730> have<00:03:10.910> atom

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
with two jets so now you can have atom

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.870 
with two jets so now you can have atom
and<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:11.840> can<00:03:12.080> purchase<00:03:12.260> extra<00:03:12.590> jets<00:03:13.070> so<00:03:13.700> these

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
and you can purchase extra jets so these

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.390 
and you can purchase extra jets so these
can<00:03:14.150> then<00:03:14.330> just<00:03:14.570> be<00:03:14.750> positioned<00:03:15.290> anywhere<00:03:15.400> and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
can then just be positioned anywhere and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.420 
can then just be positioned anywhere and
now<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.730> have<00:03:19.810> four<00:03:20.810> jets<00:03:21.110> fitted<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:22.280> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
now you have four jets fitted to this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.080 
now you have four jets fitted to this
brush<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:23.320> then<00:03:24.320> these<00:03:24.470> are<00:03:24.530> easily<00:03:25.190> linked

so<00:04:42.240> here<00:04:42.420> you<00:04:42.570> can<00:04:42.720> see<00:04:42.930> now<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:44.070> brush<00:04:44.220> is

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
so here you can see now the brush is

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.800 
so here you can see now the brush is
rotated<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:46.380> locked<00:04:46.560> in<00:04:46.770> position<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.810> now

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
rotated and a locked in position and now

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.500 
rotated and a locked in position and now
you<00:04:48.870> can<00:04:49.200> clean<00:04:49.470> using<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> brush<00:04:50.370> vertically
