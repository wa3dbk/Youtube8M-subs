 feeding the leg 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.360
 that is, according to the theory of 75 percent 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.699
 vegetable food 25 percent beef

 here is the ground in the aquarium with such fish 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.570
 must be a fraction size 35 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.390
 millimeters because the larger ones are well 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.570
 or cobblestones already quite that is a fraction 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.520
 there is 15-30 year and the average fraction between 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.810
 five millimeters and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.790
 15 and depending on the size of the fish 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 here they can choke that is very 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.770
