00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.499 
velociraptors all around him I think
that<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.290> awesome<00:01:46.850> being<00:01:47.850> able<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.329> like

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that would be awesome being able to like

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.530 
that would be awesome being able to like
control<00:01:49.049> Owen<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> shoot<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.369> machine<00:01:51.299> gun

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
control Owen and shoot your machine gun

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.929 
control Owen and shoot your machine gun
not<00:01:51.780> your<00:01:51.960> Michigan<00:01:52.380> your<00:01:52.979> automatic<00:01:53.310> rifle

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
not your Michigan your automatic rifle

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.350 
not your Michigan your automatic rifle
and<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.680> be<00:01:56.399> able<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> control<00:01:57.149> your

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
and or and be able to control your

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.090 
and or and be able to control your
Raptors<00:01:57.840> at<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> same<00:01:58.259> time<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.530> think<00:01:58.920> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
Raptors at the same time I think that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
Raptors at the same time I think that
would<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.640> awesome<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.360> think<00:02:01.110> there's<00:02:01.259> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
would just be awesome I think there's a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.490 
would just be awesome I think there's a
whole<00:02:01.710> lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> potential<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.909> game<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.500> I

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
whole lot of potential for a game and I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.050 
whole lot of potential for a game and I
am<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:04.979> looking<00:02:05.100> forward<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> would

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
am really looking forward to one I would

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.180 
am really looking forward to one I would
love<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:07.110> both<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.619> would<00:02:07.770> love<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.039> see

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
love to have both I would love to see

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.320 
love to have both I would love to see
the<00:02:08.340> lego<00:02:08.459> game<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the lego game and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.370 
the lego game and
see<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.380> more<00:02:10.890> adult<00:02:11.430> game<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:12.210> really<00:02:12.960> want<00:02:13.200> them

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
see a more adult game I really want them

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
see a more adult game I really want them
to<00:02:13.560> put<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.860> whole<00:02:14.130> lot<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> work<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.880> this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
to put a whole lot of work into this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.890 
to put a whole lot of work into this
game<00:02:15.420> because<00:02:16.910> oftentimes<00:02:17.910> movie<00:02:18.660> based

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
game because oftentimes movie based

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.560 
game because oftentimes movie based
games<00:02:19.230> don't<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.250> they're<00:02:21.150> not<00:02:21.180> really

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
games don't really they're not really

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.210 
games don't really they're not really
great<00:02:21.930> people<00:02:22.170> don't<00:02:22.440> really<00:02:22.650> put<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.010> much

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
great people don't really put that much

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.280 
great people don't really put that much
time<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.670> effort<00:02:23.760> into<00:02:24.090> him<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.960> know<00:02:25.020> it's

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
time and effort into him and I know it's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.740 
time and effort into him and I know it's
likely<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.250> time<00:02:26.610> if<00:02:27.000> they<00:02:27.390> release<00:02:27.600> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
likely that this time if they release a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.680 
likely that this time if they release a
of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.860> more<00:02:29.070> adult<00:02:29.310> version<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.850> game<00:02:30.030> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
of the more adult version of a game that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.690 
of the more adult version of a game that
it<00:02:30.840> wouldn't<00:02:31.050> be<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.260> best<00:02:31.290> quality<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.400> that

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
it wouldn't be the best quality and that

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.000 
it wouldn't be the best quality and that
maybe<00:02:33.150> people<00:02:33.900> wouldn't<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.350> worked<00:02:34.590> as

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
maybe people wouldn't have worked as

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
maybe people wouldn't have worked as
hard<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> because<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.880> know<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.210> lego<00:02:36.420> games

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
hard on it because I know the lego games

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.560 
hard on it because I know the lego games
are<00:02:37.010> genuinely<00:02:38.330> generally<00:02:39.330> pretty

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
are genuinely generally pretty

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.110 
are genuinely generally pretty
consistent<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.320> pretty<00:02:40.530> good<00:02:40.710> but<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.610> really

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
consistent and pretty good but I really

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.390 
consistent and pretty good but I really
hope<00:02:42.600> that<00:02:42.900> if<00:02:43.140> they<00:02:43.350> make<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.590> more<00:02:43.920> adult<00:02:44.130> game

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
hope that if they make a more adult game

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.640 
hope that if they make a more adult game
which<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.730> what<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.910> want<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.470> be

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
which is what I want is for it to be

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.420 
which is what I want is for it to be
more<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:48.600> be<00:02:48.720> high<00:02:48.930> budget<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.010> look<00:02:50.190> great

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
more to be high budget and to look great

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.330 
more to be high budget and to look great
and<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.790> would<00:02:50.940> love<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.300> see<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.690> next-gen<00:02:52.340> so
