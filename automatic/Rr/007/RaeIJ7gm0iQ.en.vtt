00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.990
 there are such friends of youtube in this 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.690
 version bringing a very special boxing 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.790
 and that possibly the special of the 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.510
 six thousand subscribers is the review of 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.750
 this computer already together with my zero 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.780
 I will show you well how I go 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.890
 giving working these days but first 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'm going to show you the computer that 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:44.129
 buy good carmen more than anything brings a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.220
 amd fx 6.300 black edition processor already 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:53.510
 come be blocked 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:58.070
 1 GB as you can see USB 3.0 the double 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:02.960
 compatible with people to md fx4 and 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.960
 graphic cards ati ram 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:12.650
 a 2 gb gddr5 radio graphics card 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.560
 r 7 250 to be able to perform faster and 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.910
 be able to run some games and obviously 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.090
 a special cabinet the cabinet the 430 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.370
 black this was not the one that has flown 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.030
 originally me and one cheaper but 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.100
 by purchasing everything I did and everything 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.140
 that adds to the end they gave it to me 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 so I think it was better 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.380
 let's go to proceed to open it for 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.830
 that you can see what the 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.830
 cabinet 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.610
 here 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.590
 but 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590
 can you draw it just when I record 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.610
 cicchitto 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.450
 yes 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.720
 two 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.500
 to 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.070
 we can 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.070
 per share 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.790
 we have here 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:48.140
 here it only brings the characteristics of 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.140
 warranty cabinet 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.940
 suppose a little more the cabinet 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.599
 in front brings a fan with light 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.599
 led this is pretty much the interior 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.970
 and seven slots to increase the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.970
 ability of the mind 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.569
 like this 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.170
 Amen 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.200
 maybe we can appreciate very 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.260
 all right 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.849
 but this part of here 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.780
 here from the center now where it usually goes down 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:50.160
 a little the camera 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.340
 so they can better see the cabinet in 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.340
 yes 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.939
 here brings the motherboard gb 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.500
 an unt hard drive was a source of 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:08.500
 power of kim 50 watts 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:17.090
 on the fan the video card the 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.090
 r cited 250 gbdrd5 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.380
 on the opposite 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.980
 I the way 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.740
 to do with him 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.740
 the disc tray a reader 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.040
 multi-card I occupy it much more than 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.170
 nothing for the videos because I all 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.529
 videos he saved them in a sd that is the 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.139
 the camera and then I needed it 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.909
 here is the other fan this is the 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.670
 that lights blue is going to be game 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.160
 with water 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.440
 is going to be game with obviously with the 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.130
 keyboard and with the mouse since both 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.130
 turn on blue 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.629
 in the part of above although it is not 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.750
 Concentrate other spaces for 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.030
 fans here soon we can 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.240
 to show 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.830
 here between the two spaces for 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.840
 fans and soon here later 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.840
 put in a cooling system 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.500
 liquid 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.990
 To avoid this capable of anything 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:24.080
 here is the back of the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:26.870
 computer we have usb vga hdmi ports 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.610
 and 2 USB 3.0 ports that I'm going to 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.530
 put to change the graphics card 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.580
 the microphone connector for 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.099
 hearing aids so that is more ports dvi 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.040
 which are the vga graphics card 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.670
 and here is here 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.380
 below the port for the current 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.930
 that by the way the cable does not macro where 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.910
 I left it 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.370
 but when the lit they will see 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.100
 working everything I really liked this 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.509
 cabinet since in that part he manufactured 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.979
 then we can see all the parts 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:05.419
 of pspv in tve backlit when 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:09.080
 when you turn it on it looks pretty good 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:12.080
 8 gb of ram memory I forgot a thousand 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.610
 333 megahertz I was not encouraged by the 1600 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.449
 for the moment because he did not want to invest 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:23.900
 it cost me about 8 thousand 475 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.729
 does not appear already with all the pieces if 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.270
 they are interested I leave the link in the 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:32.780
 description of the original computer and 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.950
 I add certain things but the 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.980
 Original worth about 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.110
 seven thousand pesos it seems to me six thousand 800 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.940
 performances but how do I comment? 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:44.280
 I added certain things to 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.560
 I did not have to modify in a rock 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.030
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.340
 if so subscribe a little hand up 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.380
 share with friends and expect more lives 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.200
 in the channel I'm going to go up more 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.289
 comment that I have the computer well 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.889
 see you in a proximity 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.889
 bye
