00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.590
 Full checkmate chess and reiki 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.990
 towers 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.120
 we will see a checkmate pattern that requires 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.810
 that both the king and the tower work 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.670
 together 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.400
 so it's not so easy without it 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.439
 let's fully understand the pattern 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.010
 in this pattern the king blocks the king 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.200
 opponent while the sheik tower 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.960
 this blockage is known as opposition 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.630
 opposition occurs when kings 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.740
 face to face and no one wants to be 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.349
 the first to play 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.649
 the opposition is a form of zombie 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.679
 forced move the checkmate of tower 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.969
 and is the only basic checkmate pattern that 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:45.010
 requires southern aid in the year 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.499
 note the opposition between the kings when the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.389
 whites reach this opposition to 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.609
 should check with the tower 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.469
 to force the black river to the edge of the 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.449
 board 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.229
 note that the black king is obliged to go 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:03.459
 towards the 8th line because the houses of 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:06.059
 three and three and f3 are controlled by 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.059
 White River 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.130
 the next white step is also 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:14.409
 how they should move forward 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.420
 obviously put the white tower in the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.149
 fifth line is a waste of time 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.820
 because the black king can come back 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.500
 therefore white should bring the river 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.520
 white to the third row 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.329
 but to which house this movement is the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640
 key 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.969
 And you must be wondering why not? 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.820
 king f3 white do not want the opposition 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.859
 yes the white people want the opposition but the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.700
 need the movement to be 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.630
 her 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.020
 as soon as the opposition happens the black 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.539
 obviously should avoid king and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.689
 5 would allow the check tower with the 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.429
 movement to 5 this position emphasizes that 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.880
 online games is necessary so that the 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:01.990
 white disease 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.890
 White continues to persecute and the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.780
 continue to flee opposition 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.560
 finally using the fact that there is no 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.190
 no column and white held the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.830
 King 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.420
 it should move to the 6th line 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.230
 contrary as white 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:25.380
 play tower 5 or black king must go 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.380
 for g5 and the opposition to white 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.480
 now white forces black river to go 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.940
 toward the edge of the tray with this 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.220
 movement forces the white to 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.930
 repeat the pattern again but 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.880
 really there's nothing like the black ones 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.880
 can do to avoid their defeat. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.120
 this movement with the tower is necessary 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.200
 when she was threatened by the king now 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.410
 be careful 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.510
 whites can not go to ce 4 and not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.240
 they will lose all the work of chasing 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.240
 the black river if the white is to be 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.010
 four king intends to run for 16 and 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.690
 whites will have to chase after 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.960
 back to the other side 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.480
 this position requires what is known 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.680
 as the waiting movement to place the 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.590
 black king in zombies the year if the black king 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.740
 move to 16 black of a check 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.960
 and force black river there towards the 8th 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.730
 line 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.730
 instead he runs 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.360
 this process will repeat itself until the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.769
 black king is on the 8th line with no 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.030
 place to run 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.030
 so it's going to be a checkmate 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.379
 obviously king b7 would make the lives of 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.370
 easier but the black ones did 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.370
 your best defense 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.730
 now what white should do the same 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.220
 they should make a wait move 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.220
 because if the blacks play in 17 the white ones 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.040
 give a check in b 7 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.040
 obviously the black ones run one more time 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.560
 now the black king is going to do his last 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.560
 run to the other side of the board 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:58.520
 the tower moved to the other side to 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.520
 keep your safety 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.470
 and checkmate
