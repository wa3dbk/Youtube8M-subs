straight<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.610> varial<00:01:09.180> flip<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.830> was

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
straight into the varial flip I was

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.850 
straight into the varial flip I was
really<00:01:11.100> confused<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:13.200> first<00:01:13.650> you're

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
really confused because you first you're

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
really confused because you first you're
skating<00:01:14.100> left<00:01:14.400> foot<00:01:14.580> forward<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.150> then

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
skating left foot forward and then

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.820 
skating left foot forward and then
you're<00:01:15.390> skating<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.900> foot<00:01:16.140> forward<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
you're skating right foot forward and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.330 
you're skating right foot forward and
then<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:18.479> almost<00:01:18.900> landing<00:01:19.590> burial<00:01:20.009> flips

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
then you're almost landing burial flips

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.490 
then you're almost landing burial flips
but<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> didn't<00:01:21.240> even<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> kickflip

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.990 

sometimes<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.710> people<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.700> learning

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
sometimes when people first are learning

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
sometimes when people first are learning
these<00:01:27.119> tricks<00:01:27.450> they<00:01:27.630> get<00:01:27.840> into<00:01:27.960> these<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:29.189> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
these tricks they get into these kind of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
these tricks they get into these kind of
situations<00:01:29.579> where<00:01:31.189> yeah<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:33.150> feel<00:01:33.630> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
situations where yeah you you feel like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.770 
situations where yeah you you feel like
oh<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.530> varial<00:01:34.890> flip<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.250> easier<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.570> true

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
oh the varial flip is easier and if true

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.929 
oh the varial flip is easier and if true
and<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.170> might<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.590> true<00:01:37.890> because<00:01:38.250> your<00:01:38.759> back

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and that might be true because your back

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.760 
and that might be true because your back
foot<00:01:39.270> gets<00:01:39.540> used<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.900> doing<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.259> shove<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
foot gets used to doing that shove it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.219 
foot gets used to doing that shove it
but<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.310> still<00:01:41.670> want<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> master<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
but I still want you to master the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.649 
but I still want you to master the
kickflip<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:44.939> important<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.509> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
kickflip it's very important that you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.630 
kickflip it's very important that you
master<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> kickflip<00:01:46.649> before<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.460> into

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
master the kickflip before you get into

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.510 
master the kickflip before you get into
varial<00:01:48.210> flips<00:01:48.509> because<00:01:49.140> obviously<00:01:49.520> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
varial flips because obviously the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.460 
varial flips because obviously the
varial<00:01:50.939> flip<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> pop<00:01:51.630> shuvit<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
varial flip is a pop shuvit and the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.670 
varial flip is a pop shuvit and the
kickflip<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.170> kickflips

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
kickflip so you have to have kickflips

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.899 
kickflip so you have to have kickflips
really<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.340> order<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> put<00:01:56.790> those

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
really down in order to put those

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.510 
really down in order to put those
together<00:01:57.469> so<00:01:58.469> anyways<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.219> being<00:01:59.430> said

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520

you<00:02:12.940> could<00:02:13.120> have<00:02:13.240> landed<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:15.190> let's<00:02:15.340> take<00:02:15.550> this

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you could have landed so let's take this

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.460 
you could have landed so let's take this
frame<00:02:16.000> by<00:02:16.209> frame<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.720> see<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:16.930> we<00:02:16.989> got<00:02:17.200> here

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
frame by frame and see what we got here

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.120 
frame by frame and see what we got here
nice<00:02:18.280> pop<00:02:18.670> with<00:02:18.940> your<00:02:19.090> back<00:02:19.300> foot<00:02:19.800> front<00:02:20.800> foot

nice pop with your back foot front foot
flick<00:02:21.550> looks<00:02:21.880> good<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:23.290> one<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.500> wasn't

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
flick looks good that one just wasn't

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.150 
flick looks good that one just wasn't
rotated<00:02:24.730> enough<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.390> kickflip<00:02:25.900> part<00:02:26.380> so

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
rotated enough on the kickflip part so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.309 
rotated enough on the kickflip part so
if<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.459> would<00:02:27.640> have<00:02:27.760> flicked<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.599> more<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
if you would have flicked it more on the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.110 
if you would have flicked it more on the
kickflip<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:30.250> would<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.730> probably<00:02:30.940> been

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
kickflip you would have probably been

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.229 
kickflip you would have probably been
able<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.540> land<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.930> one<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.260> well<00:02:32.970> cool<00:02:33.970> so

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
able to land that one as well cool so

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.590 
able to land that one as well cool so

I can't kick flip I can 360 flip but I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.780 
I can't kick flip I can 360 flip but I
can't<00:02:47.350> ollie<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:49.650> master<00:02:50.650> every<00:02:51.519> one<00:02:51.670> of

these tricks in the proper order so you

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.039 
these tricks in the proper order so you

kick<00:03:02.290> flips<00:03:02.560> with<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.069> body<00:03:03.370> varial<00:03:03.910> which<00:03:04.600> is

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
kick flips with a body varial which is

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.050 
kick flips with a body varial which is
called<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.290> sex<00:03:05.560> change<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.220> do<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.489> kickflip

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
called a sex change so you do a kickflip

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.500 
called a sex change so you do a kickflip
but<00:03:07.780> your<00:03:07.989> body<00:03:08.440> does<00:03:08.769> a<00:03:08.799> 180<00:03:09.280> because<00:03:10.269> that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
but your body does a 180 because that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.509 
but your body does a 180 because that
was<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.690> like<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.230> comfortable<00:03:11.860> way<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.100> do

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
was just like the comfortable way to do

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.400 
was just like the comfortable way to do
it<00:03:12.700> but<00:03:13.269> then<00:03:13.420> they<00:03:13.540> were<00:03:13.600> never<00:03:13.930> able<00:03:14.230> to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
it but then they were never able to

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.770 
it but then they were never able to
learn<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:15.310> regular<00:03:15.790> kickflips<00:03:16.360> because

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
learn just regular kickflips because

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.949 
learn just regular kickflips because
they<00:03:17.470> learned<00:03:18.100> it<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.400> some<00:03:18.670> like<00:03:18.959> awkward

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
they learned it in some like awkward

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.229 
they learned it in some like awkward
fashion<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:21.280> I<00:03:21.310> don't<00:03:21.519> want<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.910> do<00:03:22.060> that

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
fashion so I don't want you to do that

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.720 
fashion so I don't want you to do that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the proper way and learn each trick as

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.300 
the proper way and learn each trick as
they<00:03:27.160> come<00:03:27.840> cool<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.140> like<00:03:29.739> I<00:03:29.859> said<00:03:29.920> you're

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
they come cool so like I said you're

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.860 
they come cool so like I said you're
very<00:03:30.340> ellipse<00:03:30.850> weren't<00:03:31.120> bad<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.690> were

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
very ellipse weren't bad you were

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.110 
very ellipse weren't bad you were
actually<00:03:32.650> getting<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:33.190> rotation<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.000> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
actually getting the rotation of the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.509 
actually getting the rotation of the
board<00:03:34.390> not<00:03:35.320> only<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.709> rotation<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.370> the

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
board not only the rotation of the

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.310 
board not only the rotation of the
kickflip<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.180> also<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.570> rotation<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.200> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
kickflip but also the rotation of the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.979 
kickflip but also the rotation of the
shove<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.030> so<00:03:40.030> now<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:40.239> piece<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.570> you<00:03:40.780> need

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
shove it so now the piece that you need

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.440 
shove it so now the piece that you need
to<00:03:41.079> work<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.500> is<00:03:41.850> catching<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.000> board<00:03:43.269> with

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
to work on is catching the board with

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.300 
to work on is catching the board with
your<00:03:43.630> front<00:03:43.840> foot<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> board<00:03:45.040> doesn't

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
your front foot so the board doesn't

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.920 
your front foot so the board doesn't
over<00:03:45.880> rotate<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:48.040> here<00:03:48.370> we<00:03:48.459> go<00:03:48.640> your<00:03:49.359> back<00:03:49.600> foot

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
over rotate so here we go your back foot

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.199 
over rotate so here we go your back foot
in<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.230> position<00:03:50.530> like<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.890> just<00:03:51.519> ready<00:03:51.880> to<00:03:52.090> do

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
in a position like this just ready to do

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.699 
in a position like this just ready to do
the<00:03:52.359> shove<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.900> your<00:03:52.989> front<00:03:53.260> foot<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.590> the

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
the shove and your front foot in the

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.180 
the shove and your front foot in the
kickflip<00:03:54.100> position<00:03:54.870> Boop<00:03:55.870> flick<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.799> catch<00:03:57.160> it

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
kickflip position Boop flick it catch it

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.849 
kickflip position Boop flick it catch it
with<00:03:57.430> your<00:03:57.459> front<00:03:57.790> foot<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.180> then<00:03:58.299> land

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
with your front foot and then land

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.979 
with your front foot and then land
easier<00:03:59.859> said<00:03:59.920> than<00:04:00.250> done<00:04:00.489> right<00:04:00.730> so<00:04:01.209> what<00:04:01.870> I'm
