00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
we did is we use some holographic yellow

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
we did is we use some holographic yellow
glitter<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> sugar<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.960> some<00:01:18.960> studio<00:01:19.500> by

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
glitter for the sugar and some studio by

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.910 
glitter for the sugar and some studio by
sculpey<00:01:20.189> clay<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.259> sunny-side<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.290> which<00:01:22.740> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
sculpey clay and sunny-side up which is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.399 
sculpey clay and sunny-side up which is
like<00:01:23.070> an<00:01:23.220> egg<00:01:23.400> yolk<00:01:23.580> color<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.720> create<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
like an egg yolk color to create the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.359 
like an egg yolk color to create the
color<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:28.470> goes<00:01:28.650> under<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> glitter

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
color of the that goes under the glitter

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.499 
color of the that goes under the glitter
because<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.790> glitter<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.180> kind<00:01:30.420> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
because the glitter is kind of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.749 
because the glitter is kind of
see-through<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.040> wouldn't<00:01:32.340> want<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> use

and around little head and little ears

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.100 
and around little head and little ears
so<00:02:18.030> that's<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.950> just<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:21.540> little

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
so that's all this is just the little

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.870 
so that's all this is just the little
round<00:02:22.320> bodies<00:02:22.709> stuck<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.459> little<00:02:23.670> round

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
round bodies stuck to the little round

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.170 
round bodies stuck to the little round
head<00:02:24.000> with<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.990> ears<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.430> did<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
head with the ears and what I did is I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.740 
head with the ears and what I did is I
strung<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.840> onto<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> head<00:02:28.770> pin<00:02:28.970> before<00:02:29.970> baking

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
strung it onto a head pin before baking

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.590 
strung it onto a head pin before baking
because<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:31.890> studio<00:02:32.520> clay<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.180> kind<00:02:33.510> of

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
because this studio clay can be kind of

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.500 
because this studio clay can be kind of
mushy<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.880> especially<00:02:35.880> when<00:02:36.030> you're<00:02:36.150> making<00:02:36.270> a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
mushy so especially when you're making a

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.940 
mushy so especially when you're making a
little<00:02:36.720> sculpture<00:02:37.170> that<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.709> you're

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
little sculpture that you know you're

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.350 
little sculpture that you know you're
going<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> turn<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.640> bead<00:02:38.910> or<00:02:39.090> an<00:02:39.150> earring

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
going to turn into a bead or an earring

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.949 
going to turn into a bead or an earring
either<00:02:40.320> put<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.709> hole<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.330> or<00:02:42.330> thread<00:02:42.810> it

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
either put the hole in it or thread it

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.080 
either put the hole in it or thread it
right<00:02:42.989> on<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.530> pin<00:02:43.770> right<00:02:44.070> before<00:02:44.910> you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
right on to the pin right before you

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
right on to the pin right before you
bake<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.020> don't<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.470> mess

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
bake it so that you don't have to mess

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.699 
bake it so that you don't have to mess
with<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.860> afterwards<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:49.170> baked

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
with it afterwards so then I just baked

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.190 
with it afterwards so then I just baked
