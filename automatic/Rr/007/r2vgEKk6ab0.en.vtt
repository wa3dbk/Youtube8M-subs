00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and then he casts a spell where

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.660 
and then he casts a spell where
everybody<00:00:40.440> gets<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.710> extra<00:00:40.829> movement<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
everybody gets the extra movement and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
everybody gets the extra movement and
then<00:00:41.790> he<00:00:42.030> advances<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.899> cool<00:00:43.079> he's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
then he advances and I'm like cool he's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.680 
then he advances and I'm like cool he's
advancing<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.670> he<00:00:44.760> uses<00:00:45.030> his<00:00:45.180> feet<00:00:45.390> so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
advancing but then he uses his feet so

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
advancing but then he uses his feet so
basically<00:00:45.989> his<00:00:46.170> feet<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.010> his<00:00:47.280> control

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
basically his feet is in his control

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.600 
basically his feet is in his control
area<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.210> hurt<00:00:48.989> anybody<00:00:49.590> damage<00:00:50.010> anybody<00:00:50.489> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
area if I hurt anybody damage anybody in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
area if I hurt anybody damage anybody in
his<00:00:50.730> control<00:00:50.940> area<00:00:51.360> whoever<00:00:51.780> did<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
his control area whoever did the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
his control area whoever did the
damaging<00:00:52.590> takes<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.190> point<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> damage<00:00:53.579> now

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
damaging takes one point of damage now

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.880 
damaging takes one point of damage now
for<00:00:54.629> infantry<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.079> course<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.469> kills<00:00:55.710> them

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
for infantry of course that kills them

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.099 
for infantry of course that kills them
and<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.090> pretty<00:00:57.270> much<00:00:57.360> protects<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:57.989> guy

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and so it pretty much protects this guy

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.369 
and so it pretty much protects this guy
really<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.590> well<00:00:59.210> he<00:01:00.210> advances<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.079> his

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
really really well he advances with his

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.310 
really really well he advances with his
zealots<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:03.000> how<00:01:03.270> much<00:01:03.449> how<00:01:03.930> many<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
zealots to see how much how many of the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230 
zealots to see how much how many of the
doom<00:01:04.530> reverse<00:01:04.799> he<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.070> kill<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.970> reason<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
doom reverse he can kill the reason I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.160 
doom reverse he can kill the reason I
didn't<00:01:06.390> put<00:01:06.510> all<00:01:06.540> my<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:06.810> Murray<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.140> behind

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
didn't put all my do Murray was behind

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
didn't put all my do Murray was behind
the<00:01:07.530> covers<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.040> even<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> blast<00:01:09.090> damage

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the covers because even the blast damage

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
the covers because even the blast damage
is<00:01:09.540> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.869> pretty<00:01:10.229> good<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.530> kill<00:01:10.890> them

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
is going to be pretty good to kill them

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
is going to be pretty good to kill them
and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.390> survive<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.290> they

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and then if they do survive then they

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
and then if they do survive then they
won't<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.830> able<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.280> charge<00:01:14.760> because<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
won't be able to charge because you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.620 
won't be able to charge because you
can't<00:01:15.720> charge<00:01:15.990> over<00:01:16.380> over<00:01:17.220> cover<00:01:17.479> unless<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
can't charge over over cover unless you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.820 
can't charge over over cover unless you
have<00:01:18.720> Pathfinder<00:01:19.200> which<00:01:19.350> these<00:01:19.470> guys<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
have Pathfinder which these guys you

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
have Pathfinder which these guys you
don't<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.880> fires<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> first<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
don't have so fires are the first one

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.999 
don't have so fires are the first one
and<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> second<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> both<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.890> them

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and the second one and the both of them

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
and the second one and the both of them
get<00:01:23.130> direct<00:01:23.400> hits<00:01:23.640> automatically<00:01:24.180> killing

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
get direct hits automatically killing

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.690 
get direct hits automatically killing
them<00:01:24.540> because<00:01:24.689> they<00:01:24.780> have<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> high<00:01:25.140> enough

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700

scatter now that I can't scatter very

does<00:01:40.619> manager<00:01:41.040> scatter<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.400> couple<00:01:41.640> inches<00:01:41.790> and

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
does manager scatter a couple inches and

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
does manager scatter a couple inches and
the<00:01:42.479> blast<00:01:42.750> hits<00:01:43.110> two<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.820> it'll

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the blast hits two of them and so it'll

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.639 
the blast hits two of them and so it'll
be<00:01:45.090> less<00:01:45.299> strength<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.899> does<00:01:46.110> manage<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> kill

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
be less strength but does manage to kill

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
be less strength but does manage to kill
the<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.610> does<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.240> manage<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.630> kill

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the one and then does not manage to kill

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
the one and then does not manage to kill
a<00:01:48.810> second<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.770> still<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.340> far<00:01:50.610> three<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a second one but still so far three of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.600 
a second one but still so far three of
the<00:01:51.240> six<00:01:51.420> guys<00:01:51.630> are<00:01:51.960> dead<00:01:52.170> any<00:01:52.979> fires<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.520> the

the six guys are dead any fires with the

the six guys are dead any fires with the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
because he's just out of range but

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.100 
because he's just out of range but
scatters<00:01:56.850> back<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> hits<00:01:57.360> another<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:57.810> river

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
have a six inch range if you're

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.260 
have a six inch range if you're
wondering<00:02:16.230> why<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.820> doesn't<00:02:17.820> do<00:02:17.880> any<00:02:18.060> damage

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
wondering why and doesn't do any damage

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.700 
wondering why and doesn't do any damage
to<00:02:18.390> Fenris<00:02:18.810> even<00:02:19.020> though<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.170> blast<00:02:19.380> damage

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
to Fenris even though the blast damage

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.530 
to Fenris even though the blast damage
does<00:02:19.890> manage<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.160> hit<00:02:20.340> them<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:21.120> bastions

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
does manage to hit them the bastions

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.290 
does manage to hit them the bastions
then<00:02:21.690> move<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.020> these<00:02:22.230> guys<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:23.000> hard<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> kill

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
then move up these guys are hard to kill

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.790 
then move up these guys are hard to kill
because<00:02:24.540> they<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> rule<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.410> allows

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
because they have a rule that allows

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.230 
because they have a rule that allows
them<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:25.980> spread<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.460> any<00:02:26.610> damage<00:02:26.940> they<00:02:27.060> take

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
them to spread up any damage they take

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.210 
them to spread up any damage they take
or<00:02:27.420> not<00:02:27.480> spread<00:02:28.110> any<00:02:28.350> damage<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.680> take<00:02:28.980> so

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
or not spread any damage to take so

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.560 
or not spread any damage to take so
basically<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> can't<00:02:30.000> kill<00:02:30.210> them<00:02:30.300> until

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
basically you can't kill them until

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.690 
basically you can't kill them until
you've<00:02:30.690> dealt<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.020> lot<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.410> damage<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:32.520> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you've dealt a lot of damage to the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.820 
you've dealt a lot of damage to the
group<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.930> once<00:02:34.230> you've<00:02:34.410> got<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.710> that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
group and then once you've got to that

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.140 
group and then once you've got to that
point<00:02:34.980> they<00:02:35.220> each<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.120> two

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
point they each have like one or two

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.290 
point they each have like one or two
boxes<00:02:36.660> left<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.580> then<00:02:38.580> they<00:02:38.820> get<00:02:38.970> hit<00:02:39.150> by<00:02:39.270> a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
boxes left and then they get hit by a

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.880 
boxes left and then they get hit by a
10-point<00:02:39.840> attack<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.290> they're<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.710> okay

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
10-point attack on they're like okay

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.320 
10-point attack on they're like okay
I'll<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.130> keep<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.370> on<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.610> one<00:02:41.790> guy<00:02:42.000> so

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
I'll just keep it on this one guy so

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.420 
I'll just keep it on this one guy so
it's<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:43.020> hard<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.380> effectively<00:02:44.070> kill<00:02:44.280> him

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
it's really hard to effectively kill him

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.610 
it's really hard to effectively kill him
and<00:02:44.550> then<00:02:45.450> he<00:02:45.540> boosts<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> attack<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.410> fires

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
and then he boosts to attack and fires

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.940 
and then he boosts to attack and fires
at<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.490> juggernaut<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.440> actually<00:02:49.440> mrs.<00:02:49.740> are

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
at the juggernaut and actually mrs. are

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.770 
at the juggernaut and actually mrs. are
sorry<00:02:50.160> he<00:02:50.400> hits<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.940> he<00:02:51.060> boosts<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> damage

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
sorry he hits and he boosts the damage

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.070 
sorry he hits and he boosts the damage
and<00:02:52.250> he<00:02:53.250> does<00:02:53.490> six<00:02:54.240> points<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.600> damage<00:02:54.720> they're

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
and he does six points of damage they're

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.930 
and he does six points of damage they're
going<00:02:55.350> down<00:02:55.530> one<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.920> columns<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.490> a<00:02:56.520> huge

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
going down one of the columns not a huge

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.120 
going down one of the columns not a huge
amount<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.240> damage<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.720> good<00:02:57.960> start<00:02:58.320> then

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
amount of damage but a good start then

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.730 
amount of damage but a good start then
the<00:02:59.430> vessel<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.390> menoth<00:03:00.630> moves<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.260> then

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
the vessel of menoth moves up and then

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.230 
the vessel of menoth moves up and then
Gorman<00:03:02.070> moves<00:03:02.250> over<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> position

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
Gorman moves over to get in a position

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.660 
Gorman moves over to get in a position
and<00:03:03.570> then<00:03:04.560> these<00:03:04.740> guys<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.490> that

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and then these guys have I think that

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.400 
and then these guys have I think that
camera<00:03:06.060> what<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.330> rule<00:03:06.660> is<00:03:06.690> called<00:03:06.900> but

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
camera what the rule is called but

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.740 
camera what the rule is called but
basically<00:03:07.770> if<00:03:07.950> they<00:03:08.010> move<00:03:08.460> then<00:03:09.360> they<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.720> be

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
basically if they move then they can be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.900 
basically if they move then they can be

it and then we're firing something that

it and then we're firing something that

order give them plus two defense and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.590 
order give them plus two defense and
then<00:04:14.040> they<00:04:14.130> do<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.310> combined<00:04:14.820> range<00:04:15.270> attack

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
then they do a combined range attack

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.180 
then they do a combined range attack
against<00:04:16.020> his<00:04:16.200> reckoner<00:04:16.560> only<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.830> few<00:04:17.040> them

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
against his reckoner only a few them

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.260 
against his reckoner only a few them
could<00:04:17.340> get<00:04:17.460> in<00:04:17.580> there<00:04:17.700> but<00:04:17.850> they<00:04:17.910> do<00:04:17.970> manage<00:04:18.150> to

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.270 
could get in there but they do manage to

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:20.720 
could get in there but they do manage to
hit<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:19.500> it's<00:04:19.680> dice<00:04:19.830> even<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.370> eight<00:04:20.549> points

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
hit and it's dice even so eight points

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.540 
hit and it's dice even so eight points
of<00:04:20.940> damage<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.560> middle<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.250> doesn't

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
of damage to the middle so it doesn't

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.250 
of damage to the middle so it doesn't
disable<00:04:23.760> anything<00:04:24.270> unfortunately<00:04:24.840> but<00:04:25.200> I

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
disable anything unfortunately but I

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.390 
disable anything unfortunately but I
don't<00:04:25.440> think<00:04:25.590> any<00:04:25.710> where<00:04:25.919> you<00:04:25.950> hit<00:04:26.160> with<00:04:26.280> eight

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
don't think any where you hit with eight

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.670 
don't think any where you hit with eight
points

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
points

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.200 
points
damage<00:04:26.919> on<00:04:27.039> a<00:04:27.070> heavy<00:04:27.250> Jack<00:04:27.520> disables<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.090> on

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
damage on a heavy Jack disables it on

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.510 
damage on a heavy Jack disables it on
the<00:04:28.300> first<00:04:28.449> try<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.710> officer<00:04:30.190> was<00:04:30.340> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the first try and the officer was the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.890 
the first try and the officer was the
focus<00:04:30.850> of<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.180> he<00:04:31.300> takes<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.660> point<00:04:31.840> of

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
focus of that so he takes the point of

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.029 
focus of that so he takes the point of
damage<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.289> it's<00:04:32.440> kind<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:32.680> nice<00:04:32.770> work

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
damage so it's kind of a nice work

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.340 
damage so it's kind of a nice work
around<00:04:33.340> for<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:33.699> then<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:34.630> rocketeer<00:04:35.080> fires

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
around for that then the rocketeer fires

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.070 
around for that then the rocketeer fires
into<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.949> group<00:04:36.160> right<00:04:36.370> here<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.990> gets<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
into the group right here and gets a

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.980 
into the group right here and gets a

the<00:05:39.639> template<00:05:40.210> basically<00:05:40.419> if<00:05:40.930> they<00:05:41.050> move<00:05:41.380> they

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
the template basically if they move they

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.719
