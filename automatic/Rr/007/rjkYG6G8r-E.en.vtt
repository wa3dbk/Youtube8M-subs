00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.440
 I looked at amazon we ordered 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.990
 Only at the very beginning have you seen mine 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.070
 big box in it 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.590
 By the way, I have the video here 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.090

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.920
 after and I have it there with the phone 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.090
 recorded because everything with me 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.220
 that was already too much 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.080
 because of the bill and he pays homage 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.950
 Let's get out of coach a small bill 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.230
 I have this team from here pet 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.840
 ordered and the mouse will be left 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.890
 I pack in the description and then 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.210
 I'll get right here 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.090
 the boxes or the little bit out 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.190
 shows a little bit I can do you too 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.390
 relatively towards the end of the video I 'll 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.489
 Do not tell all the time what I do 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.170
 make but towards the end of the videos can 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.270
 I already have experience reports to the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.190
 deliver mouse because I already have them in 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.420
 The hand has a few with it 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.800
 played round counterstrike 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.020
 yes and I have a bit already 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.459
 played with it and knows a bit 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.499
 I can give you the first impressions 

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.819
 ever give it 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:09.380
 and here I have a few 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.450
 had problems with the packaging 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.700
 with one with a hand was not quite 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.990
 just i thought i put my cellphone 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.310
 on the ground trying so on the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.229
 tried to make his own but 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.259
 that's not why I have two three 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.719
 cuts in which I make in it that on 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.049
 here for example zakat arab open 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:29.689
 and I open the thing and yes 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.700
 actually a cool packaging like you 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.499
 it from steelseries knows nice open 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.679
 So you can put in from below 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:38.109
 If I look a bit now 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.700
 you'll see more tilts 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:42.939
 since certain exactly there you can go in below 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.939
 look 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.630
 the next cool thing you have to say 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.530
 well, I'll give you that in between 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.780
 me here now a bit 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.210
 I'll give you an unwrap pack 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.550
 a few impressions 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 The mouse is of the material itself 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.530
 high quality you can really nothing against 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.810
 say 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.070
 on the sides where you attack them 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.149
 so thumb and ring finger is that and 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.280
 on the little finger depending on how you are in 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.090
 household are accesses respectively 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.470
 such a church for the area that is 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.810
 very good for the mouse 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.940
 and holds and good grip you have a lot 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.360
 sad where moved I find really cool 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.520
 then she has it on the back 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.770
 I will show this button later 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.110
 rival can be integrated with steel series 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.440
 or press and on the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 steelseries the ad the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.270
 is lit as well as the mausrad it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.310
 also lit one can change color 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.980
 from each color the possibly 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.260
 you want to let her breathe so 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.790
 always so different from a slow tone 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.230
 or through or the colors 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.480
 could change everything on the switch 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.739
 mausrad is a cool series of games so 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.390
 I really like it, I have it 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.940
 straight in it is really cool 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.280
 the cable high I will not be too fat 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.110
 so it is easy to move well 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.580
 very boring have my pc in it 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.580
 and there is the whole table i have 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.230
 two meters table so two girls now 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.860
 not long but it has already sounded 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.400
 and here you can also see the handles on the left 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.110
 left this grip really cool 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.720
 is also very good country thinks so too 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.580
 a big thing what everyone needs 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.299
 or what we need mausrad I leave 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.180
 also very 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.920
 It can be turned very easily here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.720
 you can see the rippled on the lying surface 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:35.780
 is an optical mouse and ridiculous 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.530
 off that you hold me see there looks 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.730
 One of this listing that is lit. 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.750
 I also have three photos at the end 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.620
 tuned that you can see it 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.600
 and then that shows everything to the side 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.180
 you guys here briefly this 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.980
 this sticker i'll say stickers 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.170
 that does not know how to do that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.200
 but with a trick trick 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.340
 to express against us 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.710
 you click behind instead of this wise 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.690
 Can you make the design as you do 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.100
 that would be great even for some 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.780
 from nlp for example also seen that 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.650
 the back there for flyers or something 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.310
 have to stand on it 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.950
 there you can see my pants jim is too 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.910
 not bad and i do not have it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.910
 noted in the video 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.760
 then we go directly over again 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.670
 the box and get us this 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.310
 mouse pad out the mouse pad is also in the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.570
 description is a significant link 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.160
 bigger tomorrow , everything is thought 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:37.310
 would that it was also really 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.080
 cool surface works too 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.720
 really good with the mouse so that works 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.820
 Hot on it is just awesome 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.290
 So that's really fluent on it 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.340
 because who calls me now on the book 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.560
 fight a little courage 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.550
 that means I can follow you after this 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.270
