00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
heart attack um and then the oil just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.080 
heart attack um and then the oil just
comes<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> side<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> tractor<00:00:56.940> right

here bottom of the engine that's what my

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.900 
here bottom of the engine that's what my
plug<00:01:00.000> goes<00:01:00.379> no<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> just<00:01:01.739> run<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> into<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> bucket

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
plug goes no I just run it into a bucket

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
plug goes no I just run it into a bucket
and<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.830> reservoir<00:01:04.830> tank<00:01:05.220> with

and then I have a reservoir tank with
all<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:06.510> waste<00:01:06.659> oil<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.530> have<00:01:08.810> we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
all our waste oil in it that we have we

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.710 
all our waste oil in it that we have we
use<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> lot<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> our<00:01:10.710> waste<00:01:10.920> oil<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.460> oil<00:01:11.880> things

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
use a lot of our waste oil to oil things

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.929 
use a lot of our waste oil to oil things
keep<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.000> I'll<00:01:18.600> let<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.990> run<00:01:19.259> out

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
keep it and then I'll let this run out

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.370 
keep it and then I'll let this run out
and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.090> I'll<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.330> put<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> oil<00:01:21.780> filter<00:01:22.080> on

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and then I'll go put the oil filter on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.340 
and then I'll go put the oil filter on
the<00:01:22.799> oil<00:01:23.100> filter<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> other<00:01:24.900> side<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the oil filter so the other side of the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
the oil filter so the other side of the
tractor<00:01:26.180> there's<00:01:27.180> no<00:01:27.299> plug<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.869> side<00:01:28.049> too

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
tractor there's no plug on this side too

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
tractor there's no plug on this side too
but<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.710> couldn't<00:01:29.130> he<00:01:29.520> man<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.880> open<00:01:30.210> anymore<00:01:31.790> so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
but I couldn't he man it open anymore so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
but I couldn't he man it open anymore so
the<00:01:33.000> other<00:01:33.150> side<00:01:33.329> was<00:01:33.479> easier<00:01:33.720> just<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
the other side was easier just to do and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740 
the other side was easier just to do and
the<00:01:34.950> tires<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.310> turn<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.640> way<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.720> oil

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the tires to turn that way the oil

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.590 
the tires to turn that way the oil
filters<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.380> there<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> tractor<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
filters right there on the tractor and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.330 
filters right there on the tractor and
the<00:01:39.600> last<00:01:39.780> time<00:01:39.990> we<00:01:40.110> changed<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.100> 8th

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
