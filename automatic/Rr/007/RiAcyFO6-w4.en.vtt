00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.750
 Hello dear friends today we are 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.360
 see live gameplay 3 blitzkrieg 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.840
 try to break through the enemy defenses 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:26.420
 seize warehouses and enemy base 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.220
 our troops appeared on the map to the bottom 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.310
 part of the screen is almost centered we 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.390
 located to our left a passage to the base 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.890
 that's actually the enemy base itself 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.930
 top right is the second pass and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.930
 control on . with warehouses that us 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.370
 You need to capture the direction of travel 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.390
 there we go let's assign 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.339
 hotkey heavy tank so 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.440
 send scout with the support of 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.300
 heavy tanks 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.989
 I will assign hot keys 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.440
 medium tank and also divide them about 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.440
 such 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.560
 so our scout arrived let's 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.150
 let's see what he sees on his own 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.870
 saying the structure here these are displayed 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.420
 us on the map 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.340
 here we have extra for the little third 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.600
 this is a heavy tank hiding here 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.540
 let's modify it 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:22.570
 this apt-85 is quite a dangerous car 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.450
 let's call the grenade throwers I probably don't 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.910
 a better idea of the tank has guns Aksyuta 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.869
 don't move in scout she richu gone 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:35.410
 appointed let's act differently show 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.310
 such an easy goal for him to ambush him 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.310
 heavy tanks 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.759
 I think to meet three heavy tanks he 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.759
 did not expect here 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.039
 let's call for increased power medium tanks 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.880
 our tank crews deal with it 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.400
 88mm guns fit 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.930
 medium tanks 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.720
 as a scout we send further here 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 minefields - discovered go 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.610
 let's see what else can be seen here squad 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.580
 enemy infantry is approaching us 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.350
 let's not we tempt fate 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.890
 better hide behind the backs of our brothers 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.890
 bigger 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.540
 so understood tank crews with enemy 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.069
 infantry scout continues his 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.700
 sly intelligence department should be paid 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.700
 Special attention 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.920
 We opened the firing point of opponents 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.900
 boar self-propelled gun 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.000
 not the best gift option for ours 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.650
 infantry want a tank might cause 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.069
 a lot of running from where are you going 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.670
 shoulders 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.890
 our covers here so we need not forget 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.069
 mine this minefield later 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.790
 artillery strike let's squeeze it 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.280
 from the flank 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.080
 the tower she has no spin she can't 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.950
 therefore it is easy prey for 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.959
 us so this is what else is about popped up 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.019
 similar self-propelled for crude very 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.340
 unexpected surprise 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.930
 good she has no machine gun when the ball 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.540
 correct member but get here 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.230
 our tanks would be all very sad 2 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.370
 self-propelled 1 ambush so drove on 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.340
 into intelligence 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.580
 here it begins the defense of the enemy from 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.090
 flew our scout for honey and 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.850
 we were thrown here two pieces of mortars 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.940
 anti-tank gun 2 dota mine 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.100
 barrage field a lot of artillery 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.739
 will have to spend points in support for 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.540
 destruction from this node plus narrow 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.060
 bridge passage for heavy tanks 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.170
 shelling artillery from the side no friends 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.180
 no, this is not an option 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.640
 let's change the direction of the main 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.370
 strike all the troops translate to the bottom 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.200
 part let's go down because it 's 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.800
 we will have a fortified area 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.500
 so what happens there with us 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.420
 expense of our 8 different hit a mine here 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.030
 forgot to clear mine vlan 100 and here 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
 I'll take care of you 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.810
 we forgot to clear the minefield and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.360
 distinguish your arrows 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.310
 guided on reconnaissance medium tank I 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.380
 chose three rubles because she is not so sorry 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.930
 lose four still heavier 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.310
 guns at me stronger 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.209
 here's a minefield we discovered let's 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.150
 we shall clear it with mortar shelling 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.140
 begin to resort and over our support 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.580
 Well done mortar very well 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.800
 we put everything from the first time 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.460
 cleared 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.409
 how heavy cars need to bring closer 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.089
 radius of view of our tank 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.849
 much smaller than armored personnel carriers 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:40.629
 so we move very carefully need 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.459
 probe for hide enemy defenses so 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:46.389
 Here found on anti-tankists accurate 

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:48.249
 We are moving beyond the region to Bochin so 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.989
 enemy infantry appeared another 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:53.349
 counter there is not all depart from here 

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:55.539
 watched oh-oh-she covers it 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:58.349
 guys this is not anti-tank 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.239
 artillery was there is a howitzer 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.249
 this is very bad the enemy is very serious to us 

00:05:01.239 --> 00:05:05.589
 need to smuggle troops let's 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.959
 destroy the anti that someone 

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:11.379
 place shoots on here let's call 

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:14.110
 the whole machine Well you need to resort to 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:16.959
 the help of the assault force to establish a place 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.689
 where is the enemy artillery us 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:21.699
 need to sabotage the base of 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:25.499
 what to attack not suppressed artillery 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.360
 we can not this very serious weapon 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.219
 so here she is beautiful she appeared 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.139
 quickly paratroopers penetrate the base 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:35.559
 We look at all that can be tanks and 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.360
 mortars on us shoot so die 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:39.369
 our paratroopers but their goal 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.579
 completed artillery installation 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:43.779
 discovered let's destroy it 

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:44.490
 meanwhile, the tanks crossed over to 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.409
 other shore 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.149
 we made all the preparations for 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.389
 assault enemy base intelligence 

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:57.089
 clearance suppression guns all 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.089
 ready for the final fight 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.139
 and immediately we meet resistance 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.840
 here's the enemy rooted thousands 4 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.979
 an unpleasant surprise 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.960
 come across medium tanks let's 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:10.589
 ask for a heavy tank about the powerful that he 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.610
 I attacked from the flank to disassemble it 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:16.139
 heavy tank 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.509
 medium tanks go on the attack meanwhile 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.950
 at the top we have a very difficult situation 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.390
 stumble on tough enemy defenses 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.910
 smoking creep tea let's help 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.960
 artillery destroy the ruble 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.860
 here so medium tanks recede 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.570
 its quite heavy 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.220
 critical position is more convenient 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.290
 how to destroy pass another volley 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.250
 artillery on it will not carry bleed 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.660
 adversary of practice structures 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.430
 heavy so heavy tanks we have 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.310
 suffered defeat above all 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.680
 destroyed too the system turned out to be 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.460
 enemy defense here it is 2 howitzer 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.120
 quickly destroy 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.949
 here still getting cashback turned out to be 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.660
 3 dove somewhere hit the top guys 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:03.000
 it's all very sad to go away 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:06.840
 the remaining three tanks two already 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.610
 actually prepared the enemy yes not 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.300
 we were expecting so much about resistance moving back 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.220
 backwards 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.240
 a and gets us howitzer call 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.979
 artillery what is a cop tank well 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.930
 artillery can not penetrate very 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:22.470
 strongly fortified it let's open 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.210
 destroy it so still self-propelled to us 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.550
 approaching here is good us soils 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:32.430
 checks underneath were the last tank 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:35.060
 we have about half a word tone still howitzer projectile 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:38.759
 frontal plate straight 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.860
 Well lit self-propelled going to capture 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.979
 the bases are very tricky turned on rival 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.360
 all artillery is spread over the base 

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:48.330
 do not cover with one blow and artillery 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:52.080
 did around here was 34 to assault 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:54.590
 flashed let's see where is ma da 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.330
 here it is destroyed and and 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:00.170
 spend the last points they are no longer us 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:02.360
 will need our flag rises friends 

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.460
 it is a victory we still managed to break through 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.680
 enemy defenses and capture its base 

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:10.900
 today we watched multiplayer 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.900
 mode 3 blitzkrieg following ours
