 elche as some of these here there is more here 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.930
 I bring you the introduction of a game 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.399
 that really has basically marked the 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.470
 80 percent of everything that came to me 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.200
 accuracy 4 that I downloaded it these 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.880
 guys my friends is war frame wharf in 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.800
 your multiplayer action RPG 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.050
 online that is currently 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.060
 available for pc and playstation 4 and 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.280
 basically this game takes in the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.450
 market enough time is no longer for 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.220
 nothing new but I do not know if it is not 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.990
 recently that takes out an update 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.240
 for request 4 that basically changes 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.949
 quite the user interface of 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.590
 example and how to play it then 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.390
 guys, I bring this to you today because I eat 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.860
 I said in the calm video returns the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.270
 approach my channel was going to be destiny of 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.489
 another game that was mentioned more 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.570
 go ahead and that is this game obviously 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.890
 As I mentioned before, no 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.390
 will stop going up that duty and I'm already 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.860
 waiting for password fer but for 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.160
 now I want my focus on the channel 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.469
 this is the war frame and destiny and 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.910
 Well, believe me, this game is not going to 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.500
 disappoint since first that nothing 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 has nothing to lose but for that I'm going 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.410
 to enter later then guys 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.809
 to explain a little how the game goes 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.489
 in war in front of your character you are a race 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.809
 warrior called you not to which equips 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.399
 let's say that a war armor that 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.959
 is the guard frame you never see yourself 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.770
 as a tea you do not always see you using 

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.929
 some specific 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.399
 of some war frame let's say that 

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.390
 there are several types are in this case that 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.509
 is usually gameplay called 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.429
 excalibur and well this one basically in 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.740
 this game is like a space ninja 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.390
 my best way to define it each type 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.740
 of wharton is like an alien race and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.780
 there are also enemies that are alien 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.310
 and then let's say that as I said a game 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.049
 of action uses various types of weapons 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.729
 actually there are let's say that three 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.590
 categories which are primary weapons 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.250
 that can be submachine guns laser 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.469
 shotguns 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.819
 there are even arcs primary weapons that 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.250
 can give more secondary forgiveness than 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.770
 can this guns be included 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.229
 with there are shurikens weapons like that for that 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.000
 style and third we have body weapons to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.409
 body that go more ninja style or 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.329
 warrior that can be swords 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.970
 knives daggers hammers axes 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.860
 let's say several rare weapons that these 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 in exclusive this game nor gray hairs 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.569
 and samurai guy then I present them 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.770
 this game because I really would like 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.539
 that you who have not played 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 they try it and I also think that it does not have 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.789
 nothing to lose because they guess that war 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.349
 frame that is free like that is play was 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.480
 try I started like in playstation 4 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.690
 You can download it completely for free and 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.130
 one 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.930
 the things that I like the most is that 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.690
 they are always expanding it every month 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.250
 there are always expansions that take 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.990
 fish basically every week precision 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.880
 in precision 4 it's like every month every two 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.220
 months always take expansions that 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.390
 add new warface add enemies 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.340
 new add 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.620
 although they expand the gameplay they take out weapons 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.420
 new take out let's say expansions to the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.420
 game that are always free these 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.410
 updates then one of the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.780
 reasons why I bring you this 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.400
 game now is because it recently makes 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.110
 a couple of days they took out the update 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.670
 14 for playstation 4 that changed 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.710
 completely the user interface in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.790
 this game here taught them how were the 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.770
 user interface let's say that the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.540
 update 13 and earlier inclusive 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.850
 when I started playing this game in 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.230
 he even different from 13 but 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.420
 basically these games was around let's say 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.430
 that in this way of seeing what you had a 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.410
 steral plan you had a menu like this elegy 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.000
 the missions to if I chose no war frame 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.680
 and basically theorization 14 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.420
 they completely changed all this 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.980
 they added a personal ship to which 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.470
 you can access all the functions in 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.970
 the game from your own ship and I do not know 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.800
 guys this is to these updates 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.450
 that they bring every time makes one 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 always follow when this game like them 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.319
 I say what we are playing that came out 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.900
 playstation 4 and these are we're already 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.069
 and it's like nine months I almost never 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.329
 play a game for so long 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.310
 including Carlos Buddy which is the game 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.849
 what else do I buy because it's the one 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.139
 it lasts me this at eight months and I 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.249
 starts to annoy the game like it was 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.489
 in every time he pulls out more updates 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.269
 makes one want to keep playing more 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.000
 so to speak is a little bit more 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.980
 of the game this one of the things that more 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.269
 I like in the variety of gameplay the 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.889
 Character skills changes 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.510
 a lot the way to play each waffen is 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.680
 different then they always have say 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.870
 that your favorite plays in a way 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.430
 different there are different game modes 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.709
 as there is a goal and you have to 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.239
 defend it or there are zones and you have to 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.370
 let's say you capture the and defend the 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.599
 time a domain type game 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.459
 survival that you have to endure the 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.109
 as much time as possible there 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.849
 missions determined that it is to eliminate 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.730
 all the enemies of the mission map 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.049
 of capture etcetera etcetera and all this 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.819
 unfolds the missions in the 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.769
 planets that are unblocking every 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.290
 planet has let's say you start in a 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.879
 planet that is the earth this and in this 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.620
 is fulfilling missions and unlocks 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.570
 another planet planet has more missions 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.799
 and therefore increasingly expanding your plan 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.900
 stellar 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.759
 on each planet he also has a voice and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.840
 defeat every voice is what gets you 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:29.090
 the planes of other war frames and those 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.330
 flat is another thing that I like the most 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.940
 game is the whole thing in this game 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.440
 you can buy it from one with 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.699
 platinum that we say is the currency 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.400
 special this game that is the credit 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.740
 that you buy with real money but I 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.930
 I do not give them everything I get in this game 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.550
 let's say that getting the Christian what 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.259
 it's like it gives more emotion all 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.879
 always get me a plan or I look for the 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.150
 materials on the planets and everything that 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:54.680
 be or the arms are the objects the 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.419
 equipment the war frame all are 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.729
 they build this game and it's one of the 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.810
 mechanics that I like the most and in case 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.610
 it was little besides all these things 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.909
 buildable the game does not fall short 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.469
 in customization all the warfare in your 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.330
 auto characters all weapons 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:09.979
 you can change color you can 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.240
 customize in a certain way you can 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.500
 change the color certain patterns of 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.000
 skins in the war also frames him 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.490
 you can get different helmets for 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.699
 change let's say that its appearance and 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.080
 You can also get this accessories 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:22.669
 and unlock accessories for let's say 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.050
 that change more appearance yet 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.759
 although these are let's say more to 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.610
 more credit is achieved through 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.349
 platinum but the same is a great way to 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.669
 let's say change the appearance and cost 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:34.190
 start more you wow ugly as more you 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.449
 like it and now you see your weapons now boy 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.009
 girlfriend to come and watch them give the war 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.419
 frames and pure them good things because 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.919
 as if the game was perfect already 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.360
 that no game is and has its 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.370
 failures and you can mention so that 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.870
 You know, there are not many of them to say that 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.819
 the town stops being entertaining but 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.949
 anyway I want to mention first that 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.629
 nothing the game is a bit difficult 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.919
 understand at the beginning since in fact it 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.719
 did a survey among the most games 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.210
 difficult to understand I started and this was 

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:57.979
 the second among all and then in the 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.569
 update 14 is made easier for 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.830
 the new players understand the game 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.229
 at the beginning but really that is a 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.819
 little complicated and at the beginning that's what 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.409
 which causes one or another player to leave 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.639
 to play it because it just starts not 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.659
 they understand it but really that once 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.550
 that the garage the book and the great the 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.169
 It hooks you up and it's pretty 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.659
 stopped and you want to continue playing it every 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.370
 time more another thing is that the game by 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:19.460
 be a beta is a real is a beta 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.690
 open for that it's free but good 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.219
 it would be a rare beta because one more beta 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.449
 real I've seen it's been a sale 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.650
 it's a year and a half 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.620
 but the truth proved to be a beta 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.999
 open this you are always going to find one 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.889
 that another ship especially when you add 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.900
 a new update on pc be 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.779
 they always add this always has 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.520
 let's say what mistakes and then add them 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.439
 they fix it pretty fast the truth 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.960
 but you always find one or another bus 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:43.969
 which is annoying and it may be that 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.580
 let's say that the game bothers you in 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.629
 one against the occasion never enough 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.580
 as I tell them to stop being 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.379
 entertaining to deny it but if they 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.849
 I say it's annoying when the 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.259
 amount of let's say small mistakes 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.330
 and small bugs that you are in 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.669
 this game since it is under development 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.080
 but the same time this is not also in 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:01.909
 something taken since as I tell you as the 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.620
 game always update it and always what 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.719
 They are growing more and more 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.479
 because it makes them want to play it every time 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:10.129
 be more often then I a chance 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:11.689
 yes I have left it and just add one 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:14.300
 new use of play 4 since it puts 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.649
 I was hooked playing again and this is 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.469
 something pretty good in any kind of 

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:20.419
 I play these good guys I do not think 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:21.949
 served longer as I tell you this is 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.569
 Warfarin, I'd love to see you 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.729

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:27.469

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:28.780
 they like it because nothing is left nothing else 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:30.040
 to enjoy it 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.540
