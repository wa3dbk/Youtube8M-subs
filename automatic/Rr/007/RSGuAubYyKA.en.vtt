00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.030
 and girls how are they good because they believe 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.680
 today we are going to be inaugurating 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.629
 a new section here in the channel that 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.770
 this is going to call in the kitchen with area 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:17.380
 where I'm going to show you one or another 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.240
 thing that I do in the kitchen obviously and 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.890
 Well, today I am going to start 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.740
 with a cactus smoothie that he took 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.089
 a lot a lot of time but breast 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.220
 with this little girl and I remember that 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.279
 whenever he looked at it he said 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.689
 which was used has cactus and food 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.180
 I was not wanting to try 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.950
 this question once I finally tried it and 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.750
 the truth is that he does not know much nopal 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.700
 although it carries nopal and is one of the 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.520
 main ingredients no 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.050
 necessarily it is at par then 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.670
 if you are still in my channel 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.100
 videoblogs then you know that I 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.570
 I have the morning, do not feed me 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.520
 well not to eat at my hours of 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.470
 definitely never eat breakfast 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.210
 breakfast because usually one 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.950
 always gives priority to other things when 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.540
 I work at school to everything and we 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.120
 we forget a little bit about ourselves 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.760
 so then I wanted to start I do not know to 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.409
 designate to improve the feeding in 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.090
 this question and well I decided 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.619
 start with this smoothie that I remember 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.270
 that I liked and the truth is that 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.340
 it took like a week taking it and I 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.560
 like the truth 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.710
 I feel very good I feel with more 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.509
 energy during the day if they have yes 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.770
 they think that the truth is going to fall badly 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.079
 I did not fall badly 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.000
 so try or if you want one day 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.439
 that does not go anywhere but not 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 cause any kind of side effect 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.869
 First, I wanted to share this 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810
 recipe as I tell them I'm liking 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.609
 A lot does not leave not stop from those of them 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.740
 I promise that they will not even remove 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.850
 feel neither lava nor toilets and nopal da 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.340
 or anything and it's very rich and it's very very very 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.229
 healthy not if it is that I'm not going to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.939
 talk more and if you like this kind of 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.890
 videos definitely leave me a 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.020
 comment and little fingers up to know 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.939
 what do they want to see and put on 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.179
 stacks and make more of this type of videos 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.129
 and then good now without more or more we 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.659
 we go for my first recipe in this 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:02.659
 section that is the liquefied opal 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.090
 ok girls take note of the first thing that 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.289
 we are going to need is a cactus remember 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.420
 that nopales are high in fiber 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.910
 they control diabetes and it is a source 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.770
 important digestive fiber also 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.020
 we're going to need two or three oranges 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.270
 the oranges also have a lot 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.610
 vitamin c has high content of 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.040
 calcium potassium iron and good with 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.250
 oranges we can use two or three and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.340
 make them in a juice or you can also 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.620
 use grapefruit juice 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.830
 and I also use a half glass of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.019
 water so that it is not so thick another 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.420
 thing we 're going to use is celery and 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.629
 we need a slice of celery nothing 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.120
 more I will also occupy as three 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.379
 tiny twigs of parsley and the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.060
 parsley because it also has many 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.160
 vitamins and helps eliminate many 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.950
 toxins another of the ingredients 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.340
 main is the pineapple also occupied a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.230
 pineapple slice and also it helps 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.420
 clean the bowel and it's very very good 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.069
 for us for our body as 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.099
 let's have all of that then we're going to go 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.099
 putting in the blender as you see here 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.960
 and if it 's too hot where you live 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.820
 You can also add a couple of 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.330
 crimes to make it look cool 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.330
 cool 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.160
 all right 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.310
 and once all the ingredients 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.380
 They are inside, so we liquefy it 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.940
 obviously and we wait for it to be finished 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.010
 to liquefy to take them 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.720
 and once it's finished liquefying but 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.880
 you're ready to drink, you can 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.690
 serve up two glasses or you can 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.690
 invite someone else 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.989
 and good girls with this we conclude this 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.640
 first section I hope you have them 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.310
 that is useful to them and that they put it 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.110
 in practice and if you have already tried it 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.940
 leave me a comment below telling me 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.769
 if they liked it if they had not tried 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.959
 try it and also commenting 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.580
 down to see if they liked it as I say 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.709
 I have felt many changes in my 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.989
 body and I'm not taking it 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.970
 necessarily with the emphasis of losing 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.250
 I'm primarily taking weight 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.950
 for my health to have something in the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.419
 system to have nutrients and things 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.139
 good of my body is here is the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.090
 juice was super super rich the truth and 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.010
 It's not because I did it but it was good 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.380
 percale critically you get for two 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.330
 glasses so you can share to your 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.690
 familiar to your friend to your boyfriend all 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.100
 girlfriend who you want but good 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.290
 it was super super good speaking 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.389
 I recommend a lot and well, I'm going to 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.460
 keep enjoying this smoothie if you 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.560
 you've already tried it we have to see how 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.669
 you liked it and if you have not tried it, try it 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.889
 the truth is that there are many times 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.660
 we think that in the local it looks horrible and 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.130
 I 'm not a fan of hotels 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.900
 but since they have real pineapple 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.240
 they remove a lot a lot the flavors is that 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.060
 it is very very delicious 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.319
 and it's perfect to have nutrients and 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.620
 all those things that maybe not 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.690
 we eat daily then yes I hope 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.250
 that this video has served them and if 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.180
 like to leave crimes up to follow 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.960
 doing this kind of videos and I'm 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.669
 happening so is that we see this 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.069
 yellow I do not have yellow glazes 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.069
 and since there was a system dropped pearls
