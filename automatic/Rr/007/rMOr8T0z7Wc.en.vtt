I will compete in their videos today
we're<00:00:15.559> going<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:15.710> be<00:00:15.800> talking<00:00:15.950> about<00:00:16.190> the

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
we're going to be talking about the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.940 
we're going to be talking about the
reasons<00:00:16.940> why<00:00:17.210> you<00:00:17.900> should<00:00:18.140> not<00:00:18.320> stretch<00:00:18.920> a

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:18.950 
reasons why you should not stretch a

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.130 
reasons why you should not stretch a
muscle<00:00:19.490> just<00:00:20.119> before<00:00:20.300> you<00:00:20.480> contracting

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
muscle just before you contracting

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.350 
muscle just before you contracting
because<00:00:21.980> I<00:00:22.130> hear<00:00:22.369> a<00:00:22.400> lot<00:00:22.490> of<00:00:22.790> it<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.029> the<00:00:23.090> gyms

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
because I hear a lot of it in the gyms

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.120 
because I hear a lot of it in the gyms
people<00:00:23.869> saying<00:00:24.110> stretch<00:00:24.830> your<00:00:25.010> muscles

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
people saying stretch your muscles

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.890 
people saying stretch your muscles
stretch<00:00:25.610> your<00:00:25.790> muscles<00:00:25.880> get<00:00:26.330> a<00:00:26.360> good<00:00:26.630> stretch

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
stretch your muscles get a good stretch

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.080 
stretch your muscles get a good stretch
before<00:00:27.410> your<00:00:27.529> breasts<00:00:27.800> don't<00:00:28.520> do<00:00:28.790> it<00:00:28.820> and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
before your breasts don't do it and

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.960 
before your breasts don't do it and
here's<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.660> simple<00:00:29.869> reason<00:00:30.320> why<00:00:30.820> because<00:00:31.820> of

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
here's a simple reason why because of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.080 
here's a simple reason why because of
your<00:00:32.090> muscle<00:00:35.350> your<00:00:36.350> muscle<00:00:36.800> is<00:00:37.010> attached<00:00:37.730> to

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
your muscle your muscle is attached to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.160 
your muscle your muscle is attached to
two<00:00:38.510> bones<00:00:38.780> via<00:00:39.470> tendons<00:00:43.720> so<00:00:44.720> here's<00:00:44.990> two

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
two bones via tendons so here's two

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.890 
two bones via tendons so here's two
tendons<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:46.460> muscles<00:00:46.880> attach<00:00:47.240> the<00:00:47.450> tendons

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
tendons the muscles attach the tendons

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:57.319 
tendons the muscles attach the tendons
the<00:00:48.050> tendons<00:00:48.530> are<00:00:48.680> attached<00:00:48.980> to<00:00:49.220> bones

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 

so<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> stretch<00:00:58.499> the<00:00:58.769> two<00:00:58.980> bones

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so when you stretch the two bones

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.040 
so when you stretch the two bones
lengthen<00:00:59.789> right<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> stretch<00:01:00.839> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
lengthen right so when you stretch the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.259 
lengthen right so when you stretch the
two<00:01:01.199> bones<00:01:01.469> lengthen<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.399> bones<00:01:02.730> pull<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
two bones lengthen the bones pull on

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.910 
two bones lengthen the bones pull on
attendance<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.019> tendons<00:01:04.470> pull<00:01:04.710> on<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
attendance the tendons pull on the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 
attendance the tendons pull on the
muscle<00:01:05.220> tissue<00:01:05.399> smoke<00:01:06.330> banging<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.799> muscle

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
muscle tissue smoke banging the muscle

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.249 
muscle tissue smoke banging the muscle
tissue<00:01:08.009> you'll<00:01:08.310> find<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> call<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.509> muscle

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
tissue you'll find what we call a muscle

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.429 
tissue you'll find what we call a muscle
spindle<00:01:12.530> now<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.130> nerve<00:01:14.909> center<00:01:15.439> right

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
spindle now this is a nerve center right

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.310 
spindle now this is a nerve center right
so<00:01:16.710> inside<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.789> have<00:01:18.060> notes<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so inside there you have notes that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.910 
so inside there you have notes that
attach<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> your<00:01:19.979> brain<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.439> happens<00:01:22.770> is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
attach to your brain so what happens is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.210 
attach to your brain so what happens is
when<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.310> muscle<00:01:24.289> stretches<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.070> these

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
when this muscle stretches so when these

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.010 
when this muscle stretches so when these
two<00:01:26.399> bones<00:01:26.640> lengthen<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.570> muscle

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
two bones lengthen and this muscle

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
two bones lengthen and this muscle
stretches<00:01:28.789> inside<00:01:29.789> here<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.280> gnome<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.909> aware

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
stretches inside here the gnome is aware

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.590 
stretches inside here the gnome is aware
that<00:01:33.479> muscle<00:01:34.440> stretches<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.190> sends<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.030> reflex

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
that muscle stretches and sends a reflex

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
that muscle stretches and sends a reflex
action<00:01:36.959> to<00:01:37.049> your<00:01:37.170> brain<00:01:37.440> which<00:01:38.159> sends<00:01:38.549> another

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
action to your brain which sends another

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.859 
action to your brain which sends another
message<00:01:39.420> back<00:01:39.720> saying<00:01:40.520> contract<00:01:41.520> now<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
message back saying contract now this is

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.740 
message back saying contract now this is
really<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> lot<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.069> sports<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> just

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
really good for a lot of sports so just

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
really good for a lot of sports so just
say<00:01:45.869> you're<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> boxer<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.679> example<00:01:47.159> when

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
say you're a boxer for example when

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.580 
say you're a boxer for example when
you're<00:01:47.880> boxing<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:48.569> go<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.869> shoulder<00:01:49.319> first

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you're boxing you go in shoulder first

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.620 
you're boxing you go in shoulder first
because<00:01:50.039> what<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.280> does<00:01:50.459> is<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.909> stretches

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
because what that does is it stretches

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.630 
because what that does is it stretches
the<00:01:51.659> anterior<00:01:52.319> head<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.590> you're<00:01:52.740> dealt<00:01:53.009> which

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the anterior head if you're dealt which

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760 
the anterior head if you're dealt which
means<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.179> allowed<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.649> know

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
means you allowed you can then you know

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.219 
means you allowed you can then you know
punch<00:01:56.159> Fast<00:01:56.580> Eddie<00:01:56.819> you're<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.539> explosive

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
punch Fast Eddie you're more explosive

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.160 
punch Fast Eddie you're more explosive
tennis<00:01:59.069> players<00:01:59.399> right<00:02:00.090> tennis<00:02:00.479> players<00:02:00.780> can

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
tennis players right tennis players can

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.889 
tennis players right tennis players can
rotate<00:02:01.890> shoulder<00:02:02.429> first<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.000> stretch<00:02:03.599> as<00:02:03.750> an

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
rotate shoulder first it stretch as an

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.219 
rotate shoulder first it stretch as an
anterior<00:02:04.349> the<00:02:04.590> delt<00:02:04.830> which<00:02:04.979> allows<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.519> to

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
anterior the delt which allows them to

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.719 
anterior the delt which allows them to
you<00:02:07.229> know<00:02:07.349> go<00:02:07.530> through<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.950> forearm<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you know go through the forearm and the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
you know go through the forearm and the
back<00:02:08.910> are<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.479> more<00:02:09.660> efficiently<00:02:10.170> with

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
back are more or more efficiently with

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.570 
back are more or more efficiently with
more<00:02:10.530> power<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.720> have<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.379> sport<00:02:14.340> where

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
more power so if you have a sport where

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580 
more power so if you have a sport where
you<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.209> body<00:02:15.450> weight<00:02:15.720> then<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.349> can

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
you just have body weight then you can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.820 
you just have body weight then you can
use<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.190> stretch<00:02:17.970> reflex<00:02:18.660> action<00:02:19.230> to

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
use this stretch reflex action to

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.390 
use this stretch reflex action to
produce<00:02:20.220> more<00:02:20.700> force<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.680> question<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.190> this

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
produce more force the question is this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.660 
produce more force the question is this
what<00:02:24.180> happens<00:02:24.720> when<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.230> put<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.769> weight<00:02:26.370> load

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
what happens when you put a weight load

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790 
what happens when you put a weight load
on<00:02:26.879> that<00:02:27.060> what<00:02:27.540> happens<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> try<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.620> get

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
on that what happens if you try and get

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.280 
on that what happens if you try and get
the<00:02:28.950> stretch<00:02:29.190> reflex<00:02:29.760> action<00:02:30.180> happening<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the stretch reflex action happening to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.320 
the stretch reflex action happening to
produce<00:02:31.440> more<00:02:31.680> force<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.519> you<00:02:32.550> put<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> massive

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
produce more force but you put a massive

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.300 
produce more force but you put a massive
weight<00:02:33.540> load<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.989> muscle<00:02:34.349> right<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.129> is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
weight load on the muscle right this is

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
weight load on the muscle right this is
what<00:02:35.340> happens

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.060 

what<00:02:43.660> happens<00:02:44.020> is<00:02:44.140> when<00:02:44.320> this<00:02:44.470> muscle

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
what happens is when this muscle

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.330 
what happens is when this muscle
stretches<00:02:45.990> so<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.110> two<00:02:47.290> bones<00:02:47.500> lengthen<00:02:48.010> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
stretches so the two bones lengthen it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.090 
stretches so the two bones lengthen it
tendon<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.180> now<00:02:49.480> being<00:02:49.750> pulled<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.800> this

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
tendon is now being pulled in this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.460 
tendon is now being pulled in this
direction<00:02:51.310> right<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:53.080> being<00:02:53.380> pulled<00:02:53.650> away<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
direction right is being pulled away and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.590 
direction right is being pulled away and
now<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.500> muscle<00:02:57.160> contracts<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.210> massive

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
now this muscle contracts and a massive

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.920 
now this muscle contracts and a massive
weight<00:02:58.990> load<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.560> contracts<00:03:00.340> inward<00:03:01.060> pulling

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
weight load it contracts inward pulling

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.070 
weight load it contracts inward pulling
towards<00:03:02.830> each<00:03:02.950> other<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:04.390> means<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.840> this

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
towards each other that means that this

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.040 
towards each other that means that this
tendon<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:06.250> now<00:03:06.550> being<00:03:06.850> pulled<00:03:07.210> in<00:03:07.480> two

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
tendon is now being pulled in two

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.990 
tendon is now being pulled in two
different<00:03:08.380> directions<00:03:08.590> at<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.340> same<00:03:09.460> time

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
different directions at the same time

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.960 
different directions at the same time
and<00:03:10.380> what<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.590> means<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.190> you've<00:03:12.760> got<00:03:12.940> a

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
and what that means is that you've got a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.910 
and what that means is that you've got a
very<00:03:13.150> high<00:03:13.450> chance<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:14.110> that<00:03:14.260> tendon<00:03:14.710> just

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
very high chance of that tendon just

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.730 
very high chance of that tendon just
ripping<00:03:15.250> off<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.460> bone<00:03:15.870> easy<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.260> best-case

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
ripping off the bone easy the best-case

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.230 
ripping off the bone easy the best-case
scenario<00:03:18.220> you're<00:03:18.490> going<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.700> have<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.880> partial

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
scenario you're going to have a partial

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.590 
scenario you're going to have a partial
tear<00:03:19.660> such<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:20.430> tennis<00:03:21.430> elbow<00:03:21.820> golfer's<00:03:22.450> elbow

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
tear such as tennis elbow golfer's elbow

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.410 
tear such as tennis elbow golfer's elbow
etc<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.710> might<00:03:23.920> get<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> strained<00:03:24.490> tendon<00:03:24.640> now

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
etc you might get a strained tendon now

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.300 
etc you might get a strained tendon now
the<00:03:25.480> problem<00:03:25.840> is<00:03:26.080> your<00:03:26.350> tendons<00:03:26.830> don't<00:03:27.100> have<00:03:27.280> a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
the problem is your tendons don't have a

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.040 
the problem is your tendons don't have a
bloodstream<00:03:27.850> which<00:03:28.060> means<00:03:28.360> it's<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:28.990> to

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
bloodstream which means it's going to

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.840 
bloodstream which means it's going to
take<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.230> long<00:03:29.500> time<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.890> recover<00:03:30.160> you<00:03:30.580> have<00:03:30.670> to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
take a long time to recover you have to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.540 
take a long time to recover you have to
manually<00:03:31.360> I<00:03:31.630> sit<00:03:32.020> yourself<00:03:32.440> to<00:03:33.040> stimulate

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
manually I sit yourself to stimulate

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.270 
manually I sit yourself to stimulate
blood<00:03:33.670> flow<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.240> area<00:03:34.740> so<00:03:35.740> if<00:03:35.830> you<00:03:35.980> tear<00:03:36.250> a

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
blood flow to that area so if you tear a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.100 
blood flow to that area so if you tear a
tendon<00:03:36.400> you're<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.120> big<00:03:37.300> trouble<00:03:37.330> worst<00:03:37.870> case

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
tendon you're in big trouble worst case

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.020 
tendon you're in big trouble worst case
scenario<00:03:38.620> it'll<00:03:39.130> rip<00:03:39.340> straight<00:03:39.640> off<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.790> bone

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
scenario it'll rip straight off the bone

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.210 
scenario it'll rip straight off the bone
and<00:03:40.300> that's<00:03:40.870> obviously<00:03:41.290> something<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:42.100> you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
and that's obviously something that you

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.030 
and that's obviously something that you
don't<00:03:42.490> want<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.880> happen<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:43.840> when<00:03:44.500> people<00:03:44.860> say

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
don't want to happen so when people say

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.680 
don't want to happen so when people say
that<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.430> want<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.700> get<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.060> good<00:03:46.300> stretch

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
that you want to get it good stretch

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.850 
that you want to get it good stretch
before<00:03:47.140> you<00:03:47.200> contract<00:03:47.700> think<00:03:48.700> again
