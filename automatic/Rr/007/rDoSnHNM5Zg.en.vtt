00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
all right we're finally on the right

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.080 
all right we're finally on the right
train<00:00:27.170> taking<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:27.860> tube<00:00:28.040> to<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.670> park<00:00:28.880> where

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
train taking the tube to the park where

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.050 
train taking the tube to the park where
we're<00:00:29.180> going<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.890> take<00:00:30.890> this<00:00:31.040> time<00:00:31.310> we<00:00:31.760> got<00:00:31.910> two

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
we're going to take this time we got two

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.600 
we're going to take this time we got two
minutes<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.480> put<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.750> detector<00:00:32.960> together

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
minutes and put the detector together

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.010 
minutes and put the detector together
break<00:00:34.610> it<00:00:34.760> loose<00:00:34.880> ready<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:35.420> we<00:00:35.630> get<00:00:35.780> there

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
break it loose ready so we get there

00:00:36.020 --> 00:01:27.690 
break it loose ready so we get there
good<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.560> go

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.980 

while<00:01:28.700> we're<00:01:28.850> over<00:01:28.880> here<00:01:29.119> in<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.299> UK<00:01:29.479> we're<00:01:29.899> in

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
while we're over here in the UK we're in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.510 
while we're over here in the UK we're in
the<00:01:30.079> London<00:01:30.350> area<00:01:30.500> right<00:01:30.799> now<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.369> thought

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
the London area right now we thought

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.090 
the London area right now we thought
we'd<00:01:31.729> do<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:32.299> water<00:01:32.509> heading

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
we'd do a little water heading

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.889 
we'd do a little water heading
specifically<00:01:34.100> we're<00:01:34.220> on<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.369> Thames<00:01:34.610> River

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
specifically we're on the Thames River

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.899 
specifically we're on the Thames River
blood<00:01:35.899> of<00:01:36.049> history<00:01:36.590> here<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:37.369> Romans<00:01:37.759> even

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
blood of history here the Romans even

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.940 
blood of history here the Romans even
crossed<00:01:38.299> this<00:01:38.509> place<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:39.079> different<00:01:39.590> points

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
crossed this place in different points

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.130 
crossed this place in different points
but<00:01:40.100> what<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.210> can<00:01:41.329> do<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.570> actually<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.990> the

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
but what you can do is actually have the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.950 
but what you can do is actually have the
river<00:01:42.320> but<00:01:42.700> should<00:01:43.700> be<00:01:43.789> fair<00:01:44.000> notice<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.509> you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
river but should be fair notice that you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.690 
river but should be fair notice that you
need<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.110> proper<00:01:45.439> permit<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.220> we<00:01:46.369> applied<00:01:46.670> to

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
need a proper permit so we applied to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.310 
need a proper permit so we applied to
the<00:01:46.880> permit<00:01:47.210> long<00:01:47.450> before<00:01:47.780> we<00:01:47.869> came<00:01:48.020> over<00:01:48.080> here

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
the permit long before we came over here

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.529 
the permit long before we came over here
and<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.549> gives<00:01:49.759> us<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:50.030> certain<00:01:50.210> number<00:01:50.390> of

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
and this gives us a certain number of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.660 
and this gives us a certain number of
days<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:51.140> were<00:01:51.289> allowed<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.009> hunt<00:01:52.340> certain

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
days that were allowed to hunt certain

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.060 
days that were allowed to hunt certain
areas<00:01:52.970> to<00:01:53.149> certain<00:01:53.450> depths<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:54.470> most<00:01:54.799> cases

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
areas to certain depths in most cases

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.010 
areas to certain depths in most cases
it's<00:01:55.399> about<00:01:55.610> seven<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.390> half<00:01:56.420> centimetres

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
it's about seven and a half centimetres

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.580 
it's about seven and a half centimetres
which<00:01:57.439> is<00:01:57.590> about<00:01:57.710> 3<00:01:58.039> inches<00:01:58.070> us<00:01:58.700> measurement

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
which is about 3 inches us measurement

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.260 
which is about 3 inches us measurement
so<00:02:00.590> we're<00:02:00.860> going<00:02:00.979> to<00:02:01.039> look<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.459> shallow

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so we're going to look for shallow

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.029 
so we're going to look for shallow
targets<00:02:02.750> here<00:02:02.899> among<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.200> rocks<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.770> know

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
targets here among the rocks you know

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.010 
targets here among the rocks you know
with<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.399> rocks<00:02:04.610> being<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.270> way<00:02:05.390> they<00:02:05.420> are<00:02:05.569> a

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
with the rocks being the way they are a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.719 
with the rocks being the way they are a
good<00:02:06.649> target<00:02:06.860> is<00:02:07.039> not<00:02:07.189> necessarily<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.670> to

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
good target is not necessarily going to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.080 
good target is not necessarily going to
go<00:02:07.850> very<00:02:08.000> deep<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:08.569> 3<00:02:09.080> inches<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.530> fine<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.970> with

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
go very deep so 3 inches is fine so with

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.820 
go very deep so 3 inches is fine so with
that<00:02:11.209> in<00:02:11.360> mind<00:02:11.510> I've<00:02:11.660> got<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.959> small<00:02:12.230> coil<00:02:12.620> on

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
that in mind I've got the small coil on

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.390 
that in mind I've got the small coil on
of<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.640> 80<00:02:13.790> here

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
of the 80 here

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.789 
of the 80 here
goes<00:02:16.209> back<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:16.689> because<00:02:16.959> this<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.260> kind<00:02:17.739> of

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
goes back on because this is kind of

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.819 
goes back on because this is kind of
mucky<00:02:18.159> and<00:02:18.189> nasty<00:02:18.640> environment<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.829> hoping

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
mucky and nasty environment but hoping

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.050 
mucky and nasty environment but hoping
to<00:02:20.980> find<00:02:21.159> some<00:02:21.310> old<00:02:21.489> coins

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
to find some old coins

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.839 
to find some old coins
be<00:02:22.269> great<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.599> find<00:02:22.810> something<00:02:23.170> rolling<00:02:23.500> but

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
be great to find something rolling but

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.830 
be great to find something rolling but
anything<00:02:24.849> will<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.000> good<00:02:25.299> because<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.750> going

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
anything will be good because it's going

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.970 
anything will be good because it's going
to<00:02:25.900> be<00:02:26.019> older<00:02:26.230> than<00:02:26.319> what<00:02:26.379> we<00:02:26.500> normally<00:02:26.650> find

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
to be older than what we normally find

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.280 
to be older than what we normally find
in<00:02:27.069> America<00:02:27.519> but<00:02:28.450> we've<00:02:28.629> got<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> 80<00:02:28.989> Pro

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
in America but we've got the 80 Pro

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.929 
in America but we've got the 80 Pro
International<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.430> we're<00:02:30.549> going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.700> give<00:02:30.849> it

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
International and we're going to give it

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.780 
International and we're going to give it
a<00:02:31.000> go<00:02:31.120> here<00:02:31.329> on<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.510> river<00:02:31.659> side<00:02:32.189> it's<00:02:33.189> a<00:02:33.430> low

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
a go here on the river side it's a low

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.300 
a go here on the river side it's a low
tide<00:02:34.060> right<00:02:34.329> now<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.109> Thames<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.739> controlled

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
tide right now the Thames is controlled

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.979 
tide right now the Thames is controlled
by<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.489> tide<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.150> you've<00:02:37.299> got<00:02:37.450> two<00:02:37.750> low<00:02:37.959> tides

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
by the tide so you've got two low tides

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.770 
by the tide so you've got two low tides
and<00:02:38.560> two<00:02:38.709> high<00:02:38.920> tides<00:02:38.950> per<00:02:39.430> day<00:02:39.609> so<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.540> watch

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
and two high tides per day so you watch

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.509 
and two high tides per day so you watch
your<00:02:40.959> tidal<00:02:41.260> charts<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.890> find<00:02:42.099> out<00:02:42.250> when<00:02:42.400> it's

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
your tidal charts and find out when it's

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.210 
your tidal charts and find out when it's
at<00:02:42.640> its<00:02:42.670> lowest<00:02:43.000> point<00:02:43.409> thus<00:02:44.409> exposing<00:02:44.950> all

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
at its lowest point thus exposing all

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.280 
at its lowest point thus exposing all
this<00:02:45.370> area<00:02:45.730> all<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:45.970> rock<00:02:46.299> where<00:02:47.170> there

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
this area all this rock where there

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.180 
this area all this rock where there
could<00:02:47.349> have<00:02:47.409> been<00:02:47.530> some<00:02:47.769> old<00:02:47.889> crossing

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
could have been some old crossing

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.670 
could have been some old crossing
grounds

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
grounds

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.830 
grounds
and<00:02:49.769> we<00:02:50.700> only<00:02:50.819> got<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.030> matter<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.329> hours<00:02:51.659> and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840
