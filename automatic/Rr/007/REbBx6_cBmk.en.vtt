00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:10.264
 The reason I chose "Venus Fries" is the technology of the device. 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.583
 So the most important thing is how effective none of these devices are for my patients. 

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.044
 There are many different devices in the market and all of them are different orders 

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:26.169
 So I spent a lot of time searching for the company number one 

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:31.117
 And the most effective. Another thing patients want is 

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:37.170
 Free from pain especially when you look at radio devices 

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:42.363
 I think we all know that radio equipment is effective and this is fixed. 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:50.399
 It was a big sticking point, figure 1 authoring the device. No. 2 Is it painless? 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.331
 Most people have heard about the extent of pain caused by the devices so when I heard 

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:02.131
 With a new, painless radiator that quickly warms the tissues 

00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:03.255
 I was definitely interested 

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:08.029
 A little more because of diligence and realize that you are some of the technology behind it, 

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:15.733
 Using magnetic pulses, and some other better things that are to the doctor's side 

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.214
 Which made me interested in "Venus Fries" 

00:01:23.362 --> 00:01:29.168
 How to be "Venus Fries" compared with non-techniques is perfect 

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.525
 Through which you can reach results with this device. 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.455
 I have many other devices that are specifically for specific parts of the body. 

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:40.666
 So I have really good devices for the head and neck, 

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.467
 Some are for the lower body and some are for the abdomen. 

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.962
 This is a device that you can use throughout the body so it's really good 

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:52.688
 Especially for those who do not have a lot of hardware 

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.028
 If you want to choose one device and you want to treat multiple areas of the body, 

00:01:56.905 --> 00:02:02.740
 This is a good way to go. I think that by talking only to non-practitioners, doctors and nurses, 

00:02:03.105 --> 00:02:08.652
 Then it is very easy to use. One of the things my office staff really enjoyed about it, 

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:13.192
 Is that it is comfortable. Some of the primitive devices, which were really treating cellulite 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.198
 It was really uncomfortable, and dealing it caused a lot of fatigue for employees who use the machine. 

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:24.152
 In fact, this is not a problem at all with Venus Fries. 

00:02:24.617 --> 00:02:29.654
 The other thing is that if the patient wants to treat the neck, face, 

00:02:30.156 --> 00:02:34.758
 Abdominal, thighs can do this by this device. 

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:43.883
 The only obvious and agreed thing is that Venus Fries is very comfortable. 

00:02:44.273 --> 00:02:48.896
 In fact so relaxing, many patients bleed during treatment 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.808
 It is almost as much as the treatment of mineral water in fact by radio-frequency therapy. 

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.254
 Especially when it is intersected with other RF devices 

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:04.495
 Currently in the market, offering a completely different experience I can say 

00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.601
 They are very well treated and it is easy for them 

00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:12.625
 In terms of compliance, return and the presence of more treatments.
