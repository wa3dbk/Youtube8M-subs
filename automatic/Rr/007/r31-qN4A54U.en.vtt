00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.910
 and goes to me if it's not me 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:41.280
 I throw at him and kill him WCC chances 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.280
 for tickets need to be distracted 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 I 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:52.660
 light your strength i'm taking a look at 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.670
 we have our friends 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.030
 age contingent how do you think about 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:05.820
 price but the guys read harry potter 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:10.240
 who are watching us here and I read and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 You know, well, they are all trying to kill. 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.170
 this bald dude white robe 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.030

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.130

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.490

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.270
 Yes, the same link below 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.970
 teleport 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.970
 I think the fact is that these add 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.790
 they are cowardly motherfucks they remember 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.549
 limp they are like weights or how 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.439
 they do what the team says to them 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 there is there every house is assigned to 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.940

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.860

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.930
 potter dybala 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.850
 so I think that they simply do not like 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.010
 Once you have a small battle units 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.750

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.720
 it was impossible to litter the main 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.260
