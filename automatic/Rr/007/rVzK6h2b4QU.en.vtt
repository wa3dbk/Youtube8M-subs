00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.350 
cables and connectors which came with
the<00:01:13.350> device<00:01:13.619> overall<00:01:14.610> they<00:01:14.880> felt<00:01:15.150> good

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the device overall they felt good

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.410 
the device overall they felt good
quality<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.320> designed<00:01:17.220> well<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.850> couldn't

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
quality and designed well I couldn't

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
quality and designed well I couldn't
imagine<00:01:18.570> having<00:01:18.990> any<00:01:19.290> problems<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:20.070> in

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
imagine having any problems with them in

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.999 
imagine having any problems with them in
the<00:01:20.549> future<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.570> did<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.740> blue

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the future I really did like the blue

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
the future I really did like the blue
LEDs<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.909> indicate<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.540> power<00:01:24.780> was<00:01:25.049> being

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
LEDs to indicate the power was being

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380 
LEDs to indicate the power was being
given<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.799> device<00:01:26.189> overall<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.240> would

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
given to a device overall I would

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.120 
given to a device overall I would
recommend<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.110> product<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> someone<00:01:28.920> that's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
recommend this product to someone that's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
recommend this product to someone that's
looking<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> expand<00:01:30.150> them<00:01:30.329> out<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.600> USB<00:01:30.930> 3

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
looking to expand them out of USB 3

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.210 
looking to expand them out of USB 3
ports<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.250> they<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.640> bought<00:01:33.390> their<00:01:33.720> device

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
ports that they have bought their device

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.580 
ports that they have bought their device
so<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> only<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:35.880> USB<00:01:36.810> 3<00:01:37.110> port<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> my

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so I only have one USB 3 port on my

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
so I only have one USB 3 port on my
laptop<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.939> theory<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.509> gives<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.869> six

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
laptop and in theory this gives me six

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.200 
laptop and in theory this gives me six
more<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:40.920> I'm<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.430> pleased<00:01:41.850> about

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
more which I'm really pleased about

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.340 
more which I'm really pleased about

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
so at 35 pounds would you play oh yes

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.639 
so at 35 pounds would you play oh yes

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
that's a half-hearted yes because I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.350

personally<00:01:49.649> would<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.030> little

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
personally would like to see it a little

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.870 
personally would like to see it a little
cheaper<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.009> worth<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> money

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
cheaper but it really is worth the money

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.039 
cheaper but it really is worth the money
if<00:01:54.420> he<00:01:54.479> needs<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.409> USB<00:01:56.040> 3<00:01:56.369> ports<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.570> I'd<00:01:57.869> like

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
if he needs more USB 3 ports so I'd like
