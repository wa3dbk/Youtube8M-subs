project
so<00:00:10.680> my<00:00:11.680> project<00:00:11.950> is<00:00:12.160> controlled

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
so my project is controlled

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.560 
so my project is controlled
at<00:00:13.080> mega<00:00:13.410> 2560<00:00:14.960> with<00:00:15.960> an<00:00:16.260> eternal<00:00:16.710> shield<00:00:17.040> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
has a PID controlled power source it is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.290 
has a PID controlled power source it is
controlled<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.820> atmega<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.410> course

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
controlled by the atmega and of course

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.200 
controlled by the atmega and of course
it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> made<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:34.290> robot<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.820> robot<00:00:35.850> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it is made with a robot the robot is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.460 
it is made with a robot the robot is
made<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.920> servos<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:39.559> MDF<00:00:40.699> material<00:00:42.410> on<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
made with servos and MDF material on a

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.620 
made with servos and MDF material on a
gripper<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.720> you<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:46.050> see<00:00:46.290> it<00:00:46.350> working

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
gripper so now you will see it working

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.120 
gripper so now you will see it working
so<00:00:48.630> weõll<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.870> controlled<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.380> an<00:00:50.149> android<00:00:51.149> app

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
so weõll is controlled by an android app

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.420 
so weõll is controlled by an android app
using<00:00:53.130> Wi-Fi<00:00:53.670> connection<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.250> see

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
using Wi-Fi connection so you can see

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.420 
using Wi-Fi connection so you can see
how<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.940> moves<00:00:58.579> up<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.790> down

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
how it moves up and down

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
how it moves up and down
that's<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.640> elbow<00:01:04.070> touch<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.280> gripper<00:01:07.100> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
that's the elbow touch the gripper one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.800 
that's the elbow touch the gripper one
side<00:01:08.369> on<00:01:08.610> our<00:01:08.640> side<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.869> have<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.050> hand<00:01:10.320> button

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
side on our side we have a hand button

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.359 
side on our side we have a hand button
and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.229> teach<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.950> robot<00:01:14.100> new

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and you can also teach the robot new

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.400 
and you can also teach the robot new
positions<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.410> example<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.500> will<00:01:16.560> start<00:01:18.410> by

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
positions for example I will start by

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.609 
positions for example I will start by
grabbing<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.670> hub<00:01:20.940> get<00:01:21.179> here<00:01:24.319> wait<00:01:25.319> a<00:01:25.350> minute

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
grabbing this hub get here wait a minute

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
grabbing this hub get here wait a minute
it's<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:29.429> difficult<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.819> do<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.209> one

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
it's very difficult to do it with one

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.410 
it's very difficult to do it with one
hand

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.690 

so<00:01:35.990> I<00:01:36.020> have<00:01:36.909> I'm<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.270> position<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.740> will

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
so I have I'm now in position so I will

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.140 
so I have I'm now in position so I will
push<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.240> set<00:01:41.870> button<00:01:42.430> now<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.460> close<00:01:43.970> the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
push the set button now I close the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:53.859 
push the set button now I close the
gripper<00:01:45.130> side<00:01:46.130> button<00:01:47.800> then<00:01:48.800> we<00:01:49.040> are<00:01:52.720> we<00:01:53.720> go

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
gripper side button then we are we go

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.649 
gripper side button then we are we go
our<00:01:54.080> bicep<00:01:54.670> side<00:01:55.670> button<00:01:57.220> now<00:01:58.220> we<00:01:58.250> go<00:01:58.659> this

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
our bicep side button now we go this

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.300 
our bicep side button now we go this
side<00:01:59.900> then<00:02:00.740> I<00:02:00.860> save<00:02:01.330> safely<00:02:02.330> position<00:02:03.250> now<00:02:04.250> we

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
side then I save safely position now we

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.930 
side then I save safely position now we
go<00:02:04.580> down<00:02:07.450> Save<00:02:08.450> button<00:02:09.039> now<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.070> will<00:02:10.670> leave<00:02:10.820> the

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
go down Save button now I will leave the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:22.860 
go down Save button now I will leave the
gripper<00:02:11.270> and<00:02:12.340> that's<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.780> let's<00:02:15.140> play<00:02:15.860> it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.170 

so<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.959> can<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:24.230> how<00:02:24.350> far<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.800> how<00:02:25.610> fast<00:02:25.940> it

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
so you can see how far it is how fast it

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.590 
so you can see how far it is how fast it
is<00:02:26.680> we<00:02:27.680> are<00:02:27.830> using<00:02:28.480> linear<00:02:29.480> interpolation

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
is we are using linear interpolation

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.259 
is we are using linear interpolation
here<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:31.190> get<00:02:31.370> all<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.610> positions<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
here to get all the positions in the

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.120 
here to get all the positions in the
same<00:02:32.420> same<00:02:32.810> time<00:02:32.840> or<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.440> movements<00:02:33.860> from<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
same same time or the movements from the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.490 
same same time or the movements from the
robot<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.360> let's<00:02:35.720> see<00:02:35.810> how<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.050> works<00:02:38.500> so

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
robot so let's see how it works so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.640 
robot so let's see how it works so
that's<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:42.040> low<00:02:43.040> cost<00:02:43.400> become<00:02:44.239> place

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's it and a low cost become place

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:53.319 
that's it and a low cost become place
robotic<00:02:45.650> arm<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> hope<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.610> like<00:02:52.760> it<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.000> far

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
robotic arm so I hope you like it so far

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.300 
robotic arm so I hope you like it so far
this<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.470> one<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.890> modes<00:02:55.070> of

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
this is the this is one of the modes of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.150 
this is the this is one of the modes of
my<00:02:55.549> robot<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:57.079> is<00:02:57.230> called<00:02:58.630> Wi-Fi<00:02:59.829> teaching<00:03:00.829> and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
my robot it is called Wi-Fi teaching and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.240 
my robot it is called Wi-Fi teaching and
control<00:03:01.850> mode<00:03:02.440> next<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.530> will<00:03:03.590> show<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.920> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
control mode next I will show you the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.539 
control mode next I will show you the
object<00:03:05.090> tracking<00:03:05.540> mode<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.769> mimic<00:03:07.070> mode

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
object tracking mode and the mimic mode

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:21.160 
object tracking mode and the mimic mode
thank<00:03:08.120> you

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.570 

hello<00:03:22.170> there<00:03:22.349> this<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.040> object<00:03:23.220> tracking

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
hello there this is the object tracking

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.089 
hello there this is the object tracking
mode<00:03:23.819> now<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.870> are<00:03:25.170> seeing<00:03:25.409> what<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.799> camera

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
mode now you are seeing what the camera

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.119 
mode now you are seeing what the camera
sees<00:03:26.159> so<00:03:27.030> how<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.360> works<00:03:27.769> first<00:03:28.769> it

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
sees so how it works first it

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.430 
sees so how it works first it
discriminates<00:03:29.640> between<00:03:29.760> color<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.200> case

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
discriminates between color in this case

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.809 
discriminates between color in this case
we<00:03:32.250> are<00:03:32.280> using<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.760> blue<00:03:32.970> object<00:03:33.590> color<00:03:34.640> as<00:03:35.640> you

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
we are using a blue object color as you

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.839 
we are using a blue object color as you
can<00:03:35.970> see<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:38.010> moves<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
can see so it moves and there the

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.300 
can see so it moves and there the
robotic<00:03:41.849> arm<00:03:42.090> will<00:03:42.329> follow<00:03:42.599> its<00:03:42.810> movements<00:03:43.310> it

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
robotic arm will follow its movements it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.240 
robotic arm will follow its movements it

eternal shield and one adopter shield so

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.690 
eternal shield and one adopter shield so
the<00:04:00.420> next<00:04:00.599> step<00:04:00.900> is<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:02.040> discriminate<00:04:02.340> between

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
the next step is to discriminate between

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.080 
the next step is to discriminate between
shape<00:04:03.230> because<00:04:04.230> as<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:05.190> can<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.849> in

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
shape because as you can see in the in

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.110 
shape because as you can see in the in
the<00:04:06.150> picture<00:04:06.530> there<00:04:07.530> are<00:04:07.650> some<00:04:07.950> power<00:04:08.430> objects

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the picture there are some power objects

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.470 
the picture there are some power objects
that<00:04:09.299> are<00:04:09.659> also<00:04:10.049> blue<00:04:10.340> but<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.819> around<00:04:12.060> not

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
that are also blue but just around not

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.000 
that are also blue but just around not
yet<00:04:12.690> SAR<00:04:12.870> take<00:04:13.079> it<00:04:13.260> taken<00:04:13.799> in<00:04:13.890> an<00:04:14.010> account<00:04:16.010> so

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
yet SAR take it taken in an account so

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.589 
yet SAR take it taken in an account so
the<00:04:17.130> Roth<00:04:17.310> account<00:04:17.639> will<00:04:17.880> follow<00:04:18.180> all<00:04:18.479> the

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
the Roth account will follow all the

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:27.680 
the Roth account will follow all the
movements<00:04:19.190> from<00:04:20.190> this<00:04:20.400> object

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.050 

hello<00:04:28.690> there<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.050> is<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.470> new<00:04:29.590> week<00:04:29.740> mode<00:04:30.060> so

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
hello there this is the new week mode so

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.890 
hello there this is the new week mode so
now<00:04:31.509> you<00:04:31.570> will<00:04:31.900> see<00:04:32.050> how<00:04:32.229> the<00:04:32.290> rod<00:04:32.650> moves

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
now you will see how the rod moves

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.689 
now you will see how the rod moves
according<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.020> my<00:04:35.169> so<00:04:35.680> how<00:04:36.100> many<00:04:36.160> makhmour

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
according to my so how many makhmour

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.480 
according to my so how many makhmour
mode<00:04:36.970> works<00:04:37.830> as<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.979> can<00:04:39.160> see<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:39.400> the

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
mode works as you can see in the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.820 
mode works as you can see in the
computer<00:04:40.710> objects<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:42.220> that<00:04:42.880> are<00:04:43.180> round

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
computer objects that that are round

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.310 
computer objects that that are round
green<00:04:44.850> blue<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:45.880> red<00:04:46.210> colors<00:04:46.419> are

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
green blue and red colors are

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.879 
green blue and red colors are
discriminated<00:04:49.080> using<00:04:50.080> these<00:04:50.199> spots<00:04:50.590> in<00:04:50.770> my

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
discriminated using these spots in my

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.439 
discriminated using these spots in my
body<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.370> can<00:04:52.240> build<00:04:52.600> up<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.870> model<00:04:53.169> of<00:04:53.259> my<00:04:53.410> yarn

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
body I can build up a model of my yarn

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.430 
body I can build up a model of my yarn
so<00:04:55.449> when<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.750> close<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:57.340> open<00:04:57.550> my<00:04:57.850> hand<00:04:58.440> the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
so when I close and open my hand the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.000 
so when I close and open my hand the
gripper<00:04:59.800> closes<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.550> opens<00:05:01.410> when<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.440> move<00:05:02.800> my

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
gripper closes and opens when I move my

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.040 
gripper closes and opens when I move my
elbows<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:04.539> robotic<00:05:04.870> elbow<00:05:05.260> also<00:05:05.710> moves<00:05:07.050> that

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
elbows the robotic elbow also moves that

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.560 
elbows the robotic elbow also moves that
you<00:05:08.169> can<00:05:08.320> see<00:05:09.300> in<00:05:10.300> my<00:05:10.449> movements<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:12.460> also<00:05:13.150> if<00:05:13.389> I

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
you can see in my movements so also if I

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.189 
you can see in my movements so also if I
move<00:05:13.780> my<00:05:14.669> my<00:05:15.669> shoulder<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.389> robotic<00:05:16.810> shoulder

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
move my my shoulder the robotic shoulder

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.700 
move my my shoulder the robotic shoulder
also<00:05:17.350> moves<00:05:18.840> that's<00:05:19.840> why<00:05:20.020> this<00:05:20.080> mode<00:05:20.530> is

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
also moves that's why this mode is

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.870 
also moves that's why this mode is
called<00:05:20.889> mimic<00:05:21.370> mode<00:05:22.139> so<00:05:23.139> how<00:05:23.260> it<00:05:23.410> works<00:05:23.880> once

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
called mimic mode so how it works once

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.860 
called mimic mode so how it works once
you<00:05:25.000> have<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.419> blue<00:05:25.750> red<00:05:26.259> and<00:05:26.500> green<00:05:26.650> spots

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
you have the blue red and green spots

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.710 
you have the blue red and green spots
detected<00:05:29.130> you<00:05:30.130> make<00:05:30.340> inverse<00:05:31.000> kinematics<00:05:31.599> in

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
detected you make inverse kinematics in

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.200 
detected you make inverse kinematics in
order<00:05:31.930> to<00:05:32.050> get<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:32.800> angles<00:05:33.250> from<00:05:33.940> those

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
order to get the angles from those

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.180 
order to get the angles from those
points<00:05:34.800> those<00:05:35.800> angles<00:05:36.190> are<00:05:36.400> sent<00:05:37.000> using<00:05:37.949> TCP<00:05:38.949> /

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190

the camera on my computer as you can see

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.219 
the camera on my computer as you can see
so<00:05:53.800> this<00:05:54.070> has<00:05:54.280> many<00:05:54.580> applications<00:05:54.699> and<00:05:55.599> it<00:05:56.080> is

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
so this has many applications and it is

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:03.060 
so this has many applications and it is
it<00:05:56.470> was<00:05:56.710> made<00:05:56.919> in<00:05:57.240> matlab<00:05:58.240> as<00:05:58.389> world<00:06:01.919> so<00:06:02.919> this

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
it was made in matlab as world so this

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.589 
it was made in matlab as world so this
is<00:06:03.190> my<00:06:03.310> arm<00:06:03.520> fully<00:06:03.820> extended<00:06:04.979> now<00:06:05.979> it's<00:06:06.190> not

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
is my arm fully extended now it's not

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.420 
is my arm fully extended now it's not
now<00:06:07.599> it's<00:06:07.780> fully<00:06:08.020> extended<00:06:09.360> open<00:06:10.360> gripper

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
now it's fully extended open gripper

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.870 
now it's fully extended open gripper

well gripper open gripper close it open

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:23.430 
well gripper open gripper close it open
close<00:06:17.610> move<00:06:18.610> this<00:06:19.590> elbow<00:06:21.960> move<00:06:22.960> it<00:06:23.080> move<00:06:23.380> the

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
close move this elbow move it move the

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:33.469 
close move this elbow move it move the
shoeld<00:06:23.800> shoulder<00:06:24.570> up<00:06:25.570> and<00:06:25.810> down

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.330 

as<00:06:34.479> energy<00:06:34.840> it<00:06:35.020> has<00:06:35.259> some<00:06:35.590> delays<00:06:35.919> because<00:06:36.099> of

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
as energy it has some delays because of

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.080 
as energy it has some delays because of
the<00:06:36.729> camera<00:06:37.090> acquisition<00:06:37.960> system<00:06:38.460> so<00:06:39.460> this<00:06:40.030> is

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
the camera acquisition system so this is

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.969 
the camera acquisition system so this is
the<00:06:40.300> anemic<00:06:40.599> mode<00:06:40.780> I<00:06:41.050> hope<00:06:41.500> you'll<00:06:41.620> like<00:06:41.770> it<00:06:41.830> so

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
the anemic mode I hope you'll like it so

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.680 
the anemic mode I hope you'll like it so
much<00:06:42.210> as<00:06:43.210> I<00:06:43.360> do
