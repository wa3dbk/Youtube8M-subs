00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that feels like like maybe a pattern

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
that feels like like maybe a pattern
that<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.360> might<00:01:15.630> play<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.350> drum<00:01:17.010> set<00:01:17.250> but

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that you might play on a drum set but

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.800 
that you might play on a drum set but
you're<00:01:17.760> looking<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.660> more<00:01:19.620> exotic<00:01:20.070> sound

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
you're looking for a more exotic sound

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.900 
you're looking for a more exotic sound
so<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> exercise<00:01:23.190> that<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> borrowed

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
so this is a exercise that I borrowed

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.780 
so this is a exercise that I borrowed
from<00:01:24.410> when<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:25.440> when<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:25.920> teaching<00:01:26.370> a<00:01:26.550> lot<00:01:26.700> of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
from when I when I was teaching a lot of

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.880 
from when I when I was teaching a lot of
drumset<00:01:27.270> students<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.200> uses<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.650> Ted

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
drumset students and it uses the Ted

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.730 
drumset students and it uses the Ted
Reed<00:01:29.130> book<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.180> happens<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.020> you're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
Reed book so what happens is you're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.120 
Reed book so what happens is you're
basically<00:01:32.190> going<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> play<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.750> line<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.680> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
basically going to play the line as a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.570 
basically going to play the line as a
low<00:01:35.460> doom<00:01:35.820> tone<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.630> always<00:01:36.930> play<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.800> pop<00:01:38.159> on

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
low doom tone but always play a pop on

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.610 
low doom tone but always play a pop on
two<00:01:38.760> and<00:01:38.940> four<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.210> you're<00:01:39.840> getting<00:01:40.140> always<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
two and four so you're getting always a

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.070 
two and four so you're getting always a
built-in<00:01:41.100> backbeat<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.420> took<00:01:42.600> number

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
built-in backbeat so if you took number

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:53.640 
built-in backbeat so if you took number
one<00:01:43.640> on<00:01:44.640> page<00:01:45.150> ten<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.720> would<00:01:45.810> have

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.990 

number<00:01:54.650> two<00:01:54.980> would<00:01:55.310> be<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.950> it's<00:02:01.130> only<00:02:01.370> two<00:02:01.760> you

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
number two would be so it's only two you

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.969 
number two would be so it's only two you
wouldn't<00:02:02.270> play<00:02:02.390> two<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:03.590> number<00:02:03.830> two

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
wouldn't play two and so number two

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:12.940 
wouldn't play two and so number two
again<00:02:04.310> would<00:02:04.490> be<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:11.350> if<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.440> take<00:02:12.650> number

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
again would be and if you take number

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.590 
again would be and if you take number
one<00:02:13.250> on<00:02:13.580> page<00:02:13.940> 30

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
one on page 30

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:25.330 
one on page 30
you'd<00:02:14.720> have<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:24.320> you'd<00:02:24.739> work<00:02:24.950> all<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.220> way

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
you'd have and you'd work all the way

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.070 
you'd have and you'd work all the way
through<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.000> then<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.180> get<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.420> page<00:02:26.600> 38

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
through that and then you get to page 38

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:50.410 
through that and then you get to page 38
and<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.560> have<00:02:27.709> something<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.100> this<00:02:28.430> now<00:02:49.420> you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
and you have something like this now you

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.120 
and you have something like this now you
need<00:02:50.660> something<00:02:51.050> for<00:02:51.200> your<00:02:51.260> left<00:02:51.530> hand<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.980> do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
need something for your left hand to do

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.610 
need something for your left hand to do
so<00:02:52.340> what<00:02:52.520> it's<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.000> do<00:02:53.270> is<00:02:53.510> fill<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
so what it's going to do is fill in the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.270 
so what it's going to do is fill in the
implied<00:02:55.070> cos<00:02:55.850> ound<00:02:56.680> whenever<00:02:57.680> there's<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.950> rest

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
implied cos ound whenever there's a rest

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.979 
implied cos ound whenever there's a rest
so<00:02:58.790> we're<00:02:58.940> going<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.150> get<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.299> little<00:02:59.510> heartbeat

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
so we're going to get a little heartbeat

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.090 
so we're going to get a little heartbeat
patter<00:03:00.260> here<00:03:00.940> we<00:03:01.940> go
