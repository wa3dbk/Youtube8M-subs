00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and what I really think about it overall

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.470 
and what I really think about it overall
and<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:35.520> first<00:00:35.700> thing<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.149> say<00:00:36.270> about

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and the first thing I have to say about

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.410 
and the first thing I have to say about
this<00:00:36.780> gun<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.980> bad<00:00:38.420> whatsoever

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
this gun is that it's not bad whatsoever

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.590 
this gun is that it's not bad whatsoever
this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.230> good<00:00:40.379> shotgun<00:00:41.070> uh<00:00:41.540> this<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this is a very good shotgun uh this is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.170 
this is a very good shotgun uh this is
actually<00:00:43.260> after<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.710> buff<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.640> everything

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
actually after the buff to everything

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.720 
actually after the buff to everything
except<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> striker<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:47.340> figured<00:00:47.700> since

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
except the striker and I figured since

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.959 
except the striker and I figured since
that<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.420> relatively<00:00:49.110> new<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:50.190> relatively<00:00:50.789> new

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
that was relatively new a relatively new

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
that was relatively new a relatively new
patch<00:00:51.239> I'd<00:00:51.510> talk<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.289> so

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
patch I'd talk about a little bit so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.630 
patch I'd talk about a little bit so
basically<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:55.170> decrease<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.160> stopping

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
basically you they decrease the stopping

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.139 
basically you they decrease the stopping
power<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> striker<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.379> something<00:00:58.800> like

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
power of the striker so something like

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
power of the striker so something like
six<00:01:00.149> pellets<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:01.050> shell<00:01:01.820> that<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> shoot<00:01:03.149> out

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
six pellets or shell that you shoot out

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.450 
six pellets or shell that you shoot out
and<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.750> buffed<00:01:04.199> everything<00:01:04.739> else<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.220> some

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and they buffed everything else to some

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.880 
and they buffed everything else to some
number<00:01:05.880> i<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.299> even<00:01:06.390> know<00:01:06.510> but<00:01:07.439> basically

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
number i don't even know but basically

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.080 
number i don't even know but basically
this<00:01:08.430> shotgun<00:01:08.790> has<00:01:09.360> about<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> same<00:01:10.820> power<00:01:11.820> as

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
this shotgun has about the same power as

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.960 
this shotgun has about the same power as
the<00:01:12.330> striker<00:01:12.979> but<00:01:13.979> what<00:01:14.280> sets<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the striker but what sets is going to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
the striker but what sets is going to
part<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> striker<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.170> shoots

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
part from the striker is that it shoots

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.120 
part from the striker is that it shoots
very<00:01:16.590> slowly<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.540> for<00:01:18.540> an<00:01:18.630> automatic<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.350> don't

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
very slowly and for an automatic I don't

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.980 
very slowly and for an automatic I don't
even<00:01:20.310> use<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.610> an<00:01:20.729> automatic<00:01:21.240> basis<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
even use it as an automatic basis in the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.219 
even use it as an automatic basis in the
semi-auto<00:01:22.490> that's<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> only<00:01:24.020> obviously<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
semi-auto that's the only obviously this

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.910 
semi-auto that's the only obviously this
gun<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:26.250> gun's<00:01:26.490> probably<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> be

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
gun is this gun's probably going to be

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.060 
gun is this gun's probably going to be
it's<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.130> good<00:01:29.400> tie<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.270> spaz<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
it's a good tie with the spaz for the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's a good tie with the spaz for the
best<00:01:32.310> shotgun<00:01:32.790> other<00:01:32.970> than<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> striker<00:01:33.890> but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
best shotgun other than the striker but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
best shotgun other than the striker but
the<00:01:35.549> fact<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:36.060> gun<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> miss<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> first

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
the fact this gun if you miss the first

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
the fact this gun if you miss the first
shot<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:37.920> basically<00:01:38.310> screwed

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
shot with it you're basically screwed

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.690 
shot with it you're basically screwed
because<00:01:39.450> uh<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.860> panic<00:01:41.220> nike

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because uh you know they can panic nike

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
because uh you know they can panic nike
they<00:01:41.790> will<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.030> whatever<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.619> with

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
they will do whatever this is with

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.210 
they will do whatever this is with
damage<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:45.270> basically<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:46.079> shotgun<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
damage and so basically the shotgun is a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.370 
damage and so basically the shotgun is a
very<00:01:47.490> consistent<00:01:48.180> one<00:01:48.360> shot<00:01:48.630> kill<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> very

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
very consistent one shot kill at a very

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.340 
very consistent one shot kill at a very
close<00:01:49.649> range<00:01:49.979> without<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:51.210> without<00:01:51.810> damage

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
close range without a without damage

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
close range without a without damage
which<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.310> i<00:01:53.340> find<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.210> problem

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
which is what i find to be the problem

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.090 
which is what i find to be the problem
with<00:01:54.689> most<00:01:54.840> shotguns<00:01:55.170> especially<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
with most shotguns especially with the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.690 
with most shotguns especially with the
KSG<00:01:56.430> where<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:58.100> basically<00:01:59.100> where<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
KSG where you have a basically where you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
KSG where you have a basically where you
can<00:01:59.909> get<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.119> hitmarker<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:01.350> point-blank

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
can get a hitmarker like point-blank
