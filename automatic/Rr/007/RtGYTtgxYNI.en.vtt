00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
the god mode glitch which trick sort of

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.660 
the god mode glitch which trick sort of
patched<00:00:44.080> but<00:00:44.620> now<00:00:44.770> it's<00:00:44.980> sort<00:00:45.190> of<00:00:45.280> unpatched

patched but now it's sort of unpatched

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.850 
patched but now it's sort of unpatched
it<00:00:46.300> works<00:00:46.570> about<00:00:46.809> fifty<00:00:47.200> percent<00:00:47.230> of<00:00:47.530> the<00:00:47.650> time

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
it works about fifty percent of the time

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.820 
it works about fifty percent of the time
but<00:00:48.580> when<00:00:48.760> it<00:00:48.879> does<00:00:49.000> work<00:00:49.270> ill<00:00:49.870> gate<00:00:50.170> the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
but when it does work ill gate the

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.700 
but when it does work ill gate the
glitch<00:00:51.309> done<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.420> pretty<00:00:52.600> cool<00:00:52.900> so<00:00:53.680> I

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
glitch done and it's pretty cool so I

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.560
