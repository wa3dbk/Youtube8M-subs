00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
that's it all of that rust yep and how

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.319 
that's it all of that rust yep and how
close<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.590> oil<00:04:17.799> on<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.190> oil<00:04:18.430> filter<00:04:18.729> the

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
close to the oil on the oil filter the

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.849 
close to the oil on the oil filter the
oil<00:04:19.540> filters<00:04:19.930> right<00:04:20.109> there<00:04:20.290> any<00:04:20.440> oil<00:04:20.680> drain

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.980 
oil filters right there any oil drain
plugs<00:04:21.160> right<00:04:21.370> there<00:04:21.579> so<00:04:21.850> it's<00:04:22.180> level<00:04:22.930> of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
plugs right there so it's level of

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.930 
plugs right there so it's level of
interest<00:04:23.229> yeah<00:04:23.620> if<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.340> were<00:04:24.460> doing<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.729> tire

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
interest yeah if I were doing a tire

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.270 
interest yeah if I were doing a tire
rotation<00:04:25.479> right<00:04:25.840> right<00:04:26.500> next<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:26.949> it<00:04:27.070> or

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
rotation right right next to it or

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.950 
rotation right right next to it or
anything<00:04:27.639> on<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:27.970> front<00:04:28.120> end<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:28.510> right<00:04:28.720> side
