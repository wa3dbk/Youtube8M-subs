00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.280
 joke but otherwise I would like 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.220
 power means I like the smell of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.660

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.370
 I think it's still a bit 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.120
 complicated I'm afraid to ridicule myself in 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.120
 losing the game 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.269

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.750
 confirmation that these stuff will be 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.750
 destructible 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.020

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.590
 I shot on the wrong side 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.010
