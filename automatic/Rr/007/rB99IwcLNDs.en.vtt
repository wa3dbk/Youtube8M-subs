absorption and there's two ways to set
this<00:03:30.900> up<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.139> that<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:31.590> can<00:03:31.769> either<00:03:31.949> absorb

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
this up so that it can either absorb

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.729 
this up so that it can either absorb
shock<00:03:32.819> or<00:03:33.000> not<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.480> here's<00:03:34.199> this<00:03:34.349> combined

it<00:03:43.440> slows<00:03:43.650> down<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:44.069> get<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.370> bike<00:03:44.669> tip<00:03:44.940> now

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
it slows down you get this bike tip now

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.990 
it slows down you get this bike tip now

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
how far can to cart when we take this I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.399 
how far can to cart when we take this I
don't<00:03:48.269> know<00:03:48.389> they're<00:03:48.870> all<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.169> to<00:03:49.229> have<00:03:49.290> to

don't know they're all going to have to

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.580 
don't know they're all going to have to

be some kind of whole flat tip in order

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.409 
be some kind of whole flat tip in order
to<00:03:52.709> allow<00:03:52.949> this<00:03:53.190> gimmick<00:03:53.579> of<00:03:53.729> the<00:03:53.909> other<00:03:54.060> tip

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
to allow this gimmick of the other tip

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.180

making<00:03:56.370> them<00:03:56.519> like<00:03:56.669> this<00:03:56.819> or<00:03:57.000> they've<00:03:57.180> come<00:03:57.479> up

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
making them like this or they've come up

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.390 
making them like this or they've come up
with<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.780> new<00:03:58.260> gimmick<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.739> don't<00:03:59.069> know

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
with a new gimmick I don't know

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.399 
with a new gimmick I don't know
and<00:03:59.519> now<00:03:59.970> two<00:04:00.030> ways<00:04:00.419> to<00:04:00.599> set<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.959> up<00:04:01.109> but<00:04:01.319> it's

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
and now two ways to set this up but it's

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.349 
and now two ways to set this up but it's
not<00:04:01.530> nearly<00:04:02.159> as<00:04:02.310> complicated<00:04:02.639> as<00:04:02.970> BIGBANG

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
not nearly as complicated as BIGBANG

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.080 
not nearly as complicated as BIGBANG
Pegasus<00:04:03.900> attack<00:04:04.650> mode<00:04:04.919> notice<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.669> rubber<00:04:05.909> is

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
Pegasus attack mode notice the rubber is

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.300 
Pegasus attack mode notice the rubber is
pretty<00:04:06.329> much<00:04:06.449> all<00:04:06.750> covered<00:04:07.169> up<00:04:07.319> nothing<00:04:08.280> but

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
pretty much all covered up nothing but

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.189 
pretty much all covered up nothing but
metal<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.940> contact<00:04:09.449> and<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.690> little<00:04:09.930> bit<00:04:10.049> of

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
metal the contact and a little bit of

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.349 
metal the contact and a little bit of
plastic<00:04:10.500> right<00:04:10.919> here<00:04:11.099> on<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.280> edges<00:04:11.579> on<00:04:11.729> this

plastic right here on the edges on this
knotch

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
knotch

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.370 
knotch
that's<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.919> attack<00:04:14.190> mode<00:04:14.629> one<00:04:15.629> solid<00:04:16.079> metal

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
that's the attack mode one solid metal

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.960 
that's the attack mode one solid metal
part<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.859> then<00:04:17.159> the<00:04:17.250> other<00:04:17.370> way<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.609> can<00:04:17.760> set

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
part and then the other way you can set

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.149 
part and then the other way you can set
this<00:04:18.090> up<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.510> would<00:04:18.810> be<00:04:18.840> called<00:04:19.440> absorb<00:04:19.889> mode

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
this up it would be called absorb mode

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.069 
this up it would be called absorb mode
so<00:04:21.030> people<00:04:21.269> like<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.479> call<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.779> spin

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
so people like to call this spin

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.110 
so people like to call this spin
stealing<00:04:22.500> or<00:04:22.710> what<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.370> does<00:04:23.580> is<00:04:23.880> basically

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
stealing or what it does is basically

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.330 
stealing or what it does is basically
absorbing<00:04:24.810> shock<00:04:25.080> from<00:04:25.349> the<00:04:25.380> other<00:04:25.590> Bay

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
absorbing shock from the other Bay

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.490 
absorbing shock from the other Bay
with<00:04:26.610> these<00:04:26.790> rubber<00:04:27.000> exposed<00:04:27.720> rubber<00:04:28.080> parts

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
with these rubber exposed rubber parts

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.629 
with these rubber exposed rubber parts
and<00:04:30.740> leeches<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.770> spin<00:04:32.160> power

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
and leeches the spin power

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.730 
and leeches the spin power
what<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.720> got<00:04:33.840> continued<00:04:34.260> though<00:04:34.410> is<00:04:34.710> that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
what you got continued though is that

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.280 
what you got continued though is that
this<00:04:35.040> is<00:04:35.100> such<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> thick<00:04:35.880> beyblade<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.990> may

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
this is such a thick beyblade this may

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.830 
this is such a thick beyblade this may
be<00:04:37.530> susceptible<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:38.190> attacks<00:04:38.970> from<00:04:39.330> Bey's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
be susceptible to attacks from Bey's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.379 
be susceptible to attacks from Bey's
that<00:04:40.200> have<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> nice<00:04:40.860> low<00:04:41.370> center<00:04:42.300> of<00:04:42.330> gravity

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
that have a nice low center of gravity

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.230 
that have a nice low center of gravity
and<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:43.139> uppercut<00:04:43.560> type<00:04:43.770> attack<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.430> would

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
and the uppercut type attack I would

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.570 
and the uppercut type attack I would
think<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.720> using<00:04:46.380> my<00:04:46.500> precision<00:04:46.889> scientific

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
think and using my precision scientific

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.850 
think and using my precision scientific
caliper<00:04:47.940> as<00:04:48.030> you<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.270> see<00:04:48.419> that<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.900> width

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
caliper as you can see that the width

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.270 
caliper as you can see that the width
from<00:04:50.220> top<00:04:50.820> to<00:04:51.060> tip<00:04:51.240> is<00:04:51.480> 28.4<00:04:52.080> three<00:04:52.740> millimeter

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
from top to tip is 28.4 three millimeter

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.310 
from top to tip is 28.4 three millimeter
now<00:04:53.669> for<00:04:53.940> comparison<00:04:54.120> my<00:04:54.600> dark<00:04:54.870> wolf<00:04:55.110> is

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
now for comparison my dark wolf is

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.530 
now for comparison my dark wolf is
twenty<00:04:56.010> six<00:04:56.190> point<00:04:56.400> seven<00:04:56.580> nine<00:04:56.730> millimeters

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
twenty six point seven nine millimeters

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.960 
twenty six point seven nine millimeters
and<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:58.590> think<00:04:59.010> you<00:04:59.100> could<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.790> could

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
and I think you could you could

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.140 
and I think you could you could
configure<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.690> shorter<00:05:01.440> Bay<00:05:01.650> if<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.160> tried<00:05:02.490> so

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
configure a shorter Bay if you tried so

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.850 
configure a shorter Bay if you tried so
I'm<00:05:03.479> suggesting<00:05:03.780> that<00:05:04.820> this<00:05:06.320> beyblade<00:05:07.320> may<00:05:07.800> be

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
I'm suggesting that this beyblade may be

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.879 
I'm suggesting that this beyblade may be
viable<00:05:08.250> l-drago<00:05:08.850> may<00:05:09.120> be<00:05:09.180> vulnerable<00:05:09.630> to

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
viable l-drago may be vulnerable to

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.960 
viable l-drago may be vulnerable to
shorter<00:05:10.889> beyblades<00:05:11.310> with<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.580> uppercut

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
shorter beyblades with the uppercut

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:21.839 
shorter beyblades with the uppercut
attack

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.100 

you
