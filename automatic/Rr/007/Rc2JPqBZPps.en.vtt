00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
right there you can see how biggie is

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.390 
right there you can see how biggie is
compared<00:03:32.949> to<00:03:33.120> ultimate<00:03:34.120> cap<00:03:34.359> very<00:03:35.199> cool<00:03:35.470> so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
compared to ultimate cap very cool so

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.339 
compared to ultimate cap very cool so
it's<00:03:36.519> getting<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.790> this<00:03:36.910> figure<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:38.169> for

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
it's getting to this figure so for

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.159 
it's getting to this figure so for
articulation<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:40.269> head<00:03:40.480> does<00:03:40.720> move<00:03:40.900> side<00:03:41.139> to

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169 
articulation the head does move side to

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.770 
articulation the head does move side to
side<00:03:41.349> a<00:03:41.949> little<00:03:42.519> bit<00:03:42.639> up<00:03:42.940> and<00:03:43.060> down<00:03:43.180> I<00:03:43.329> believe

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
side a little bit up and down I believe

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.050 
side a little bit up and down I believe
you<00:03:43.870> can<00:03:44.049> pop<00:03:44.889> it<00:03:45.069> off<00:03:45.160> if<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.430> want<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.879> or

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
you can pop it off if you want to or

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.059 
you can pop it off if you want to or
maybe<00:03:46.269> not<00:03:46.419> don't<00:03:46.599> try<00:03:46.840> don't<00:03:47.440> try<00:03:47.620> popping<00:03:47.980> it

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
maybe not don't try don't try popping it

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.030 
maybe not don't try don't try popping it
off<00:03:48.190> I'm<00:03:48.639> not<00:03:48.849> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.060> try<00:03:49.410> this<00:03:50.410> vest<00:03:50.829> is

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
off I'm not going to try this vest is

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.000 
off I'm not going to try this vest is
one<00:03:51.370> molded<00:03:51.879> piece<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.780> take<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.709> off

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
one molded piece you can take it off

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.949 
one molded piece you can take it off
right<00:03:54.669> here<00:03:54.970> as<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.209> see<00:03:55.569> there's<00:03:55.870> a

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
right here as you can see there's a

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.479 
right here as you can see there's a
little<00:03:56.109> I<00:03:56.349> can't<00:03:56.739> even<00:03:56.799> get<00:03:57.040> these<00:03:57.190> things

little I can't even get these things

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.720 
little I can't even get these things
back<00:03:57.699> in<00:03:58.269> that's<00:03:59.230> how<00:03:59.500> like<00:03:59.769> tight<00:04:00.069> this<00:04:00.400> vest

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
back in that's how like tight this vest

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.490 
back in that's how like tight this vest
is<00:04:00.849> on<00:04:01.030> them<00:04:01.180> but<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.900> can<00:04:02.049> see<00:04:02.260> underneath

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
is on them but you can see underneath

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.099 
is on them but you can see underneath
there<00:04:02.949> he<00:04:03.099> does<00:04:03.310> have<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:04.780> know<00:04:05.340> abdomen

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
there he does have you know abdomen

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.449 
there he does have you know abdomen
articulation<00:04:08.109> or<00:04:08.349> chest<00:04:08.590> articulation<00:04:09.250> as<00:04:09.340> i

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
articulation or chest articulation as i

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.819 
articulation or chest articulation as i
call<00:04:09.669> it<00:04:09.729> so<00:04:10.510> that<00:04:10.690> allows<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.139> full<00:04:11.500> range<00:04:11.650> of

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
call it so that allows a full range of

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.770 
call it so that allows a full range of
motion<00:04:11.940> no<00:04:12.940> waste<00:04:13.209> articulation<00:04:14.049> now

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
motion no waste articulation now

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.680 
motion no waste articulation now
so<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.530> kind<00:04:15.740> of<00:04:15.830> sucks<00:04:16.100> but<00:04:16.340> it's<00:04:16.910> cool<00:04:17.239> i'm

so that kind of sucks but it's cool i'm
not<00:04:18.019> i'm<00:04:18.260> not<00:04:18.340> sweating<00:04:19.340> too<00:04:19.609> much<00:04:19.639> over<00:04:20.000> that

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
not i'm not sweating too much over that

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.960 
not i'm not sweating too much over that

and turns 360 degrees and there's one

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.879 
and turns 360 degrees and there's one
piece<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.419> articulation<00:04:36.200> at<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.440> top<00:04:36.650> where

the shoulder is which goes up and down
front<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.470> back<00:04:39.650> full<00:04:40.340> range<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.669> motion

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
front and back full range of motion

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.600 
front and back full range of motion
right<00:04:41.150> there<00:04:41.620> for<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.710> wrist<00:04:42.919> it<00:04:43.100> does<00:04:43.280> turn

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
right there for the wrist it does turn

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.440 
right there for the wrist it does turn
360<00:04:44.600> degrees<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.470> there's<00:04:46.310> no<00:04:46.520> extra<00:04:47.120> sets<00:04:47.330> of

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
360 degrees and there's no extra sets of

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.690 
360 degrees and there's no extra sets of
hands<00:04:47.690> they<00:04:47.930> haven't<00:04:48.230> really<00:04:48.350> even<00:04:48.590> dwelt<00:04:49.490> in

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
hands they haven't really even dwelt in

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.030 
hands they haven't really even dwelt in
it<00:04:49.970> dwelled<00:04:50.419> into<00:04:50.600> that<00:04:50.870> yet<00:04:51.230> for<00:04:51.560> three<00:04:51.950> and

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
it dwelled into that yet for three and

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.440 
it dwelled into that yet for three and
three-quarter<00:04:52.460> inch<00:04:52.580> figures<00:04:52.940> probably

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
three-quarter inch figures probably

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.930 
three-quarter inch figures probably
because<00:04:53.600> they're<00:04:53.750> too<00:04:53.900> small<00:04:54.280> yeah<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.760> can

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
because they're too small yeah you can

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.430 
because they're too small yeah you can
see<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.270> cup<00:04:56.510> if<00:04:56.660> you<00:04:56.780> can<00:04:56.960> kind<00:04:57.110> of<00:04:57.140> see<00:04:57.290> the

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
see the cup if you can kind of see the

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.350 
see the cup if you can kind of see the
color<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.740> his<00:04:57.860> vest<00:04:58.340> is<00:04:58.520> kind<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.820> a<00:04:58.850> charcoal

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
color of his vest is kind of a charcoal

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.130 
color of his vest is kind of a charcoal
gray<00:05:00.220> it's<00:05:01.220> really<00:05:01.460> cool<00:05:01.610> I<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:02.060> it<00:05:02.240> then<00:05:03.050> we

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
gray it's really cool I like it then we

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.230 
gray it's really cool I like it then we
go<00:05:03.320> down<00:05:03.530> into<00:05:03.770> his<00:05:03.950> legs<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.520> I<00:05:04.580> hate<00:05:04.970> these

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
go down into his legs and I hate these

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.600 
go down into his legs and I hate these
hip<00:05:06.140> joints<00:05:06.530> these<00:05:06.650> are<00:05:06.770> just<00:05:06.890> terrible<00:05:07.280> I

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
hip joints these are just terrible I

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.600 
hip joints these are just terrible I
think<00:05:07.850> it's<00:05:08.630> two<00:05:09.169> pieces<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.860> got<00:05:10.040> one<00:05:10.370> piece

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
think it's two pieces you got one piece

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.120 
think it's two pieces you got one piece
right<00:05:10.850> there<00:05:10.880> does<00:05:11.300> 360<00:05:12.080> degrees<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.620> then

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
right there does 360 degrees and then

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.980 
right there does 360 degrees and then
you<00:05:13.190> got<00:05:13.310> another<00:05:13.550> piece<00:05:13.820> which<00:05:14.000> goes<00:05:14.300> kind<00:05:14.780> of

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
you got another piece which goes kind of

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.340 
you got another piece which goes kind of
up<00:05:15.200> and<00:05:15.440> down<00:05:15.680> not<00:05:16.040> really<00:05:16.820> and<00:05:17.419> it<00:05:18.110> doesn't

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
up and down not really and it doesn't

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.110 
up and down not really and it doesn't
really<00:05:18.590> go<00:05:18.800> forward<00:05:19.340> and<00:05:19.430> back<00:05:19.640> too<00:05:19.940> much

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
really go forward and back too much

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.580
