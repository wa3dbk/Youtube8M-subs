00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.390
 hi very good people all here 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.849
 fermin in a new video and good then 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.129
 I bring you a series that comes from me 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.039
 old channel which I closed good 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.470
 history that I already care very little and 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.109
 that we have and we have the steel dollars 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.869
 the series that I started my old channel a 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.119
 series that only has one chapter since 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.449
 the sons of bitches of the haters do not 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.859
 They gave time to do more and what is the 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.210
 series series will see as a 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.410
 kind of road to color is what happens 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.900
 that I have put it to zero dollars 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.700
 basically because I wanted to give it a 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.920
 original name not always road to glory 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.680
 as most people put me 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.120
 would like to give it an original name other 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.150
 kind of name and well I will inherit the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.310
 name of my old channel 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.680
 to 0 hours because because we are not going to use 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.760
 no outside help or new 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.400
 it means points or coins or I want to 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.250
 coins or anything or we pay the 70 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.100
 euros of the game 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.680
 we understand the ultimate and it gives us in the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.300
 fucking team of bronze and with the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.180
 coins that we are winning played 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.479
 playing seasons online we're going 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.890
 improving the team little by little and of course 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.660
 we have to try to get the first 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.720
 division in my case you already know that it is a 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.760
 very lame and I will not even get to 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.200
 my main account where I have legend 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.170
 the best equipment and so on 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.360
 I'm in the sixth division and I'm not going to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.870
 come with that team or I do not think 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.460
 that comes to this division 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.980
 on board the club since it is in the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.120
 account charged for something else in name 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the club to make the dollars already 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.710
 you know and well let's give it the ultimate 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.500
 and see the presentation they make us 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.230
 etc 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.850
 I have said the thing about that of no 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.020
 spending money is like a person 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.380
 normal that you do not have resources for 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.420
 being money will use the ultimate 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.890
 team here we start if we have not choose 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.159
 a player 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:04.490
 we have started to admit this 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.860
 very heavy introduction here we have the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.929
 initial team that is not in bronze and 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.929
 I am going to jump 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.950
 garzon israel velasco phillips 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.670
 in the formation I used the 404 n in 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:32.060
 this error and my idea is to do it from the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.230
 forward link or the Liga or what 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.670
 I'm going to ask in this video is that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.940
 you leave me in the comments of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.530
 linking I do if La Liga 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.110
 the barclays premier league of the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.930
 bundesliga my opinion the best that what 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.570
 the best I can see is doing it in the bbva league 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.460
 or as much of the league forward as 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.560
 are not very good players are very 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.599
 cheap 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.760
 I do not know, you will tell me yours 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.069
 your ideas I'm going to sisters and a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.110
 poquillo the team and now we come good 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.380
 people because we already have the team formed 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.410
 we have been half good at least 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.640
 we have an acceptable defense since 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.099
 we have the right lateral side 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.660
 left that is very difficult I assure you 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.819
 get a lateral left lateral 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.660
 good right of penalties we have one of the 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.060
 league of the villarreal that is called israel 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.880
 it's normal and you're here by 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.440
 ortiz of the league forward 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.819
 these also normalistas we have to 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.670
 right side from the left with 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.319
 very good thing we have only goalkeeper 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.319
 goalkeeper who has come back burini 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.660
 of Saudi Arabia- we have the midfielder 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.190
 1 we have a defensive midfielder and not 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.260
 we have to convert to see what 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.780
 know where we have to convert 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.610
 we have shape and other extreme right 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.140
 we have to be routes of which I have very 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.870
 good references by friends but not 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.489
 just to start et cetera and well no 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.080
 it's bad after neighborhoods too 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.030
 I have very good references 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.330
 but I have nothing and we also have 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.570
 we have this extreme but it is that 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.150
 we do not have anyone to access I do not 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.310
 Like it seemed better to put this 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.220
 d 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.500
 of offensive midfielder and I do not know if 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.080
 we would have formed the team be 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.690
 is for this video to be like 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.090
 introduction to the guards in the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.060
 next game we will do half of 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:24.290
 ninth division and we will continue to 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.880
 continue 0 coins start here this 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.070
 it costs money people do not I have been 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.370
 got nothing we have here the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.340
 assignment of players to see what's still here 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.889
 I'm going to sing what I can be talking about 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.720
 I 'm not watching because I'm short 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.180
 is going because it's worth for the 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.490
 players on loan from which it is clear 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:49.020
 what extremes I do not know five games four 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.220
 I'm going to take neymar 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.169
 I'm going to catch the neymar juniors 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.800
 I guess we have five parties 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.800
 I will not use it 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:06.270
 for now I will not use it 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.270
 and my club's mouth is also played 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.730
 and gave me the chalet and here seeks to give 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.130
 here is to see or well animal is not 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.740
 forget to use for now for now do not 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.450
 I will use when I need it more in a 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.490
 division a little more advanced as can 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.740
 be or seventh cap maybe I'll use it 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.150
 but for now I'm not going to use it and well 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.490
 the template has remained as 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.590
 we are seeing the name of the club we are going 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.230
 to name our club to 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.300

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.710
 tasks so that they give us what is the 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.420
 about free where you can not leave a 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.200
 big player in front of capitals and put him 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.200
 to 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.420
 but 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.420
 when
