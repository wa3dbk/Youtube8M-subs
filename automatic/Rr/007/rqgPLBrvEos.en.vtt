00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.120
 just finished training with 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.440
 michael belly let's do one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.969
 chat about what it is 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.030
 the experience of withdrawal with the first one 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.330
 team is going great I would say yes 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.460
 is going well at the beginning I was very 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 excited to be here in retreat is a 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.550
 dream come true toe let's say mass there 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 we work so much since we are 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.599
 even smaller we have to work of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.040
 more than the others to prove are 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.850
 so many great champions and we have to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
 learn from them 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.719
 you expected the coach to do it for you 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.270
 called to be aggregated to the group 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.969
 at first not as I expected then 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 when I arrived the call was 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.280
 proud very happy and nothing now 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.170
 I'm here I'm happy 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.629
 the excitement of the past is almost complete 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.430
 at the end of the withdrawal, therefore, that la 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 we can leave aside whoever did it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.420
 important in these days I know that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.780
 jonathan has adopted you a little because 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.229
 also through public messages has 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.299
 let it be known that they were very close 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.880
 Jonathan is like my brother 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.460
 here we are always together in the evening at 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 morning and as if I were his brother more 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.150
 small now now as soon as we return to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 milano I also go with him there 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.119
 I stay at his adopted house that is not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.420
 which one says I rely on a big why 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.369
 I also want to learn why it is not the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 my role however I learn in the evening there 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.360
 let's give you so much advice on 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.400
 what needs to improve on how I should 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.369
 to act on the attitude in the field 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.320
 no no it really is a very good one 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.240
 great person a great champion a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.159
 about your role for the few 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.020
 who still do n't know you well how 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.119
 you would present yourself with the features 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.210
 I recommend not to miss the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 description then predominantly 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.630
 second point behind the tips 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.520
 if I can even play outside 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
 left to right then the coach decides 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.560
 where I have to play, I like it so much 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.960
 driblare come into the field 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.799
 I have to improve a lot in the shot that is 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.509
 pull in the door and that 's it 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.879
