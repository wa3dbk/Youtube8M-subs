00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.320
 well how are you welcome to another 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.060
 tutorial by leonard velarde and good 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.290
 this time we're going to make a watch type 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.400
 for a news something then then for the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.400
 Let's see how style is here 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.239
 well more or less you see that as 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.250
 we were spending time we are in 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.730
 real time here you can see it are 7 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.730
 seconds 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.379
 Four. Five 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.510
 and we can see here, if we see the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.390
 course the time we position it in zero 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.240
 and we can move up to 30 and we're going to 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.990
 mark the 30 seconds okay this is a 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.380
 pretty simple effect to do is 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.320
 relatively simple and first let's 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.259
 create new composition and we 're going to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.479
 new layer and we generate a solid of 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.280
 color that does not matter at the moment 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.190
 let's find the numbers effect 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.680
 numbers 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.920
 let's apply well here if we get 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.510
 a window we can edit the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.990
 properties of our watch we can 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.990
 put him 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.020
 and for another style 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.619
 you can put your hand 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.619
 I know my voice 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 no better in extra voice and alignment 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.650
 doing what we want to the right 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.690
 well in the horizontal direction or 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.050
 vertical in this case is to work with 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.240
 horizontal we accept and generate something 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.610
 like that if we go to the biggest 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.789
 so that it can be better appreciated here in 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.900
 size we do enough 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.840
 well here in type let's put that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.870
 mark us time automatically goes 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.430
 to put these three of these columns very 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.010
 typical d 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.799
 of time the clock and this 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.939
 here we must have a composition I have 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.310
 the composition and 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.560
 a time in frames I do not think we 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.690
 serve well is that it is configured in 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.120
 weather 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.849
 First we are going to 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.250
 go to positions to position it in a 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.910
 part here more or less 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.910
 it's okay 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.989
 well position ourselves we position our 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.800
 composition in zero here we can see 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.500
 is completely zero and we're going 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.590
 alignment pleasure value we put 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.599
 keyframe and values at zero 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.970
 we move to the last point of 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:12.700
 our composition that here would be 30 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.050
 seconds and we're going to put value on it 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.440
 exploitation is displaces alignment 30 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.330
 seconds 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.930
 and we can see that 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.500
 and even our watch is very basic 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.500
 simple 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.590
 As you can see it is quite easy this 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.629
 effect 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.840
 let's do it in any conclusion 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.879
 a composition of one hour 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.660
 here we are exactly six seconds and 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.380
 here we mark 6 seconds 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.600
 this effect is very good and well here 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.400
 we can go to options and go back to 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.100
 edit our font if we do not like it 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.770
 this source or mark the alignment to 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.720
 center for example here to be able to see 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.720
 and in position we move 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.890
 and it is very very easy to be this effect 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.370
 I hope you liked this guy 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.450
 tutorial and until the next one says goodbye 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.450
