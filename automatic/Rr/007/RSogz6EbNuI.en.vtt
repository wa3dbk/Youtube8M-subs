blocks and opaque blocks I hope it blows
that<00:02:28.520> right<00:02:29.050> blocks<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.290> don't<00:02:30.560> transmit

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
that right blocks that don't transmit

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.000 
that right blocks that don't transmit
electricity<00:02:31.820> anyway<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.890> problem<00:02:33.890> with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
electricity anyway and problem with

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.920 
electricity anyway and problem with
those<00:02:34.130> were<00:02:34.490> this<00:02:34.760> there's<00:02:35.240> just<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.570> many<00:02:35.780> of

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
those were this there's just so many of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.260 
those were this there's just so many of
them<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.860> have<00:02:36.980> glass<00:02:37.310> block<00:02:37.700> or<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
them but you have glass block or you can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.840 
them but you have glass block or you can
use<00:02:38.300> stairs<00:02:38.930> or<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.250> use<00:02:40.370> them

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
use stairs or you can just use them

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.020 
use stairs or you can just use them
wouldn't<00:02:41.660> slaps<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.290> thought<00:02:43.280> well<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.000> know

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
wouldn't slaps I thought well you know

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.900 
wouldn't slaps I thought well you know
what<00:02:44.420> it<00:02:44.630> would<00:02:44.720> be<00:02:44.900> good<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.380> unique

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
what it would be good to have a unique

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.940 
what it would be good to have a unique
unique<00:02:46.910> money<00:02:47.690> where<00:02:47.989> you<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.200> only<00:02:48.470> use<00:02:48.680> one

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
unique money where you can only use one

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.790 
unique money where you can only use one
type<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.730> thing<00:02:50.239> my<00:02:51.020> original<00:02:51.500> thought<00:02:51.770> was

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
type of thing my original thought was

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.990 
type of thing my original thought was
using<00:02:52.489> or<00:02:52.640> but<00:02:53.890> now<00:02:54.890> I've<00:02:55.250> been<00:02:55.550> stuck<00:02:55.820> with

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
using or but now I've been stuck with

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.870 
using or but now I've been stuck with
pistons<00:02:56.390> but<00:02:56.660> as<00:02:56.780> pistons<00:02:57.550> can<00:02:58.550> have

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
pistons but as pistons can have

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.190 
pistons but as pistons can have
orientation<00:02:59.360> as<00:03:00.050> well<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.700> makes<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.750> much

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
orientation as well so it makes it much

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.680 
orientation as well so it makes it much
easier<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:04.100> make<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:07.239> make<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.270> vending<00:03:08.660> machine

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
easier to make a make a vending machine

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.040 
easier to make a make a vending machine
and<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.790> got<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.120> idea<00:03:11.300> from<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:14.180> video<00:03:14.750> by

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
and and I got this idea from a video by

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.440 
and and I got this idea from a video by
seth<00:03:15.350> bling<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.700> i'll<00:03:17.000> put<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:17.390> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
seth bling and i'll put that in the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.770 
seth bling and i'll put that in the
description<00:03:18.459> now<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.520> little<00:03:19.880> thing<00:03:20.570> about

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
description now the little thing about

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.140 
description now the little thing about
these<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.110> they<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.190> be<00:03:22.340> normal<00:03:22.970> pistons

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
these is they have to be normal pistons

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.560 
these is they have to be normal pistons
they<00:03:23.780> can't<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.440> sticky<00:03:25.040> pistons<00:03:25.520> if<00:03:26.300> they're

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
they can't be sticky pistons if they're

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.930 
they can't be sticky pistons if they're
sticky<00:03:26.900> pistons<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.739> will<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.250> mess<00:03:28.760> the

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
sticky pistons it will just mess the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.470 
sticky pistons it will just mess the
whole<00:03:28.970> thing<00:03:29.120> up<00:03:29.420> basically<00:03:31.180> actually<00:03:32.180> no<00:03:32.300> we

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
whole thing up basically actually no we

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.350 
whole thing up basically actually no we
won't<00:03:32.630> do<00:03:32.959> anything<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:33.770> will<00:03:33.830> just<00:03:34.360> fail

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
won't do anything it will just fail

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.170 
won't do anything it will just fail
miserably<00:03:36.520> but<00:03:37.520> anyway<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.830> here<00:03:40.609> says<00:03:40.880> push

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
miserably but anyway so here says push

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.690 
miserably but anyway so here says push
before<00:03:41.390> order<00:03:41.930> twice<00:03:42.260> with<00:03:42.769> Sam<00:03:43.070> recognition

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
before order twice with Sam recognition

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.270 
before order twice with Sam recognition
so<00:03:44.600> basically<00:03:45.019> we<00:03:45.140> press<00:03:45.440> this

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
so basically we press this

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.470 
so basically we press this
and<00:03:47.280> then<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:47.880> hear<00:03:48.090> all<00:03:48.270> the<00:03:48.300> Pistons<00:03:48.870> going

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
and then we hear all the Pistons going

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.339 
and then we hear all the Pistons going
and<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:51.660> just<00:03:51.870> watch<00:03:52.050> this<00:03:52.349> light<00:03:56.930> and<00:03:57.930> it's

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
and we just watch this light and it's

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:10.729 
and we just watch this light and it's
not<00:03:58.500> on<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.310> we<00:03:59.430> press<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.819> again<00:04:08.510> haha<00:04:09.650> here<00:04:10.650> we

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
not on so we press it again haha here we

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.620 
not on so we press it again haha here we
go<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:12.450> our<00:04:13.050> payment<00:04:13.650> has<00:04:13.800> been<00:04:13.830> received

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
go so our payment has been received

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.789 
go so our payment has been received
because<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.959> light<00:04:16.230> is<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:17.540> so<00:04:18.540> now<00:04:18.780> we<00:04:19.590> come

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
because the light is on so now we come

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.909 
because the light is on so now we come
over<00:04:19.829> here<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.700> we<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.630> our<00:04:21.989> Apple<00:04:22.500> now<00:04:22.860> the

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
over here and we get our Apple now the

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.170 
over here and we get our Apple now the
reason<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:24.210> only<00:04:24.389> used<00:04:24.690> apples<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:26.180> rather

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
reason I have only used apples is rather

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.490 
reason I have only used apples is rather
simple<00:04:27.540> one<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.810> just<00:04:28.110> didn't<00:04:28.290> want<00:04:28.410> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
simple one I just didn't want the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.129 
simple one I just didn't want the
circuitry<00:04:28.979> to<00:04:29.070> be<00:04:29.600> really<00:04:30.600> really<00:04:30.630> really

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
circuitry to be really really really

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:38.450 
circuitry to be really really really
compliant<00:04:31.800> complex<00:04:32.580> sorry<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:35.600> basically<00:04:37.460> in

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
compliant complex sorry and basically in

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.950 
compliant complex sorry and basically in
my<00:04:38.820> real<00:04:39.180> version<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.840> my<00:04:40.250> mark<00:04:41.250> three<00:04:41.960> vending

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
my real version of my mark three vending

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.530 
my real version of my mark three vending
machine<00:04:43.290> I'm<00:04:43.530> planning<00:04:44.070> on<00:04:44.160> having<00:04:44.540> apple

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
machine I'm planning on having apple

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.290 
machine I'm planning on having apple
apples<00:04:46.200> and<00:04:46.560> basically<00:04:47.010> every<00:04:47.520> item<00:04:47.790> in<00:04:48.150> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
apples and basically every item in the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.170 
apples and basically every item in the
game<00:04:48.740> except<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:49.830> maps<00:04:50.190> because<00:04:50.640> you<00:04:51.090> would

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
game except for maps because you would

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.909 
game except for maps because you would
just<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.450> a<00:04:51.510> load<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.720> map<00:04:52.020> zeros<00:04:52.470> and<00:04:52.740> that

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
just get a load of map zeros and that

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.050 
just get a load of map zeros and that
would<00:04:53.039> just<00:04:53.190> be<00:04:53.250> you<00:04:53.520> know<00:04:54.380> ridiculously<00:04:56.060> what

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
would just be you know ridiculously what

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.560 
would just be you know ridiculously what
rubbish<00:04:57.300> basically<00:04:58.140> so<00:04:59.010> anyway<00:04:59.310> we<00:05:00.030> hit<00:05:00.419> the

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
rubbish basically so anyway we hit the

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.230 
rubbish basically so anyway we hit the
get<00:05:00.780> apples<00:05:01.169> button<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:02.310> we<00:05:02.400> get<00:05:02.580> one<00:05:02.760> apple

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
get apples button and we get one apple

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.779 
get apples button and we get one apple
and<00:05:03.479> we<00:05:03.660> have<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.870> chance<00:05:04.289> of<00:05:04.680> getting<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:05.160> golden

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
and we have a chance of getting a golden

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.290 
and we have a chance of getting a golden
apple<00:05:05.910> but<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:07.050> seems<00:05:07.500> that<00:05:07.890> we've<00:05:08.850> only<00:05:09.000> got<00:05:09.270> a

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
apple but it seems that we've only got a

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.130 
apple but it seems that we've only got a
red<00:05:09.750> apple<00:05:09.960> for<00:05:10.500> now<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:11.220> we<00:05:12.150> can<00:05:12.330> eat<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.780> nom

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
red apple for now so we can eat that nom

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.180 
red apple for now so we can eat that nom
nom<00:05:13.350> nom<00:05:13.380> if<00:05:13.979> we<00:05:14.750> were<00:05:15.750> actually<00:05:15.900> hungry<00:05:16.350> but

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
nom nom if we were actually hungry but

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.159 
nom nom if we were actually hungry but
I'm<00:05:17.430> not<00:05:17.760> actually<00:05:17.910> hungry<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:18.870> I<00:05:18.900> thought

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
I'm not actually hungry so I thought

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.440 
I'm not actually hungry so I thought
this<00:05:19.320> would<00:05:19.380> be<00:05:19.530> great<00:05:19.800> for<00:05:20.150> smps<00:05:21.150> and

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
this would be great for smps and

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.480 
this would be great for smps and
multiplayer<00:05:22.110> maps<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.190> especially

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
multiplayer maps and especially

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.350 
multiplayer maps and especially
