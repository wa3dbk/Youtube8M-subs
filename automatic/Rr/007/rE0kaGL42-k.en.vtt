00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.610
 friends good afternoon with you again company 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.160
 orbi group and today I will try 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.690
 answer the question that asks us 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.960
 every second client 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.880
 they ask where does this come from 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.680
 low price 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.439
 the answer lies in how the bidding is arranged 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.350
 bankruptcy bankruptcy bidding 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.510
 has three stages 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:33.290
 primary bidding and repeat this auction 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.680
 at auction the price rises with a certain 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.930
 by step 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.839
 this step is set by the organizer 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.960
 bidding if the property at these stages 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.909
 will not be realized the question arises 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.129
 how does a lender get your money 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.199
 the debtor 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.379
 the answer to this question lies in the third 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:54.799
 the bidding stage is the sale of property with 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.449
 public offer as arranged 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:58.549
 this stage 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.750
 on the public offer the price does not grow 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.549
 drops in a predetermined step 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.830
 who sets this step it 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.950
 reinstate the board of creditors these are 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.520
 people whom the debtor should he given 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.120
 the right to decide how often and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.550
 what amount decreases the price you don't 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.210
 believe it but sometimes the property is cheaper to 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.420
 1 ruble 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.060
 Now we give a couple of examples first 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.080
 An example is the sale of a 3-room apartment in 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.540
 Prokopyevsk city 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.200
 on the electron site manufacturer as we 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.490
 see bidding procedure is already going flat 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.490
 liza and tsya on a public offer 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.820
 initial apartment price 2 million 97 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.000
 thousand rubles I will say right away this price is already 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.720
 below 20 percent of the market analyzed 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.840
 this one is below the initial price there is a schedule 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.370
 the downsizing schedule here is small connected 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.930
 so that the procedure is some time 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.790
 is coming and the price has already dropped dramatically 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.299
 current price at the moment at first 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.369
 type 1 million 88000 but the most interesting 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:13.310
 that 20 10 14 years the price will be 1 ruble 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.800
 need to understand that up to 1 ruble price is not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.260
 will most likely fall flat to buy 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.510
 less say more in this trade 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.770
 procedure here is the president of the three 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.450
 there under the three applications 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.820
 but looking ahead still note that this 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.860
 still nothing says these applications can 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.860
 just be ordinary dummies that is 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.660
 these figures are not worth it 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.140
 The next example is the purchase of special equipment. 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.750
 but rather a garbage truck on the basis of KAMAZ so 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.600
 the manufacturer bought the same platform 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.880
 managing partners of our company tenders we 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.910
 these won 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.300
 What is worth noting the initial price 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 with which the slides were weak 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.930
 set by bid organizer 671 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.440
 1000 33 rubles this price was already lower 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.780
 market 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.460
 we estimate the price given 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.830
 vehicle stood there 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.200
 whom she is now was 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.370
 somewhere around 1 million rubles price 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.750
 which we purchased it 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.400
 makes three hundred and ninety six thousand 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.110
 four hundred and sixteen rubles that is 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.480
 somewhere around 1600 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:26.480
 below the market except the purchase of transport 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.160
 funds and real estate at auctions 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.040
 can very often meet 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.340
 the sale of certain resources all this 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.080
 there may be some natural resources 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.540
 sand rubble so on then there may be 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.870
 construction materials in this example 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.830
 you can see 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.870
 It was a trade procedure 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.320
 sale of property 1 house-building 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.690
 Combine in this auction I participated 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.190
 here you have a large 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.330
 list of building materials which 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.739
 was called just below we can see 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.050
 price drop chart 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:05.630
 and the initial price of this property was 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:09.770
 four million 930 thousand rubles price 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.810
 which we purchased that 591 1626 rubles 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:16.790
 25 kopecks that is, we did not wait 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:20.030
 the last decline 49 1302 rubles we 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.220
 bought on the last but one why 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.200
 understand that such objects do not live 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.740
 most decided c 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.840
 very good deal as not yet 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.580
 two or three weeks to implement this 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.010
 building material for more than 3 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:41.000
 million the following example also 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.790
 refers to trading sales of every kind 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.610
 resources this here fox products bid 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.830
 held today a little bit with us 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.100
 upset for the simple reason that 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.830
 organizer 7 minutes before the last 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.340
 price reduction has stopped accepting applications 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.360
 at the request of the board of creditors namely 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.510
 Sberbank of Russia 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.910
 pay attention sold huge 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.070
 amount of not very liquid 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.010
 sawn timber of about 20,000 cubic 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.600
 meters and now pay attention 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.320
 price fall dynamics ie at the beginning 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.840
 the property was worth 7 million 263 thousand 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.670
 this morning we planned to buy 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.010
 this property for seventy two thousand 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.940
 six hundred and thirty rubles that is for one 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:32.660
 the percentage of the boss is not visible Sberbank 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.590
 Russia decided not to allow such a fall 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.100
 and they stopped filing applications 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.680
 way you see the price may fall 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.040
 very much up to 1 and sometimes 0 1 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.090
 percent of the initial price of the property 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.410
 if you are interested in investing your 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.000
 funds with great liquidity 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.000
 invite you to cooperation
