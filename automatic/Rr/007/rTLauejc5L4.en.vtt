00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 good 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.719
 hello friends from the garden today we are in 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.090
 the garden and na again and I'm going to 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.460
 explain how to remove pacifiers from 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.890
 tomatoes these tomatoes that we have here 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.900
 we planted them two weeks ago or 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.180
 unless you remember them we put some 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.160
 plastic bottles to protect them and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.019
 some we have already removed them from others 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.850
 not yet from the moment they start 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.160
 to grow tomatoes you have to start 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.689
 Take off the pacifiers and I'm going to 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.120
 explain what pacifiers are because 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.699
 many times people do not know what we 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.830
 We refer to tomato or pacifiers 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.690
 where are they and how do they come out I will try 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.780
 explain one of the pacifiers if you give 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.260
 account this would be the main stem of the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.260
 tomato 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.060
 and here you get a branch between 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.430
 the main stem and the leaf comes out 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.100
 as a new outbreak these buds have to be 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.110
 remove them and just to one side 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.739
 they already know themselves without doing any kind of 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.330
 force this is removed because if not the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.210
 tomato plant starts to grow towards 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.790
 everywhere you plan everywhere and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.860
 makes the tomato lose strength with what 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
 which we are interested in the stem 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 central and tomatoes this is for 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.340
 example here we have the main stem 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.340
 a sheet as this also will 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.540
 we would remove 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.060
 so with the whole plant we are setting 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.650
 and this would be another one that comes out between the branch 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.650
 and the sheet and we remove it 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.010
 discounted this little one is going to be 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.760
 another pacifier 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.760
 we remove it 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.740
 and so on until releasing the whole plant this 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.350
 more or less we have to do all 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.870
 the weeks and looking at the suckers 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.510
 to remove them because if we are not 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.600
 There are people who are afraid of 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.630
 confuse a pacifier with the flowers of 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.520
 You realize that they do not come out 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.090
 while the armpits of the tomato or anything 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.100
 they just go out there there we have the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 tomato flower 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.550
 since the pacifier because the pacifier 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.550
 we remove 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.360
 here we have another case of pacifier this is 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.840
 it was our hand we let it grow 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.970
 too much and it seems part of the trunk and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.130
 of the stem but nothing to see the stem 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.710
 the main one is this that I know there's 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.850
 always leave this one off this will cost 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.850
 a little more than the previous ones 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.370
 if you want to have another tomato you can 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.310
 plant the pacifier on the floor that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.200
 I assure you right away that it takes root 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.960
 we leave like this has a week already cast 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.230
 estate 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.260
 you have already seen how 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.230
 we have been populating the tomatoes there are 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.420
 do this every little time and here 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.989
 also the pacifiers and also 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.180
 we take advantage of putting more rope 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.830
 tomatoes so they grow straight 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.730
 this is one thing that needs to be done 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.019
 I continue then good that you know that 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.730
 you have to control it so that 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.040
 combats grow up and without 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.040
 pacifiers so nothing if you liked 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.620
 the video gives you salt and like you comment what 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.379
 you can subscribe you please and what 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.269
 You must share then also guys we 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.269
 we see in future videos how
