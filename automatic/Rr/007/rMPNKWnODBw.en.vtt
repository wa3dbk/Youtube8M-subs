00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
this is a weird question why why do

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.800 
this is a weird question why why do
humans<00:01:58.110> only<00:01:58.439> use<00:01:58.680> 10%<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.939> their<00:02:00.000> brains<00:02:00.450> I've

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
humans only use 10% of their brains I've

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.660 
humans only use 10% of their brains I've
been<00:02:01.110> wondering<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.740> few<00:02:01.950> days<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:02.430> I'm

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
been wondering for a few days now I'm

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.249 
been wondering for a few days now I'm
going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.909> try<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.479> Ricky's<00:02:03.810> opinion<00:02:06.259> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
going to try to know Ricky's opinion I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.330 
going to try to know Ricky's opinion I
think<00:02:07.350> news<00:02:07.560> about<00:02:07.710> Twain<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> think<00:02:08.250> it's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
think news about Twain I think it's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.650 
think news about Twain I think it's
probably<00:02:08.489> cuz<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.789> delocalized<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
probably cuz it's delocalized the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.810 
probably cuz it's delocalized the
information<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.470> also<00:02:10.950> think<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:11.640> we

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
information I also think it's because we

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.550 
information I also think it's because we
lose<00:02:12.030> brain<00:02:12.269> cells<00:02:12.600> from<00:02:12.840> birth<00:02:13.079> they<00:02:13.290> never

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
lose brain cells from birth they never

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
lose brain cells from birth they never
replaced<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.760> need<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> lot<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.540> we

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
replaced so we need a lot that we

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.100 
replaced so we need a lot that we
probably<00:02:15.780> won't<00:02:16.049> use<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.920> don't<00:02:17.880> know

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
probably won't use that can I don't know

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.470 
probably won't use that can I don't know
but<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.200> sounded<00:02:19.560> good<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:20.010> sounded<00:02:20.579> good<00:02:20.790> are

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
but it sounded good it sounded good are

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.840 
but it sounded good it sounded good are
