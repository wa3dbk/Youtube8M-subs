00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
massively helped by the fact that we

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.720 
massively helped by the fact that we
wrote<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.470> together<00:02:23.680> not<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.550> because

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
wrote it together not just because

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.190 
wrote it together not just because
you're<00:02:24.940> only<00:02:25.239> writing<00:02:25.510> half<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.930> bit<00:02:26.080> but

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
you're only writing half a bit but

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.710 
you're only writing half a bit but
because<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.590> got<00:02:27.250> someone<00:02:27.550> there<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.940> bounce

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
because you got someone there to bounce

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.990 
because you got someone there to bounce
ideas<00:02:28.900> off<00:02:29.290> you<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:30.160> we<00:02:30.310> got<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.640> while<00:02:30.880> we

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
ideas off you think we got on while we

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.739 
ideas off you think we got on while we
