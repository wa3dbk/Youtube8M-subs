00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.660
 I have waited so long and finally 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.580
 were pokémon soulsilver and heart gold 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.980
 Published they look like the pokemon 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.500
 de follow you or talk to you 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.210
 I finally could take poker cloud 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 Try everything for yourself 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.840
 I am immediately to the gamestop grant with 49 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.640
 euro in the bag 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 I have the difficult cheaper 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.369
 I think it was for euro or 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.170
 so but I digress 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.070
 I was barely at home when I got the game 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.350
 the same meant everything was normal 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.989
 rubio on the cover image starter pokémon 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.600
 everything I did not even think about it 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.850
 that I do in his baby pasta 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.770
 would transform 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.200
 after I led the top 4 defeated 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.320
 my way to canto still 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.440
 completely normal until I have a certain city 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.920
 reached 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.190
 Labbadia, I think for sure now without 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.210
 labbadia like original again such a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.989
 Labbadia are homestory but no 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.060
 not a bit 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 i went to the pokémon center mine 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.659
 cure pokémon 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 but when I wanted to leave the center 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.320
 opened a textbox 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.720
 no no I thought that was a little bit 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.150
 strangely that was part of the game 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.360
 what does not stop me from going on 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.030
 so i did is and one more 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 textbox appeared 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.050
 why people like why I stepped 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.960
 progress only one step again 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.750
 appeared a textbox why have you 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 my tone is torn down 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.440
 just so that your music is ok with this 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.960
 point he was definitely playing again 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.610
 unsympathetic why was knox reputation like that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.110
 deeply played again a speech bubble 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.410
 Are not you interested in ours? 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.860
 ghosts in peace route now it was 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.649
 I realized it was body circles out of the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.959
 previous generation but stop 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.079
 one is not there managed the mind 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.900
 bring the last peace 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.519
 I did not remember that moment 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.439
 continue 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.829
 I just stopped and the next one 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:26.590
 textbox came as a dialog interested 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:31.150
 this poor where not at all or that 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.819
 is she or I good? 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.549
 From here I was unwell I had one 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.049
 feeling sick in the stomach 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.709
 I wanted to turn them off but those 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.599
 I continued to curiosity 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.620
 new radio sound is more important than 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.409
 the souls of dead pokemon on the spot around 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.810
 not enough you really have had to 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.780
 dig up the dead pokémon and their 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.099
 disturb the last peace 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.700
 I could understand what the soul was 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.409
 meant what if your grave one day 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.540
 through some entertainment stuff 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:09.840
 is laid over it by thinking times 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.519
 why did you ever do that? 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.099
 thought of how we would feel 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.980
 even if it was just a textbox I was 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.970
 could not mourn for the closer was not 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.040
 angry but sad she and her 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.019
 Friends are no longer in peace 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.280
 they were no longer able to 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.610
 can 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.140
 the body just dug up for music me 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.940
 remember the broken one 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.550
 tower to see 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.520
 the screaming souls of the deceased 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.390
 they screamed as they screamed out 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.940
 made injustice at this point 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.520
 that was pretty sad to me 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.300
 that was really depressing 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:58.610
 Intention of game freak in a game 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:01.260
 a child's play is just a game 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:07.350
 So it does not matter 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.320
 I think it has no meaning 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.239
 the ghost read my thoughts though 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.920
 as 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.470
 just because we are stuck in a module 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.310
 does not mean that we do not fill 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.570
 can 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.580
 the screen became black no sound 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.590
 shortly afterwards the spread of one appeared 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.860
 plaintiff but it was yes 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.270
 angry the body's scream of course 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.880
 it matters 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.010
 he shrank back at my wall 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.560
 spring it down but I hope to 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.620
 and pressed you but you think so 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.060
 is not important now you will see that 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.370
 game was back to normal 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.150
 but the last textbox already has me 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:57.800
 scared but it was just a game 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.689
 I changed my report for the time being 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.209
 A few months later, changed a bit more 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.249
 I went away to school after all 

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:06.999
 I decided to leave the cemetery 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.659
 to run 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:14.369
 where my father is buried it lies 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.369
 a radio tower was built over
