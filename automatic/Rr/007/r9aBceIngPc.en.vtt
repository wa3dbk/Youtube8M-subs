00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.460
 and in principle who watched previous 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.330
 the collection is so powerful it is so 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.869
 she is awesome she is so cool 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.180
 that now from the moment of the first moment and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.900
 appearing on me does not go out 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.300
 basic such use and then in general 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.110
 principle delight you only delight in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.640
 Didi cream is twofold 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.899
 here are twofold sensations but i'm a principle 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.360
 I'll share with you now 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.000
 In general, here's how didi cream 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.149
 Prescribed before the beauty screen that is 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.469
 a cream that solves everything 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.460
 obligations all problems 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.829
 this cream is awesome it is not that there 8 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.039
 7 in 1 5 in one as they love here bbc 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.020
 di di cream it is called it just 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.890
 if I say correctly 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 multifunction cream first is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.619
 beautiful anti-aging cream because 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.350
 in composition 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.570
 and stem cells of pride but in all 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.270
 present it goes without saying 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 2 The undoubted advantage is that 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 it is replaced by butane forest 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.830
 here are the micronized pigments which 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.110
 absolutely loyal to our 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.689
 skin does not clog pores and that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.689
 interesting didi cream he adapts 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.360
 the color of our skin that is it 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.040
 universal let's say universal 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.159
 leaving on the foundation from I will put on 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 who will see the pen and he is very 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 very economical we really 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.240
 prescribed that 8 drops you put on 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.189
 face and here is such here 25 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 milliliters but with such narrow 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.820
 spout so that we don't have too much 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.820
 inflicted because the cream is wonderful 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.520
 distributed has a terrific gentle 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.469
 aroma light texture and magna 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.719
 it actually absorbs instantly 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.860
 so here is an absolutely universal cream 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:09.030
 which adapts to skin color to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.920
 in the same cream there is a protection factor against 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.870
 the sun as much as 30, and this one here is a factor 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.989
 contributes to protecting ours and us 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.750
 and from pigmentation and from harmful 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.180
 UV exposure by the way with one 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.459
 sides in the winter too 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.560
 snow snow one hundred percent reflect 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.959
 the sun's rays and and no one is insured 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.110
 even in winter , subject spot management 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.430
 so here as such a winter 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.579
 cream too it has a place to be next 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.790
 the moment is that here dd cream is already cream 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.440
 next generation and cream with 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.150
 anti-aging effect with pronounced 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.400
 anti-aging effect 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.530
 that is, it is not just a day cream it 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.540
 replaced by day cream is cream 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.510
 comprehensive action in terms of rejuvenation 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.600
 this and leveling the terrain and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.829
 alignment of tone this and smoothing 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.810
 wrinkles and also 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.280
 and lifting effect by generating 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.560
 collagen elastin well i mean if 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.560
 look so in general it is 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.660
 so versatile powerful high 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.750
 technical product that combines 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:20.209
 very very very very many in themselves 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.380
 cream and so here in itself deprim 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.989
 supersky for any skin type 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.630
 begin forty but 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.760
 it is especially good for very dry 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.970
 sensitive skin yes indeed 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.160
 fits and 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.340
 recommended if you have applied serum 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.790
 and you enough about to face needs more 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.650
 something else may be applied once but 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.510
 what I faced why I said 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.549
 initially ambiguous feeling that 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.889
 to me 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.200
 winter cold winter chill late 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.410
 Autumn and winter of this cream will be 1 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.909
 not enough that is skin will suffer 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.739
 from lack 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:05.280
 let's say so a few feeder how many 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.269
 protective of some elements and have 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.010
 didi cream 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:13.110
 combine more with either a protective cream from 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.629
 weatherproof with either day cream more 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.120
 plump here so here now on 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.250
 really the problem when to apply that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.800
 lady di cream first whether your base 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.810
 cream in general, for me I will probably 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.060
 apply your first day cream and 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.850
 then didi cream because there is 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.250
 pigments that stain on him 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.039
 work instead of foundation well in 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.440
 In general, with the cold, let's see how it will be 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.620
 behave the cream while it is absolutely 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.840
 perfect job by itself and yet 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.150
 one thing that is not, I had 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.880
 seen but the girls who took 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.220
 if there is any pronounced on the skin 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.570
 deformations or defects that need 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:58.080
 hide for example window pustular rash 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.419
 scarring but pronounced spots 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.050
 one didi cream as a masking 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.450
 funds will not cope then you will need 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.150
 either top over or extra 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.330
 tighter means either 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.039
 apply correctors in general somehow 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.380
 combine didi with additional 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.590
 some means but so and so here in 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.750
 In general, just superfood 1 of course 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.780
 insult there is a little trouble what he 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.860
 came out in october month here if he 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.410
 came out somewhere 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.870
 July-August he simply had no equal 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.070
 so much so cool so much 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.389
 tasty product 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.930
 Well, in general, I would still put 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:42.210
 highest grade highest grade because 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.639
 amazing amazing and like skin like 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.889
 skin feels comfortable with it 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.580
 it just needs to try just 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.580
 to try
