00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 wow for years without making a video with 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.370
 this voice synthesizer and they know that it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.530
 feel of the scrubbing to use it again 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.719
 you know by editing and corrections 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.889
 in the audio and all that crap but in 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.889
 end let's go to the point 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.430
 About three days or more ago I do not know no 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.440
 I remember I was seeing if it's still 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.450
 there were videos with voices of 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.580
 loquendo and I have the unpleasant surprise of 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.370
 yes and do with him a reverend ma 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.410
 square critical to the school made by 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.480
 a brat that always disapproves and that's why 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.030
 nobody wants it criticizes a series of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.190
 Anime criticizes a 12-year-old girl who 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.660
 insulted the crazy thing done by an idiot 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.880
 who can barely talk without having 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.370
 mental problems and other shits without 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.770
 meaning that's why I'll do something 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.350
 different and that nobody said no one has 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.600
 made several videos on how to improve 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.420
 its spelling or rather how 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.060
 to write well the Spanish language is that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.220
 seriously, it really pisses me off that 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.570
 having the automatic corrector 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.210
 they write like retarded apes 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.060
 Conalep students so hands to 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.640
 the work that I have come to illuminate them 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.710
 let's start with the most basic some of 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.380
 you know what a word means 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.270
 severe acute esdrújula or on esdrújula 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.270
 it does not take me 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.840
 the sharp words are the ones that have 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.780
 the tonic syllable in last place carry 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.540
 accents and end in vowel not as 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.690
 example is ball heart prayer or 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.180
 reason the monosyllabic words is to say 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.400
 those with only one syllable do not carry 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.050
 accent because in them it is not necessary 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.050
 indicate in which syllable the greatest 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.560
 intensity this happens in words like 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.140
 foot pas and others saw was some 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.630
 words about all monosyllables are 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.550
 uses the diacritic accent that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.729
 I will explain in another video because it does not give me 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.729
 weather 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.030
 the words grave or flat according to each 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.580
 who are the ones with the syllable 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.370
 tonic or the accent for the slow 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.800
 understanding in penultimate place lead 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.710
 accent if they do not end in vowel or n 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.530
 nor as examples do we have the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.530
 words pencil difficult mobile lawn and 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.630
 many more there are exceptions in the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.150
 serious words then finished in 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.580
 any consonant followed by n or s 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.740
 with accents in words shown 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.740
 as biceps comics forceps 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.550
 the words esdrújulas are those that 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.990
 they have the accent on the penultimate 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.180
 syllable 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.910
 there are several examples like traffic light 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 fast Saturday or page respectively 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.590
 here there is no exception all the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.990
 words that carry syllable tonic in the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.590
 antepenultimate the accent will be put no more 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.590
 no less 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.989
 the words on compasses are the ones 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.120
 they have the tonic syllable before 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.670
 antepenultimo place I do not know what it's called 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.249
 or no name so I put before 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.590
 so they do not criticize me as 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:07.319
 example we have words that serve to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.230
 order things like eat it baby 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.389
 study it among others 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.239
 normally the words envelopes luxury the 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:17.340
 they have the orthographic accent nonetheless 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.129
 in the case of adverbs created from 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.499
 of adjective with the suffix mind is to say 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.719
 that end in the word mind for 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:26.400
 those who do not know what a suffix is ​​only 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.040
 will be accentuated in the event that the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.379
 adjective carry the accent alone by 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.389
 example the word hardly carries 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.639
 accent since the adjective 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:38.129
 It is formed the word difficult too 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.439
 it is nevertheless carried by words like 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.939
 it does not take it since neither 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.939
 has the word effective 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.500
 and finally I want to explain to you what 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.180
 means the syllable tonic because they 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.070
 I assure you that many of you 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.890
 they were with Juan's face when listening 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.380
 those words the tonic syllable is 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.510
 the one where the voice is loaded is 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.700
 say the syllable of a word that is 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.670
 pronounced with greater intensity than 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.470
 other that's all about the first 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.810
 spelling lesson that I bring for 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.790
 you beardless boys so that 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.860
 improve your writing because it gives me a lot 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.280
 shame that people of that type have 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.130
 Internet access is unfortunate without further 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.810
 to say goodbye and seriously see this 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.850
 video seriously and eager to 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.010
 learn then I do it for your good and not 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.380
 I am nobody to walk correcting the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.180
 but with this contribution I am giving my 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.330
 bit to have better 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.780
 people with better spelling until the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.780
 next 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.990
 to 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.360
 no no no
