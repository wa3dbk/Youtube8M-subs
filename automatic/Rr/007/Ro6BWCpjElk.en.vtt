00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.590 
that's what its gonna look like I wanted
to<00:03:29.280> try<00:03:29.459> these<00:03:29.519> out<00:03:29.790> because<00:03:30.090> I'm<00:03:30.359> not<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> big

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
to try these out because I'm not a big

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.380 
to try these out because I'm not a big
trigger<00:03:30.930> person<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.549> know<00:03:32.579> whenever

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
trigger person but I you know whenever

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.670 
trigger person but I you know whenever
they're<00:03:33.600> hooking<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.049> up<00:03:34.079> with<00:03:34.140> some<00:03:34.380> things

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
they're hooking you up with some things

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.650 
they're hooking you up with some things
trial<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.340> figured<00:03:35.760> I'd<00:03:35.880> try<00:03:36.090> them<00:03:36.209> out<00:03:36.299> nice

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
trial I figured I'd try them out nice

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.120 
trial I figured I'd try them out nice
talk<00:03:36.870> with<00:03:36.900> Alan<00:03:37.200> so<00:03:37.320> he<00:03:37.470> may<00:03:37.620> ever<00:03:37.799> ask<00:03:38.010> me

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
talk with Alan so he may ever ask me

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.610 
talk with Alan so he may ever ask me
about<00:03:38.310> him<00:03:38.609> I<00:03:38.820> can<00:03:39.120> only<00:03:39.209> say<00:03:39.480> hey<00:03:39.690> these

things

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.550 

so<00:03:45.070> now<00:03:45.280> guess<00:03:45.970> what<00:03:46.180> fail<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:47.050> give<00:03:47.170> up<00:03:47.290> set

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
so now guess what fail to give up set

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.580 
so now guess what fail to give up set
away<00:03:47.680> whatever<00:03:48.070> we<00:03:48.460> do<00:03:48.640> oh<00:03:49.350> here's<00:03:50.350> what<00:03:50.500> I'll
