00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.849
 Dear colleagues 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.619
 the reason for our meeting is simple 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.289
 We often make investments but knew how to use the equipment 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.989
 projections for example 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.119
 is much more than a tartar remover 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.239
 there are some situations in the daily clinic that put us ahead of some 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.190
 difficulties 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.220
 whose solution can be better achieved with the use of ultrasound 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.339
 office productivity 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.890
 is obtained by using the precise tool 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.970
 in the right time 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.280
 and in the best indication of the case 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.160
 have this tool on the consistory at this time 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.520
 priceless 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.150
 then we will expand the list of procedures in which, since only in what 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.270
 Is it used 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.200
 I ask that you continue with me in the next few minutes as we will demonstrate 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.120
 in practice 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 some of these situations 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.720
 the new one since his team had 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 is yet another launch of ships arriving to provide greater precision 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.670
 safety and clinical procedures 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.980
 its more modern and bold design now also includes a peristaltic 'pump' 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.860
 allowing the regulation of the flow of water and the use of other liquids 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.730
 such as saline, your external water tank is 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.390
 removable translucent letting light that makes it easy to see your 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.340
 content 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.480
 in relation to the panel this counts now with commands coming from that readers 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.490
 with three programmable functions 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.560
 written 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.210
 your fine water adjustment in procedures with refrigeration 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 constant wording with flow controls, 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.090
 carrying out cico works 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.730
 no jackson tibet 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.090
 it is also possible to fine-tune the power 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.150
 up to when each type of procedure 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.200
 being the only device that allows adjustments and stops of water 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.219
 the Pope in a special thermoplastic material 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.349
 allows for firm handling and precision in movements 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.639
 today the actions of the bb contemplate characteristics that mark the evolution 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.089
 of a product 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:30.849
 sales success that is indispensable today in our offices. 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.679
 follow 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:36.259
 we will present the different ones in certain that can be used with the jadson and 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
 pdt 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.109
 for removal of cabuÃ§u for people ball 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:55.230
 the uncertain number 1 is used in the lingual phases the vestibular has proximal 

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:57.539
 as in this example 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:58.620
 normally 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.270
 is indicated for large blame removal at power of 10 to 50% 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.969
 already the uncertain number 2 allows us to use the power in up to 100% 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.569
 in the same indication of the uncertain number 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.089
 however in cases where removal presents greater difficulty 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.010
 when calculates presents volume coming city of high difficulty of removal 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.139
 the indication is uncertain to undress 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.220
 thus 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.550
 even the consistent calculations are removed at a power of ten to 70% 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.629
 the subgente valley calculation needs to be delicately removed 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.239
 maintaining the integrity of adjacent tissues 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.859
 was successful 3 was designed for that statement 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.699
 including furnas 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.790
 in these cases we use the power of 10 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.790
 to 70% 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.970
 to facilitate access to root canals 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.860
 the uncertain because it has 20 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.189
 with its length and 17 minutes 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:23.440
 assists in the removal of new ones by pairs of teeth, and obtained old actions 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.440
 on a power of 10 to 25% 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.039
 the cervical texts in it bia is the one of the driver to take off 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.740
 we used a desert he has 40 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.550
 in situations of 10 1 per action of conduct take off in the removal of pine and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.210
 an extension of the classified channels 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.889
 the length of 24 mm over power from 10 to 15% 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.650
 guarantee the safety of the procedure 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.670
 because it is manufactured in titanium and does not have diamond coating 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.639
 the uncertain that 4 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.409
 one of the most desired functions of the 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.740
 the removal of fractured instruments 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.449
 the length of 24 mm in power from 10 to 15% 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.440
 favors its use throughout the conflict to take off 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.180
 the fires at 120 lia 90 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.349
 are holders therefor with a diameter of 0 8 millimeters 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.900
 the difference between them is the heart that facilitates access for teeth 

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:36.419
 anterior and posterior 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.419
 with a recommended power of 10 to 50 percent 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.050
 and angles of 120 than 90 degrees 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.020
 the biomechanical preparation of the canal 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.279
 is the application with a great advantage 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.600
 an efficient violation of the miners 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.560
 provided by irrigation 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.560
 and to the ultrasonic vibration of 30 thousand rats 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.289
 Surgery Walls 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.789
 one of the key points 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.989
 is access getting ready to take off in fiscal weight 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.889
 the uncertain that 12 90 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.360
 with an angle of 110 degrees can be accurately positioned at the angle 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.479
 required for treatment on the power of 10 to 50% 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:27.139
 but not all teeth have holy channels and easy access 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:30.979
 in cases where the roots are small and delicate 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.759
 the uncertain sinners who with an angle of 100 degrees 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.289
 has a slimmer design and is ideal for providing a procedure 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:41.159
 surgery 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:42.540
 for this case 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.119
 power follows the same 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:47.119
 from ten to 50% 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.020
 if there were pinochet crowns crowns has always been a challenge for us 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.680
 dental surgeons 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.360
 with uncertain five to go in its design and more fuel what it provides 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.189
 the maximum power of our service and 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:14.960
 we increase the probability of removal of the crowns without having to be healed 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.830
 and finally 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.830
 we have to win by 6 to 3 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.249
 originally designed for amalgam condensation 

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:30.839
 nowadays beyond this indication we use with great success as 

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.839
 assist in the cementation of pinus and crowns 

00:07:34.349 --> 00:07:36.830
 the power of 10 to 50% 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.199
 makes it possible for us to get better out of the way 

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:48.639
 I hope I spoke our language. 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:52.889
 we dentists are deserving of solutions that help us in the 

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.889
 productivity and improve our quality of life 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.089
