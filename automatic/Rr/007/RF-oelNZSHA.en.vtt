hi<00:00:00.179> guys<00:00:00.420> in<00:00:00.719> today's<00:00:00.750> Ettore<00:00:01.439> i'd<00:00:01.680> like<00:00:01.890> to

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hi guys in today's Ettore i'd like to

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.649 
hi guys in today's Ettore i'd like to
show<00:00:02.190> you<00:00:02.220> how<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.580> can<00:00:02.760> get<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.970> random<00:00:03.449> output

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
show you how you can get a random output

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.590 
show you how you can get a random output
out<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.110> 2<00:00:04.350> or<00:00:04.589> 3<00:00:04.620> bits<00:00:05.160> by<00:00:05.759> just<00:00:06.060> hitting<00:00:06.330> an

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
out of 2 or 3 bits by just hitting an

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600 
out of 2 or 3 bits by just hitting an
input<00:00:07.049> so<00:00:07.410> this<00:00:07.620> time<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.859> got<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.099> first<00:00:08.370> one

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
input so this time we got the first one

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.690 
input so this time we got the first one
again<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.540> first<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:11.030> third<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:13.700> second

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
again the first one third one and second

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.400 
again the first one third one and second
one<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.269> on<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.780> can<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.199> for

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
one and so on and you can do this for

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.260 
one and so on and you can do this for
two<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.740> three<00:00:16.949> bits<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.490> let<00:00:17.670> me<00:00:17.789> show<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.000> how

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
two or three bits so let me show you how

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.779 
two or three bits so let me show you how
to<00:00:18.330> build<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.439> first<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.550> course

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
to build this so first up we of course

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.550 
to build this so first up we of course
want<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.029> start<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.510> our<00:00:21.689> input<00:00:21.869> block<00:00:22.230> here

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
want to start with our input block here

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.009 
want to start with our input block here
put<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> lever<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:23.670> your<00:00:24.060> repeater<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
put a lever or your repeater on the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.099 
put a lever or your repeater on the
front<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:26.070> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> site<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:27.869> want

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
front then going to the site here want

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
front then going to the site here want
to<00:00:28.199> place<00:00:28.470> three<00:00:28.769> redstone<00:00:29.010> dust<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.670> dropper

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
to place three redstone dust a dropper

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.990 
to place three redstone dust a dropper
and<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.500> hopper<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.730> course

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
and a hopper because this is of course

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
and a hopper because this is of course
using<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.140> randomness<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.160> dropper<00:00:35.670> then

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
using the randomness of the dropper then

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.869 
using the randomness of the dropper then
a<00:00:36.450> comparator<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.649> site<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> then<00:00:38.550> for

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a comparator to the site and then for

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
a comparator to the site and then for
the<00:00:38.969> tube<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.360> will<00:00:39.540> start<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.079> two<00:00:40.320> blocks

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the tube it will start with two blocks

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.389 
the tube it will start with two blocks
and<00:00:41.059> then<00:00:42.059> two<00:00:42.239> redstone<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.780> top<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:44.219> need

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
and then two redstone on top and we need

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.430 
and then two redstone on top and we need
to<00:00:44.520> decode<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> redstone<00:00:45.600> signal<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.410> a

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
to decode the redstone signal here so a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.279 
to decode the redstone signal here so a
place<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.070> repeat<00:00:47.399> us<00:00:47.579> down<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.719> two

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
place to repeat us down here then two

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
place to repeat us down here then two
blocks<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:49.980> blocks<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.430> top<00:00:50.840> two

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
blocks here two blocks on top two

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
blocks here two blocks on top two
redstone<00:00:52.320> dust<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.670> repeaters<00:00:54.120> on

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
redstone dust here two more repeaters on

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.970 
redstone dust here two more repeaters on
the<00:00:54.539> second<00:00:55.020> delay<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:56.329> redstone<00:00:57.329> torches

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
the second delay and redstone torches

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.029 
the second delay and redstone torches
blocks<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.309> redstone<00:01:00.270> torches<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.920> we

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
blocks and redstone torches and then we

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.179 
blocks and redstone torches and then we
need<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.340> fill<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.199> non<00:01:04.199> stackable<00:01:04.650> item<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
need to fill in a non stackable item and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.460 
need to fill in a non stackable item and
a<00:01:05.519> 64<00:01:06.650> stackable<00:01:07.650> item<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.960> overwrite<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
a 64 stackable item and to overwrite the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020 
a 64 stackable item and to overwrite the
signal<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.520> now<00:01:11.640> given<00:01:11.909> an

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
signal here because this is now given an

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.270 
signal here because this is now given an
output<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.540> need<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.810> place<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> block<00:01:13.380> redstone

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
output we need to place a block redstone

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.690 
output we need to place a block redstone
torch<00:01:14.549> block<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.110> repeater<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.740> full<00:01:17.130> delay

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
torch block and a repeater on full delay

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.530 
torch block and a repeater on full delay
and<00:01:18.560> now<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:19.830> hit<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> switch<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.970> we<00:01:21.360> can

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and now if we hit the switch here we can

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
and now if we hit the switch here we can
see<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.380> gives<00:01:22.619> us<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.100> random<00:01:23.460> output

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
see that this gives us a random output

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
see that this gives us a random output
depending<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.720> item<00:01:25.080> gets<00:01:25.290> shot<00:01:25.710> into

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
depending on which item gets shot into

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.039 
depending on which item gets shot into
the<00:01:26.340> hopper<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
the hopper and if you want to do this

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.620 
the hopper and if you want to do this
for<00:01:28.350> three<00:01:28.710> bits<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.430> need<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.970> add<00:01:30.119> one

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
for three bits you just need to add one

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.289 
for three bits you just need to add one
more<00:01:30.659> block<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.640> yeah<00:01:32.640> just<00:01:32.909> make<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more block here and yeah just make the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.520 
more block here and yeah just make the
decoding

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
decoding

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.120 
decoding
one<00:01:34.950> block<00:01:35.250> wider<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
one block wider so just like this and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.600 
one block wider so just like this and
then<00:01:38.729> redstone<00:01:39.240> torch<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:39.780> block<00:01:40.610> redstone

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
then redstone torch here block redstone

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.960 
then redstone torch here block redstone
torch<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> fill<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.840> 15<00:01:43.770> more<00:01:43.979> fences<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.640> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
torch and fill in 15 more fences and a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.240 
torch and fill in 15 more fences and a
an<00:01:45.149> item<00:01:45.360> which<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.720> stackable<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.439> 16<00:01:47.009> items

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
an item which is stackable to 16 items

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.120 
an item which is stackable to 16 items
and<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:48.750> hit<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> switch<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.860> see

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and if we now hit the switch you can see

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.569 
and if we now hit the switch you can see
that<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> random<00:01:51.149> output<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:52.140> three

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
that we get a random output out of three

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.219 
that we get a random output out of three
so<00:01:53.579> that's<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.030> for<00:01:54.240> today's<00:01:54.479> tutorial<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.990> hope

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so that's it for today's tutorial I hope

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.050
