forces<00:02:13.280> there<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.580> Shanghai<00:02:14.150> these<00:02:14.390> people<00:02:14.780> or

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
forces there to Shanghai these people or

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.360 
forces there to Shanghai these people or
I<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:16.370> call<00:02:17.180> around<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.750> say<00:02:17.930> Shanghai<00:02:18.440> at

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
I can call around and say Shanghai at

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.550 
I can call around and say Shanghai at
that<00:02:19.640> point<00:02:19.909> we<00:02:20.060> would<00:02:20.180> compare<00:02:20.659> who's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
that point we would compare who's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.399 
that point we would compare who's
winning<00:02:22.010> what<00:02:22.249> and<00:02:22.579> that<00:02:22.930> person<00:02:23.930> would<00:02:24.049> take

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
winning what and that person would take

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.360 
winning what and that person would take
the<00:02:24.920> card<00:02:25.219> and<00:02:25.400> put<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.760> front<00:02:25.969> of<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
the card and put it in front of the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.910 
the card and put it in front of the
if<00:02:26.730> there's<00:02:27.659> a<00:02:27.720> tie<00:02:28.049> like<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.799> we

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
if there's a tie like this and we

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.979 
if there's a tie like this and we
compare<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.459> dice<00:02:29.670> next<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.390> card<00:02:30.659> so<00:02:30.870> in

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
compare the dice next to the card so in

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.339 
compare the dice next to the card so in
this<00:02:31.110> case<00:02:31.790> red<00:02:32.790> would<00:02:33.030> actually<00:02:33.390> take<00:02:33.659> this

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
this case red would actually take this

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.110 
this case red would actually take this
card<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.010> they<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.459> win<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.819> one<00:02:36.000> because

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
card and they would win this one because

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.780 
card and they would win this one because
of<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.450> tiebreaker<00:02:37.080> die<00:02:37.409> here<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.640> don't

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
of this tiebreaker die here so I don't

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.220 
of this tiebreaker die here so I don't
really<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.120> do<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.049> would

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
really want to do that so I would

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.649 
really want to do that so I would
continue<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:41.310> let's<00:02:41.489> say<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:42.330> okay<00:02:42.510> let

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
continue so let's say I think okay let

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.240 
continue so let's say I think okay let
me<00:02:42.750> do<00:02:42.870> let<00:02:43.110> me<00:02:43.140> do<00:02:43.260> at<00:02:43.349> least<00:02:43.500> one<00:02:43.829> more<00:02:43.860> here

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
me do let me do at least one more here

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.949 
me do let me do at least one more here
three<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.579> got<00:02:44.849> three<00:02:45.090> all<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.659> live<00:02:45.810> with

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
three I got three all so I can live with

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.860 
three I got three all so I can live with
that<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.470> they<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.150> now<00:02:48.360> by<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.629> way<00:02:48.750> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that and then they and now by the way I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.569 
that and then they and now by the way I
would<00:02:49.170> break<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.560> tie<00:02:49.860> because<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
would break that tie because if it's the

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.300 
would break that tie because if it's the
same<00:02:50.790> number<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.239> dice<00:02:51.560> then<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.739> look<00:02:52.890> at<00:02:52.980> pips

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
same number of dice then we look at pips

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.360 
same number of dice then we look at pips
and<00:02:54.060> then<00:02:54.209> they<00:02:54.360> would<00:02:54.540> roll<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.220> they<00:02:56.220> would

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
and then they would roll and they would

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.160 
and then they would roll and they would
get<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.549> 1<00:02:56.879> and<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:57.269> 3<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:58.140> they're<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.400> to

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
get a 1 and a 3 and they're going to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.690 
get a 1 and a 3 and they're going to
play<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.349> 3<00:03:01.650> right<00:03:01.859> there<00:03:01.890> where<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.340> landing

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
play that 3 right there where it landing

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.970 
play that 3 right there where it landing
boom<00:03:03.060> okay<00:03:03.959> back<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.230> me<00:03:04.470> let's<00:03:04.709> say<00:03:04.859> I'm

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
boom okay back to me let's say I'm

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.380 
boom okay back to me let's say I'm
calling<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.489> for<00:03:05.579> some<00:03:05.760> reason<00:03:06.090> we<00:03:06.209> would

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
calling it for some reason we would

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.460 
calling it for some reason we would
compare<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.970> 3<00:03:09.299> here<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> perfect

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
compare and so the 3 here is a perfect

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.039 
compare and so the 3 here is a perfect
time<00:03:10.709> no<00:03:11.129> one's<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:12.480> goes<00:03:12.780> to

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
time no one's gonna get that one goes to

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.059 
time no one's gonna get that one goes to
them<00:03:13.290> 2<00:03:13.980> goes<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.310> them<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.629> one<00:03:16.069> comes

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
them 2 goes to them and this one comes

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.550 
them 2 goes to them and this one comes
here<00:03:17.159> to<00:03:17.519> me<00:03:17.760> these<00:03:18.599> would<00:03:18.810> go<00:03:18.959> back<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.230> each

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
here to me these would go back to each

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.140 
here to me these would go back to each
player<00:03:21.200> these<00:03:22.200> would<00:03:22.470> be<00:03:22.590> discarded<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.670> when

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
player these would be discarded and when

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390 
player these would be discarded and when
you<00:03:24.239> play<00:03:24.420> another<00:03:24.780> round<00:03:25.079> until<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:25.920> deck<00:03:26.159> is

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
you play another round until the deck is

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.819 
you play another round until the deck is
gone<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:27.510> there's<00:03:27.780> one<00:03:27.989> new<00:03:28.200> kind<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.620> car

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
gone now there's one new kind of car

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.259 
gone now there's one new kind of car
that<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.040> want<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.310> show<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.549> here<00:03:29.909> so<00:03:30.090> let's

say this is round 2 we are setting up
all<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> cards<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:34.010> we<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:36.180> one<00:03:36.450> there

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
all the cards and we get that one there

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.509 
all the cards and we get that one there
that<00:03:38.069> kind<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.489> card<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.150> an<00:03:39.959> action<00:03:40.349> card<00:03:40.620> you

turn you can do one of two things as it

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.890 
turn you can do one of two things as it
shows<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.639> lets<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:50.940> reroll<00:03:51.389> both<00:03:51.629> dice

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
shows that lets you reroll both dice

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.319 
shows that lets you reroll both dice
before<00:03:52.379> you<00:03:52.530> place<00:03:52.769> one<00:03:53.069> or<00:03:53.730> I'll<00:03:53.879> let<00:03:53.970> you<00:03:54.030> add

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
before you place one or I'll let you add

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
or subtract one to one of the dice you

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.449 
or subtract one to one of the dice you
rolled<00:03:57.419> so<00:03:58.169> very<00:03:58.440> useful<00:03:58.650> there's<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.099> few<00:03:59.340> of

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
rolled so very useful there's a few of

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.729 
rolled so very useful there's a few of
those<00:03:59.579> in<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.970> deck<00:04:00.180> this<00:04:00.449> one<00:04:00.660> re-roll<00:04:01.440> or

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
those in the deck this one re-roll or

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.909 
those in the deck this one re-roll or
two<00:04:02.370> wild<00:04:02.790> Pirates<00:04:03.209> that<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.419> get<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.629> add<00:04:03.919> to

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
two wild Pirates that you get to add to

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.490 
two wild Pirates that you get to add to
a<00:04:04.949> segment<00:04:05.400> comes<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.940> six<00:04:06.269> of<00:04:06.389> that<00:04:06.540> kind<00:04:06.900> like

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
a segment comes a six of that kind like

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.710 
a segment comes a six of that kind like
so<00:04:07.799> and<00:04:08.090> usually<00:04:09.090> there<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.569> two

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
so and usually there are two

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.509 
so and usually there are two
combinations<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.680> different<00:04:10.829> things<00:04:11.310> like

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
combinations of different things like

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.580 
combinations of different things like
that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
that

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.930 
that
this<00:04:13.590> one<00:04:13.769> lets<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.160> have<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.609> two<00:04:14.760> wall

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
this one lets you have the two wall

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.879 
this one lets you have the two wall
pirates<00:04:15.359> or<00:04:15.449> you<00:04:15.599> can<00:04:15.720> place<00:04:15.930> both<00:04:16.260> dice<00:04:16.650> you

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
pirates or you can place both dice you

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.370 
pirates or you can place both dice you
rolled<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.609> turn<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.269> so<00:04:18.959> all<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.260> this

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
rolled on that turn and so all of this

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.760 
rolled on that turn and so all of this
that<00:04:20.099> you're<00:04:20.250> doing<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.840> win<00:04:22.169> points<00:04:22.410> and

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
that you're doing is to win points and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.610 
that you're doing is to win points and
once<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.160> deck<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.669> completely<00:04:24.270> gone<00:04:24.620> then

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
once the deck is completely gone then

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.290 
once the deck is completely gone then
you're<00:04:25.860> going<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.220> compare<00:04:26.550> each<00:04:26.760> color<00:04:27.090> you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
you're going to compare each color you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.170 
you're going to compare each color you
have<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:28.590> your<00:04:28.770> opponent's<00:04:29.460> color<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.000> so

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
have to your opponent's color and so

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.439 
have to your opponent's color and so
let's<00:04:30.419> say<00:04:30.720> we<00:04:31.169> have<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.370> they<00:04:32.729> have<00:04:32.970> five

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
let's say we have this they have five

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.180 
let's say we have this they have five
orange<00:04:33.900> here<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.349> I've<00:04:34.440> decided<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.039> make

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
orange here and I've decided to make

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.000 
orange here and I've decided to make
that<00:04:35.219> orange<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:35.909> I<00:04:35.940> have<00:04:36.330> six<00:04:36.780> orange<00:04:37.260> well

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
that orange so I have six orange well

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.380 
that orange so I have six orange well
I'm<00:04:38.130> going<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.849> four

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
I'm going to get four

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.260 
I'm going to get four
orange<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:40.740> strength<00:04:41.220> of<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.700> pirates<00:04:42.120> I'm

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
orange the strength of the pirates I'm

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.500 
orange the strength of the pirates I'm
able<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.660> beat<00:04:43.020> up<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.530> then<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.510> have

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
able to beat up and then and have

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.770 
able to beat up and then and have
dominance<00:04:46.200> over<00:04:46.410> so<00:04:46.980> for<00:04:47.850> orange<00:04:48.270> I'll<00:04:48.510> get

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
dominance over so for orange I'll get

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.490 
dominance over so for orange I'll get
five<00:04:49.260> but<00:04:50.250> if<00:04:50.340> my<00:04:50.460> opponent<00:04:50.910> had<00:04:51.030> this<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:52.290> I

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
five but if my opponent had this and I

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.090 
five but if my opponent had this and I
still<00:04:52.770> had<00:04:52.950> six<00:04:53.250> then<00:04:53.520> for<00:04:53.670> orange<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.210> get<00:04:54.420> two

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
still had six then for orange I get two

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.010 
still had six then for orange I get two
so<00:04:56.100> once<00:04:56.700> you've<00:04:56.880> got<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.120> nice<00:04:57.390> big<00:04:57.690> lead<00:04:57.990> in

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
so once you've got a nice big lead in

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.920 
so once you've got a nice big lead in
something<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.100> your<00:04:59.880> opponent<00:05:00.270> has<00:05:00.360> nothing

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
something and your opponent has nothing

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.510 
something and your opponent has nothing
in<00:05:01.050> that<00:05:01.200> color<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.590> need<00:05:01.800> to<00:05:01.920> be<00:05:02.070> really

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
in that color you need to be really

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.660 
in that color you need to be really
careful<00:05:02.760> if<00:05:03.090> they<00:05:03.240> don't<00:05:03.450> get<00:05:03.600> some<00:05:03.870> low<00:05:04.200> card

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
careful if they don't get some low card

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.210 
careful if they don't get some low card
because<00:05:05.670> if<00:05:06.060> your<00:05:06.690> opponent<00:05:07.140> has<00:05:07.170> nothing<00:05:08.070> in

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
because if your opponent has nothing in

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.820 
because if your opponent has nothing in
that<00:05:08.250> color<00:05:08.670> then<00:05:09.270> you<00:05:09.300> do<00:05:09.750> score<00:05:10.230> your<00:05:10.410> own<00:05:10.560> so

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
that color then you do score your own so

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.860 
that color then you do score your own so
I<00:05:10.860> would<00:05:11.010> get<00:05:11.160> eight<00:05:11.430> but<00:05:12.210> if<00:05:12.330> they're<00:05:12.480> able<00:05:12.660> to

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
I would get eight but if they're able to

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.110 
I would get eight but if they're able to
snatched<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.530> even<00:05:13.920> this<00:05:14.040> one<00:05:14.370> card<00:05:14.730> I<00:05:14.940> they

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
snatched it even this one card I they

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.880 
snatched it even this one card I they
suddenly<00:05:15.420> take<00:05:15.750> in<00:05:15.900> my<00:05:16.080> score<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.440> orange

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
suddenly take in my score and orange

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.690 
suddenly take in my score and orange
from<00:05:17.220> eight<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:18.270> three<00:05:19.070> that's<00:05:20.070> basically<00:05:20.520> the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
from eight to three that's basically the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.890 
from eight to three that's basically the
game<00:05:20.880> you<00:05:21.030> play<00:05:21.060> until<00:05:21.480> the<00:05:21.600> deck<00:05:21.780> is

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
game you play until the deck is

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.230 
game you play until the deck is
completely<00:05:22.410> gone<00:05:22.590> you<00:05:23.310> count<00:05:23.640> up<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:23.820> points

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
completely gone you count up the points

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.270 
completely gone you count up the points
in<00:05:24.330> each<00:05:24.510> you<00:05:24.960> see<00:05:25.170> who<00:05:25.320> wins<00:05:25.650> they<00:05:25.980> get<00:05:26.190> the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
in each you see who wins they get the

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.100 
in each you see who wins they get the
other<00:05:26.430> person's<00:05:26.850> points<00:05:27.360> unless<00:05:27.630> they<00:05:27.870> have

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
other person's points unless they have

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
opponent has or doesn't have because you

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.470 
opponent has or doesn't have because you
