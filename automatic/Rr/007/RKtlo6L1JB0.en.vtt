00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
lightly mist it you don't even need a

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
lightly mist it you don't even need a
lot<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.840> little<00:01:16.080> bit<00:01:16.229> literally<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
lot just a little bit literally just a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
lot just a little bit literally just a
little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.710> just

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
little bit and then all you do you just

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.580 
little bit and then all you do you just
take<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.220> flat<00:01:20.460> iron<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.939> straighten<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
take your flat iron and straighten it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.890

what's<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.250> argan<00:01:24.210> oil<00:01:26.720> from<00:01:27.720> Morocco

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.810 
what's in it is argan oil from Morocco
and<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.650> actually<00:01:28.829> works<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.369> well

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and it actually works really well

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
and it actually works really well
because<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.240> gets<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.659> moisture<00:01:31.290> deep

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
because it gets a lot of moisture deep

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.310 
because it gets a lot of moisture deep
down<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> cuticles<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.110> hair<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
down in the cuticles of your hair that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.030 
down in the cuticles of your hair that
you<00:01:34.619> would<00:01:34.860> need<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.340> about<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.820> some

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
you would need to think about with some

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
you would need to think about with some
simple<00:01:38.040> straightening<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.750> one

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
simple straightening this and this one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.960 
simple straightening this and this one
is<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.650> heat<00:01:40.950> protectant<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.700> well

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
is actually a heat protectant as well

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.999 
is actually a heat protectant as well
they<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.720> advertise<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> is

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
they don't really advertise that it is

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.910 
they don't really advertise that it is
but<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> definitely<00:01:45.780> tell<00:01:46.079> if<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.560> use

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
but you can definitely tell if you use

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.749 
but you can definitely tell if you use
any<00:01:47.570> straightening<00:01:48.570> products<00:01:48.990> before<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
know what a heat protectant does so this

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.350 
know what a heat protectant does so this
one<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:59.130> was<00:02:00.000> gonna<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:00.299> my

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
one as you can see I was gonna take my

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.020 
one as you can see I was gonna take my
comb<00:02:03.979> kind<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.070> comb<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> down<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:05.790> bit

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
comb kind of comb it down a little bit

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.080 
comb kind of comb it down a little bit
but<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:07.380> does<00:02:07.619> make<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.099> hair<00:02:08.340> feel<00:02:08.700> really
