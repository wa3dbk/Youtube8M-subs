00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.140
 Oh my God 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.830
 let's talk today about fashion fashion 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.170
 this that is now carried passenger use that 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.630
 regulate according to the taste of the moment 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.270
 way of dressing the living and so on 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.570
 According to this definition, fashion is something 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.640
 that in theory we like and understand by 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.160
 what we do ourselves but I 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.870
 I'm going to put in doubt 10 fashions that you like 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.910
 to the people and that I understand it because to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 people like to see if I match 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.150
 you do not feel so lonely alone 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.000
 I'm alone fashion I do not understand this 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.730
 so ugly to despair teeth here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.440
 I will forward zac efron how handsome he 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.900
 is and with enough if the position and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.239
 as was the child that is now expected 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.159
 employ that higher priority mouth as 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.650
 I like it, I do not like it 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.440
 second stupid fashion this has come up 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.839
 Now recently it's get well 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.299
 being chichi as an iron for 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.130
 separate the legs so that when you 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.560
 you have someone new antennae coming out 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.560
 hence you see them separately 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.450
 third relationship to fashion the 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.000
 bell pants history high 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.760
 say that the bell pants are 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.100
 the evil are made by the devil are 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.930
 ugly in its origins two screens of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.390
 bell were made for those of the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.280
 American Navy because something so ugly 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.620
 because because being made from below is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.330
 they could take off their pants and take off 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.550
 the boots and that maintains then to do 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.680
 striptease because against something does not work and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.260
 they were also like that because you can see they could 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.630
 serve as a float because it entered the 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.760
 air below the leg and clear that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.530

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.180
 normal street people because it does not work 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.700

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.979
 come back and if they come back you have to do it 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.730
