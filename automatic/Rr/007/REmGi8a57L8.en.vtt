00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
so you want to make sure your primroses

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.829 
so you want to make sure your primroses
are<00:00:51.409> have<00:00:52.400> plenty<00:00:52.760> of<00:00:52.850> blooms<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.479> be<00:00:53.600> able<00:00:53.750> to

this is new breeding right here there's
a<00:01:10.640> lot<00:01:10.820> of<00:01:10.970> genetic<00:01:11.810> diversity<00:01:12.440> in<00:01:12.590> some<00:01:12.799> of

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
a lot of genetic diversity in some of

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.340 
a lot of genetic diversity in some of
these<00:01:12.979> new<00:01:13.600> varieties<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:14.780> as<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.049> look<00:01:15.229> at

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
these new varieties so as we look at

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.690 
these new varieties so as we look at
these<00:01:16.600> really<00:01:17.600> unique<00:01:18.020> blooms<00:01:18.799> such<00:01:19.369> as<00:01:19.549> this

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
these really unique blooms such as this

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.569 
these really unique blooms such as this
one<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:21.020> find<00:01:21.320> these<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.859> retail<00:01:22.250> store

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
one you find these in the retail store

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.179 
one you find these in the retail store
many<00:01:22.850> times<00:01:23.149> they're<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.869> lot<00:01:24.289> more<00:01:24.320> expensive

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
many times they're a lot more expensive

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.249 
many times they're a lot more expensive
than<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.549> standard<00:01:26.060> down<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.659> a<00:01:26.750> type

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
than the standard down of a type

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.859 
than the standard down of a type
Primula<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:28.880> think<00:01:29.149> they're<00:01:29.329> well<00:01:29.539> worth

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
Primula but I think they're well worth

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.139 
Primula but I think they're well worth
it<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.350> lot<00:01:31.039> of<00:01:31.130> people<00:01:31.340> say<00:01:31.549> they<00:01:31.759> don't<00:01:31.969> really

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
it a lot of people say they don't really

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.779 
it a lot of people say they don't really
have<00:01:32.359> the<00:01:32.420> ability<00:01:33.109> to<00:01:33.320> take<00:01:33.890> care<00:01:34.189> of<00:01:34.250> plants

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
have the ability to take care of plants

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.849 
have the ability to take care of plants
they<00:01:35.570> feel<00:01:35.810> like<00:01:35.929> they<00:01:36.140> don't<00:01:36.170> have<00:01:36.439> a<00:01:36.590> green

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
they feel like they don't have a green

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.870 
they feel like they don't have a green
thumb<00:01:37.119> but<00:01:38.259> these<00:01:39.310> primroses<00:01:40.310> are<00:01:40.609> really

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
thumb but these primroses are really

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.279 
thumb but these primroses are really
quite<00:01:41.149> easy<00:01:41.179> to<00:01:41.570> take<00:01:41.719> care<00:01:41.929> of<00:01:42.049> we've<00:01:42.259> done

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
quite easy to take care of we've done

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.749 
quite easy to take care of we've done
all<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.799> work<00:01:42.979> right<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.549> at<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
all the work right here at the

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.480 
all the work right here at the
greenhouse<00:01:43.999> already<00:01:45.219> they've<00:01:46.219> been

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
greenhouse already they've been

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.060 
greenhouse already they've been
fertilized<00:01:47.090> they've<00:01:47.869> got<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.109> well<00:01:48.380> balanced

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
fertilized they've got a well balanced

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.830 
fertilized they've got a well balanced
fertilizer<00:01:49.670> we<00:01:49.939> don't<00:01:50.149> give<00:01:50.390> them<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.600> lot<00:01:50.630> of

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
fertilizer we don't give them a lot of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.870 
fertilizer we don't give them a lot of
high<00:01:51.499> nitrogen<00:01:52.009> at<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.429> time<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.850> year

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
high nitrogen at this time of the year

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.310 
high nitrogen at this time of the year
because<00:01:53.210> there's<00:01:53.479> not<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.689> lot<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.869> active

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
because there's not a lot of active

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.419 
because there's not a lot of active
growing<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:56.780> reality<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.799> that<00:01:57.829> you

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
growing but the reality is is that you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.130 
growing but the reality is is that you
can<00:01:58.579> take<00:01:58.789> bring<00:01:58.999> this<00:01:59.149> plant<00:01:59.450> into<00:01:59.689> your<00:01:59.929> home
