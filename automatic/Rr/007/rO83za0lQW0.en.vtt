00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 show another small tutorial today 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.000
 I give you the winterberg configurator 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.800
 First up here you go on the left 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.889
 in the description then you invite yourself 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.590
 on this page the small program 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.570
 it can be down that you are there 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.490
 All you have to do is register with the bird 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.960
 free 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 if you have downloaded the lead 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 He beautiful the file from here as usual 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.070
 still nice after an explanation then 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.149
 you have this icon on the desktop 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 this leads you back then as 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
 administrator from either right click 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.540
 as administrator or under 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.129
 characteristics here and then here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.059
 program as administrator execute the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.309
 put checkmark in place 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.800
 ok then confirm 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.239
 then the program opens with this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.250
 you can still program winterberg 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.100
 always adjust more precisely first 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 you choose the murder here then 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.789
 can you already look here if you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.890
 wanted to start your shift and then 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.850
 Here is the home page I call now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.409
 times in mp4 has different maps the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.229
 could choose either freeplay 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.580
 challenge multiplayer and the deluxe 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.100
 version is still replay deluxe and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 challenge de luxe who could choose 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 which you then start in the game then 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 it has the settings in the op 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 It Snow shocks zoom camera and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 everything here i am the level difficulty 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.820
 there you can ever for one percent 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.909
 the inserts which inserts are here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 again settings to the individual 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.070
 sound then you can choose here 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.369
 which web deposited behind the maps 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 is 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.380
 in the 30 winterberg summer winter then here 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.170
 again the graphics settings completely 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 then normally you can use under 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 adjust which inserts want to have 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.549
 the traffic accident brender train ever 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.450
 after this 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 I would recommend bombing here and 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.290
 Take a bomb breaker from here so one 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.270
 put out hook there winterberg there still 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.729
 a bug in it has who every time if 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.340
 you get the bomb room service 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.599
 the game crashes i do not know if it is 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850
 but I have already been resolved 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.290
 do not believe it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.880
 then under vehicles you can 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.670
 adjust what the vehicles loaded 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.860
 have for example take the 844 two 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.230
 I now have four respirators 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.090
 2 emil protective suits according to the same 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.230
 You can still do a quick attack here 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.820
 I could adjust exactly now 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.140
 Set rescue scissors 10 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.190
 but then do not stop again 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.230
 true to the original I then choose from 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.670
 which when vehicles move in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.230
 which order and what for 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.540
 Vehicles come so if I am now 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:49.650
 example local alarms comes with me 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.300
 the wmf drk tlf and again a tlf that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.980
 but not as there is only one 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:00.690
 tlf in glk I take now for example 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:05.390
 Out because I always turn the ladder 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:11.460
 to manually alarm so save 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.680
 yes, yes, to the whole to the 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.030
 program i can only recommend it 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.200
 worthwhile in any case is to 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.240
 install because you always want to 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.540
 make small changes and 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.830
 simply perfect and through the program 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.990
 before you forget it when you're up 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.630
 this icon clicks here starts the mode 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.070
 directly so city winterberg's fashion 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.020
 is loading you can directly with the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.330
 Fashion does not have to start playing 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.430
 select manually 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.140
 god that was a little tutorial i 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.740
 Hope you liked it we'll see each other 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.740
 then later
