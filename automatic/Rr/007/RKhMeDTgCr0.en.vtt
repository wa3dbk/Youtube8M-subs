00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
ways of folding the smart cover for the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.560 
ways of folding the smart cover for the
iPad<00:00:13.019> 2<00:00:13.340> Apple<00:00:14.340> has<00:00:14.490> two<00:00:14.759> ways<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> folding<00:00:15.420> it

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
iPad 2 Apple has two ways of folding it

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.510 
iPad 2 Apple has two ways of folding it
the<00:00:15.780> first<00:00:16.020> way<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.619> typing<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> iPad

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the first way is for typing on the iPad

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.240 
the first way is for typing on the iPad
which<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.359> find<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.140> angle<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.740> too<00:00:20.039> low

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
which I find the angle to be too low

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.970 
which I find the angle to be too low
it's<00:00:20.939> hard<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.300> see<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> screen<00:00:21.900> if<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> iPad

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it's hard to see the screen if the iPad

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040 
it's hard to see the screen if the iPad
is<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> desk<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.359> your<00:00:24.390> lap<00:00:24.689> that's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
is on a desk if it's on your lap that's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.859 
is on a desk if it's on your lap that's
okay<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.130> second<00:00:26.580> way<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.390> standing<00:00:27.779> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
okay the second way is for standing it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.380 
okay the second way is for standing it
up<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.560> watching<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.920> movie<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:30.029> find<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
up for watching a movie and I find the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
up for watching a movie and I find the
angle<00:00:30.720> too<00:00:31.019> high<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.980> hard<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.430> see<00:00:32.579> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
angle too high here it's hard to see the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
angle too high here it's hard to see the
screen<00:00:32.820> unless<00:00:33.360> you're<00:00:33.540> sitting<00:00:33.750> three<00:00:33.870> to

of folding the triangle all the way down
to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> bottom<00:00:59.309> flush<00:00:59.760> against<00:01:00.120> disc<00:01:00.420> I'm

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
to the bottom flush against disc I'm

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.720 
to the bottom flush against disc I'm
going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> lift<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.219> make<00:01:02.430> sure<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
tip of that triangle you can see the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820 
tip of that triangle you can see the
angle<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.000> much<00:01:12.240> lower<00:01:12.540> than<00:01:12.810> before<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.650> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
angle is much lower than before this is

feet away alright next apples way of
folding<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.710> smart<00:01:26.250> cover<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.729> typing<00:01:27.060> has<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
folding a smart cover for typing has a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
folding a smart cover for typing has a
very<00:01:27.570> low<00:01:27.869> angle<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> makes<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.280> hard<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
very low angle so it makes it hard to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.969 
very low angle so it makes it hard to
see<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.850> screen<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> iPad<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.860> the
