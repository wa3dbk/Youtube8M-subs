00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.879
 I do not have it 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 I also have art at the age of 16 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.980

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.160

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
 older than me 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 my mother 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.810
 Franco Foda does not have to worry about that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.750
 maybe there is yes 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.750
 we artists can reach approx 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 my mother of all 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.720
 To make demi accessible 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.720
 I always have three to four 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 good but my privacy 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.510
 on Tuesday 8 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.940
 so have decreased 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.790
 I could get the car 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 my mother tracked down what is the best 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.440
 do not follow any 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.930
 Maybe should 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.420
 Hattendorf 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.130
 Defense chain left dpa 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.000
 however activity 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 rtl editor could get people jobs 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.140
 many people agreed 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.959
 much narrower 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.579
 leaves a judge 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.079
 Euro costs here 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:20.079
 and when we met 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 it was from Chile 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.839
 Elise of the contract 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:40.439
 I think it was a lot of fun now 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.829
 25 million 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.839
 Dublin SID 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.839
 the time 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.160
 Freedom ultimately love him to limit his funeral boundaries 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.619
 quite clearly 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:57.909
 in self-forgetfulness 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.909
 for this purpose is 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.569
 Luis last time 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.149
 somehow a thing 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.059
 Sarah of art 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:12.719
 when you become somebody 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.930
 That fit the outraged and the pictures would have to emerge 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.149
 himself 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.149
 Commander himself regulates 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:30.539
 for the chapter 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.539
 because at Kandersteg off again 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 I was great that was not the provocation 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.689
 I look up in the pictures 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.459
 but I say now as I was so to speak 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.689
 like the landscape 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.069
 Lena stature 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.259
 suddenly should give a product 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.319
 and nobody that Kapsch 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.319
 So I was not there 

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.679
 I have to do what I should say again 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.309
 the animal Electric and again meets say mirror-smooth 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:10.539
 for more fun Apple's iPad 

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:13.629
 Stories or a gas once again say what chaos 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.389
 unlocked 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:18.769
 that none of the boss 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.769
 "One would become one's own art 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:23.979
 where you can not anymore 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.479
 and I had 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.189
 Subject object 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:29.099
 to make a difference 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.650
 In life, both are so in the game 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.650
 that one does not know who feels. "That was not the move 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.110
 and remember 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.120
 Remember they were still at their beginning 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.120
 Henkel have 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.619
 Florian decorating a clothesline 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.719
 as the market 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.159
 make that a clash again 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:01.819
 we become the idea 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.559
 with new ideas we like to do together 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.009
 I would be something like that 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.300
 Thomas is different 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.300
 made is done 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.629
 Naumburg her way 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.389
 But what makes it look so that you can almost say 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.499
 what's happening now that happens 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.419
 Barroso 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.860
 now it has a lot 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.860
 event 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.439
 but that's it Top Super already at halftime 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:35.300
