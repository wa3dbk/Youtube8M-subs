00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
trick you're gonna need slide gloves

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.630 
trick you're gonna need slide gloves
that<00:00:58.870> have<00:00:59.020> good<00:00:59.200> slide<00:00:59.530> pucks<00:01:01.140> also<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.640> said

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
that have good slide pucks also I said

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.060 
that have good slide pucks also I said
you<00:01:03.700> don't<00:01:03.820> need<00:01:04.030> them<00:01:04.239> but<00:01:04.479> I<00:01:04.750> mean<00:01:05.020> you<00:01:05.920> could

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
you don't need them but I mean you could

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.280 
you don't need them but I mean you could
have<00:01:06.190> some<00:01:06.370> crazy<00:01:06.640> hands<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.630> deal<00:01:07.960> without

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
have some crazy hands and deal without

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.140 
have some crazy hands and deal without
but<00:01:09.130> yeah<00:01:09.280> you<00:01:09.340> should<00:01:09.520> probably<00:01:09.550> have<00:01:09.880> slide

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
but yeah you should probably have slide

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.230 
but yeah you should probably have slide
gloves<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:11.229> find<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.369> if<00:01:12.760> your<00:01:12.940> trucks

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
gloves and I find that if your trucks

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.960 
gloves and I find that if your trucks
are<00:01:13.390> looser<00:01:13.720> it's<00:01:13.869> easier<00:01:14.170> for<00:01:14.200> sliding<00:01:14.970> also

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
are looser it's easier for sliding also

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.490 
are looser it's easier for sliding also
harder<00:01:16.300> wheels<00:01:16.479> they're<00:01:16.720> easier<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:17.229> sliding

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
harder wheels they're easier for sliding

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.280 
harder wheels they're easier for sliding
and<00:01:17.860> softer<00:01:18.310> wheels<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:19.600> don't<00:01:19.750> need<00:01:19.930> them

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
and softer wheels you don't need them

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.560 
and softer wheels you don't need them
I<00:01:20.320> do<00:01:20.560> recommend<00:01:21.009> them<00:01:21.310> like<00:01:21.729> orangutan

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
I do recommend them like orangutan

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.620 
I do recommend them like orangutan
stimulus<00:01:23.170> that's<00:01:24.130> what<00:01:24.310> I'm<00:01:24.400> using<00:01:25.440> yeah

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
stimulus that's what I'm using yeah

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.960 
stimulus that's what I'm using yeah
bouncy<00:01:29.400> step<00:01:30.400> 1<00:01:30.670> put<00:01:31.150> on<00:01:31.300> your<00:01:31.509> gloves<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.700> get

on your board put it this way so it's

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.430 
on your board put it this way so it's
easier<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.350> see<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:39.330> alright<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:40.690> once<00:01:41.259> you're

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.840 

it's<00:03:58.930> doc<00:03:59.470> you're<00:03:59.739> gonna<00:03:59.800> start<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.459> and

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
you're not gonna have enough speed or

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.650 
you're not gonna have enough speed or
momentum<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.709> carry<00:04:03.010> around<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.459> 180<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:04.060> roll

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
momentum to carry around the 180 is roll

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.900 
momentum to carry around the 180 is roll
away<00:04:04.780> it's<00:04:05.440> another<00:04:05.650> tip<00:04:05.980> don't<00:04:06.370> lean<00:04:06.550> too<00:04:06.640> far

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
away it's another tip don't lean too far

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.460 
away it's another tip don't lean too far
back<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.420> too<00:04:07.570> much<00:04:07.720> on<00:04:07.870> your<00:04:07.989> heels

heels and then when you're done the

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.280 
heels and then when you're done the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
slide you're not gonna be able to stand

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.320 
slide you're not gonna be able to stand
up<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:15.160> you're<00:04:15.280> just<00:04:15.340> gonna<00:04:15.550> keep<00:04:15.790> rolling

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
up and you're just gonna keep rolling

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.300 
up and you're just gonna keep rolling
until<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:17.080> hit<00:04:17.169> something

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
another problem might have with this

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.680 
another problem might have with this

trick is once you're done the slide to
come<00:04:22.720> around<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.290> 180<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.130> you're<00:04:24.370> leaning

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
come around the 180 and you're leaning

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.850 
come around the 180 and you're leaning
way<00:04:24.880> too<00:04:24.940> much<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.510> your<00:04:25.690> front<00:04:25.870> foot<00:04:26.140> or<00:04:26.560> way
