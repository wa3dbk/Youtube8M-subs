00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
Royal crossbow is a lot better than the

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.849 
Royal crossbow is a lot better than the
zeriba<00:00:21.239> so<00:00:22.239> I<00:00:22.750> thought<00:00:23.380> that<00:00:23.590> the<00:00:23.650> zaire<00:00:23.829> I

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
zeriba so I thought that the zaire I

zeriba so I thought that the zaire I
bows<00:00:24.129> the<00:00:24.160> best<00:00:24.550> bow<00:00:24.730> in<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.879> game<00:00:25.180> but<00:00:25.750> for<00:00:26.169> PK

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
bows the best bow in the game but for PK

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
apparently the Royal crossbow is a

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.389 
apparently the Royal crossbow is a
little<00:00:28.869> bit<00:00:28.989> better<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.770> has<00:00:29.950> like<00:00:30.129> three

00:00:30.389 --> 00:00:30.399 
little bit better it has like three

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.190 
little bit better it has like three
hundred<00:00:30.520> damage<00:00:31.000> more<00:00:31.270> which<00:00:31.570> is<00:00:31.599> quite<00:00:31.899> good

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
hundred damage more which is quite good

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.459

and<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:33.610> all<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:33.969> requires<00:00:34.090> is<00:00:34.360> one<00:00:34.629> easy<00:00:34.960> class

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:35.469 
and it all it requires is one easy class

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.799 
and it all it requires is one easy class
and<00:00:35.940> I'll<00:00:36.940> leave<00:00:37.239> that<00:00:37.270> in<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.660> description

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
and I'll leave that in the description

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.010 
and I'll leave that in the description
it<00:00:38.500> takes<00:00:38.710> like<00:00:38.949> it<00:00:39.879> took<00:00:40.060> me<00:00:40.180> like<00:00:40.270> 15<00:00:40.720> minutes

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020
