00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
it's just getting them back up to speed

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.370 
it's just getting them back up to speed
really<00:02:11.270> getting<00:02:11.690> them<00:02:11.840> seeing<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.170> ball

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
really getting them seeing the ball

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.440

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
again getting their time in their

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.850 
again getting their time in their
reactions<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.110> then<00:02:15.260> getting<00:02:15.470> back<00:02:15.560> into

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
reactions and then getting back into

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.220 
reactions and then getting back into
things<00:02:16.070> like<00:02:16.390> cross<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.900> some<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.110> the

because it's not just a preseason game
for<00:03:58.250> them<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.520> is<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.640> big<00:03:58.910> big<00:03:59.210> opportunity<00:03:59.870> and

for them it is a big big opportunity and
a<00:04:00.020> chance<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.380> show<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:01.250> manager<00:04:01.430> especially

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760
