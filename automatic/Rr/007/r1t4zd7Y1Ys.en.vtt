install base for the Wii U you know what
what<00:01:38.070> would<00:01:38.159> happen<00:01:38.549> they<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.420> make<00:01:39.600> fronts

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
what would happen they would make fronts

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
what would happen they would make fronts
by<00:01:40.140> 3:00<00:01:40.439> work<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.100> maybe<00:01:41.759> they'd<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.030> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
by 3:00 work for it maybe they'd have to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210 
by 3:00 work for it maybe they'd have to
scale<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> couple<00:01:42.930> parts<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> down<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
scale a couple parts of it down and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.219 
scale a couple parts of it down and
maybe<00:01:44.700> some<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.479> lighting<00:01:45.930> wouldn't

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
maybe some kind of lighting wouldn't

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
maybe some kind of lighting wouldn't
work<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> textures<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> little

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
work or the textures would be a little

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.359 
work or the textures would be a little
bit<00:01:47.939> softer<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.200> people<00:01:49.380> would<00:01:49.710> buy<00:01:49.920> their

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
bit softer but if people would buy their

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.030 
bit softer but if people would buy their
games<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.060> him<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.290> make<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.799> games
