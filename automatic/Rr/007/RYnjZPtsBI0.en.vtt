00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
okay so if the wanna multiply two large

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:04.530 
okay so if the wanna multiply two large
numbers<00:03:59.820> over<00:04:00.820> there<00:04:01.030> was<00:04:03.180> multiplied<00:04:04.180> alum

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
numbers over there was multiplied alum

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.860 
numbers over there was multiplied alum
bomb<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.989> top<00:04:07.650> by<00:04:08.650> first<00:04:09.450> however<00:04:10.450> many
