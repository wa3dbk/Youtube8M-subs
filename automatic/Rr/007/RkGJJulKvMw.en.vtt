accommodating<00:01:16.250> now<00:01:16.970> what's<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.330> standard

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
accommodating now what's the standard

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.160 
accommodating now what's the standard
head<00:01:17.930> for<00:01:18.229> that<00:01:18.880> I<00:01:19.880> think<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.780> standard<00:01:21.050> head

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
head for that I think the standard head

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.870 
head for that I think the standard head
would<00:01:21.260> be<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> vacuum<00:01:21.800> flushing<00:01:22.190> okay<00:01:22.400> well

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
would be the vacuum flushing okay well

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.280 
would be the vacuum flushing okay well
so<00:01:23.330> pretty<00:01:23.600> upscale<00:01:24.100> now<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.940> the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290
