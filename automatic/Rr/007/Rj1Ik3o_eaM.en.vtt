 everyone welcome again on the day of 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.740
 today we are back again 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.380
 plants against zombies garden warfare and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.730
 today we are back again 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.799
 specifically with 1 episode of what 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.299
 it's road to where stickers and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.390
 just today I think he plays 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.039
 episode number 45 and good guys 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.270
 basically you already know the dynamics of what 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.769
 what is this series that currently 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 we have inside the channel which 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.580
 basically consists of acquiring what 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 they are envelopes but specifically 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.060
 about these 20 thousand hits and how 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.980
 we did it since the last episode 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.899
 thanks to the good amount of coins 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.130
 that I have out there stored equally 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.960
 in this episode I'll buy what 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.000
 there are three of them one of each type of 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.469
 which also cost 20,000 like that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.879
 what are you guys so as not to continue extending me? 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 more with this topic I'm going to start now 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.390
 because it robs them and on a few occasions in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.770
 which confuses me enough for the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 comments from people who tell me that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 I talk too long 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.469
 there are people who say they want to watch videos 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.719
 much longer there really are times that 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.610
 you do not get into some kind of confusion 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.989
 and I really do not know or want to see what 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 is what they would really like so 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.230
 guys we go there especially for 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.969
 try to finish the week of the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.850
 best possible way so let's go to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.020
 start with what is the prize envelope 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.939
 obviously he will be the first 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.429
 unlock and let's see what we have 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.689
 just in these moments fuck 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:15.329
 guys we know we have obviously 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.210
 nine cards and the first one goes 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.219
 to be a piece a sticker of what 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.899
 is one of the carnivorous plants I think 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.100
 that this is the one of fire this I believe that already 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.479
 I've seen him in some video 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 specifically I think this already the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.829
 has carlos so guys we have a 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 piece of what this character is for 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.640
 Here we also have a sticker of a 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.560
 sunflower I think it's the electric 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.360
 which we already have the third would be or 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.520
 would be three of them already and only we 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.739
 two are missing to try to finish what 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 what is this character we have here 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:45.000
 that petazeta equally these are 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.340
 rather consumable accessories for 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.750
 garden operations and all that what is 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.780
 this fish 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.549
 - restored is an accessory rather 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.709
 accessory anointing I think an improvement or 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.720
 skill for the marine biologist the 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.909
 fish appetizer the gift of the zombie dolphin 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.399
 they are less slippery so they 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.810
 get better recharge times or 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.219
 very well this does serve them 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.920
 specifically for the marine biologist 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.660
 so that it recharges faster 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.489
 which is ammunition which is super good 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.050
 for that character so we have 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.460
 Peas even more 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.380
 hot is specifically a 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.210
 Fire paralyzing ability increases 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.270
 the ammunition capacity with the 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.320
 pea discovery more 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.660
 hot wow is going to give you much more 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.240
 power to that character we have here 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.860
 a retro hat man something like that is a 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.650
 castle for what soldiers are 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.780
 we have here a cookie vacuum cleaner 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.910
 I think it's 'the whiskers' that it has 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.610
 just under his nose for the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.320
 star engineers to omit challenge very 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.880
 well we have three of omit challenge which 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.440
 it comes super good for some occasions 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.660
 of which we have a bit of laziness 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 when doing challenges and we have curl 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.930
 equally a gesture a mockery for the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.390
 sunflowers we go with the following 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.700
 guys one of what is about the plant 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.990
 incredible and let's see what has us 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.780
 We really hope that something good we are going 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.970
 to see what we have right here and good 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.100
 guys we have just for the part 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 of the wow stickers for the part of 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.210
 the stickers we have here what is 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.500
 one more of what is a plant that 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.050
 above which I left that little bit 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 a piece we see that we got the part 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.590
 from up to down and here we have new 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.450
 character unblocked the cactus 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.319
 powerful wow unlocked guys not 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.209
 we must make cactus 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.920
 electric can be called that and already 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.599
 we have the last stone guys I think 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.549
 that this is going to meditate in a next 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.950
 video a like with this new character 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.420
 clear yes yes guys we continue 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.980
 also with what are the fangs 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.870
 also an accessory for 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.329
 carnivorous we have here petazeta 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.489
 obviously consumables we have here 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.799
 more mysterious power for the flower 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.930
 mystical ammunition capacity increases 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.519
 in a very mysterious way is a 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.370
 new skill that if I'm not wrong 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.829
 for what is the mystic flower peas 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.959
 even more toxic what are more toxic 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.079
 they increase the ammunition capacity and they are 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.209
 good to be in regime go I think 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.889
 that is going to be kind of having a 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.079
 little more ammunition within what is 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.030
 the character of the toxic instant we have 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.519
 over here striped is a tattoo for 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.199
 carnivorous we have eye paint a 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.480
 accessory and rather a tattoo for what 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.669
 that are the spear peas and we have 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.870
 retry of team by two to 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.340
 perform equally this video guys 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.130
 we go quickly with what is the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.930
 envelope of the vengeful zombie doctor and 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.340
 Let's see what Earth is going for in 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.470
 this moment especially for what 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.810
 they are the subject of the zombies and good 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.970
 guys we have right here 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.040
 ok we have first of all a sticker 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 for what is an engineer we have to 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.610
 the top the head of this no 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.800
 I had no piece so it's the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.600
 first we have here sticker 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.450
 character is also there is the second 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.280
 piece of equally of an engineer 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.410
 we continue with what is mega bomb 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.450
 curative poplar the sea to mega bomb 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.700
 curative is very popular in the 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.800
 parties you just have to throw it to a 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.830
 group of friends and watch how they recover 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.900
 health right in front of your eyes go 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.340
 sounds pretty good it's like it's the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.080
 another skill from the other rather 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.610
 accessory to fill the blood of your 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.800
 but this time has friends like 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.990
 one form of the other bombard 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.300
 explode of the scientists we have for 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.370
 Each layer of light is a super accessory 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.990
 weird for what the engineers are 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.669
 my goalkeeper five of them for 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.729
 obviously zombie garden operations 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.389
 latrine equally and here we have 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.669
 Curve and child storage 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.740
 enriched that that's one more skill 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.040
 well without skill for the toxic doctor 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.530
 the storage of uranium increases the 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.020
 ammunition capacity when recharging the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.520
 thing that holds it apparently trellis 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.500
 of ammunition inside what is the weapon 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.910
 of the toxic doctor which comes super 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.979
 well because if you remember the episode 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.650
 of air that character only counts 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.629
 with 5 shots which does not very 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.340
 well not very effective specifically for 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:46.349
 this topic so this comes in super good 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.849
 to obviously improve that character 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.830
 but it's so that security is what 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.409
 first an accessory for engineers 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.419
 and finally we have half and half 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.830
 personalization of facial hair what 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.300
 we have that he has half the mustache and 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.009
 half of the bar only one 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.240
 side so girls basically what 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.860
 we have for today is forgiveness of 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.270
 true that they have enjoyed this room 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.310
 episode remember in the bottom 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.900
 in the description have all the 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.099
 videos of plants against zombies all 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.720
 the episodes of all the laws that 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.669
 we currently have in this game 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.319
 also remember that the description 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.090
 in the first line we also have what 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.650
 which is very important social networks 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.300
 to join and all that so guys 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.530
 meanwhile I already say goodbye not 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.759
 forget to tell me what you think about this 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.560
 video give like so that more people 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.060
 can get to see it and especially 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.580
