you think the simpsons have grown as a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.300 
you think the simpsons have grown as a
showrunner<00:01:13.320> my<00:01:13.560> goal<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.040> they<00:01:14.130> never

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
really grow or learn anything always

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
really grow or learn anything always
return<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> same<00:01:16.920> point<00:01:17.190> they<00:01:17.310> started
