I'm gonna make a guess here and I'm
gonna<00:02:17.569> take<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.440> at<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.680> but<00:02:18.920> i'm<00:02:19.069> going<00:02:19.250> to

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
gonna take a look at it but i'm going to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.730 
gonna take a look at it but i'm going to
guess<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:19.970> african<00:02:20.480> cherry<00:02:21.880> it's<00:02:22.880> not<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
guess this is african cherry it's not a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.070 
guess this is african cherry it's not a
cut<00:02:24.740> that's<00:02:24.950> highly<00:02:25.520> figured<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.270> this<00:02:26.870> has

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
cut that's highly figured but this has

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.240 
cut that's highly figured but this has
some<00:02:27.290> figuring<00:02:27.740> in<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.130> can<00:02:28.160> see<00:02:28.570> with<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
some figuring in it you can see with the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.880 
some figuring in it you can see with the
up<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.400> down<00:02:31.660> those<00:02:32.660> eggs<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:35.350> i<00:02:36.350> don't<00:02:36.830> know

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
up and down those eggs and i don't know

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.620 
up and down those eggs and i don't know
what<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> technical<00:02:37.580> term<00:02:37.730> for<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.030> is<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
what the technical term for that is I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.680 
what the technical term for that is I
can<00:02:39.320> do<00:02:39.440> some<00:02:39.620> research<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.160> fine<00:02:40.400> but<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:41.569> a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
can do some research and fine but it's a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.380 
can do some research and fine but it's a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
plate to fits up against this as you put

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.800 
plate to fits up against this as you put
tension<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.890> strings<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:56.269> plate<00:03:56.570> will

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
tension on the strings the plate will

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.729 
tension on the strings the plate will
actually<00:03:57.380> bend<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.190> little<00:03:58.220> bit<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:59.739> believe

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
actually bend a little bit and believe

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.710 
actually bend a little bit and believe
it<00:04:00.860> not<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.130> does<00:04:01.340> I've<00:04:01.700> seen<00:04:02.299> I've<00:04:02.480> actually

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
it not it does I've seen I've actually

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.750 
it not it does I've seen I've actually
seen<00:04:03.079> it<00:04:03.230> happen<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.590> cast-iron<00:04:04.160> plate<00:04:04.459> will

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
seen it happen that cast-iron plate will

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.710 
seen it happen that cast-iron plate will
do<00:04:04.970> that<00:04:05.209> and<00:04:07.030> this<00:04:08.030> piece<00:04:09.100> fits<00:04:10.100> here<00:04:10.489> and

do that and this piece fits here and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.930 
do that and this piece fits here and
it's<00:04:11.720> needed<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.260> tighten<00:04:12.769> that<00:04:12.980> gap<00:04:13.280> up<00:04:13.579> or

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
it's needed to tighten that gap up or

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.029 
it's needed to tighten that gap up or

installed and strong and that piece was
forgotten<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.580> luckily<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.850> plate<00:04:30.090> wasn't

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
forgotten and luckily the plate wasn't

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.450 
forgotten and luckily the plate wasn't
broken<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:31.169> when<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.710> tension<00:04:32.130> was<00:04:32.220> let<00:04:32.430> down

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
broken but when the tension was let down

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.290 
broken but when the tension was let down
that<00:04:33.169> gap<00:04:34.169> opened<00:04:34.590> up<00:04:34.740> enough<00:04:35.220> for<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.060> piece

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
that gap opened up enough for that piece

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.270 
that gap opened up enough for that piece
to<00:04:36.449> be<00:04:36.539> put<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.900> there<00:04:37.110> it's<00:04:37.530> phenomenal<00:04:38.130> but

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
to be put in there it's phenomenal but

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.480 
to be put in there it's phenomenal but
the<00:04:39.180> plate<00:04:39.479> has<00:04:39.690> about<00:04:39.990> 20<00:04:40.440> tons<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.949> stress<00:04:41.280> on

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
the plate has about 20 tons of stress on

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.300 
the plate has about 20 tons of stress on
it<00:04:41.520> when<00:04:41.880> it's<00:04:42.259> brought<00:04:43.259> up<00:04:43.500> to<00:04:43.650> pitch<00:04:44.060> so

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
it when it's brought up to pitch so

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.670 
it when it's brought up to pitch so
that's<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.490> lot<00:04:47.729> of<00:04:47.759> pressure<00:04:48.470> in<00:04:49.470> any<00:04:49.620> case

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
that's a lot of pressure in any case

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.059 
that's a lot of pressure in any case

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.129 
instrument when it's finished I'm going
to<00:05:07.979> see<00:05:08.160> if<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.370> can<00:05:08.580> maybe<00:05:09.330> get<00:05:09.570> some<00:05:09.810> video<00:05:09.960> of

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
to see if I can maybe get some video of

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.379 
to see if I can maybe get some video of
it<00:05:10.410> being<00:05:10.590> played<00:05:10.949> here's<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.910> pin<00:05:12.180> block

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
it being played here's the pin block

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.020 
it being played here's the pin block
here<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:13.800> probably<00:05:14.039> saw<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.490> few<00:05:14.520> seconds

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
here you probably saw it a few seconds

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.890 
here you probably saw it a few seconds
ago<00:05:15.120> I<00:05:15.270> didn't<00:05:15.570> make<00:05:15.659> a<00:05:15.720> mention<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.229> it<00:05:16.380> it's

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
ago I didn't make a mention of it it's

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.430 
ago I didn't make a mention of it it's
actually<00:05:18.900> more<00:05:19.530> dust<00:05:19.710> into<00:05:19.919> the<00:05:20.130> cabinet

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.890

embassy funded out for Dyle there

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.460 
embassy funded out for Dyle there
there's<00:05:28.680> another<00:05:29.159> Dow<00:05:29.490> here<00:05:31.009> it<00:05:32.009> was<00:05:32.250> uh<00:05:33.470> down

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
there's another Dow here it was uh down

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.520 
there's another Dow here it was uh down
here<00:05:34.860> now<00:05:35.070> I<00:05:35.449> guess<00:05:36.449> there<00:05:36.810> is<00:05:36.930> probably<00:05:37.409> a

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
here now I guess there is probably a

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.249 
here now I guess there is probably a
couple<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.979> other<00:05:38.220> hand<00:05:39.259> different

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
couple of other hand different

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.580 
couple of other hand different
manufacturers<00:05:40.919> put<00:05:41.070> them<00:05:41.219> in<00:05:41.310> different<00:05:41.460> ways

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
manufacturers put them in different ways

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.430 
manufacturers put them in different ways
some<00:05:43.590> of<00:05:43.680> the<00:05:44.509> more<00:05:45.509> elite<00:05:45.810> brands<00:05:46.139> with

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
some of the more elite brands with

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.010 
some of the more elite brands with
actually<00:05:47.099> put<00:05:47.310> their<00:05:47.490> pin<00:05:47.789> their<00:05:48.419> pin<00:05:48.780> blocks

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
actually put their pin their pin blocks

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.320 
actually put their pin their pin blocks
in<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.199> pianos<00:05:49.620> this<00:05:49.740> way<00:05:49.889> actually<00:05:50.699> is<00:05:51.030> glued

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
in the pianos this way actually is glued

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.450 
in the pianos this way actually is glued
to<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:51.690> stretcher<00:05:52.199> here<00:05:52.469> cross<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.099> front

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
to the stretcher here cross the front

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.820 
to the stretcher here cross the front
you<00:05:53.580> can<00:05:53.610> actually<00:05:53.820> see<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.300> glue<00:05:54.830> running

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
you can actually see the glue running

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.790 
you can actually see the glue running
alone<00:05:56.009> here<00:05:56.310> where<00:05:56.490> they<00:05:56.610> glued<00:05:56.909> it<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
alone here where they glued it to the

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.709 
alone here where they glued it to the
stretchy<00:05:58.800> here<00:05:59.070> so<00:05:59.250> it's<00:05:59.400> actually<00:05:59.719> glued

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:00.719 
stretchy here so it's actually glued

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.089 
stretchy here so it's actually glued
into<00:06:00.930> this<00:06:01.229> piece<00:06:02.000> here<00:06:03.000> and<00:06:03.740> it<00:06:04.740> makes<00:06:04.949> for

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
into this piece here and it makes for

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:13.089 
into this piece here and it makes for
real<00:06:05.310> stable<00:06:07.490> assembly<00:06:09.320> but<00:06:10.550> in<00:06:11.550> any<00:06:11.699> case

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
real stable assembly but in any case

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:19.760 
real stable assembly but in any case

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
senator parts will really basically

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.870 
senator parts will really basically
arrest<00:06:39.319> the<00:06:39.470> parts<00:06:39.800> for<00:06:40.039> it<00:06:40.069> one<00:06:40.610> other<00:06:40.759> thing

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880

over the years with your benches you

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.710 
over the years with your benches you
know<00:07:01.310> you<00:07:01.370> just<00:07:01.639> get<00:07:01.849> a<00:07:01.880> spate<00:07:02.270> where<00:07:02.479> you<00:07:02.539> ask
