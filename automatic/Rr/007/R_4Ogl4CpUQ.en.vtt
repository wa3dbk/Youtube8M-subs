00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170 
has a ton of travel on the handle you're
pretty<00:01:55.439> much<00:01:55.560> locked<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
pretty much locked in there with the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.690 
pretty much locked in there with the
finger<00:01:57.479> choil<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.860> are

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
finger choil and on the back you are

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
finger choil and on the back you are
pretty<00:01:59.969> much<00:02:00.030> locked<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
pretty much locked in so really like the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.340 
pretty much locked in so really like the
high<00:02:02.939> polish<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> blade<00:02:03.840> there<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.200> can

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
high polish on the blade there you can

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.270 
high polish on the blade there you can
see<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.299> shark<00:02:07.200> fixed<00:02:08.039> blade

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
see so I think the shark fixed blade

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.279 
see so I think the shark fixed blade
makes<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.060> utility<00:02:09.390> blade<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.200> an
