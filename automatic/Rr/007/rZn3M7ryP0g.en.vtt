either your Deku nuts would give you
about<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.739> one<00:01:04.979> sword<00:01:05.220> slash<00:01:05.460> done<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.600> amount

about a one sword slash done that amount

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.420 
about a one sword slash done that amount

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
of time or you can use your slingshot it

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.920 
of time or you can use your slingshot it
gives<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> enough<00:01:09.090> time<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.540> three

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
gives you enough time for about three

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.859 
gives you enough time for about three
source<00:01:10.200> decimals<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.280> far<00:01:11.580> superior

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
source decimals so this is far superior

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.300 
source decimals so this is far superior
now<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:12.990> other<00:01:13.080> thing<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> note<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
now one other thing to note is when you

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.890 
now one other thing to note is when you
do<00:01:14.520> attacker<00:01:14.909> your<00:01:15.330> since<00:01:15.540> your<00:01:15.659> deck<00:01:15.780> is

do attacker your since your deck is
picked<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.680> damage<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.340> attack

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
picked to be more damage you can attack

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
picked to be more damage you can attack
it<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> jump<00:01:18.930> attack

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it with that you can do a jump attack

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
it with that you can do a jump attack
with<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.680> gives<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> total<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.460> 4

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
with that which gives you a total of 4

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
with that which gives you a total of 4
damage<00:01:21.150> which<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> insane<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> being

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
damage which is insane so that being

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.070 
damage which is insane so that being
said<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> best<00:01:24.450> way<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.750> defeat

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
said this is the best way to defeat

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
stick to jump attack and now slash her

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
stick to jump attack and now slash her
up<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:33.170> time<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.619> actually

bitter in so that's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.820
