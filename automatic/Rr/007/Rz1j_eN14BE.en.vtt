00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
anywhere they just easily adjust by

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.929 
anywhere they just easily adjust by
sliding<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.130> reason<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.670> put

sliding them on now the reason I put
this<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.160> could<00:00:23.279> see<00:00:23.519> my

there<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:02.880> pretty<00:02:03.090> much<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.799> it's

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
there and that's pretty much it it's

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.100 
there and that's pretty much it it's
really<00:02:05.040> easy<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.060> doesn't<00:02:06.570> take<00:02:06.960> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
really easy to do it doesn't take that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
really easy to do it doesn't take that
long<00:02:07.520> now

know how that came out I'll show you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.560 
know how that came out I'll show you
when<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.930> clean<00:02:13.200> my<00:02:13.380> guns<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.420> build<00:02:15.420> my

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
when I clean my guns and build my

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060 
when I clean my guns and build my
computers<00:02:16.110> like<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.710> here's<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
computers like you can see here's the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.840 
computers like you can see here's the
same<00:02:17.310> exact<00:02:17.640> setup<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.900> shelf<00:02:19.850> with

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
same exact setup it's a shelf with

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.420 
same exact setup it's a shelf with
particle<00:02:21.360> wood<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.560> particle<00:02:23.160> wood<00:02:23.310> is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
particle wood now the particle wood is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.280 
particle wood now the particle wood is
the<00:02:23.520> same<00:02:23.760> way<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> held<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.540> together<00:02:24.660> by<00:02:24.990> zip

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the same way I held it together by zip

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.650 
the same way I held it together by zip
ties<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.710> see<00:02:25.860> here<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:27.090> drilled<00:02:27.540> the

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
ties you see here I just drilled the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.210 
ties you see here I just drilled the
hole<00:02:27.870> how<00:02:28.140> did<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.320> get<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.500> by<00:02:28.560> zip<00:02:28.770> ties<00:02:28.980> to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
hole how did you get it by zip ties to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.930 
hole how did you get it by zip ties to
hold<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.930> use<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.110> Dremel<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:32.130> carve<00:02:32.490> out<00:02:32.700> this

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
hold on use the Dremel to carve out this

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.780 
hold on use the Dremel to carve out this
corner<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:33.870> so<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> slides<00:02:35.250> up<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.700> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
corner here so the slides up and it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.850 
corner here so the slides up and it
sticks<00:02:36.090> up<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.570> little<00:02:37.380> further<00:02:37.560> than<00:02:37.680> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
sticks up a little further than the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.050 
sticks up a little further than the
shelf<00:02:38.130> actually<00:02:38.520> what's<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.820> gives<00:02:38.970> you<00:02:39.030> a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
shelf actually what's it gives you a

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.020 
shelf actually what's it gives you a
little<00:02:39.209> bit<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.360> under<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:41.490> that's<00:02:41.820> pretty

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
little bit of under and that's pretty

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.790 
little bit of under and that's pretty
much<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.540> put<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> light<00:02:42.959> there<00:02:43.230> which<00:02:43.620> is

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
much it and put a light there which is

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.020 
much it and put a light there which is
that<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.040> could<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.310> with<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.640> desk<00:02:44.850> as

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
that you could do that with the desk as

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.190 
that you could do that with the desk as
well<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:46.260> fan<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.830> to<00:02:46.920> keep<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.250> cool<00:02:47.459> and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
well and a fan just to keep it cool and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
well and a fan just to keep it cool and
that's<00:02:49.200> pretty<00:02:49.440> much<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.709> any<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.640> questions

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
that's pretty much it any more questions

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.240 
that's pretty much it any more questions
just<00:02:51.260> send<00:02:52.260> me<00:02:52.410> maybe<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.709> can<00:02:52.920> make<00:02:53.040> another

just send me maybe I can make another

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.560 
just send me maybe I can make another
video<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.640> don't<00:02:53.820> know<00:02:53.940> how<00:02:54.060> good<00:02:54.239> this<00:02:54.360> one's
