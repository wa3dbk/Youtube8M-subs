00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.640
 Easy visualization of energy usage 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:16.039
 Circuit energy monitor 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:18.370
 We will introduce from installation method to data collection and analysis method 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.920
 me 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:27.800
 At first let's confirm setting space 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:35.200
 When installing , turn off the operating version for safety 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.200
 Installation is possible if there is an open space near the practice inside the distribution board 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 Installation is complete only by fitting to the legend mounting plate 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:53.020
 In addition to this, you can also mount it directly with ring mail or screws 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:57.700
 If there is no space , please use the free box for installation 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:02.050
 Let's take the same power supply as the circuit to be measured next 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:09.690
 It is convenient to take power from unused spare gray 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.690
 If there is no spare breaker , please add a dedicated lower grader 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.190
 Next select the circuit to be measured 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.190
 Let's attach ct 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.630
 Connect to the main unit using a ct cable 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.630
 Measure the amount of current in the circuit 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.649
 After confirming the safety of Kai Road , please turn on the power . 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.649
 The power supply LED of the main unit lights up 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.580
 Let's connect the display setting unit next 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.049
 Turn on the display setting unit Once you have connected 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.049
 Make basic settings 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.830
 At first we do from clock setting 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.149
 Next , set the vessel color of the measurement circuit 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.110
 me 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.110
 me 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.790
 Next we will set the ct rating 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:57.690
 Finally select the measurement settings from the basic settings 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.690
 Let's start the measurement 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:09.890
 When measurement starts, the LED on the lower right of the main unit lights up 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:15.080
 About hourly data can be stored for about 2 months 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:19.569
 At first let's measure in measurement period in one month 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:25.480
 Let's retrieve the data when the measurement period is over 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:29.920
 Please insert in this time the left side of the slot sd card 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:33.940
 LED will light when writing starts 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.710
 So please take out the integrated sd card 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:43.960
 Data collection is complete 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:49.270
 Let's graph and analyze the data collected on sd card with a PC 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:52.080
 Download the key tool from the homepage of Panasonic Electric Works 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.080
 me 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.270
 dee dee 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:04.910
 Confirm the save location and save 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:06.970
 Insert the sd card into your computer and load the data after launching the software 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:13.550
 The rest is easy 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:19.950
 Select the graph you want to create and select the circuit you measured 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:26.170
 It is a monthly graph you can see the transition of power amount of one month on a daily basis 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:32.350
 We can propose waste reduction for holidays and power reduction for weekdays 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:38.730
 You can see the transition of the daily power consumption in hourly units in the daily treasure graph 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.730
 We can offer suggestions for power reductions before and after regular times and during lunch breaks 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:51.750
 Comparison by period is possible using daily comparison 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:54.750
 Let's analyze the graph by comparing the amount of power on the same day and the same time 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.050
 And displays the other main comparative graph 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.169
 Hidenori button 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:06.099
 Weekly report button to display the graph for one week 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:14.160
 You can also select and compare circuits 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:23.070
 Let's investigate the increase in the amount of power in the natural time zone and the unnecessary standby power and look for outliers 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:26.600
 If you find out the abnormal value First of all as a temporary measure operation that does not require an expense such as complete turning off of the lunch break 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:35.200
 Please help us improve the proposal 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:35.200
 And let's step up the cycle or see from the trial renewal try
