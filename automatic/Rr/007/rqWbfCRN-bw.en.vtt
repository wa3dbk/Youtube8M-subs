00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
only know how the instruments play we

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.410 
only know how the instruments play we
have<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> also<00:02:21.830> understand<00:02:22.550> how<00:02:22.760> we're<00:02:23.300> going

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
have to also understand how we're going

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.390 
have to also understand how we're going
to<00:02:23.480> start<00:02:23.720> moving<00:02:23.840> our<00:02:24.110> body<00:02:24.319> depending<00:02:25.250> on

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
to start moving our body depending on

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.680 
to start moving our body depending on
the<00:02:25.519> instrument<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.060> we<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.269> listening<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the instrument that we are listening to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.610 
the instrument that we are listening to
correct<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.269> if<00:02:29.269> you<00:02:29.330> don't<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.050> an<00:02:30.200> idea<00:02:30.470> of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
correct so if you don't have an idea of

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.550 
correct so if you don't have an idea of
how<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.610> instrument<00:02:32.330> sounds<00:02:32.780> don't<00:02:33.319> worry

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
how the instrument sounds don't worry

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.370 
how the instrument sounds don't worry
we're<00:02:34.190> going<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.670> point<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
we're going to get to that point but the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.650 
we're going to get to that point but the
important<00:02:36.830> part<00:02:37.010> right<00:02:37.220> now<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.970> it's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
important part right now is that it's

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.630 
important part right now is that it's
instead<00:02:39.260> doing<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.680> same<00:02:39.890> things<00:02:40.220> just

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
instead doing the same things just

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.539 
instead doing the same things just
counting<00:02:41.269> we<00:02:41.540> limit<00:02:41.900> ourselves<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.250> what<00:02:43.430> we

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
counting we limit ourselves so what we

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.350 
counting we limit ourselves so what we
want<00:02:43.760> to<00:02:43.849> do<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.209> start<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.670> listen<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.880> educate

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
want to do is start a listen and educate

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.150 
want to do is start a listen and educate
a<00:02:47.390> little<00:02:47.690> more<00:02:47.810> ourselves<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.470> understand

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
a little more ourselves to understand

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.660 
a little more ourselves to understand
more<00:02:49.519> what<00:02:50.330> we<00:02:50.630> can<00:02:50.840> do<00:02:51.019> with<00:02:51.200> our<00:02:51.230> body

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
more what we can do with our body

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.559 
more what we can do with our body
depending<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.910> instrument<00:02:53.329> that<00:02:53.420> we

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
depending on the instrument that we

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.199 
depending on the instrument that we
listen<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.959> okay<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.250> see<00:02:55.730> different

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
listen to okay so to see different

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.660 
listen to okay so to see different
results<00:02:56.329> we<00:02:57.140> have<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.500> start<00:02:57.739> doing<00:02:58.310> different

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
results we have to start doing different

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.850 
results we have to start doing different
things<00:02:59.209> one<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.959> challenge<00:03:00.380> that<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> had

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
things one of the challenge that I had

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.620 
things one of the challenge that I had
when<00:03:01.069> I<00:03:01.099> was<00:03:01.190> starting<00:03:01.849> dancing<00:03:02.450> salsa

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
when I was starting dancing salsa

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.319 
when I was starting dancing salsa
because<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.319> started<00:03:03.769> just<00:03:03.980> like<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.610> start

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
because I started just like you I start

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.120 
because I started just like you I start
from<00:03:05.510> beat<00:03:05.690> from<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.959> beginning<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.530> didn't

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
from beat from the beginning I didn't

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.920 
from beat from the beginning I didn't
know<00:03:07.160> how<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.400> dance<00:03:07.610> salsa<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.599> start

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
know how to dance salsa so I start

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080 
know how to dance salsa so I start
training<00:03:09.110> little<00:03:10.010> by<00:03:10.069> little<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.670> then<00:03:10.730> I

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
training little by little and then I

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.500 
training little by little and then I
educate<00:03:11.780> myself<00:03:11.989> especially<00:03:12.860> with

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
educate myself especially with

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.699 
educate myself especially with
instruments<00:03:14.510> actually<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:15.019> love<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.530> way<00:03:15.680> that

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
instruments actually I love the way that

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.460 
instruments actually I love the way that
the<00:03:16.040> conga<00:03:16.400> sounds<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.150> Amanda<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.870> already

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
the conga sounds so Amanda you already

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.030 
the conga sounds so Amanda you already
dancing<00:03:18.980> but<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.430> only<00:03:19.670> count<00:03:20.120> 1<00:03:20.540> 2<00:03:20.750> 3<00:03:20.989> 5<00:03:21.380> 6<00:03:21.440> 7

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
dancing but you only count 1 2 3 5 6 7

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.160 
dancing but you only count 1 2 3 5 6 7
so<00:03:22.730> we<00:03:23.299> never<00:03:23.480> going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.810> get<00:03:23.989> different

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
so we never going to get different

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.170 
so we never going to get different
results<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.980> always<00:03:25.370> going<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.579> feel<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
results you always going to feel the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.490 
results you always going to feel the
same<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.780> dance<00:03:26.989> floor

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
same on the dance floor

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.470 
same on the dance floor
so<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.400> reason<00:03:28.730> is<00:03:28.850> because<00:03:29.030> we're<00:03:29.359> doing

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
so the reason is because we're doing

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.080 
so the reason is because we're doing
exactly<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.170> same<00:03:30.200> thing<00:03:30.620> over<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.310> over<00:03:31.430> it

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
exactly the same thing over and over it

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.000 
exactly the same thing over and over it
doesn't<00:03:32.480> matter<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.930> learn<00:03:33.170> hundreds

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
doesn't matter that you learn hundreds

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.910 
doesn't matter that you learn hundreds
of<00:03:34.160> turns<00:03:34.459> it's<00:03:35.180> about<00:03:35.630> what<00:03:36.260> do<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.410> do<00:03:36.709> with

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
of turns it's about what do you do with

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.759 
of turns it's about what do you do with
these<00:03:37.069> turns<00:03:37.370> how<00:03:37.790> do<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:38.060> make<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.540> work<00:03:38.769> and

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
these turns how do you make it work and

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.610 
these turns how do you make it work and
create<00:03:40.579> dynamics<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.720> make<00:03:42.079> it<00:03:42.230> look<00:03:42.380> totally

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
create dynamics to make it look totally

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.740 
create dynamics to make it look totally
different<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.760> for<00:03:43.910> example<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.299> crossword<00:03:44.690> a

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
different so for example a crossword a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.949 
different so for example a crossword a
lead<00:03:45.019> or<00:03:45.260> any<00:03:45.500> turn<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.069> do<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.459> salsa

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
lead or any turn that you do in salsa

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.110 
lead or any turn that you do in salsa
you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.139> do<00:03:48.290> it<00:03:48.410> on<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:48.799> many<00:03:48.980> ways<00:03:49.310> that

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
you can do it on so many ways that

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.610 
you can do it on so many ways that

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
different way so for example you do a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.300 
different way so for example you do a
crossbody<00:03:55.670> lead<00:03:55.880> with<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.420> song<00:03:56.690> or<00:03:57.069> we<00:03:58.069> want

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
rhythm is going to feel totally

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.020 
rhythm is going to feel totally
different<00:04:00.530> when<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.160> do<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.760> different

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
different when you do it to a different

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.330

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.970 
song to a different speed and different
rhythm<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:04.849> this<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.780> not<00:04:05.959> because<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
rhythm and this is not because the

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.490 
rhythm and this is not because the
counting<00:04:07.430> it's<00:04:07.670> because<00:04:08.209> we<00:04:08.900> can<00:04:09.109> express

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
counting it's because we can express

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.890 
counting it's because we can express
depending<00:04:10.160> on<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.459> music<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.690> can

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
depending on the music and we can

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.960 
depending on the music and we can
interpret<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.889> instrument<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.669> takes

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
interpret it the instrument that takes

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.379 
interpret it the instrument that takes
over<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:15.139> song<00:04:15.470> so<00:04:16.370> if<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.940> implement

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
over that song so if you implement

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.870
