like that and then 35 to 50 I rank up on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.049 
like that and then 35 to 50 I rank up on
my<00:00:38.040> own<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> lot<00:00:39.030> faster

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
my own because I can do it a lot faster

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.819 
my own because I can do it a lot faster
and<00:00:39.540> off<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> editing<00:00:40.320> process<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
and off the editing process and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.900 
and off the editing process and
everything<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.460> easier<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
everything and it's just easier to

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180 
everything and it's just easier to
obtain<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.930> basically<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.129> I'm

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
when loss is 0 79 because I do play solo

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.640 
when loss is 0 79 because I do play solo
I<00:03:02.819> play<00:03:03.030> solo<00:03:03.329> only<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.810> don't<00:03:03.930> really<00:03:04.169> party<00:03:04.560> up

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
I play solo only I don't really party up

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.110 
I play solo only I don't really party up
with<00:03:04.769> people<00:03:05.040> unless<00:03:05.129> I<00:03:05.340> really<00:03:05.579> really<00:03:05.909> want

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
with people unless I really really want

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.050 
with people unless I really really want
to<00:03:06.329> um<00:03:06.599> I<00:03:07.409> don't<00:03:07.799> know<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.040> i<00:03:08.250> think<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.819> solo

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to um I don't know I i think the solo

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.699 
to um I don't know I i think the solo
playing<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.659> just<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.109> bit<00:03:10.230> better<00:03:10.409> but

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
playing is just a little bit better but

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.050 
playing is just a little bit better but
it<00:03:10.829> is<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> little<00:03:11.159> bit<00:03:11.340> more<00:03:11.489> competitive

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
it is a little bit more competitive

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.759 
it is a little bit more competitive
because<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.989> know<00:03:13.109> you<00:03:13.379> get<00:03:13.530> poked<00:03:13.709> with

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
because you know you get poked with

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.409 
because you know you get poked with
randoms<00:03:14.159> instead<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.549> people<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.969> know<00:03:15.209> we're

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
randoms instead of people you know we're

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.399 
randoms instead of people you know we're
good<00:03:15.599> so<00:03:15.900> score<00:03:16.799> per<00:03:16.950> minute<00:03:17.189> or<00:03:17.310> SPM<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.419> 370

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
good so score per minute or SPM is 370

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:21.979 
good so score per minute or SPM is 370
369<00:03:20.129> not<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.459> best<00:03:20.819> but<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.419> said<00:03:21.479> I'm

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
369 not the best but like I said I'm

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.379 
369 not the best but like I said I'm
trying<00:03:22.199> to<00:03:22.349> go<00:03:22.440> more<00:03:22.739> for<00:03:22.889> score<00:03:23.250> now<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:24.090> it

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
trying to go more for score now so it

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.879 
trying to go more for score now so it
will<00:03:24.510> be<00:03:24.569> rising<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.199> I<00:03:25.290> only<00:03:25.409> play<00:03:25.680> team

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
will be rising up and I only play team

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.229 
will be rising up and I only play team
deathmatch<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.459> ground<00:03:26.639> war<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:26.940> stuff<00:03:27.090> like

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
deathmatch and ground war and stuff like

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.899 
deathmatch and ground war and stuff like
that<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:27.510> that's<00:03:27.780> pretty<00:03:28.019> much<00:03:28.109> for<00:03:28.560> that<00:03:28.709> um<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
that so that's pretty much for that um I

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.550 
that so that's pretty much for that um I
don't<00:03:30.269> know<00:03:30.419> what<00:03:30.540> else<00:03:30.629> to<00:03:30.720> show<00:03:30.959> my<00:03:31.260> armory
