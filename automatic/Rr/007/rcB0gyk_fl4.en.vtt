for the graphite they usually come you
know<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.359> six<00:00:24.660> different<00:00:25.350> pencils<00:00:26.150> this<00:00:27.150> is

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
know in six different pencils this is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.759 
know in six different pencils this is
what<00:00:27.449> mine<00:00:27.599> looks<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> inside<00:00:28.199> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
what mine looks like on the inside and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.560 
what mine looks like on the inside and
yes<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> them<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.730> missing<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.390> no

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
yes one of them is missing I have no

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.910 
yes one of them is missing I have no
idea<00:00:30.840> where<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> left<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.710> um<00:00:31.969> anyway<00:00:33.590> these<00:00:34.590> are

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
idea where I left it um anyway these are

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.240 
idea where I left it um anyway these are
what<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> use<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.989> know<00:00:37.110> every<00:00:37.559> day<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.129> might

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
what I use you know every day you might

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.010 
what I use you know every day you might
see<00:00:38.309> some<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> video<00:00:39.120> here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
see some of these in the video here

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.090 
see some of these in the video here
you'll<00:00:40.140> see<00:00:40.320> I'm<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> start<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you'll see I'm going to start with the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.020 
you'll see I'm going to start with the
hardest<00:00:41.489> pencil<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.469> this<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.890> called<00:00:44.460> 2h

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
hardest pencil and this one is called 2h

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.490 
hardest pencil and this one is called 2h
and<00:00:46.969> generally<00:00:47.969> what<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.329> means<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and generally what that means is it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.340 
and generally what that means is it
shows<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> very<00:00:50.550> light<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> paper<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.899> if

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
shows up very light on the paper and if

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.490 
shows up very light on the paper and if
you<00:00:52.469> press<00:00:52.710> really<00:00:53.219> hard<00:00:53.399> onto<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> paper<00:00:54.500> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you press really hard onto the paper it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
you press really hard onto the paper it
really<00:00:55.770> isn't<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.280> dark<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.690> also

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
really isn't that dark and it can also

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.830 
really isn't that dark and it can also
leave<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.469> good<00:00:58.980> dent<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> paper<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.660> it's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
leave a good dent in the paper so it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.950 
leave a good dent in the paper so it's
good<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.050> finer<00:01:01.530> work<00:01:02.489> finer<00:01:02.940> shading<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
good for finer work finer shading the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.210 
good for finer work finer shading the
next<00:01:04.260> pencil<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.510> kit<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.220> HB

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
next pencil that is in my kit here is HB

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.300 
next pencil that is in my kit here is HB
it's<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.790> little<00:01:09.119> bit<00:01:09.270> softer<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.950> can<00:01:11.100> see

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
it's a little bit softer and you can see

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.000 
it's a little bit softer and you can see
it<00:01:11.640> makes<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:12.840> mark<00:01:13.680> it's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it makes a little bit more mark it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.429 
it makes a little bit more mark it's
easier<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.060> darken<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.380> paper<00:01:17.180> after<00:01:18.439> that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
easier to darken on the paper after that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.740 
easier to darken on the paper after that
usually<00:01:20.009> comes<00:01:20.250> B<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.479> said<00:01:21.659> I'm

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
usually comes B but as I said I'm

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
usually comes B but as I said I'm
missing<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.799> skip<00:01:23.159> from

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
missing one so I'm just gonna skip from

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.609 
missing one so I'm just gonna skip from
the<00:01:23.549> B<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.330> B<00:01:25.159> and<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.560> see

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the B to the to B and as you can see

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.109 
the B to the to B and as you can see
this<00:01:28.890> one's<00:01:29.070> even<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.430> bit<00:01:29.610> darker<00:01:29.970> than

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
this one's even a little bit darker than

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.230 
this one's even a little bit darker than
the<00:01:30.240> HB<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.250> it's<00:01:32.250> easier<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.030> make<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> mark

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
the HB and it's easier to make a mark

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.350 
the HB and it's easier to make a mark
after<00:01:36.240> two<00:01:37.200> B<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.890> 4b<00:01:40.159> again<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.939> much

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
after two B is the 4b again it is much

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.469 
after two B is the 4b again it is much
softer<00:01:42.930> therefore<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.070> easier<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
softer therefore it's a lot easier to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:55.720 
softer therefore it's a lot easier to
make<00:01:46.290> dark<00:01:47.420> shading<00:01:48.420> dark<00:01:49.079> shades<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.020 

and<00:01:56.900> the<00:01:57.900> last<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.010> six<00:01:59.280> B<00:01:59.520> which<00:01:59.850> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and the last one is the six B which is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080 
and the last one is the six B which is
the<00:02:00.330> as<00:02:00.960> far<00:02:01.170> as<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.130> heaviest

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the as far as I know the heaviest

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.060 
the as far as I know the heaviest
softest<00:02:04.550> graphite<00:02:06.560> available<00:02:07.560> maybe<00:02:07.800> there's

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
softest graphite available maybe there's

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.880 
softest graphite available maybe there's
heavier<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:08.880> I've<00:02:09.000> never<00:02:09.150> seen<00:02:09.479> any<00:02:09.890> excuse

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
heavier but I've never seen any excuse

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:19.160 
heavier but I've never seen any excuse
me<00:02:11.040> softer<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.640> heavier<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.990> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
me softer not heavier so there's the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
me softer not heavier so there's the
pencils<00:02:19.670> there's<00:02:20.670> other<00:02:20.880> ones<00:02:21.030> available

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
pencils there's other ones available

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.230 
pencils there's other ones available
like<00:02:21.660> charcoal<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:23.040> stuff<00:02:23.430> but<00:02:23.730> those<00:02:24.060> are

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
like charcoal and stuff but those are
