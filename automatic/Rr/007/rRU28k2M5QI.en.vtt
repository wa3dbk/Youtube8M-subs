00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860 

all<00:00:00.750> right<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.199> entire<00:00:01.500> building<00:00:02.100> is

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
all right so the entire building is

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.349 
all right so the entire building is
5,000<00:00:03.870> pounds<00:00:04.440> there's<00:00:04.830> 25<00:00:05.339> arches<00:00:06.120> which

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
5,000 pounds there's 25 arches which

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.820 
5,000 pounds there's 25 arches which
means<00:00:06.600> each<00:00:06.960> arch<00:00:07.470> weighs<00:00:09.139> 200<00:00:10.139> pounds<00:00:10.200> so

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
means each arch weighs 200 pounds so

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.320 
means each arch weighs 200 pounds so
these<00:00:10.980> straight<00:00:11.280> pieces<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.790> each<00:00:11.910> side<00:00:12.179> are

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
these straight pieces on each side are

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.350 
these straight pieces on each side are
probably<00:00:12.570> about<00:00:12.690> 25<00:00:13.200> pounds<00:00:13.710> each<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.969> longer

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
probably about 25 pounds each the longer

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.910 
probably about 25 pounds each the longer
ones<00:00:15.570> must<00:00:15.809> be<00:00:15.990> around<00:00:16.139> 45<00:00:18.380> so<00:00:19.380> that's<00:00:19.650> all<00:00:19.770> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
ones must be around 45 so that's all it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.300 
ones must be around 45 so that's all it
is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
is
believe<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:20.939> you're<00:00:21.510> better<00:00:21.869> off

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
believe it or not you're better off

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.450 
believe it or not you're better off
dealing<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.680> one<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> these<00:00:22.949> modular

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
dealing with one of these modular

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.330 
dealing with one of these modular
buildings<00:00:23.850> than<00:00:24.060> dealing<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.449> lumber<00:00:25.340> get

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
buildings than dealing with lumber get

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.179 
buildings than dealing with lumber get
me<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.490> pile<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.760> lumber<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.269> that's<00:00:27.599> probably

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
me a pile of lumber like that's probably

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.179 
me a pile of lumber like that's probably
500<00:00:29.189> pounds<00:00:29.609> more<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> hundred

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
500 pounds more and it's like a hundred

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.030 
500 pounds more and it's like a hundred
and<00:00:32.460> five<00:00:32.790> out<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:34.110> over<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> hundred<00:00:34.530> can

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and five out here to over a hundred can

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130 
and five out here to over a hundred can
tell<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.520> we've<00:00:36.420> got<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> whole<00:00:36.690> rhythm

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
tell you that we've got a whole rhythm

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
tell you that we've got a whole rhythm
I'm<00:00:37.500> not<00:00:37.649> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> get<00:00:38.010> into<00:00:38.160> now<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.910> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
I'm not going to get into now do it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
I'm not going to get into now do it
later<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.480> hover<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.290> we're

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
later and hover gonna get how we're

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.010 
later and hover gonna get how we're
getting<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.739> apart<00:00:41.129> yeah<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.910> not<00:00:42.090> there

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:54.619 

how<00:00:46.020> we<00:00:46.079> move<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:48.480> position<00:00:53.030> yeah<00:00:54.030> that's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
how we move it in position yeah that's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.610 
how we move it in position yeah that's
it<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:56.360> what'd<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> expedite<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it so what'd you do to expedite the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
it so what'd you do to expedite the
disassembly<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.550> remove<00:00:59.820> all<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.270> these

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
disassembly is to remove all of these

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.399 
disassembly is to remove all of these
bolts<00:01:00.780> along<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> seams<00:01:03.409> but

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
bolts along here on all the seams but

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.969 
bolts along here on all the seams but
leaving<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> few<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:06.560> and<00:01:07.560> then<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
leaving a few in and then you have to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.730 
leaving a few in and then you have to
leave<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.340> at<00:01:09.270> least<00:01:09.479> four<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.200> oversee

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
leave in at least four on these oversee

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.310 
leave in at least four on these oversee
all<00:01:10.830> these<00:01:10.979> overlap<00:01:11.689> now<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> overlap<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
all these overlap now the overlap is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.870 
all these overlap now the overlap is
offset<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.820> structural<00:01:15.509> integrity

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
offset that's for structural integrity

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
offset that's for structural integrity
but<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> can<00:01:18.150> remove<00:01:18.479> almost<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.470> these

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
but you can remove almost all of these

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.800 
but you can remove almost all of these
down<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> say<00:01:20.520> one<00:01:20.909> above<00:01:21.330> where<00:01:21.630> these

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
down to say one above where these

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.749 
down to say one above where these
overlap<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:23.210> by<00:01:24.210> leaving<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.990> few

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
overlap and by leaving in just a few

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.780 
overlap and by leaving in just a few
you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.909> now<00:01:27.060> come<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:29.640> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you can now come back and do the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
you can now come back and do the
following<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.380> pre

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
following and you to do this pre

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.380 
following and you to do this pre
disassembly<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.240> these

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
disassembly you know you take all these

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.390 
disassembly you know you take all these
bolts<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:33.900> you've<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.860> leave<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> couple

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
bolts out you've got to leave a couple

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.039 
bolts out you've got to leave a couple
in<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:37.079> keep<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.530> structural<00:01:38.040> integrity

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
in here to keep the structural integrity

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.429 
in here to keep the structural integrity
together<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:41.899> otherwise<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
together so otherwise when you go to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.100 
together so otherwise when you go to
undo<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.180> piece<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.960> be

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
undo these and this piece would just be

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.819 
undo these and this piece would just be
sitting<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:47.100> nothing<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.880> hold<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.829> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
sitting with nothing to hold it right it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
sitting with nothing to hold it right it
wants<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> twist<00:01:50.430> around<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.000> twist<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.479> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
wants to twist around and twist out so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660 
wants to twist around and twist out so
leave<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> couple<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.770> bolts<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.280> here<00:01:53.490> until

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
leave a couple of bolts in here until

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.850 
leave a couple of bolts in here until
you're<00:01:53.880> ready<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.090> remove<00:01:54.329> these<00:01:55.110> right<00:01:55.649> okay

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
you're ready to remove these right okay

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.910 
you're ready to remove these right okay
so<00:01:58.860> once<00:01:59.040> you've<00:01:59.159> got<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.490> these<00:01:59.670> Unruh<00:02:00.479> moved

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
so once you've got all these Unruh moved

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
so once you've got all these Unruh moved
and<00:02:01.920> you're<00:02:02.219> ready<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.460> remove<00:02:02.729> these<00:02:03.180> panels

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and you're ready to remove these panels

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.649 
and you're ready to remove these panels
these<00:02:04.200> upper<00:02:04.469> two<00:02:04.649> panels<00:02:05.159> individually<00:02:05.850> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
these upper two panels individually you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.040 
these upper two panels individually you
come<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> side<00:02:07.520> of<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.789> overlapping<00:02:09.660> one

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
come to the side of the overlapping one

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.070 
come to the side of the overlapping one
remove<00:02:10.800> these<00:02:11.129> remaining<00:02:11.489> bolts<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.930> go

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
remove these remaining bolts and you go

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.920 
remove these remaining bolts and you go
up<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.440> lab

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
up on the lab

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.240 
up on the lab
remove<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.829> remaining<00:02:15.310> overlapping<00:02:16.269> bolts

remove the remaining overlapping bolts

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.490 
remove the remaining overlapping bolts
then<00:02:18.250> push<00:02:18.730> off<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.510> overlapping<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.349> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
then push off the overlapping one the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.640 
then push off the overlapping one the
first<00:02:20.709> this<00:02:20.920> one<00:02:21.129> beads<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.459> push<00:02:21.939> it<00:02:21.970> down<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
first this one beads it push it down and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.220 
first this one beads it push it down and
you<00:02:23.739> come<00:02:23.860> over<00:02:24.099> here<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.430> undo<00:02:24.700> these<00:02:25.230> push

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
you come over here and undo these push

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.550 
you come over here and undo these push
this<00:02:26.500> one<00:02:26.739> down<00:02:28.349> closely<00:02:29.349> you'll<00:02:29.439> see<00:02:29.500> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this one down closely you'll see that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.630 
this one down closely you'll see that
this<00:02:29.829> one<00:02:29.890> overlaps<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:31.269> one<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.010> that's<00:02:33.459> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
this one overlaps this one so that's the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.800 
this one overlaps this one so that's the
one<00:02:33.790> you're<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.209> when<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.540> get<00:02:34.689> these

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
one you're going to when you get these

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.830 
one you're going to when you get these
bolts<00:02:35.200> undone<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:36.459> slide<00:02:36.879> this<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.450> down<00:02:37.629> you

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
bolts undone you slide this one down you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.420 
bolts undone you slide this one down you
push<00:02:38.079> it<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.319> a<00:02:38.349> stick<00:02:38.709> with<00:02:38.950> another<00:02:39.189> man

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
push it with a stick with another man

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.059 
push it with a stick with another man
down<00:02:39.700> below<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.030> catch<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.650> then<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.799> push

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
down below to catch it then you push

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.009 
down below to catch it then you push
this<00:02:42.400> one<00:02:42.609> down<00:02:42.939> when<00:02:43.299> you<00:02:43.390> push<00:02:43.599> this<00:02:43.810> one

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
this one down when you push this one

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.420 
this one down when you push this one
down<00:02:44.230> you're<00:02:44.439> stay<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.739> this<00:02:44.890> side<00:02:45.099> because

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
down you're stay on this side because

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.539 
down you're stay on this side because
now<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.640> overlaps<00:02:46.269> on<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:47.409> one<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.769> overlap

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
now the overlaps on this one the overlap

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.649 
now the overlaps on this one the overlap
will<00:02:49.299> be<00:02:49.420> on<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.599> other<00:02:49.780> on<00:02:50.079> this<00:02:50.620> side<00:02:50.920> and

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
will be on the other on this side and

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.170 
will be on the other on this side and
that'll<00:02:52.659> be<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.079> underlap<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.940> leaves

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
that'll be the underlap that leaves

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.210 
that'll be the underlap that leaves
these<00:02:55.359> connected<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.680> set<00:02:56.950> them<00:02:57.099> aside

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
these connected you can set them aside

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.179 
these connected you can set them aside
like<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:57.970> see<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:59.109> stack<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.739> these<00:03:00.069> are

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
like this see you stack the these are

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.280 
like this see you stack the these are
the<00:03:00.250> tops<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.670> top<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:01.629> get<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.810> ladder<00:03:02.079> like

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the tops of top you get a ladder like

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.720 
the tops of top you get a ladder like
that<00:03:02.530> so<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.739> can<00:03:02.829> get<00:03:02.920> up<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.189> top<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.489> then

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
that so you can get up on top and then

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.369 
that so you can get up on top and then
you<00:03:03.939> take<00:03:04.120> your<00:03:04.150> screw<00:03:04.599> gun<00:03:04.870> your<00:03:05.079> battery

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
you take your screw gun your battery

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:06.809 
you take your screw gun your battery
power<00:03:05.590> screw<00:03:05.859> gun<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.340> start<00:03:06.519> undoing

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
power screw gun and just start undoing

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.589 
power screw gun and just start undoing
all<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.150> bolts<00:03:07.989> up<00:03:08.170> there<00:03:09.389> and<00:03:10.389> you're<00:03:10.510> good

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
all the bolts up there and you're good

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.720 
all the bolts up there and you're good
then<00:03:10.900> when<00:03:11.290> you're<00:03:11.439> ready<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:12.189> remove<00:03:12.459> this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
then when you're ready to remove this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.629 
then when you're ready to remove this
one<00:03:13.409> you<00:03:14.409> may<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.920> loosen<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.310> some<00:03:15.519> of

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
one you may have to loosen up some of

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.939 
one you may have to loosen up some of
these<00:03:15.819> on<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.540> sides<00:03:16.780> because<00:03:17.109> sometimes<00:03:17.620> and

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:17.949 
these on the sides because sometimes and

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.490 
these on the sides because sometimes and
when<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.160> was<00:03:18.280> assembled<00:03:19.199> these<00:03:20.199> have<00:03:20.379> an

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
when this was assembled these have an

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.240 
when this was assembled these have an
overlap<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.220> underlap<00:03:21.669> between<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.150> overlap

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
overlap and underlap between the overlap

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.800 
overlap and underlap between the overlap
overlapping<00:03:24.250> panels<00:03:24.879> so<00:03:25.540> how<00:03:25.629> do<00:03:25.720> you

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
overlapping panels so how do you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.770 
overlapping panels so how do you
assemble<00:03:26.109> one<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.500> these<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:28.480> put<00:03:28.629> the
