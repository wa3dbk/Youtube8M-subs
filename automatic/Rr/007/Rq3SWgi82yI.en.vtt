00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello welcome to a new tech 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.810
 today we are going to teach you one of the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.990
 devices that has attracted more attention 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.920
 in recent times the samsung galaxy 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.310
 gear 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.380
 this watch or complement does not really 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 It is a clock but a complement that goes 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.289
 perfect with terminals like the galaxy 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.170
 nou 3 there is an application that makes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 both can work together through 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 bluetooth 4.0 samsung will go incorporating 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.620
 successively other terminals to the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 possibility of working with the galaxy 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.630
 gear right now we show you this 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.570
 gadget that is so curious and that makes 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.740
 well, different things here you have 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.740
 the time just by moving it 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.210
 we explain to you by parts what it is that 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.920
 Take the galaxy gear as you can see 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:07.820
 It has a super 16 inch screen 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.550
 amoled when one takes the bracelet to 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.960
 The view is when it is turned on 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.649
 this is an option that can be activated 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.490
 or disable here we have a camera 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.850
 one with nine megapixels and here we have 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.130
 microphone and speaker a single button is what 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.840
 that allows us to work with the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.660
 phone functions the screen is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.659
 tactile and now we will show you how 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.429
 it works and what things can be done with 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.580
 she can start changing for 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.560
 example the clock screens in this 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.149
 case we had a 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.390
 screen that is downloadable from the 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.509
 samsung store and now let's see 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.420
 other possible other possible 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.689
 watch presentations for example here 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 we have an analog here we have another 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.980
 are different options that we can 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.410
 to have 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.910
 for example here we have one of 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.230
 pedometer is to say that if we go 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.510
 walking like a pedometer 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.110
 also the clock we can see 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.020
 besides the hour our steps what 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.670
 we are moving forward while doing something of 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.650
 exercise 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.690
 let's see different options one by 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.570
 example is that we can receive the 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.600
 messages that were going to reach us 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.820
 terminal to the galaxy no three 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.430
 that we have for example in your pocket or 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.350
 in a suitcase or in a bag we already have 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.960
 here the message can be sent 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.570
 directly if we want our 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:43.130
 device has welcomed us to 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.130
 the avant-garde let's see it in the galaxy 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.160
 let's do a test of how it's done 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.540
 a call in one of your options with 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.080
 the galaxy gear we played twice in the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.080
 side button 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.240
 call nacho samsung 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 Now he's already making the call in 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.310
 reality who makes the call is the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.239
 terminal the galaxy note that we have 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.239
 taught before 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.330
 we can hang up again and there's no need 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.410
 that bothers more nacho with this with 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.590
 this test 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.870
 Well we're going to show you how 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.760
 also use the watch screen if 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.980
 we move laterally towards a 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.240
 side or towards another what we have is the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.860
 access to different applications 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.320
 clicking on them 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.540
 what we do is always access to 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.310
 let's pull back this is the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.870
 movement to go backwards but if 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.990
 we start from the clock screen 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.320
 we can do so we would activate the 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.210
 camera in this case is in the version 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.910
 Of video 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.040
 and now we pass the photographic version 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.530
 we just click and it makes us a 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.720
 Photograph that we can send to 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.120
 any of our contacts to a 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.830
 phone we want we can go back 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.260
 back again there we have of 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.410
 new the clock screen from this 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.450
 same screen if the gesture is contrary 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.250
 we access a keyboard with which 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.530
 We can dial a phone number and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.930
 call directly 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.730
 the galaxy gear is a complement 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.550
 perfect for terminals like the new 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.040
 galaxy know 3 that as you can see also 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.960
 just left he showed up the same day 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.990
 in Berlin the galaxy gear was presented 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.570
 and that looks a lot more 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.270
 refined than its predecessor the galaxy note 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.050
 2 has the screen of something bigger 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:45.470
 although it weighs less and has the same 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:49.580
 size as a telephone how can we can 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.710
 see the backrest the back cover makes 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.510
 an aspect that obviously mimics skin 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.630
 it's not cold and he 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.890
 the new spin that is the terminal with the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:06.130
 that you can do many functions 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.680
 on this phone, it's pretty 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.460
 also more refined and allows a series 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.610
 of new options like you can 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.610
 watch 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:21.690
 in the galaxy nou 3 there are new 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.700
 functionalities added to one that already 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.100
 had to be group play that allows 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.370
 Share videos that share 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.440
 texts between terminals of the same range 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.210
 now let's see how video is shared 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.560
 and how can you do for example a 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.140
 large screen 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.190
 taking advantage of several screens of the 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.190
 same terminal 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.540
 yes 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.210
 Well, you've seen how it works 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.700
 this device the samsung galaxy and a 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.610
 new category of devices that are 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.170
 closest to our body 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.680
 directly on our skin until the 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.680
 next technical 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.780
 how
