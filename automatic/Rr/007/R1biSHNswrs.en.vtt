00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.210 
some of the work I saw on there was pro
rata<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.990> may<00:02:29.140> only<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.440> one<00:02:29.470> or<00:02:29.740> two<00:02:29.890> hours

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220

no chances for pro rata and 40 quid
something<00:02:39.550> like<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:41.160> but<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.460> know

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
something like that but but you know

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.910 
something like that but but you know
it's<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.850> great<00:02:43.120> resource<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.440> didn't<00:02:44.800> know

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
it's a great resource I didn't know

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.650 
it's a great resource I didn't know
about<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.640> found<00:02:45.970> out<00:02:46.120> about<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.360> I'm

it's<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> great<00:03:13.330> way<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.450> networking<00:03:13.960> as<00:03:14.290> well

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
it's a great way of networking as well

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.240 
it's a great way of networking as well
even<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.900> money<00:03:16.900> isn't<00:03:17.140> so<00:03:17.530> good<00:03:17.740> but<00:03:18.070> you

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
even if the money isn't so good but you

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.350 
even if the money isn't so good but you
know<00:03:18.340> devalue<00:03:18.910> your<00:03:19.090> time<00:03:19.390> as<00:03:19.870> well

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
eventually because if you always do

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.650 
eventually because if you always do
things<00:03:24.040> for<00:03:24.280> free<00:03:24.520> you're<00:03:25.210> never<00:03:25.420> going<00:03:25.630> to
