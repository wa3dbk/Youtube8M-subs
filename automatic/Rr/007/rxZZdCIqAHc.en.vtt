intense coloring today so I'm using a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.560 
intense coloring today so I'm using a
waterproof<00:00:24.080> ink<00:00:24.770> called<00:00:25.160> jet<00:00:25.730> black<00:00:26.240> it's<00:00:26.480> a

waterproof ink called jet black it's a
Ranger<00:00:27.430> Hiva<00:00:28.430> link<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:28.910> I'm<00:00:29.449> stamping<00:00:29.720> this

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
Ranger Hiva link and I'm stamping this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.779 
Ranger Hiva link and I'm stamping this
onto<00:00:30.320> the<00:00:30.439> smooth<00:00:30.710> side<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.160> some<00:00:31.369> watercolor

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
onto the smooth side of some watercolor

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.820 
onto the smooth side of some watercolor
cardstock<00:00:32.090> we<00:00:32.480> just<00:00:32.689> cut<00:00:32.900> the<00:00:33.019> same<00:00:33.230> size<00:00:33.260> as

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:33.830 
cardstock we just cut the same size as

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.460 
cardstock we just cut the same size as
my<00:00:34.400> card<00:00:34.820> front<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.330> I'm<00:00:35.840> just<00:00:35.989> going<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:36.260> hold

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
my card front and I'm just going to hold

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.200 
my card front and I'm just going to hold
the<00:00:36.769> image<00:00:37.220> down<00:00:37.400> a<00:00:37.460> little<00:00:37.640> bit<00:00:37.790> longer<00:00:38.000> than

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the image down a little bit longer than

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.500 
the image down a little bit longer than
normal<00:00:38.269> because<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.850> just<00:00:40.850> allows<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.269> ink<00:00:41.390> a

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
normal because it just allows the ink a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.210 
normal because it just allows the ink a
little<00:00:41.720> bit<00:00:41.809> more<00:00:41.989> time<00:00:42.290> to<00:00:42.650> sink<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:45.220> now

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
little bit more time to sink in so now

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.560 
little bit more time to sink in so now
when<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.400> started<00:00:46.670> adding<00:00:46.760> my<00:00:46.909> color<00:00:47.210> with<00:00:47.540> my

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
when I started adding my color with my

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.170 
when I started adding my color with my
pencils<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.320> I'm<00:00:48.440> just<00:00:48.830> cutting<00:00:49.040> direct<00:00:49.580> onto

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
pencils and I'm just cutting direct onto

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.719 
pencils and I'm just cutting direct onto
the<00:00:50.269> cardstock<00:00:50.570> at<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:50.960> moment<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.729> these

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
the cardstock at the moment and these

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.899 
the cardstock at the moment and these
pencils<00:00:53.540> are<00:00:53.720> very<00:00:54.409> intense<00:00:55.190> Internet<00:00:55.699> color

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
pencils are very intense Internet color

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.460 
pencils are very intense Internet color
and<00:00:56.409> it's<00:00:57.409> easier<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:58.210> add<00:00:59.210> less<00:01:00.170> than<00:01:00.379> you

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
and it's easier to add less than you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.410 
and it's easier to add less than you
think<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.799> need<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.460> then<00:01:01.970> you<00:01:02.000> can<00:01:02.269> always

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
think you need and then you can always

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.109 
think you need and then you can always
let<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:02.780> dry<00:01:03.369> after<00:01:04.369> you've<00:01:04.489> activated<00:01:04.760> it

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
let it dry after you've activated it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.700 
let it dry after you've activated it
with<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:05.540> order<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.049> you<00:01:06.200> can<00:01:06.260> always<00:01:06.470> add

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
with the order and you can always add

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.219 
with the order and you can always add
more<00:01:06.890> color<00:01:07.100> after<00:01:07.700> but<00:01:08.390> once<00:01:08.600> this<00:01:08.780> color<00:01:09.020> is

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
more color after but once this color is

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.609 
more color after but once this color is
dry<00:01:09.530> it<00:01:09.920> won't<00:01:10.520> reactivate<00:01:11.270> but<00:01:12.079> that<00:01:12.229> is<00:01:12.380> good

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
dry it won't reactivate but that is good

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.959 
dry it won't reactivate but that is good
for<00:01:12.740> some<00:01:12.950> techniques<00:01:13.340> because<00:01:13.640> that<00:01:13.820> means

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
for some techniques because that means

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.120 
for some techniques because that means
that<00:01:14.149> you<00:01:14.299> can<00:01:14.450> actually<00:01:14.600> add<00:01:15.079> other<00:01:15.469> mediums

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
that you can actually add other mediums

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.620 
that you can actually add other mediums
and<00:01:16.930> inks<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.549> markers<00:01:19.549> over<00:01:19.969> top<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.390> you

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
and inks and markers over top and you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.849 
and inks and markers over top and you
know<00:01:20.659> that<00:01:20.929> it's<00:01:21.049> not<00:01:21.229> going<00:01:21.320> to<00:01:21.409> affect<00:01:21.710> the

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
know that it's not going to affect the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.620 
know that it's not going to affect the
base<00:01:22.009> color<00:01:22.420> so<00:01:23.420> I'm<00:01:23.479> just<00:01:23.630> mapping<00:01:23.810> out<00:01:24.109> my

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
base color so I'm just mapping out my

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.599 
base color so I'm just mapping out my
shadows<00:01:26.630> at<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:26.990> moment<00:01:27.409> and<00:01:27.619> then<00:01:28.369> just

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
shadows at the moment and then just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.719 
shadows at the moment and then just
using<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.060> wet<00:01:29.299> brush<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.219> then<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.520> other

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
using a wet brush and then the other

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.609 
using a wet brush and then the other
technique<00:01:32.179> that<00:01:32.210> I'll<00:01:32.479> be<00:01:33.049> using<00:01:33.079> in<00:01:33.530> this

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
technique that I'll be using in this

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.260 
technique that I'll be using in this
video<00:01:33.799> is<00:01:34.929> direct<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> tip<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.880> pencil

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
video is direct to the tip of the pencil

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.300 
video is direct to the tip of the pencil
so<00:01:38.630> I'll<00:01:38.719> have<00:01:38.929> a<00:01:38.960> wet<00:01:39.170> brush<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.740> I<00:01:39.890> touch<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
so I'll have a wet brush and I touch the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.120 
so I'll have a wet brush and I touch the
tip<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.640> pencil<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.350> put<00:01:42.350> color<00:01:42.679> on<00:01:42.740> my

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
tip of the pencil and put color on my

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.200 
tip of the pencil and put color on my
image<00:01:43.460> with<00:01:44.450> that<00:01:44.810> sort<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.409> technique<00:01:45.829> and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
image with that sort of technique and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.959 
image with that sort of technique and
that<00:01:47.210> edge<00:01:47.420> actually<00:01:47.780> adds<00:01:48.319> a<00:01:48.619> lot<00:01:48.890> more

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
that edge actually adds a lot more

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.700 
that edge actually adds a lot more
intense<00:01:49.969> color<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.200> I'm<00:01:51.259> going<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.439> list<00:01:51.590> all

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
intense color so I'm going to list all

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.830 
intense color so I'm going to list all
the<00:01:51.770> pencils<00:01:52.310> names<00:01:53.119> of<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.329> pencils<00:01:53.630> that<00:01:53.780> I

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
the pencils names of the pencils that I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.599 
the pencils names of the pencils that I
use<00:01:54.079> over<00:01:54.319> my<00:01:54.590> blog<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.189> link<00:01:55.219> will<00:01:55.429> be<00:01:55.579> in

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
use over my blog and the link will be in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:56.950 
use over my blog and the link will be in
the<00:01:55.700> YouTube<00:01:56.090> description<00:01:56.270> below

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
the YouTube description below

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.809 
the YouTube description below
and<00:01:57.590> I'll<00:01:57.740> be<00:01:57.859> back<00:01:58.009> after<00:01:58.249> the<00:01:58.609> color

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
and I'll be back after the color

00:01:58.819 --> 00:05:27.010 
and I'll be back after the color
coloring<00:01:59.539> is<00:01:59.630> finished

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.809 

so<00:05:28.020> now<00:05:28.139> that<00:05:28.199> I've<00:05:28.440> added<00:05:28.590> my<00:05:28.919> balloon<00:05:29.280> string

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
so now that I've added my balloon string

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.570 
so now that I've added my balloon string
with<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.060> copic<00:05:30.660> multiliner<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.530> decided<00:05:32.460> that

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
with a copic multiliner I decided that

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.520 
with a copic multiliner I decided that
just<00:05:33.000> was<00:05:33.210> looking<00:05:33.449> a<00:05:33.509> little<00:05:33.599> bit<00:05:33.750> plain<00:05:34.020> so

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
just was looking a little bit plain so

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.189 
just was looking a little bit plain so
I've<00:05:34.830> taken<00:05:35.460> some<00:05:35.639> Sun<00:05:36.330> yellow<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:36.960> I'm

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
I've taken some Sun yellow and I'm

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.710 
I've taken some Sun yellow and I'm
adding<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.500> little<00:05:37.710> glow<00:05:37.889> behind<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.759> giraffe

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
adding a little glow behind the giraffe

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.350 
adding a little glow behind the giraffe
which<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.560> think<00:05:40.770> helped<00:05:41.160> make<00:05:41.610> him<00:05:41.789> pop<00:05:42.000> just<00:05:42.240> a

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
which I think helped make him pop just a

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.589 
which I think helped make him pop just a
little<00:05:42.599> bit<00:05:42.720> more<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:44.310> my<00:05:44.669> sentiment<00:05:45.150> is<00:05:45.389> from
