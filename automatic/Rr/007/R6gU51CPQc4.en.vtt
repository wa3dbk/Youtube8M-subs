like an ST G and the reason I haven't
looked<00:03:53.660> at<00:03:53.750> is<00:03:53.960> because<00:03:54.140> it's<00:03:54.470> not<00:03:54.920> elite<00:03:55.220> or

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
looked at is because it's not elite or

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.660 
looked at is because it's not elite or
legendary<00:03:56.300> I<00:03:56.540> wonder<00:03:57.260> if<00:03:57.320> that's<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.620> case<00:03:57.800> we
