00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.240
 a professor of genetics with some 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.189
 social difficulty that sets in motion 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.689
 to look for a wife and do it 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.610
 in the only way he knows that is 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.620
 scientifically and works a 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.750
 16-page questionnaire to find the 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.850
 perfect woman for him the questionnaire 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.410
 in fact there are questions to eliminate the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:49.269
 kind of women who caused it 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:51.010
 problems in the past, most 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.929
 of the people reading the book arrives 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.059
 the conclusion that don is affected by 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.160
 asperger's syndrome which is however from 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.050
 some part in the autistic spectrum 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.910
 certainly the people affected by the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.679
 syndrome or who have children affected by 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:08.800
 syndrome came into close e 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:10.390
 positive relationship with history as 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.310
 no woman predictable compared to 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.440
 all the criteria exactly then 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.020
 rosie arrives who is light years away from 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.010
 each criterion is a smoker 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.980
 vegetarian is a waitress 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.230
 all things he does not want but a use 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.270
 for don he wants to know who the person is 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.710
 your biological father your mother had 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.540
 had a story of one night and one 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.250
 graduation party of the dead without having 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.640
 never told rosicky was his true 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.640
 biological father 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.970
 obviously he knows he would go crazy for 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.100
 indulge in this story but it turns out 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.050
 strangely attracted to rosi e 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.130
 despite his judgment he decides to 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.870
 continue in the plan 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.030
 the two find themselves spending a lot of time 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.010
 together and even if they are different they must 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.110
 learn to adapt to each other 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.430
 I imagine you can imagine where the la go 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.440
 story from there 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.160
 here historical louis turns 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.810
 I originally wrote the story 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.370
 like a script 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.840
 I had always wanted to write a 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.030
 book but I never felt able 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.590
 to do so however I thought it could be 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.239
 I wrote a good script 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.069
 to a course and we needed a 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.510
 project to work on 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.980
 so I remembered the story of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.290
 a great friend of mine who had tried hard 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.160
 as don tillman to find a partner 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.660
 testori 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.310
 at the beginning the story was born as a 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.780
 drama in which the skills of women 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.030
 tillman considered mostly 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.640
 socially unacceptable became 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.320
 crucial to maintaining their relationship 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.420
 I had imagined this woman who did 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.550
 he called clara as a researcher of 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.870
 physics and he was also the two yes 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.970
 they fell in love quite naturally 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650
 most of the story was up 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:50.870
 as a woman overcome her difficulties 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.430
 in the social field I worked on this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.110
 story for two and a half years 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.540
 until I realized it wasn't like that 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.160
 as good as it could have been they are 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.540
 was encouraged to throw it away is 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.100
 the only thing I pulled out of 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.350
 trash and been don tillman ho 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.150
 transformed don into an organized geneticist 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.500
 the story setting it a few years 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.260
 before the search for the biological father 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.910
 and today it has been eaten perfectly 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.680
 compatible with don totally 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.880
 different to make it so 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.410
 a challenge in taiwan prize our year 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.690
 that script eventually won 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.850
 the award in australia presented itself 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.200
 a producer ready to make the film 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.060
 but I had always had the dream of 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.860
 writing a novel I did not think of 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.959
 be able but I realized that 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:37.640
 I had the plot I had the characters I had 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:39.740
 even the appropriate vogue and the dialogues 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.700
 step between what I had is a novel not 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.170
 it was huge 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.850
 I started working I wrote the 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.190
 novel in just four more weeks 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.630
 three weeks to fix it 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.340
 manuscript won a prize for i 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.560

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
 find a publisher and quickly we have 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.320
