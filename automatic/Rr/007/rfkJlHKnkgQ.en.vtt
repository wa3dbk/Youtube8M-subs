 1 ap sx ラ ー that debuted as a hatchback model of the s 13 Silvia 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:22.890
 The car is initially given a retractable light and equipped with a real glass hatch 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:29.810
 It was almost unnoticeable because of the popularity of Silvia 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.810
 The engine line-up of only Sylvia etc. but turbo model was the same 1.8 l

 Sr 202 that generates a maximum torque of 28 km 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:52.329
 Originally to Man dsx continues selling with this spec 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.739
 s 13 no longer should finish the production along with the full change of Sylvia 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:00.969
 However , it was exported in 2 t 4 t sx 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 Because the popularity in the black of the 2.4 liter specification did not decline 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:07.290
 Nissan decides to continue production separately from Silvia 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.619
 There was a tailwind in the Japanese market there 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:19.240
 A girl who likes to run because the new model s 14 Silvia has been enlarged 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:25.659
 It started to gather at yat sx 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:30.830

 Type s is also added 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.590
 The car is heavier than the Silvia, and the hatchback body is stiff because it becomes a handicap 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.600
 But I was told to take to Sylvia in 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:07.299
 Its weakness was overcome tuning parts is one after another release 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.069
