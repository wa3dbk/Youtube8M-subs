you

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.079 
you
this<00:00:10.719> is<00:00:10.900> tubal-cain<00:00:11.259> again<00:00:11.950> with<00:00:12.190> part<00:00:12.400> 2<00:00:12.789> of

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.089 
this is tubal-cain again with part 2 of

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.189 
this is tubal-cain again with part 2 of
the<00:00:13.809> sign<00:00:14.019> bar<00:00:14.429> be<00:00:15.429> sure<00:00:15.610> and<00:00:15.759> watch<00:00:15.879> part<00:00:16.209> 1<00:00:16.449> if

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
the sign bar be sure and watch part 1 if

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.670 
the sign bar be sure and watch part 1 if
you<00:00:17.259> haven't<00:00:17.410> already<00:00:17.770> seen<00:00:18.070> it<00:00:19.259> now<00:00:20.259> the<00:00:20.320> sign

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
you haven't already seen it now the sign

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.460 
you haven't already seen it now the sign
bars<00:00:20.980> still<00:00:21.789> set<00:00:22.119> at<00:00:22.300> 12<00:00:22.509> degrees<00:00:22.750> 30<00:00:23.349> minutes

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
bars still set at 12 degrees 30 minutes

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.279 
bars still set at 12 degrees 30 minutes
that's<00:00:23.949> 12<00:00:24.189> and<00:00:24.400> a<00:00:24.430> half<00:00:24.460> degrees<00:00:25.000> and<00:00:25.300> I'm

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
that's 12 and a half degrees and I'm

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.570 
that's 12 and a half degrees and I'm
just<00:00:26.500> trying<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.859> show<00:00:27.039> you<00:00:27.099> several

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
just trying to show you several

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.609 
just trying to show you several
different<00:00:27.820> applications<00:00:28.750> for<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.109> sign<00:00:29.349> bar

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
different applications for the sign bar

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.740 
different applications for the sign bar
so<00:00:29.920> we've<00:00:30.429> got<00:00:30.519> a<00:00:30.550> piece<00:00:30.759> of<00:00:30.789> stock<00:00:31.179> on<00:00:31.480> here

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
so we've got a piece of stock on here

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.619 
so we've got a piece of stock on here
with<00:00:31.929> in<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:32.949> layout<00:00:33.160> dye<00:00:33.519> on<00:00:33.699> it<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.030> my

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
with in the layout dye on it and my

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.390 
with in the layout dye on it and my
height<00:00:34.870> gauge<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.800> I'm<00:00:35.949> just<00:00:36.129> going<00:00:36.339> to

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
height gauge and I'm just going to

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.189 
height gauge and I'm just going to
scribe<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:36.879> line<00:00:36.910> on<00:00:37.269> it<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:37.570> that<00:00:37.660> line<00:00:37.930> will

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
scribe a line on it and that line will

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.410 
scribe a line on it and that line will
of<00:00:38.320> course<00:00:38.470> be<00:00:38.769> exactly<00:00:39.250> 12<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.030> 1/2<00:00:40.089> degrees

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
of course be exactly 12 and 1/2 degrees

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.070 
of course be exactly 12 and 1/2 degrees
in<00:00:41.940> comparison<00:00:42.940> to<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.210> bottom<00:00:43.690> of<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.900> work

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
in comparison to the bottom of the work

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.160 
in comparison to the bottom of the work
or<00:00:44.379> the<00:00:44.799> surface<00:00:45.640> plate<00:00:45.909> so<00:00:46.479> we'll<00:00:46.659> describe

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
or the surface plate so we'll describe

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.869 
or the surface plate so we'll describe
that<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:52.890> there<00:00:53.890> we<00:00:54.040> have<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.250> line<00:00:54.549> if<00:00:54.760> it

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
that and there we have a line if it

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.410 
that and there we have a line if it
shows<00:00:55.119> up<00:00:55.150> that<00:00:55.839> is<00:00:59.339> exactly<00:01:00.339> 12<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:01.330> 1/2

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
shows up that is exactly 12 and 1/2

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.760 
shows up that is exactly 12 and 1/2
degrees<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:04.809> let's<00:01:05.229> try<00:01:05.409> some<00:01:05.619> other

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
degrees now let's try some other

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.430 
degrees now let's try some other
applications<00:01:06.549> on<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.510> other<00:01:07.630> machines<00:01:13.440> now

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
applications on the other machines now

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.220 
applications on the other machines now
here's<00:01:14.830> an<00:01:14.950> example<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.760> how<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.060> might<00:01:16.270> use<00:01:16.840> a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
here's an example of how you might use a

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.470 
here's an example of how you might use a
sign<00:01:17.770> bar<00:01:18.040> on<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.340> lathe<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.000> I'm<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
sign bar on a lathe so I'm on the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.380 
sign bar on a lathe so I'm on the
closing<00:01:19.930> lay<00:01:20.110> then<00:01:20.440> we<00:01:20.530> we've<00:01:21.190> got<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:22.030> small

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
closing lay then we we've got the small

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.230 
closing lay then we we've got the small
three<00:01:25.390> inch<00:01:25.570> sign<00:01:25.990> bar<00:01:26.380> set<00:01:27.159> for<00:01:27.490> 12<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.180> a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
three inch sign bar set for 12 and a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.260 
three inch sign bar set for 12 and a
half<00:01:28.360> degrees<00:01:28.780> yet<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.860> use<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.610> big<00:01:30.790> sign<00:01:31.030> bar

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
half degrees yet I use the big sign bar

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.420 
half degrees yet I use the big sign bar
before<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.960> a<00:01:31.990> smaller<00:01:32.350> one<00:01:32.590> the<00:01:33.190> big<00:01:33.400> one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
before this is a smaller one the big one

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.520 
before this is a smaller one the big one
would<00:01:33.790> be<00:01:33.940> most<00:01:34.150> awkward<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.870> use<00:01:35.050> on<00:01:35.320> this

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
would be most awkward to use on this

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.470 
would be most awkward to use on this
because<00:01:35.770> they're<00:01:36.070> hard<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.430> use<00:01:36.610> when<00:01:37.300> they're

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
because they're hard to use when they're

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.290 
because they're hard to use when they're
in<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.900> horizontal<00:01:38.620> position<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:40.120> so

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
in the horizontal position like this so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.620 
in the horizontal position like this so
what<00:01:40.450> I've<00:01:40.570> done<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.350> I've<00:01:41.500> taken<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.630> little

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
what I've done is I've taken the little

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.480 
what I've done is I've taken the little
sign<00:01:43.870> bar<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.260> I've<00:01:44.320> got<00:01:44.500> three<00:01:44.770> magnets<00:01:45.250> here

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
sign bar and I've got three magnets here

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.300 
sign bar and I've got three magnets here
ceramic<00:01:46.090> magnets<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.750> I've<00:01:46.870> got<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:48.100> thing

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
ceramic magnets and I've got the thing

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.990 
ceramic magnets and I've got the thing
fastened<00:01:48.940> along<00:01:49.240> with<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.720> spacers<00:01:50.409> onto<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
fastened along with the spacers onto the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.630 
fastened along with the spacers onto the
compound<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.900> lathe<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.530> preset<00:01:54.490> the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
compound of the lathe I preset the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.430 
compound of the lathe I preset the
compound<00:01:55.180> for<00:01:55.420> around<00:01:55.750> 12<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.409> half

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
compound for around 12 and a half

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.230 
compound for around 12 and a half
degrees<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.130> best<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.460> could<00:01:57.610> see<00:01:57.880> another

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
degrees the best you could see another

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.270 
degrees the best you could see another
regular<00:01:59.140> protractor<00:01:59.740> is<00:01:59.799> way<00:01:59.920> over<00:02:00.159> on<00:02:00.250> the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
regular protractor is way over on the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.610 
regular protractor is way over on the
other<00:02:00.370> side<00:02:00.580> so<00:02:01.479> it's<00:02:01.690> a<00:02:02.049> little<00:02:02.260> bit<00:02:02.350> hard<00:02:02.560> to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
other side so it's a little bit hard to

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.680 
other side so it's a little bit hard to
see<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.369> put<00:02:06.610> an<00:02:06.700> indicator<00:02:06.940> on<00:02:07.240> here

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
see and then I put an indicator on here

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.970 
see and then I put an indicator on here
and<00:02:07.840> I've<00:02:08.080> been<00:02:08.229> running<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:10.379> cross<00:02:11.379> slide

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
and I've been running the cross slide

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.180 
and I've been running the cross slide
back<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.700> forth<00:02:12.760> until<00:02:13.360> I've<00:02:13.690> got<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.190> pretty

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
back and forth until I've got a pretty

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.550 
back and forth until I've got a pretty
close<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> zero<00:02:15.819> reading<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:16.989> let's<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:17.470> if

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
close to a zero reading so let's see if

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.330 
close to a zero reading so let's see if
we<00:02:17.709> can<00:02:17.890> show<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.760> now

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.100 

try<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.400> zoom<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.940> in<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.450> can<00:02:25.629> got<00:02:26.629> a<00:02:26.659> heck

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
try to zoom that in if I can got a heck

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.089 
try to zoom that in if I can got a heck
of<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.349> glare<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.930> indicator<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:30.980> going

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
of a glare on the indicator so I'm going

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.740 
of a glare on the indicator so I'm going
to<00:02:31.190> shade<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.879> little<00:02:32.090> bit<00:02:32.239> and

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
to shade that just a little bit and

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.059 
to shade that just a little bit and
we'll<00:02:33.440> run<00:02:33.680> this<00:02:34.810> across<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.230> you're<00:02:36.890> going

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
we'll run this across and you're going

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.210 
we'll run this across and you're going
to<00:02:37.099> see<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.670> got<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.830> within<00:02:39.830> about<00:02:40.190> a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
to see that I got it within about a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.050 
to see that I got it within about a
thousandth<00:02:41.860> there<00:02:42.860> may<00:02:43.099> be<00:02:43.129> times<00:02:43.670> when<00:02:43.910> you

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
thousandth there may be times when you

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.059 
thousandth there may be times when you
want<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.480> set<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.959> compound<00:02:45.560> that

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
want to set your compound that

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.000 
want to set your compound that
accurately<00:02:46.790> see<00:02:47.120> I'm<00:02:47.209> within<00:02:47.629> a<00:02:48.010> thousandth

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
accurately see I'm within a thousandth

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.039 
accurately see I'm within a thousandth
at<00:02:49.129> this<00:02:49.310> time<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.110> three-inch<00:02:51.110> run<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:53.049> could

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
at this time on a three-inch run I could

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.569 
at this time on a three-inch run I could
spend<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.290> little<00:02:54.410> more<00:02:54.620> time<00:02:54.829> again<00:02:55.160> to<00:02:55.340> get<00:02:55.459> it

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
spend a little more time again to get it

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.150 
spend a little more time again to get it
just<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.849> hair<00:02:55.879> closer<00:02:56.329> I'm<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:57.440> going<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.890> for

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
just a hair closer I'm not going to for

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.300 
just a hair closer I'm not going to for
this<00:02:58.310> demonstration<00:02:58.870> purposes<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.829> should

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
this demonstration purposes but should

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.250 
this demonstration purposes but should
you<00:03:01.340> need<00:03:01.609> to<00:03:01.670> set<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.120> real<00:03:02.510> accurate<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.200> is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
you need to set it real accurate this is

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.640 
you need to set it real accurate this is
one<00:03:03.560> way<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.769> doing<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.489> I<00:03:04.670> do<00:03:05.090> not<00:03:05.480> think<00:03:05.870> that

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.449 

you<00:03:09.650> could<00:03:09.829> use<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.400> big<00:03:11.000> one<00:03:11.859> on<00:03:12.859> there<00:03:13.220> and

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
you could use this big one on there and

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.369 
you could use this big one on there and
it's<00:03:13.670> too<00:03:13.819> heavy<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.180> be<00:03:14.359> held<00:03:14.569> by<00:03:14.750> magnets<00:03:15.260> so

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
it's too heavy to be held by magnets so

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.740 
it's too heavy to be held by magnets so
that<00:03:15.560> little<00:03:15.709> one<00:03:15.920> is<00:03:16.160> pretty<00:03:17.030> handy<00:03:17.420> for<00:03:17.599> this

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
that little one is pretty handy for this

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.410 
that little one is pretty handy for this
purpose<00:03:21.370> okay<00:03:22.370> here's<00:03:22.609> another<00:03:22.670> way<00:03:23.060> to<00:03:23.120> use

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
purpose okay here's another way to use

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.940 
purpose okay here's another way to use
the<00:03:23.780> sine<00:03:24.019> bar<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.440> I'm<00:03:24.500> going<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.709> use<00:03:24.799> the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
the sine bar and I'm going to use the

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.520 
the sine bar and I'm going to use the
little<00:03:25.160> 3<00:03:25.459> inch<00:03:25.489> sine<00:03:25.940> bar<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.989> we're<00:03:27.230> going

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
little 3 inch sine bar and we're going

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.129 
little 3 inch sine bar and we're going
to<00:03:30.040> create<00:03:31.040> an<00:03:31.250> angle<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:31.730> 4<00:03:31.970> degrees<00:03:32.359> 36

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
to create an angle that's 4 degrees 36

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:33.729 
to create an angle that's 4 degrees 36
minutes

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
minutes

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.009 
minutes
and<00:03:33.889> we'll<00:03:34.489> get<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.760> by<00:03:35.150> using<00:03:35.419> a<00:03:35.690> quarter

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
and we'll get that by using a quarter

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.710 
and we'll get that by using a quarter
inch<00:03:36.169> riser<00:03:36.680> block<00:03:37.099> and<00:03:37.489> in<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.120> case<00:03:38.389> I'm

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
inch riser block and in this case I'm

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.009 
inch riser block and in this case I'm
using<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:39.440> ground<00:03:39.769> lathe<00:03:40.579> tool<00:03:41.030> bit<00:03:41.359> which

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
using a ground lathe tool bit which

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.270 
using a ground lathe tool bit which
happens<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.620> be<00:03:42.769> exactly<00:03:43.239> quarter<00:03:44.239> inch<00:03:44.450> I

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
happens to be exactly quarter inch I

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
and that is that showing up 250

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.379 
and that is that showing up 250
thousandths<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:59.530> when<00:04:00.530> we<00:04:00.829> lay<00:04:01.040> that<00:04:01.389> into

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
thousandths and when we lay that into

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:05.140 
thousandths and when we lay that into
the<00:04:02.599> vises<00:04:03.019> vise<00:04:03.380> jaws<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:04.099> then<00:04:04.609> we<00:04:04.730> use<00:04:04.910> this

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
the vises vise jaws and then we use this

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.580 
the vises vise jaws and then we use this
very<00:04:05.419> thin<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.169> little<00:04:06.440> 3<00:04:06.739> inch<00:04:08.049> sine<00:04:09.049> bar<00:04:09.319> lay

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
very thin the little 3 inch sine bar lay

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.690 
very thin the little 3 inch sine bar lay
it<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:09.829> there<00:04:09.950> like<00:04:10.190> that

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
it in there like that

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.620 
it in there like that
we<00:04:11.150> have<00:04:11.329> now<00:04:11.510> created<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:12.669> 4<00:04:13.669> degree<00:04:14.290> 36<00:04:15.340> minute

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
we have now created a 4 degree 36 minute

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.029 
we have now created a 4 degree 36 minute
parallel<00:04:17.630> actually<00:04:18.139> it's<00:04:18.229> not<00:04:18.349> parallel<00:04:18.829> but

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
parallel actually it's not parallel but

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.250 
parallel actually it's not parallel but
you<00:04:19.130> get<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.459> gist<00:04:19.729> now<00:04:20.359> your<00:04:20.630> work<00:04:20.870> could<00:04:21.139> be

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
you get the gist now your work could be

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.760 
you get the gist now your work could be
laid<00:04:21.500> on<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:22.419> I've<00:04:23.419> got<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.780> vise<00:04:24.260> jaws<00:04:24.530> wide

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
laid on that I've got the vise jaws wide

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.490 
laid on that I've got the vise jaws wide
open<00:04:25.160> I<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:26.240> we<00:04:26.419> would<00:04:26.630> pull<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.199> and

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
open I that we would pull that in and

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.930 
open I that we would pull that in and
it's<00:04:27.650> thin<00:04:27.860> enough<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.340> where<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.699> wouldn't

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
it's thin enough to where it wouldn't

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.060 
it's thin enough to where it wouldn't
interfere<00:04:29.210> with<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.690> vise<00:04:29.870> closing<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.770> then

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
interfere with the vise closing and then

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.339 
interfere with the vise closing and then
you<00:04:31.190> could<00:04:31.370> drill<00:04:31.610> your<00:04:31.789> holes<00:04:32.030> or<00:04:32.479> mill<00:04:33.110> or

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
you could drill your holes or mill or

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:34.159 
you could drill your holes or mill or
whatever<00:04:33.620> your<00:04:33.800> op

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169

whatever your op
raishin<00:04:34.469> was<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:34.949> required<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.789> that

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
raishin was that required that that

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.920 
raishin was that required that that

work<00:04:45.300> on<00:04:45.569> you<00:04:46.349> also<00:04:46.560> could<00:04:47.069> slide<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.879> out<00:04:48.090> of

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
work on you also could slide this out of

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.580 
work on you also could slide this out of
there<00:04:48.659> after<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:50.159> have<00:04:50.370> pinched<00:04:51.150> your<00:04:51.300> work

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
there after you have pinched your work

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.719 
there after you have pinched your work
in<00:04:52.590> case<00:04:52.830> you're<00:04:52.979> drilling<00:04:53.189> all<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.610> way

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
in case you're drilling all the way

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.790 
in case you're drilling all the way
through<00:04:53.969> and<00:04:54.120> didn't<00:04:54.300> want<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.539> damage<00:04:54.810> the

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
through and didn't want to damage the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:05.059 
through and didn't want to damage the
sign<00:04:56.370> bar<00:05:02.210> this<00:05:03.210> particular<00:05:03.779> application<00:05:04.590> for

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
sign bar this particular application for

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.899 
sign bar this particular application for
this<00:05:06.029> spindle<00:05:06.569> square<00:05:07.050> was<00:05:07.979> suggested<00:05:08.699> in<00:05:08.789> the

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
this spindle square was suggested in the

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:10.909 
this spindle square was suggested in the
directions<00:05:09.240> that<00:05:09.930> came<00:05:10.110> along<00:05:10.319> with<00:05:10.379> it<00:05:10.589> so

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
directions that came along with it so

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.519 
directions that came along with it so
I'll<00:05:11.759> do<00:05:11.939> that<00:05:11.969> demonstration<00:05:12.749> and<00:05:13.259> we're

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:13.529 
I'll do that demonstration and we're

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.879 
I'll do that demonstration and we're
going<00:05:13.680> to<00:05:13.740> tilt<00:05:14.009> the<00:05:14.249> head<00:05:14.520> for<00:05:15.620> 12<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.830> half

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
going to tilt the head for 12 and a half

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.600 
going to tilt the head for 12 and a half
degrees<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.960> then<00:05:18.960> we're<00:05:19.139> going<00:05:19.349> to<00:05:19.469> test<00:05:20.430> it

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
degrees and then we're going to test it

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.399 
degrees and then we're going to test it
with<00:05:20.729> this<00:05:20.879> tramming<00:05:21.389> device<00:05:21.689> or<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.020> spindle

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:24.439 
with this tramming device or the spindle
square<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.740> should<00:05:23.039> call<00:05:23.249> it<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.729> we've<00:05:24.240> got

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
square I should call it and we've got

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.070 
square I should call it and we've got
the<00:05:24.860> sine<00:05:25.860> bar<00:05:26.099> all<00:05:26.699> set<00:05:27.120> up<00:05:27.270> at<00:05:27.449> 12<00:05:27.689> and<00:05:27.839> 1/2

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
the sine bar all set up at 12 and 1/2

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.779 
the sine bar all set up at 12 and 1/2
degrees<00:05:28.259> on<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.770> table<00:05:29.129> the<00:05:29.249> vise<00:05:29.400> has<00:05:29.639> been

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
degrees on the table the vise has been

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.420 
degrees on the table the vise has been
removed<00:05:30.150> if<00:05:30.509> you<00:05:31.139> have<00:05:31.319> a<00:05:31.349> very<00:05:31.620> accurate<00:05:31.919> vise

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
removed if you have a very accurate vise

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.369 
removed if you have a very accurate vise
you<00:05:32.669> can<00:05:32.849> do<00:05:32.969> this<00:05:33.210> even<00:05:33.719> while<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.990> vise<00:05:34.139> is

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
you can do this even while the vise is

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.700 
you can do this even while the vise is
installed<00:05:34.889> the<00:05:35.129> mine<00:05:35.339> was<00:05:35.520> off<00:05:35.699> anyway<00:05:36.150> so<00:05:36.710> I'm

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
installed the mine was off anyway so I'm

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.969 
installed the mine was off anyway so I'm
going<00:05:38.069> with<00:05:38.250> this<00:05:39.139> particular<00:05:40.139> method<00:05:40.500> now

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
going with this particular method now

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.760 
going with this particular method now
first<00:05:41.279> of<00:05:41.430> all<00:05:41.520> loosen<00:05:42.029> up<00:05:42.149> all<00:05:42.389> four<00:05:42.810> bolts

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
first of all loosen up all four bolts

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.170 
first of all loosen up all four bolts
here<00:05:44.189> and<00:05:45.919> loosen<00:05:46.919> them<00:05:47.219> only<00:05:47.370> slightly<00:05:48.000> like

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
here and loosen them only slightly like

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.629 
here and loosen them only slightly like
a<00:05:48.210> quarter<00:05:48.719> of<00:05:48.839> a<00:05:48.960> turn<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.229> then<00:05:50.189> over<00:05:50.610> here

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
a quarter of a turn and then over here

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:56.480 
a quarter of a turn and then over here
we<00:05:51.270> turn<00:05:52.310> this<00:05:53.310> bolt<00:05:53.699> and<00:05:55.279> we've<00:05:56.279> got<00:05:56.460> a

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
we turn this bolt and we've got a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.889 
we turn this bolt and we've got a
protractor<00:05:57.270> here<00:05:59.089> and<00:06:00.089> I<00:06:00.389> think<00:06:00.479> that's<00:06:00.719> going

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:00.899 
protractor here and I think that's going

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:02.029 
protractor here and I think that's going
to<00:06:00.990> show<00:06:01.139> up<00:06:01.319> good<00:06:01.529> with<00:06:01.649> the<00:06:01.710> high<00:06:01.979> definition

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
to show up good with the high definition

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.439 
to show up good with the high definition
and<00:06:02.819> I've<00:06:02.909> got<00:06:03.120> it<00:06:03.300> set<00:06:03.539> at<00:06:03.569> twelve<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.259> a<00:06:04.319> half

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
and I've got it set at twelve and a half

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.589 
and I've got it set at twelve and a half
pretty<00:06:06.449> close<00:06:06.719> and<00:06:07.339> believe<00:06:08.339> it<00:06:08.490> or<00:06:08.580> not<00:06:08.789> when

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
pretty close and believe it or not when

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.139 
pretty close and believe it or not when
I<00:06:09.629> went<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.289> check<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:10.889> I<00:06:11.099> was<00:06:11.279> fairly<00:06:11.699> close

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.149 
I went to check this I was fairly close

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:15.379 
I went to check this I was fairly close
so<00:06:12.659> let's<00:06:12.930> bring<00:06:13.110> that<00:06:13.169> down<00:06:13.379> and<00:06:14.149> watch<00:06:15.149> those

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:15.389 
so let's bring that down and watch those

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.480 
so let's bring that down and watch those
indicators<00:06:17.449> so<00:06:18.449> we're<00:06:18.719> about<00:06:19.020> one<00:06:19.949> came<00:06:20.219> up<00:06:20.339> to

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
indicators so we're about one came up to

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.480 
indicators so we're about one came up to
zero<00:06:20.789> and<00:06:21.120> one<00:06:21.330> did<00:06:21.599> not<00:06:21.830> be<00:06:22.830> sure<00:06:22.979> look<00:06:23.249> at<00:06:23.339> my

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
zero and one did not be sure look at my

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.379 
zero and one did not be sure look at my
other<00:06:23.610> video<00:06:24.089> where<00:06:24.419> I<00:06:25.069> do<00:06:26.069> use<00:06:26.339> this<00:06:26.610> spindle

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
other video where I do use this spindle

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.839 
other video where I do use this spindle
square<00:06:27.779> so<00:06:28.560> I'm<00:06:28.710> just<00:06:28.949> going<00:06:29.189> to<00:06:29.249> adjust<00:06:29.430> a

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
square so I'm just going to adjust a

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.179 
square so I'm just going to adjust a
little<00:06:29.969> bit<00:06:30.149> off-camera<00:06:30.659> until<00:06:31.560> both<00:06:31.770> of<00:06:31.800> them

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:32.189 
little bit off-camera until both of them

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:34.010 
little bit off-camera until both of them
come<00:06:32.639> up<00:06:32.819> zero<00:06:33.210> and<00:06:33.449> then<00:06:33.539> I'll<00:06:33.629> show<00:06:33.810> that

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
come up zero and then I'll show that

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.100 
come up zero and then I'll show that
again

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.339 

okay<00:06:38.180> I've<00:06:39.180> reset<00:06:39.780> it<00:06:39.930> and<00:06:40.080> it's<00:06:40.199> coming

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
okay I've reset it and it's coming

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.200 
okay I've reset it and it's coming
pretty<00:06:40.800> darn<00:06:41.009> close<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.490> zero<00:06:41.729> and<00:06:41.939> I<00:06:42.000> watch

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
pretty darn close to zero and I watch

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.510 
pretty darn close to zero and I watch
this<00:06:42.479> as<00:06:42.659> I<00:06:42.689> raise<00:06:43.020> the<00:06:43.349> table<00:06:43.620> watch<00:06:44.039> the<00:06:44.310> two

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
this as I raise the table watch the two

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.950 
this as I raise the table watch the two
indicators<00:06:45.530> come<00:06:46.530> up<00:06:46.680> to<00:06:46.949> zero<00:06:47.370> at<00:06:48.360> the<00:06:48.719> same

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
indicators come up to zero at the same

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.070 
indicators come up to zero at the same
time<00:06:49.610> I'm<00:06:50.610> going<00:06:50.819> to<00:06:50.909> zoom<00:06:51.090> that<00:06:51.330> in<00:06:51.569> if<00:06:51.689> I<00:06:51.810> can

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
time I'm going to zoom that in if I can

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:00.950 
time I'm going to zoom that in if I can
and<00:06:52.469> try<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:52.860> again<00:06:53.009> and<00:06:59.300> I'm<00:07:00.300> holding<00:07:00.539> a<00:07:00.810> piece

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
and try it again and I'm holding a piece

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.480 
and try it again and I'm holding a piece
of<00:07:00.990> cardboard<00:07:01.590> to<00:07:01.650> try<00:07:01.860> to<00:07:01.919> get<00:07:02.129> rid<00:07:02.280> of<00:07:02.310> the

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
of cardboard to try to get rid of the

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.010 
of cardboard to try to get rid of the
reflection<00:07:03.060> I<00:07:03.180> think<00:07:03.210> it's<00:07:03.479> working<00:07:03.689> pretty

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
reflection I think it's working pretty

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.170 
reflection I think it's working pretty
good<00:07:04.229> but<00:07:04.409> I'm<00:07:04.889> going<00:07:05.069> to<00:07:05.129> raise<00:07:05.699> the<00:07:05.939> table

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
good but I'm going to raise the table

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.959 
good but I'm going to raise the table
now<00:07:06.530> watch<00:07:07.530> the<00:07:07.770> needles<00:07:08.099> come<00:07:08.280> up<00:07:08.430> to<00:07:08.639> zero

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:08.969 
now watch the needles come up to zero

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.909 
now watch the needles come up to zero
together<00:07:09.719> and<00:07:11.150> that<00:07:12.150> shows<00:07:12.479> you<00:07:12.780> now<00:07:13.349> that<00:07:13.889> I

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 
together and that shows you now that I

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.959 
together and that shows you now that I
have<00:07:14.310> the<00:07:14.610> head<00:07:15.360> tilted<00:07:15.960> at<00:07:16.259> a<00:07:16.680> true<00:07:17.219> 12

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:17.969 
have the head tilted at a true 12

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.499 
have the head tilted at a true 12
degrees<00:07:18.780> 30<00:07:19.319> minutes<00:07:19.729> no-nonsense<00:07:20.729> with<00:07:21.389> the

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:21.509 
degrees 30 minutes no-nonsense with the

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:26.689 
degrees 30 minutes no-nonsense with the
protractor<00:07:22.259> that<00:07:22.289> is<00:07:22.620> only<00:07:23.280> fairly<00:07:24.030> close<00:07:25.699> now

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 
protractor that is only fairly close now

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:30.050 
protractor that is only fairly close now
that's<00:07:26.940> another<00:07:27.560> application<00:07:28.560> for<00:07:29.490> the<00:07:29.789> sine

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
that's another application for the sine

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.980 
that's another application for the sine
bar

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:30.990 
bar

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.930 
bar
I'm<00:07:31.259> sure<00:07:31.529> there's<00:07:31.800> thousands<00:07:32.490> of<00:07:32.580> different

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
I'm sure there's thousands of different

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.450 
I'm sure there's thousands of different
uses<00:07:33.180> I've<00:07:33.509> just<00:07:33.659> given<00:07:33.870> you<00:07:34.020> a<00:07:34.139> little<00:07:34.460> idea

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 
uses I've just given you a little idea

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.809 
uses I've just given you a little idea
of<00:07:35.550> how<00:07:36.150> you<00:07:36.449> might<00:07:36.750> use<00:07:37.050> a<00:07:37.289> sine<00:07:37.710> bar<00:07:38.009> but

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 
of how you might use a sine bar but

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:41.659 
of how you might use a sine bar but
mostly<00:07:39.509> what<00:07:40.199> you<00:07:40.349> might<00:07:40.500> use<00:07:40.650> a<00:07:40.680> sine<00:07:41.039> bar<00:07:41.310> for

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:41.669 
mostly what you might use a sine bar for

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:45.800 
mostly what you might use a sine bar for
is<00:07:44.090> applications<00:07:45.090> that<00:07:45.210> would<00:07:45.360> come<00:07:45.629> out<00:07:45.659> of

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810 
is applications that would come out of

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.619 
is applications that would come out of
your<00:07:46.110> own<00:07:46.229> imagination<00:07:46.740> on<00:07:47.490> just<00:07:48.120> about<00:07:48.270> any

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:48.629 
your own imagination on just about any

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:51.350 
your own imagination on just about any
machine<00:07:49.080> they<00:07:49.830> also<00:07:50.069> make<00:07:50.460> a<00:07:50.490> tool<00:07:50.819> called<00:07:51.180> a

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 
machine they also make a tool called a

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.719 
machine they also make a tool called a
sine<00:07:51.659> plate<00:07:52.199> which<00:07:52.949> is<00:07:53.159> something<00:07:53.370> like<00:07:53.550> a

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729 
sine plate which is something like a

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:56.209 
sine plate which is something like a
sine<00:07:54.120> bar<00:07:54.479> only<00:07:54.870> it's<00:07:55.169> a<00:07:55.319> larger<00:07:55.770> working

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:56.219 
sine bar only it's a larger working

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:58.640 
sine bar only it's a larger working
surface<00:07:56.699> and<00:07:56.909> there<00:07:57.690> are<00:07:57.810> some<00:07:58.050> of<00:07:58.199> them<00:07:58.349> that

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.650 
surface and there are some of them that

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.119 
surface and there are some of them that
tilt<00:07:58.979> in<00:07:59.250> both<00:07:59.490> directions

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:01.129
