 this time since it was released 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.600
 So far, I would say that from 1 to 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.460
 10 20 is a record that decided to wait 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.379
 a lot not only with our audience 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.449

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.839
 that was prepared with a lot of love and with 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.890
 long time almost more than three years and 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.260

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.149
 the luck of so many times that we come to 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.100
 mexico having shared the stage with 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.690
 the boys of the pantheon Rococo the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.940

 in Argentina and throughout Latin America 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.220
 resonates to this day 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.770
 we also encourage you to send an email 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.560
 luckily for that question of destiny 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.750
 so grateful to have tremendous 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.940
 musicians in our new material and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 great people too because we have 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.750
 I was lucky to meet and happy to 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.210
 can have spoken a kind of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.740
 good friendly musical relationship soon 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.940
 is going to present this day also here 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.710
 in the night there will be some other 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.360
 Looks I do not want 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.860
 overtake nothing but surely going to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.310
 have several surprises about the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.620
 scenarios 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.020
 of locations during we are playing 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.790
 so I want to invite everyone to be 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.250
 approach the match because of the hot 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.630
 and returning it from the record because the wait 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.330
 three years 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 says in a natural way 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.040
 we had taken out our last album 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.830
 Dancer luckily we had a lot 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.890
 work we went traveling a lot for 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.280
 all Latin America in fact now we 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.160
 we go in October for europe and good that 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.020
 was what caused him to dilate so much in 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.780
 the moment to enter a studio to record 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.690
 this new material and also the premise 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.420
 It was when we the righteous songs 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.690
 for this good album we made more than 100 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.690
 that left 12 so nothing was why 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.450
 that the wait but good was worth it 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.980
 they have since 97 playing they are almost there 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.580
 for buying their 20 years have thought 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.580
 some tour d 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.720
 if this said I think it 's the beginning of 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.360
 a trilogy 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.980
 the three materials that I think the most 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.440
 to culminate with the celebration of our 20 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.480
 years as we are just going well you said and with 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.520
 a split live album but good that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.640
 is later this year concentrated on 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.110
 psychology and in to celebrate our 18 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.670
 spring years that we meet in 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.770
 August so they are all invited 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.630
 surely we will come to the end of the year 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.700
 to celebrate the 18-year career of the 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.160
 hot perfect finally the message 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.360
