 welcome to metabolism tv your source 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.840
 of correct information about the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.939
 metabolism and health coconut oil and 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.590
 cellulitis 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.259
 I am frank Suarez specialist in 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.970
 obesity and good metabolism I want 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.600
 answer a question from the friend 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.100
 Isabel Vega Isabella Vega asks us what 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.930
 he knows he can ask questions that he can 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.550
 write questions on metabolism tv 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.170
 he only writes the bottom part 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.720
 we gladly put it on 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.790
 ready to answer the question we 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.370
 question does not say this 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.550
 How does coconut oil help me 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.620
 eliminate cellulite 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.880
 that is the question of isabel vega by 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.380
 what 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.240
 let's talk a little bit about this 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.460
 because many women ask us 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.590
 on the subject of cellulite and we're going to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.380
 see what that has to do if something with the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.700
 coconut oil issue the first thing would be 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.890
 start to define what is cellulite 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 we are talking about a condition where 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.490
 the body accumulates something under the skin 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 I'm going to the blackboard for a little while 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 explain a little bit how it is that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.240
 creates cellulite and what are the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 causes of cellulite what is it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.880
 has seen that it can help reduce 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.880
 cellulitis 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.560
 an interesting fact that I want to share 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.070
 with you the next I do a lot 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.450
 research what I learn I do 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.780
 investigating I am very curious 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.970
 then I read everything I see things that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.759
 they have to do with science I have the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.220
 clinical studies then things that are a 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.210
 little yes more esoteric as saying the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.759
 Indian medicine was helped by steele or 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.579
 different things not because I find 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 that the truth is as watered and as 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.600
 that I can not have the truth 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.130
 but is watered and everyone 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.810
 has as a bit of truth already 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.880
 Sometimes I have to read some strange topic 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.060
 for within that topic find some 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.310
 true of something that I see that aligns with 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.310
 what I have seen that works that is 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.630
 the way that year investigated then 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.810
 investigating other topics one day I 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.170
 I found a piece of information there is a study 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.790
 what they do to the women of the Amazon 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.770
 in the Amazon there are women who live in 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.110
 the jungle and these women who are 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.420
 indigenous people who live in the jungle some 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.520
 of them are chubby but they are 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.700
 chubby because the kind of diets that 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.200
 use a certain tribe in amazons is a 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.880
 diet where what they eat is true 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 tuber that is like a type 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.760
 of potatoes as if it were a starch and 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.500
 they eat that tuber all the time 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.530
 what happens like that has a lot of starch 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.580
 as that has a lot of glucose then 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.040
 these women live in the jungle 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.350
 the house man and others but they have 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.270
 even the chubby and what is a woman 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.790
 who has physical activity because in 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.070
 there's no microwave in that kind of 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.600
 things are nevertheless chubby but there 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.820
 a curious fact that comes out in these 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.940
 studies and is that they are chubby but not 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.950
 they have no hint of cellulite that's a 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.349
 interesting data 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.360
 however the woman here in the world 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.410
 western 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.610
 she gets chubby 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.880
 they grow up to the buttocks and the 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.580
 cellulite then what is the difference 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.770
 Well, there are other studies that show 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.080
 that for example if they do an autopsy 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.620
 to a corpse of a person who has 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.420
 cellulite when they extract what is in 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.420
 cellulite find 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.290
 the toxic 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.470
 So cellulite is cellulite 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.830
 it is an accumulation of toxic 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.050
 that makes total logic because 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.400
 the woman who is in the jungle can 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.640
 be chubby but there is no 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.830
 pesticides there there are no dyes there 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.870
 there are no condoms there the toxic as 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.700
 there is no toxic can not be chubby 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.730
 it may have fat but it does not have 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.330
 cellulite means that cellulite 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.250
 cellulite seems to be an effort of the 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:28.400
 Body to cover the toxic in fat 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.070
 to waterproof what is already known and that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.060
 is recognized for example the fat of 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.650
 a human being is not white 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.139
 in fact the fat a human being comes 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.820
 yellow this anyone knows 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.100
 who has undergone surgery or who has 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.870
 seen a person with a wound the 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.450
 human body fat is well yellow 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.030
 in more yellows than the fat that is 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.560
 found under the skin on the 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.930
 breast of a chicken that is like 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.380
 yellowish so the fat of a being 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.680
 human is not white think the fat of 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.500
 a pig is completely white 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.900
 it's not yellow and that makes logic too 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.360
 because the pig is vegetarian 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.250
 pigs do not eat meat and neither do they use 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.550
 toxic pigs do not eat anything with 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.250
 condoms neither with dyes nor with 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.280
 nothing that is chemical so a pig 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.919
 has pure white white fat 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.139
 white is clean the fat of a 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.310
 human being is yellow means that 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.800
 has toxic 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.190
 in autopsies that are done for example to 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.610
 indigenous bodies find a 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.770
 well white fat not a yellow grease 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.150
 to like ours then demonstrating 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.360
 that 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.010
 in fact there are forensic doctors and right now 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.870
 I'm going to cellulitis there, forensic doctor 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.760
 which are the ones that do autopsy that I've 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.430
 found when he does an autopsy 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.900
 a corpse of a person obviously 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.010
 dead find in the fat and 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.610
 toxic substances that person 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.080
 used 20 years ago then the theory 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.480
 that there is everything behind all this 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.850
 perhaps a total logic is that when 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.400
 between a toxic body to the body 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.310
 try to get it out through the 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.400
 breathing through urine to 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.670
 through excreted through 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.380
 mucosa but if it fails to remove it as the 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.110
 body you have to protect the next 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.060
 strategy that the body has left is 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:25.700
 cover it in grease because when covering it in 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.790
 fats it waterproofs and when not 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.310
 waterproofs are protected from that is 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.860
 Many people are obese or have 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.780
 cellulite simple and simply because 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.970
 your body has too toxic already is 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.720
 Too toxic the body is in shape 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.340
 compulsive creating fat 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.100
 to cover the toxins so you do not 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.220
 hurt is the same thing that happens with the 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.220
 cholesterol there is theory and there is certain 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.690
 logical analytical proof that the 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.600
 cholesterol is nothing more than a 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.640
 effort of the body to fight the 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.410
 toxic substances in the body, that is, 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.490
 your body is also toxic the body 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.920
 does cholesterol because that 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.930
 waterproofs cells and protects them 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:09.160
 of toxic but returning to cellulite 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:12.370
 cellulite with a woman's weight loss 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.920
 disappears and especially when losing weight 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.270
 eating correctly for your kind of 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.280
 nervous system that is a system 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.560
 passive nervous is a diet more 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.870
 carnivorous with vegetables and salads if 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.340
 is an excited nervous system is a 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.830
 low fat salt diet 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.440
 and low in refined carbohydrates and if 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:35.820
 does that when it starts to thin the 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.620
 body breaks that fat that has underneath 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.060
 of the skin that calls it cellulite 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.820
 us for example in the clinics 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.260
 natural link where we always have 800 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.560
 1,200 people losing weight 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.900
 weekly but nothing else report 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.180
 look not only lose weight I was 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.430
 cellulite that is when the body 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.110
 start detoxifying to break grace 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.360
 throw it out basically 

00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:02.000
 get out the poisons and this is what 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.000
 I comment because the truth always triumphs
