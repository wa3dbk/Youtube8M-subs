 Alice on o2 customers today I would like to introduce a product of the company March 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.309

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.649
 the 79th 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.929
 David Wolf banks are lying 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.899
 you can not unpack 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:17.900
 what's the idea for the 46 d 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.419
 probably were fed 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.699
 even my billion mark was already the judge to meet Kramer 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.399
 the families here 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.649
 small pullback handy 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.750
 Thomas Beatie of 155 objectively 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.980

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.010
 Carsten Bender 46 de unwrapped has been expanded to brunch 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.600

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.410
 With which one can no longer lead we have the main entrance up here 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.100
 At the same time give a happy ending for the lens almost off 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.440
 60 attached 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.830
 the commitment 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.510
 the lights are late 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.720
 and a huge LCD display on Demandwares self-wearing glasses 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.840
 Priority can be read 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.300
 but otherwise there is a lot of buttons but actually at all 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.700
 none 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.990
 Leaves questions open 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.800
 the operation is an accident is a lot of fun Winslow everything logically 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.020
 built the years 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020
 she has a very nice release 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.210
 and percent autofocus is very quiet and accurate 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.210
 Visitors can target various points reached there 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.340
 different points and thus came tangibly close 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.950
 The director also had to be sure and Hans Isler 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.940

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.880
 For 46 seconds he was just a spectator 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.159
 only 4 on the occasion 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.809
