00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and goes the whole length too right here

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.870 
and goes the whole length too right here
if<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.319> get<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.530> with<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:35.799> one<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.280> then<00:02:36.700> so

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
that's this one this is the one that I

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.320 
that's this one this is the one that I
carry<00:02:44.560> more<00:02:44.739> often<00:02:45.160> it's<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.880> little<00:02:46.180> bit

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
carry more often it's a little bit

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.839 
carry more often it's a little bit
smaller<00:02:46.630> like<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.410> said<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.250> blade<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.640> three

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
smaller like I said the blade is three

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.490 
smaller like I said the blade is three
and<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> half<00:02:49.150> inches<00:02:49.569> compared<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> wrap

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and a half inches compared to the wrap

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.569 
and a half inches compared to the wrap
one<00:02:50.739> I'm<00:02:50.890> gonna<00:02:51.010> start<00:02:51.130> talking<00:02:51.370> about<00:02:51.459> the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
one I'm gonna start talking about the

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.600 
one I'm gonna start talking about the
rat<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:51.940> here<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.690> rat<00:02:52.870> ones<00:02:53.940> blade<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.269> 3<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
rat one here the rat ones blade is 3 and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.300 
rat one here the rat ones blade is 3 and
7/8<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.810> under<00:02:59.410> 4<00:02:59.709> inches<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.220> it's

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
7/8 so it's just under 4 inches so it's

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.800 
7/8 so it's just under 4 inches so it's
a<00:03:00.370> little<00:03:00.610> bit<00:03:01.410> longer<00:03:02.410> I<00:03:02.530> mean<00:03:02.680> not<00:03:02.799> much<00:03:02.980> but

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
you can kind of see the difference there

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.880 
you can kind of see the difference there
it's<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:08.049> a<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.500> bit<00:03:08.709> longer<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:10.860> well<00:03:11.860> I

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
that you till attack does way a little

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.980 
that you till attack does way a little
bit<00:04:53.240> more<00:04:53.599> it<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:54.889> shorter<00:04:55.490> than<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.479> rat<00:04:56.690> one

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
bit more it is shorter than the rat one

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.740 
bit more it is shorter than the rat one
um<00:04:57.500> in<00:04:57.919> length<00:04:58.250> but<00:04:58.909> it<00:04:59.030> is<00:04:59.180> fatter<00:04:59.449> you<00:04:59.629> can

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
um in length but it is fatter you can

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.339 
um in length but it is fatter you can
obviously<00:04:59.960> this<00:05:00.199> one<00:05:00.409> is<00:05:00.440> thin<00:05:01.190> profile<00:05:01.969> here

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
obviously this one is thin profile here

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.899 
obviously this one is thin profile here
whereas<00:05:03.349> this<00:05:03.469> one's<00:05:03.710> really<00:05:04.159> kind<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.699> fat

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
whereas this one's really kind of fat

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.270 
whereas this one's really kind of fat
and<00:05:05.030> pudgy<00:05:05.440> so<00:05:06.440> it<00:05:06.530> just<00:05:06.680> kind<00:05:06.800> of<00:05:06.830> depends<00:05:07.129> on

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
and pudgy so it just kind of depends on

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.089 
and pudgy so it just kind of depends on
which<00:05:07.400> one<00:05:07.610> you<00:05:08.360> want<00:05:08.569> this<00:05:09.500> one<00:05:09.710> also<00:05:09.860> comes
