point a point all right so I guess that
although<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.530> at<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.830> end<00:04:55.950> point<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.310> hot

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
although it at the end point is a hot

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:01.249 
although it at the end point is a hot
that's<00:04:58.679> it<00:04:58.799> right<00:04:58.949> this'll<00:04:59.429> go<00:05:00.360> inside<00:05:01.169> this

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
that's it right this'll go inside this

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.279 
that's it right this'll go inside this
box<00:05:01.439> and<00:05:01.799> this<00:05:02.309> was<00:05:02.549> a<00:05:02.789> unboxing<00:05:03.269> video<00:05:03.689> of<00:05:03.839> the
