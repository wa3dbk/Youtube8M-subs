 he went to see the tire marks 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.590
 and could not distinguish what to take or not 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.690

 we saw that the tires are already measured 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.440

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.490
 Unfortunately, this is the way 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.729
 there are many people who say 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.330

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.750

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:02.090
 I want to tell the public 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.090

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.910

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.370
 ask conan if he does not bring glue 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.670
 in the denture if you do not bring glue in 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.670
 the denture 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.070
 glue I'm almost a newborn baby 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.650

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.410
 I feel like I have kryptonite as 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.410
 the fantastic four like movidito 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.140
 hey it will not be for the diapers you wear by 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.140
 the incontinence 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.620

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.620
 moment with both see back 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.220
 I would like that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.790
 that the driver left if they do not leave 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.829
 but saleh can crash the truck 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.920

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:04.810
 we will see it again 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.650

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.650

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.080

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.909
 that you pay for it, you're asking 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:42.780

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:42.780

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.569
