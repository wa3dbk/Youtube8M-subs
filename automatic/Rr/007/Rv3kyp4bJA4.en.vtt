00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.959 
first thing I noticed with the roof
they<00:00:32.489> used<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:34.040> metal<00:00:35.040> material<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
they used a metal material for the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.690 
they used a metal material for the
roofing<00:00:36.360> surface<00:00:36.809> itself<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.670> see

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
roofing surface itself and you can see

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.810 
roofing surface itself and you can see
there<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.560> pretty<00:00:40.560> big<00:00:40.680> overhang<00:00:41.220> in<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
there is a pretty big overhang in this

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.440 
there is a pretty big overhang in this
area<00:00:42.240> and<00:00:43.040> when<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.130> come<00:00:44.310> over<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
opposing wall it's wide open so you know

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.550

installed correctly the other thing I
noticed<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.040> rafters<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.810> try<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079

to the joist you can see that there's a

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.139 
to the joist you can see that there's a
pretty<00:01:08.909> pretty<00:01:09.390> decent<00:01:09.810> gap<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:12.030> know

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
pretty pretty decent gap there you know

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.730 
pretty pretty decent gap there you know

that that hanger supposed to be up tight

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.999 
that that hanger supposed to be up tight
against<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:15.539> know<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.719> rafter<00:01:16.200> in

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
against the you know the rafter in

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.889 
against the you know the rafter in
addition<00:01:17.429> it's<00:01:17.579> a<00:01:17.700> 2<00:01:17.850> by<00:01:17.999> 4<00:01:18.030> construction

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
addition it's a 2 by 4 construction

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.319 
addition it's a 2 by 4 construction
which<00:01:19.109> is<00:01:19.139> not<00:01:19.499> correct<00:01:19.969> should<00:01:20.969> definitely

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
which is not correct should definitely

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.779 
which is not correct should definitely
be<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> thicker<00:01:21.799> would<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.130> typically<00:01:23.490> 2
