milk and add that as well then you just

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
milk and add that as well then you just
stir<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.870> together<00:01:04.080> until<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.920> forms<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.369> pasty

without further ado let's just do this

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.790 
without further ado let's just do this
cuz<00:02:53.970> I<00:02:54.090> can't<00:02:54.330> really<00:02:54.600> talk<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.230> we'll<00:02:55.590> start

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
cuz I can't really talk so we'll start

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:20.679 
cuz I can't really talk so we'll start
with<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> nose

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:23.119 

okay<00:03:21.689> so<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.930> first<00:03:22.140> time<00:03:22.349> didn't<00:03:22.799> really<00:03:23.010> do

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
okay so the first time didn't really do

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.780 
okay so the first time didn't really do
much<00:03:23.159> at<00:03:23.459> all

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
much at all

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.670 
much at all
it<00:03:23.970> definitely<00:03:24.180> exfoliated<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.110> skin<00:03:25.409> you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
know I have dry skin so sometimes it

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.089 
know I have dry skin so sometimes it
tends<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.329> be<00:03:27.510> kind<00:03:27.659> of<00:03:27.810> dry<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.560> flaky<00:03:28.739> and

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
tends to be kind of dry and flaky and

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.170 
tends to be kind of dry and flaky and
this<00:03:29.220> definitely<00:03:29.610> took<00:03:29.700> care<00:03:29.909> of<00:03:29.939> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
this definitely took care of that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.360 
this definitely took care of that

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
first peel the second peel will take the

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.599 
first peel the second peel will take the
blackheads<00:04:03.989> completely<00:04:04.650> out<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.310> let's<00:04:05.489> go

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
blackheads completely out so let's go

mixture<00:05:00.270> itself<00:05:00.600> was<00:05:00.840> just<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.290> horrible<00:05:01.650> that

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160

it was difficult for me to sit through

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.390 
it was difficult for me to sit through
two<00:05:03.630> rounds<00:05:03.960> of<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.139> I<00:05:04.320> can't<00:05:04.860> imagine<00:05:04.949> working

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
two rounds of it I can't imagine working

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.189 
two rounds of it I can't imagine working
this<00:05:05.669> into<00:05:05.970> my<00:05:06.090> beauty<00:05:06.389> regimen<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:07.020> keep

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
this into my beauty regimen to keep

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.900 
this into my beauty regimen to keep
black<00:05:07.410> has<00:05:07.620> at<00:05:07.770> bay<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.190> think<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.550> in<00:05:08.669> future

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
black has at bay I think that in future

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.219

Baylor<00:05:09.240> holy<00:05:09.389> girls<00:05:09.660> we're<00:05:09.810> going<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:10.020> be<00:05:10.080> able

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
Baylor holy girls we're going to be able

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.620 
Baylor holy girls we're going to be able
to<00:05:10.289> find<00:05:10.500> better<00:05:10.740> solutions<00:05:10.860> to<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:12.000> I

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
to find better solutions to this and I

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.120 
to find better solutions to this and I
just<00:05:12.660> think<00:05:13.139> that<00:05:13.289> this<00:05:13.440> one<00:05:13.620> isn't<00:05:13.949> one<00:05:14.100> of

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
just think that this one isn't one of

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.070 
just think that this one isn't one of
them<00:05:14.400> so<00:05:14.940> while<00:05:15.120> you<00:05:15.270> do<00:05:15.419> get<00:05:15.630> these<00:05:15.810> cool

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
them so while you do get these cool

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.500 
them so while you do get these cool
little<00:05:16.139> like<00:05:16.680> DIY<00:05:17.220> strips<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.270> get<00:05:18.419> to

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
little like DIY strips and you get to

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.730 
little like DIY strips and you get to
peel<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.750> off<00:05:18.930> your<00:05:19.110> face<00:05:19.289> and<00:05:19.530> that's<00:05:19.590> the

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
peel it off your face and that's the

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.010 
peel it off your face and that's the
whole<00:05:19.860> experience<00:05:20.280> it<00:05:20.820> didn't<00:05:21.300> remove<00:05:21.660> enough

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
whole experience it didn't remove enough

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.450 
whole experience it didn't remove enough
blackheads<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:22.650> make<00:05:22.800> me<00:05:22.919> feel<00:05:23.130> like<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.400> could

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460
