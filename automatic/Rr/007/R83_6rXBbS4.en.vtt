I<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.340> pops<00:00:35.670> wants<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.969> sell<00:00:36.149> him

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.520 
I don't think pops wants to sell him
he's<00:00:36.450> obviously<00:00:36.480> he<00:00:36.960> started<00:00:37.350> against

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
he's obviously he started against

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.220 
he's obviously he started against
Manchester<00:00:37.920> United<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.520> think<00:00:38.989> he<00:00:39.989> wants<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
Manchester United I think he wants to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
Manchester United I think he wants to
give<00:00:40.320> him<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.500> chance<00:00:40.680> does<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.100> was<00:00:41.399> given<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
give him a chance does he was given a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.130 
give him a chance does he was given a
chance<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.180> he'd<00:00:42.300> been<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.660> good<00:00:42.750> master

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
chance that he'd been really good master

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.240 
chance that he'd been really good master
and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.379> Bella<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.770> lots<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> great

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and then Bella has lots of great

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.410 
and then Bella has lots of great
qualities<00:00:44.670> I've<00:00:44.850> always<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.360> thought

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
qualities I've always kind of thought

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.080 
qualities I've always kind of thought
that<00:00:45.570> he's<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> better<00:00:46.020> player<00:00:46.489> when<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:47.850> he's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
that he's a better player when when he's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
that he's a better player when when he's
on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> front<00:00:48.750> foot<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.110> attacking<00:00:49.410> positions

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
on the front foot in attacking positions

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
on the front foot in attacking positions
rather<00:00:50.129> than<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.910> back<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> midfield

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
rather than at the back of the midfield

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
rather than at the back of the midfield
where<00:00:51.960> he's<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:52.949> his<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
where he's you know his kind of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.840 
where he's you know his kind of
ponderous<00:00:54.289> slower<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.039> side<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> his<00:00:56.610> game

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
ponderous slower the side of his game

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
ponderous slower the side of his game
kind<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> comes<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.870> more<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.260> he<00:00:58.920> was

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
kind of comes out a bit more and he was

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
kind of comes out a bit more and he was
you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.670> he<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.030> instrumental<00:01:00.300> in

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you know I think he was instrumental in

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
you know I think he was instrumental in
the<00:01:01.140> 5<00:01:01.320> 32<00:01:01.590> feet<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> Chelsea<00:01:02.160> last<00:01:02.340> season<00:01:02.670> was

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the 5 32 feet of Chelsea last season was

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
the 5 32 feet of Chelsea last season was
I<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.660> he<00:01:04.229> tends<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> play<00:01:04.769> well<00:01:04.949> against

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
I that he tends to play well against

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550 
I that he tends to play well against
good<00:01:05.400> teams<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.960> he's<00:01:06.960> also<00:01:07.110> he's<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> little

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
good teams and he's also he's a little

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.080 
good teams and he's also he's a little
bit<00:01:07.710> older<00:01:07.979> we've<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.460> lot<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> youth<00:01:08.970> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bit older we've got a lot of youth in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
bit older we've got a lot of youth in
our<00:01:09.180> team<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.540> think<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:09.900> bit<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
our team so I think a little bit of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140 
our team so I think a little bit of
experience<00:01:10.470> particularly<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.700> kind<00:01:12.030> of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
experience particularly with the kind of

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
experience particularly with the kind of
attributes<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.200> he<00:01:13.350> brings<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> game

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
attributes that he brings to the game

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.130 
attributes that he brings to the game
like<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> kind<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.270> measure<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> calm<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like the kind of the measure of calm the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
like the kind of the measure of calm the
measure<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> control<00:01:16.560> would<00:01:17.520> certainly<00:01:17.820> work

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
measure of control would certainly work

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
measure of control would certainly work
well<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> team<00:01:18.720> dynamic<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> don't<00:01:19.680> think

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
well in a team dynamic so I don't think

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
well in a team dynamic so I don't think
pops<00:01:20.009> wants<00:01:20.130> letting<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> think<00:01:21.090> he

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
pops wants letting go I kind of think he

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.880 
pops wants letting go I kind of think he
just<00:01:21.420> needs<00:01:21.659> he<00:01:22.110> needs<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> score<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> couple<00:01:22.740> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
just needs he needs to score a couple of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
just needs he needs to score a couple of
goals<00:01:23.070> yes<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.640> couple<00:01:23.970> absolute<00:01:24.330> he<00:01:25.080> needs<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
goals yes a couple absolute he needs to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.899 
goals yes a couple absolute he needs to
fit<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.920> strikes<00:01:26.159> me<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.340> maybe<00:01:26.549> he<00:01:26.640> needs<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
feel like he's one of the most important

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.230 
feel like he's one of the most important
players<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> team<00:01:29.369> yeah<00:01:29.729> cuz<00:01:29.909> when<00:01:30.060> he<00:01:30.119> was

at Fulham he was like the main man and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.170 
at Fulham he was like the main man and
everything<00:01:32.310> went<00:01:32.460> through<00:01:32.640> him<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.880> he<00:01:33.030> would

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
everything went through him and he would

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.990

this happens a lot with players at
suppose<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.829> where<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.310> come<00:01:38.520> from

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
suppose I think where they come from

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.190 
suppose I think where they come from
being<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.299> main<00:01:39.479> man<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.869> their<00:01:39.960> team<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
being the main man at their team and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.569 
being the main man at their team and
then<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.650> come<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> Spurs<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> there

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
then they come to Spurs and there

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
then they come to Spurs and there
amongst<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.299> other<00:01:42.750> main<00:01:43.020> mens<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.530> now

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
is obviously something that we lack if

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.930 
is obviously something that we lack if
not<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.710> are<00:02:32.740> late<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.130> make<00:02:33.400> if<00:02:33.550> he<00:02:33.610> was<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:33.820> at

not we are late to make if he was off at
18<00:02:34.240> million<00:02:34.450> quid<00:02:34.720> do<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.260> think<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> would<00:02:35.710> be

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
18 million quid do you think it would be

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.590 
18 million quid do you think it would be
a<00:02:35.860> done<00:02:36.070> deal<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.460> think<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.090> kind<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.330> think<00:02:37.420> he'd

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
a done deal I think I kind of think he'd

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.540 
a done deal I think I kind of think he'd
take<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.050> do<00:02:38.190> yeah<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.220> think<00:02:39.340> he<00:02:39.460> probably

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
take it I do yeah I think he probably

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.190 
take it I do yeah I think he probably
right<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.060> think<00:02:40.420> probably<00:02:40.540> right<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.960> mean<00:02:41.080> it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
right I think probably right I mean it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.510 
right I think probably right I mean it
would<00:02:41.320> never<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.650> billion<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.070> top<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.400> what

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
would never be a billion on top of what

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.010 
would never be a billion on top of what
we<00:02:42.640> paid<00:02:42.850> for<00:02:42.880> him<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.540> would<00:02:43.690> never<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.900> as

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
we paid for him it would never be as

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.970 
we paid for him it would never be as
simple<00:02:44.200> as<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.380> with<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:44.800> would<00:02:44.950> be

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
simple as that with it there would be

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.280 
simple as that with it there would be
there<00:02:45.400> would<00:02:45.430> be<00:02:45.580> kind<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.030> other<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.170> we'd

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
there would be kind of other and we'd

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.570 
there would be kind of other and we'd
never<00:02:47.470> find<00:02:47.680> out<00:02:47.920> anyway<00:02:48.070> because<00:02:48.310> now<00:02:48.520> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
never find out anyway because now the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.640 
never find out anyway because now the
undisclosed<00:02:49.270> deals<00:02:49.540> but<00:02:49.720> anyway<00:02:49.990> it's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
undisclosed deals but anyway it's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.770 
undisclosed deals but anyway it's
unlikely<00:02:51.310> i<00:02:51.490> think<00:02:51.760> unlikely<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.450> rumored

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
unlikely i think unlikely the rumored

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.720 
unlikely i think unlikely the rumored
that<00:02:52.810> will<00:02:52.960> keep<00:02:53.050> going<00:02:53.350> but<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.400> say<00:02:54.430> I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
that will keep going but I have to say I

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.310 
that will keep going but I have to say I
agree<00:02:54.820> with<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.270> don't<00:02:55.540> want<00:02:55.720> him<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.870> go<00:02:56.080> I

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
agree with you I don't want him to go I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.410 
agree with you I don't want him to go I
I<00:02:56.590> think<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.250> deserves<00:02:57.490> another<00:02:57.640> chance<00:02:57.760> okay

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
I think it deserves another chance okay

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.140 
I think it deserves another chance okay

I would love to keep him I think he's
you<00:03:30.220> know<00:03:30.250> I've<00:03:30.520> always<00:03:30.700> thought<00:03:30.970> there's<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
you know I've always thought there's a

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.580 
you know I've always thought there's a
lot<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.360> potential<00:03:31.600> there<00:03:31.720> hehe<00:03:32.200> had<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.410> pace

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
lot of potential there hehe had to pace

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.230 
lot of potential there hehe had to pace
the<00:03:32.890> problem<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.250> he<00:03:33.310> just<00:03:33.460> runs<00:03:33.670> into<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> dead

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
the problem is he just runs into a dead

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.320 
the problem is he just runs into a dead
end<00:03:34.270> which<00:03:34.720> is<00:03:34.900> an<00:03:35.730> element<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:36.880> his<00:03:37.030> game<00:03:37.210> he

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
end which is an element of his game he

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.640 
end which is an element of his game he
needs<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.570> improve<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:37.990> I<00:03:38.020> think<00:03:38.230> he<00:03:38.290> has<00:03:38.440> been

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
needs to improve and I think he has been

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.900 
needs to improve and I think he has been
given<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> chance<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.160> improve<00:03:39.490> that<00:03:39.730> and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
given a chance to improve that and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.510 
given a chance to improve that and
hasn't<00:03:40.570> really<00:03:40.960> done<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.920> think<00:03:42.130> pots

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
hasn't really done it so I think pots

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.090 
hasn't really done it so I think pots
would<00:03:42.730> be<00:03:42.880> what<00:03:43.300> would<00:03:43.330> be<00:03:43.840> keen<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.080> see<00:03:44.950> the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
would be what would be keen to see the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.050 
would be what would be keen to see the
back<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.400> him<00:03:45.520> I<00:03:45.640> think<00:03:45.790> there's<00:03:45.940> probably

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
back of him I think there's probably

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.150 
back of him I think there's probably
also<00:03:46.390> an<00:03:46.570> element<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.960> him<00:03:47.170> saying<00:03:47.440> saying

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
also an element of him saying saying

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.320 
also an element of him saying saying
that<00:03:48.340> because<00:03:48.490> he<00:03:48.700> knows<00:03:48.880> that<00:03:49.030> he's<00:03:49.180> not

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
that because he knows that he's not

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.850 
that because he knows that he's not
going<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.540> go<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.810> club's<00:03:50.080> biggest<00:03:50.320> bird<00:03:50.650> so

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
going to go to a club's biggest bird so

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.380 
going to go to a club's biggest bird so
he<00:03:51.040> will<00:03:51.190> end<00:03:51.340> up<00:03:51.430> going<00:03:51.670> further<00:03:51.850> down<00:03:52.000> league

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
he will end up going further down league

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.560 
he will end up going further down league
and<00:03:52.920> he<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:54.820> know<00:03:54.910> he<00:03:55.030> won't<00:03:55.150> get<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.390> playing

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
and he you know he won't get to playing

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.900 
and he you know he won't get to playing
the<00:03:55.630> Europa<00:03:55.990> League<00:03:56.020> probably<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.580> he'll<00:03:57.790> be

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
the Europa League probably and he'll be

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.040 
the Europa League probably and he'll be
kind<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.180> scrapping<00:03:58.540> around<00:03:58.600> mid<00:03:58.870> table

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
kind of scrapping around mid table

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.160 
kind of scrapping around mid table
rather<00:03:59.530> than<00:04:00.060> aiming<00:04:01.060> for<00:04:01.210> top<00:04:01.330> for<00:04:01.540> like<00:04:01.720> we

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
rather than aiming for top for like we

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.720 
rather than aiming for top for like we
are<00:04:02.320> I<00:04:02.440> have<00:04:02.560> to<00:04:02.680> say<00:04:02.860> he's<00:04:03.160> another<00:04:03.400> player

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
are I have to say he's another player

are I have to say he's another player
and<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.210> feel<00:04:04.660> free<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.900> disagree<00:04:05.260> with<00:04:05.440> this

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
and and feel free to disagree with this

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.100 
and and feel free to disagree with this
but<00:04:05.920> what<00:04:06.850> I<00:04:06.880> found<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.360> when<00:04:07.570> he<00:04:07.660> plays<00:04:07.870> for

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
but what I found is when he plays for

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.390 
but what I found is when he plays for
England<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.530> he<00:04:08.620> does<00:04:08.800> do<00:04:09.010> very<00:04:09.220> well<00:04:09.280> for

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
England and he does do very well for

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.000 
England and he does do very well for
England<00:04:09.790> he<00:04:10.240> tends<00:04:10.690> to<00:04:10.750> get<00:04:10.960> on<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.230> ball<00:04:11.440> more

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
England he tends to get on the ball more

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.220 
England he tends to get on the ball more
kind<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.760> central<00:04:13.240> areas<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:13.810> take<00:04:14.080> his

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
kind of in central areas and take his

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.320 
kind of in central areas and take his
shots<00:04:14.470> from<00:04:14.680> there<00:04:14.920> yeah<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.760> actually<00:04:15.850> he's

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
shots from there yeah and actually he's

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.700 
shots from there yeah and actually he's
another<00:04:16.570> one<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.810> suppose<00:04:16.960> I<00:04:17.230> think<00:04:17.440> we've<00:04:17.530> got

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:17.710 
another one I suppose I think we've got

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.160 
another one I suppose I think we've got
where<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:17.859> kind<00:04:18.100> of<00:04:18.160> think<00:04:18.340> maybe<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.600> mean<00:04:20.080> this

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
where I kind of think maybe I mean this

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.080 
where I kind of think maybe I mean this
is<00:04:20.230> redic<00:04:20.560> this<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.190> from<00:04:21.340> years<00:04:21.549> ago<00:04:21.609> but<00:04:21.940> back

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
is redic this is from years ago but back

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.460 
is redic this is from years ago but back
in<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.300> day<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.480> think<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:22.810> Martin<00:04:23.140> y'all<00:04:23.320> was

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
in the day I think when Martin y'all was

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.710 
in the day I think when Martin y'all was
manager<00:04:23.890> we<00:04:24.250> played<00:04:24.460> an<00:04:24.550> FA<00:04:24.790> cup<00:04:25.000> tie<00:04:25.030> up<00:04:25.300> tie

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
manager we played an FA cup tie up tie

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.270 
manager we played an FA cup tie up tie
stamford<00:04:26.230> bridge<00:04:26.260> when<00:04:26.590> Joe's<00:04:26.770> omarina<00:04:27.070> was

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
stamford bridge when Joe's omarina was

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.740 
stamford bridge when Joe's omarina was
rendered<00:04:27.520> them<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:27.850> we<00:04:28.060> played<00:04:28.420> brilliantly

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
rendered them and we played brilliantly

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.840 
rendered them and we played brilliantly
Lennon<00:04:29.200> was<00:04:29.380> put<00:04:29.590> just<00:04:29.980> behind<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.430> front<00:04:30.460> man

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
Lennon was put just behind the front man

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.700 
Lennon was put just behind the front man
now<00:04:31.450> everyone's<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.260> oh<00:04:32.290> he<00:04:32.440> can't<00:04:32.620> play

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
now everyone's like oh he can't play

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.990 
now everyone's like oh he can't play
there<00:04:32.950> because<00:04:33.100> it's<00:04:33.250> it's<00:04:33.490> not<00:04:33.670> using<00:04:33.910> his

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
there because it's it's not using his

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.370 
there because it's it's not using his
pace<00:04:34.180> but<00:04:34.330> he<00:04:34.420> was<00:04:34.540> brilliant<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.080> kind<00:04:35.350> of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
pace but he was brilliant and I kind of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.260 
pace but he was brilliant and I kind of
think<00:04:35.500> Townsend<00:04:36.070> maybe<00:04:36.550> should<00:04:36.820> be<00:04:36.940> given<00:04:37.210> a

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
think Townsend maybe should be given a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.580 
think Townsend maybe should be given a
little<00:04:37.420> chance<00:04:37.750> behind<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.260> front<00:04:38.410> man

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
little chance behind the front man

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.590 
little chance behind the front man
because<00:04:38.800> then<00:04:38.890> he<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.040> go<00:04:39.190> left<00:04:39.460> or<00:04:39.610> right<00:04:39.670> you

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
because then he can go left or right you

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.760 
because then he can go left or right you
know<00:04:40.720> and<00:04:40.930> it's<00:04:41.020> not<00:04:41.170> just<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.380> matter<00:04:41.530> of<00:04:41.590> him

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
know and it's not just a matter of him

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.590 
know and it's not just a matter of him
like<00:04:42.010> just<00:04:42.280> going<00:04:42.520> exactly<00:04:42.910> like<00:04:43.150> in<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.390> L

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
like just going exactly like in that L

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.180 
like just going exactly like in that L
show<00:04:43.870> well<00:04:44.050> that's<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.350> problem<00:04:44.590> is<00:04:44.740> i<00:04:45.040> mean

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
show well that's the problem is i mean

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.650 
show well that's the problem is i mean
yet<00:04:45.490> he's<00:04:45.730> always<00:04:45.910> trying<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.300> come<00:04:46.450> into<00:04:46.570> the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
yet he's always trying to come into the

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.780 
yet he's always trying to come into the
middle<00:04:46.900> isn't<00:04:46.990> he<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:47.740> makes<00:04:47.920> may<00:04:48.610> seem

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
middle isn't he and so it makes may seem

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.460 
middle isn't he and so it makes may seem
very<00:04:48.940> predictable<00:04:49.390> for<00:04:49.630> for<00:04:49.960> opposition's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
very predictable for for opposition's

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.630 
very predictable for for opposition's
and<00:04:50.650> then<00:04:50.740> when<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:50.980> does<00:04:51.100> when<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.490> does<00:04:51.610> go

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
and then when it does when it does go

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.160 
and then when it does when it does go
why<00:04:51.910> he<00:04:52.180> doesn't<00:04:52.450> tend<00:04:52.540> to<00:04:52.660> get<00:04:52.750> when<00:04:53.020> you're

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
why he doesn't tend to get when you're

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.360 
why he doesn't tend to get when you're
going<00:04:53.320> said<00:04:53.560> when<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.800> come<00:04:54.010> back<00:04:54.130> to<00:04:54.280> the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
going said when you come back to the

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.860 
going said when you come back to the
middle<00:04:54.610> from<00:04:54.820> one<00:04:55.030> side<00:04:55.300> there's<00:04:55.600> really<00:04:55.750> only

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
middle from one side there's really only

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.540 
middle from one side there's really only
one<00:04:56.080> way<00:04:56.230> you<00:04:56.440> can<00:04:56.680> go<00:04:56.860> where<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.280> if<00:04:57.400> you're

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
one way you can go where is if you're

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.740 
one way you can go where is if you're
picking<00:04:57.880> up<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.060> ball<00:04:58.180> in<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.390> middle<00:04:58.510> and

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
picking up the ball in the middle and

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.150 
picking up the ball in the middle and
then<00:04:58.990> you're<00:04:59.170> fronting<00:04:59.500> up<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.710> defender<00:05:00.130> I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
then you're fronting up a defender I

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
then you're fronting up a defender I
feel<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:00.490> he<00:05:00.610> can<00:05:00.700> take<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:00.910> right<00:05:01.120> off

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
feel like he can take it right off

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.730 
feel like he can take it right off
because<00:05:01.510> he's<00:05:01.600> got<00:05:01.720> equally<00:05:02.080> good<00:05:02.200> yeah<00:05:02.350> yeah

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
because he's got equally good yeah yeah

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.280 
because he's got equally good yeah yeah
yeah<00:05:02.950> yeah<00:05:03.100> that's<00:05:03.460> true<00:05:03.610> that's<00:05:03.940> true

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
yeah yeah that's true that's true

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.240 
yeah yeah that's true that's true
anything<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.380> think<00:05:05.650> he<00:05:05.740> will<00:05:05.890> get<00:05:06.070> that<00:05:06.190> chance

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
anything I think he will get that chance

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.360 
anything I think he will get that chance
no<00:05:06.730> you're<00:05:07.300> gonna<00:05:07.390> you're<00:05:07.810> gonna<00:05:07.900> replace<00:05:08.890> to

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
no you're gonna you're gonna replace to

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.040 
no you're gonna you're gonna replace to
put<00:05:09.820> him<00:05:09.910> in<00:05:10.030> there<00:05:10.180> I<00:05:10.330> mean<00:05:10.510> he<00:05:10.690> might<00:05:10.840> get<00:05:10.990> a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
put him in there I mean he might get a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.140 
put him in there I mean he might get a
run<00:05:11.230> out<00:05:11.350> there<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:12.040> the<00:05:12.520> Europa<00:05:12.850> League<00:05:12.880> I

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
run out there in the Europa League I

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.300 
run out there in the Europa League I
suppose<00:05:13.480> but<00:05:13.840> he's<00:05:14.320> unlikely<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.770> be<00:05:14.860> starting

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
suppose but he's unlikely to be starting

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.770 
suppose but he's unlikely to be starting
there<00:05:15.460> with<00:05:15.580> any<00:05:15.700> regularity<00:05:16.060> I<00:05:16.450> would've

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
there with any regularity I would've

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.330 
there with any regularity I would've
thought<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.169> he<00:05:17.680> wants<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.950> stay<00:05:18.130> but<00:05:18.310> you

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
thought so he wants to stay but you

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.770 
thought so he wants to stay but you
think<00:05:18.580> there's<00:05:18.730> a<00:05:18.790> chance<00:05:18.820> before<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.390> window

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
think there's a chance before the window

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.310 
think there's a chance before the window
closes<00:05:20.320> that<00:05:20.560> he<00:05:20.710> might<00:05:20.919> be<00:05:21.570> yeah<00:05:22.570> what<00:05:22.990> I<00:05:23.020> mean

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
closes that he might be yeah what I mean

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.600 
closes that he might be yeah what I mean
there<00:05:23.500> has<00:05:23.650> been<00:05:23.800> speculation<00:05:23.919> about<00:05:24.490> him

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
there has been speculation about him

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.610 
there has been speculation about him
going<00:05:24.790> fairly<00:05:25.720> consistently<00:05:26.260> for<00:05:26.440> a<00:05:26.470> while

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
going fairly consistently for a while

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.800 
going fairly consistently for a while
now<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:27.070> that's<00:05:27.700> really<00:05:27.820> it<00:05:28.090> tends<00:05:28.480> to<00:05:28.540> come

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
now so that's really it tends to come

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.659 
now so that's really it tends to come
and<00:05:28.960> go<00:05:29.080> it<00:05:29.620> would<00:05:29.740> make<00:05:29.860> sense<00:05:29.919> missed<00:05:30.460> him

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
and go it would make sense missed him

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:33.600 
and go it would make sense missed him
yeah<00:05:31.060> yeah<00:05:31.780> go<00:05:32.169> out<00:05:32.410> and<00:05:32.500> run<00:05:32.560> around<00:05:32.620> a<00:05:32.890> bit<00:05:33.040> so

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
yeah yeah go out and run around a bit so

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.130 
yeah yeah go out and run around a bit so
maybe<00:05:33.640> tom<00:05:34.300> around<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.690> shoulder

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
maybe tom around the shoulder

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.840 
maybe tom around the shoulder
potentially<00:05:35.650> townsend<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:36.250> added<00:05:36.520> by<00:05:36.640> or<00:05:36.820> i

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
potentially townsend and added by or i

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.880 
potentially townsend and added by or i
would<00:05:37.150> think<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.690> Villard<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.530> one<00:05:38.710> yeah

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
would think to Villard that one yeah

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.070 
would think to Villard that one yeah
yeah<00:05:39.880> he<00:05:40.060> added<00:05:40.300> by<00:05:40.330> all<00:05:40.600> one<00:05:40.720> it's<00:05:40.870> been<00:05:40.960> going

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
yeah he added by all one it's been going

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.230 
yeah he added by all one it's been going
