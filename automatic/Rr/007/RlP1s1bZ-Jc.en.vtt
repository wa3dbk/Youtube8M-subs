00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
bottom very simple and I did the same

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.790 
bottom very simple and I did the same
thing<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.200> did<00:02:13.319> from<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.530> top

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
thing as I did from the top

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:30.730 
thing as I did from the top
to<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> bottom<00:02:14.640> making<00:02:15.450> an<00:02:15.570> outline

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.250 

now<00:02:31.340> it's<00:02:31.550> time<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.970> do<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.330> which<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.020> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
one as you will see the little bar will

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.410 
one as you will see the little bar will
slant<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.230> meet<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.920> thicker<00:02:52.190> right<00:02:52.790> bar<00:02:53.150> of

the a you see me right now messing

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.200 
the a you see me right now messing
around<00:02:55.820> with<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.210> sea<00:02:56.710> trying<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:58.160> find<00:02:59.030> the

around with the sea trying to find the
right<00:02:59.240> angle<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:01.540> now<00:03:02.540> it's<00:03:02.720> time<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.260> the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
right angle so now it's time to do the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.880 
right angle so now it's time to do the
bottom<00:03:04.280> part<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.930> outlining<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.860> i

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
bottom part of the a outlining it so i

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.250 
bottom part of the a outlining it so i
gotta<00:03:07.160> i<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.730> copied<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.300> put<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.960> next

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
gotta i just copied it put in the next

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
gotta i just copied it put in the next
layer<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:10.090> just<00:03:11.090> made<00:03:11.240> a<00:03:11.270> bigger<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:11.840> know

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
layer and just made a bigger you know

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.230 
layer and just made a bigger you know
just<00:03:12.200> like<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.410> same<00:03:12.880> processes<00:03:13.880> that<00:03:13.940> i<00:03:14.030> did

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
just like the same processes that i did

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.910 
just like the same processes that i did
with<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.450> other<00:03:14.570> ones<00:03:14.870> same<00:03:15.470> with<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.680> little

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
with the other ones same with the little

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.940 
with the other ones same with the little
one<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:16.330> made<00:03:17.330> it<00:03:17.450> blue<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.410> now<00:03:18.560> i<00:03:18.590> hear<00:03:18.800> it

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
one and made it blue so now i hear it

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.980 
one and made it blue so now i hear it
was<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.400> hard<00:03:19.610> part<00:03:19.670> trying<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.660> make<00:03:20.750> that

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
was the hard part trying to make that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:27.460 
was the hard part trying to make that
triangle<00:03:21.560> part<00:03:21.980> at<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.100> top<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:27.110> you<00:03:27.140> can<00:03:27.230> see

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
triangle part at the top so you can see

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.760 
triangle part at the top so you can see
that<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> is<00:03:27.830> coming<00:03:28.490> out<00:03:28.610> long<00:03:29.380> but<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.620> bit

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
that a is coming out long but it's a bit

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.380 
that a is coming out long but it's a bit
of<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.950> triangle<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:31.850> have<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.030> mess<00:03:32.240> with

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
of a triangle so we have to mess with

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.510 
of a triangle so we have to mess with
the<00:03:32.480> triangle<00:03:33.020> either<00:03:33.230> like<00:03:33.410> click<00:03:33.950> are<00:03:34.100> three

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
the triangle either like click are three

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.270 
the triangle either like click are three
and<00:03:35.320> make<00:03:36.320> it<00:03:36.440> trying<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.680> make<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:36.980> i<00:03:37.070> try<00:03:37.220> to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
and make it trying to make it i try to

00:03:37.280 --> 00:04:25.250 
and make it trying to make it i try to
make<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.400> kind<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:37.970> like<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.210> right<00:03:38.450> angle

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.330 

so<00:04:25.890> once<00:04:26.070> i<00:04:26.160> was<00:04:26.340> about<00:04:27.770> content<00:04:28.770> with<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
so once i was about content with the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.730 
so once i was about content with the
triangle<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:30.090> just<00:04:30.900> grabbed<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.320> thicker<00:04:31.560> part

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
triangle I just grabbed the thicker part

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.240 
triangle I just grabbed the thicker part
the<00:04:32.610> thicker<00:04:32.820> rectangle<00:04:33.710> copying<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.800> made<00:04:35.070> it

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
the thicker rectangle copying it made it

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.850 
the thicker rectangle copying it made it
longer<00:04:35.670> made<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.300> go<00:04:36.360> all<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.570> way<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:36.810> top

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
longer made it go all the way to the top

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.370 
longer made it go all the way to the top
slid<00:04:37.860> out<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.070> little<00:04:38.310> bit<00:04:38.550> for<00:04:38.850> the<00:04:38.910> outline

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
slid out a little bit for the outline

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.430 
slid out a little bit for the outline
making<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.500> light<00:04:40.740> blue<00:04:42.080> did<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.200> same<00:04:43.410> thing

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
making it light blue did the same thing

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
making it light blue did the same thing
with<00:04:43.920> the<00:04:43.950> thinner<00:04:44.880> part<00:04:45.810> eh<00:04:45.930> eh<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:53.190> now<00:04:53.310> it

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
with the thinner part eh eh so now it

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.750 
with the thinner part eh eh so now it
was<00:04:53.580> time<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:55.050> make<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.590> L<00:04:55.830> connect<00:04:56.520> with<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
was time to make the L connect with the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.050 
was time to make the L connect with the
a<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:57.660> bottom<00:04:57.930> part<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.200> L<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.850> was<00:05:00.000> very

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
a the bottom part of the L it was very

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.370 
a the bottom part of the L it was very
easy<00:05:00.330> just<00:05:00.570> make<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.200> very<00:05:01.500> thin<00:05:01.920> rectangle<00:05:02.820> and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
easy just make a very thin rectangle and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.010 
easy just make a very thin rectangle and
just<00:05:04.380> make<00:05:04.710> them<00:05:04.890> connect<00:05:05.540> so<00:05:06.540> now<00:05:06.660> you<00:05:06.720> see<00:05:06.900> me

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
just make them connect so now you see me

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.900 
just make them connect so now you see me
trying<00:05:07.200> to<00:05:07.260> put<00:05:07.410> a<00:05:07.440> white<00:05:07.680> triangle<00:05:08.430> inside

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
trying to put a white triangle inside

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.990 
trying to put a white triangle inside
the<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.150> as<00:05:09.540> if<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:09.930> see<00:05:10.200> in<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.550> Los<00:05:11.550> Angeles

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
the a as if you see in the Los Angeles

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.690 
the a as if you see in the Los Angeles
Clippers<00:05:12.420> logo<00:05:12.960> there's<00:05:13.290> a<00:05:13.350> triangle<00:05:14.070> figure

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
Clippers logo there's a triangle figure

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.080 
Clippers logo there's a triangle figure
inside<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.200> then<00:05:16.350> I<00:05:16.440> just<00:05:16.620> decided<00:05:17.280> not<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:17.970> go

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
inside so then I just decided not to go

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.030 
inside so then I just decided not to go
with<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.270> route<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:18.900> continue<00:05:19.530> trying<00:05:19.920> to

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
with that route and continue trying to
