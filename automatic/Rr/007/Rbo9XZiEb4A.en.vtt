00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.910
 welcome to my little one 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.809
 oase in this video is about the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.809
 flowers fit 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.470
 flowers fits is a candy mass 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.570
 after processing completely 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490
 Cured flowers fits that very much 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.010
 elastic is ideal too 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.250
 modeling flowers and filigree 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.250
 ornamentation 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.309
 fitted behind is suitable for her 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.930
 elasticity to complain of gossamer 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.719
 petals scroll and filigree 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.210
 to model items by figures 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.180
 should probably have been used 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.149
 Their water consists of 50 percent of flowers 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.860
 pastor and 50 percent from where the 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.140
 Mass does not dry so fast so that 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.149
 longer can be shaped and polished 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 Nevertheless, the figures dry after one 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.700
 time as only mass flowers pastor contains 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.869
 and to cover pies should be from 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.929
 used there 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.210
 there are also videos from Dor and 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.679
 give modeling clay and I will too 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.170
 every now and then the further processing 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.940
 of flowers and their size and fit 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.550
 Lost with movie so you have one 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.560
 to get an insight how I can barrel 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.280
 cover sugar flowers and make 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.280
 figures modeled 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.390
 I show you now how flowers fit 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.799
 Manufacturer of this recipe has joined 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.560
 Proven to me and I already have it 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.530
 beautiful sugar flowers made for the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.439
 flowers fit here needed 200 grams 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.539
 defeated powdered sugar about 40 grams 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:58.909
 protein that's a crack of one 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:01.939
 big 1 7 gram cmc that's whether you're with 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.460
 you loose ten and have the number 466 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:09.769
 this causes the flowers to fit 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.470
 A pinch of salt and coconut fat is added 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.670
 grease the hand and I use that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.590
 per - often for the production of flowers 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.900
 I first fit the protein 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.000
 Mix with the pinch of salt and love 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.959
 then tablespoon wise two-thirds of the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.959
 add icing sugar 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.840
 The mass should now look like that 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.030
 spikes arise and now I still leave 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.030
 at the highest level the 10c Stir 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.730
 already you can see that through 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:02.640
 the cnc the mass got really tough 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.920
 is the remaining icing sugar I have 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.810
 now distributed on the work surface and 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.019
 on it the flowers fit given 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.030
 I scratched out of the bowl 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.599
 and now I would have my hands with the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.209
 panini soft so that the middle fit 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.159
 right away does not stick a finger and 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.420
 Knead the remaining powdered sugar now 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.420
 still under the flowers costs 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.020
 The flowers should fit nicely now 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.810
 feels supple and no longer on 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:04.790
 stick the finger and I share that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.790
 After all, flowers fit four parts 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.480
 I then shape the balls 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:24.500
 and funny in buildings or plastic bags 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.500
 packed up 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.139
 and the bags and then I always pack 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.139
 still in a plastic box 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:49.479
 and the work surface is doing well now 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:52.990
 clean same a raw egg dared 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.400
 I have processed the flowers fit 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.349
 Now for a day in the fridge 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.379
 and then it can be processed further 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.379
 become 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.950
 the use of flowers would fit 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.660
 I always with film to 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.850
 For example , there will be a video soon 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.560
 Modeling sugar giving flowers 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.810
 to become white with 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.180
 food coloring that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.850
 Coloring of flowers fit analogy 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.710
 to the coloring of there in the spoiled 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.790
 Here I show you exactly which paper 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.920
 should use 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.920
 and I can become with it 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.780
 who fits the flowers so well sealed 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.300
 kept in the refrigerator keeps them 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.060
 Get ready for at least half a year 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.860
 modeled and already dried flowers 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.380
 and figures actually keep one another 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.900
 eternity if you do for example in 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.900
 opened to a cardboard light protected 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.150
 that my videos have to look paste 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.010

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.150
 you can order quiet scenes and 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.950
 the links to the videos from don blum 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.870
 Model and wants to hear her mass 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.790
