00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello everyone you test lab 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.299
 Oldi computer and Vladimir Smirnov 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 it so happened that for the third consecutive 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.809
 testing comes to us a smartphone 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.349
 designed for the installation of two at once 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.650
 sim cards 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 At first it was philips xenium w732 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.330
 and then htc desire sv and today 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.500
 we are visiting smartphone iconbit nettab 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.270
 mercury x 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 and taking this opportunity we will spend not 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.980
 only testing but also small 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.430
 comparison with two previous devices 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.710
 delivery set 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.929
 smartphone itself is a wired stereo headset 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.410
 second battery 1 already inserted 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.730
 smartphone power supply with usb output 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.250
 Micro USB cable for charging and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 sync brief management 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.390
 user in multiple languages ​​in volume 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.020
 including Russian and protective film which 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.239
 Optionally, you can stick on the screen 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.579
 the appearance behind it is a panel of this cover from 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.280
 very thin plastic hidden under it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 place to install sd card and 2 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.489
 full-size sim cards and of course 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.620
 batteries on the back 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.290
 built-in speaker hole 8 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.129
 megapixel cameras with flash 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.260
 I wonder what's over the camera 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.900
 written full hd although you really 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.390
 shoots video only 720p format on 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.340
 the upper end is a hole for 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.380
 headphone and headset and power button 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 blocking off that lightly 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.990
 backlash on the right side is 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.310
 dual volume button 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.220
 bottom is the hole built 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.759
 microphone on the left side we see 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.490
 hole micro usb 20 front panel 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.290
 here is another speech speaker 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.150
 1280 by 720 pixels 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.729
 which gives a total density of 326 pixels 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.390
 will find three sensory located below 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.570
 back home buttons and menu what's interesting 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 not the buttons themselves but the light bulbs 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.369
 below them is another important feature 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.920
 the screen is covered with glass so that the finger 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.360
 he slips with difficulty 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 behind the non-rubber surface it 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.180
 it slides easier 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.360
 dimensions of smartphones 129 for 68 on the whole 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.510
 only 8 and 6 millimeters and small weight 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.890

 RAM 1 gigabyte internal 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.490
 memory has a capacity of 4 gigabytes of 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.060
 which the user is available 2 and 1 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.310

 milliampere hours 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.840
 I will remind them in a set of two pieces 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.310
 operating system android 4 0 4 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.989
 despite the fact that the resolution of the matrix in 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:53.090
 mercury highest compare 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.630
 nevertheless it is worth moving to 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.260
 testing 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.550
 to start quadrant standart but for now 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.620
 test will tell you about the test results 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.820
 battery life for this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.630
 test we turned off all wireless 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.070
 interfaces 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.989
 set the screen brightness to medium 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.790
 position and launched a movie in such 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.220
 Smartphone mode on one battery 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.050
 lasted five and a half hours 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.670
 not bad you need to consider that as in the case 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.140
 with philips phone built-in player 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.489
 pretty strong slow down and 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.239
 I had to install the application from 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.769
 third-party test completed 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.160
 and he put the system 2470 points 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.130
 next performance test 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.579
 systems antutu benchmark set 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.470

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.180
 video subsystem performance not on 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.370
 mark 2 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.590
 in this test, the system yielded an average of 17 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.959
 two frames per second 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.900
 multi - touch test device understands 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.970
 at the same time 5 touches and finally 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.739
 test camera photos were filmed for anything 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.690
 three smartphones from one point at 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.640
 maximum photo quality settings in 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.090
 good and low light conditions 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.790
 and here is an example of simultaneous video shooting 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.650
 in the original 720p resolution you can 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.630
 download the link given in the description to 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.220
 this clip 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.500
 summarize the results of the three units and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.880
 iconbit nettab mercury x cheapest 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.590
 it has the best technical 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.450
 characteristics and very decent 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.900
 performance as well as the thinnest 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.790
 body 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.070
 but here's the build quality leader and his 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.109
 It can no longer be called to decide what is more important 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.109
 of course goodbye to the buyer
