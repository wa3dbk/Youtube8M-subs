00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.440
 more 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.440
 to be next to Merkel 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:12.569
 Velpke 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:17.310
 Wilhelm with the title 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.159
 l 

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:20.189
 Munich ddp 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 Take third with hook 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.990
 Calabro 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 HM the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.090
 the demolition master the credit rating and I say of today 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.239
 when he is on the open door 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 Kilic guest will be different for us and the 72er 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.139
 then you see a bit of your guns iris is 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:52.819
 Storr as the name suggests what that means so the market is around 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.190
 badly crashed and obviously well 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.630
 Percent know where you mean the guitars are often percent 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.559
 yes, that's when I'm around 20 such 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.460
 who will not continue the ceiling of the 2010 Kassel? 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.810
 There is also this consideration of the Heavy over the Kiwis and I will 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.830
 Why often why should I ask for digital which now has quirks more money 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.160
 output 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.580
 and basically it is like this 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.990
 the program 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.890
 But not quite right is that digital sound alike Avengers tenants 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.810
 has the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.570
 which, so to speak, around 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.880
 it is so strong that the HR is that the paint 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.720
 cracked in its structure so that means you have other things 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 not this game anymore 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.290
 that includes the effect of the LAC that is the wood 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.190
 can swing more and the whole thing sounds a bit more open 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.170
 And that's exactly how it is with the Proton dodgy yes as a Klask series 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 of cases as fifties sixties 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670
 in order not to work and see children 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.370
 and at Europoles so the situation is much thinner 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.750
 to the question of course what to large pockets deported the holistic 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.380
 effect 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.109
 of the paint is reduced so for the absorption of capital may already be district administrator 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.770
 Peter also sounds like this will be significantly louder than salsa 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.770
 comparable 60 or 70 from Mexico 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.079
 that has and that's just the same is offered 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.079
 Japan also has Sklenar in the Ambler 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.249
 he assured that speech i have bigger train i have higher one 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.029
 dynamics 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.029
 and that sounds like the whole thing then 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.069
 No 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:33.089
 I said to myself that makes 72 percent of the students 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.319
 especially if you see it will be many 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.239
 Nenzing Kolle at the neck and singing can stand in the case that is so from the 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.419
 Of course, Mr. Wacker's neck was very much praised Werner 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:44.899
 Brunner also heard a bit so you can be a bit in 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.829
 These Gerstenecker also go a bit 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.829
 Also, where am I here misfortunes 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:54.190
 Picture Mittmann 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.190
 With 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.839
 very cool compared to the bridge the 60 times device 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 Kaltenbrunner 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.839
 No 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.839
 Dr 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.539
 or by the well-known and very well-proven delivery that is so 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:23.299
 stands 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.649
 Both point the FÃ¼rth circus Brumby is heard it 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:28.529
 but the boom is a bit quieter 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.900
 so the official belongs to the delivery Earl of Pop not that he 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:32.419
 Greul 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.899
 Merkel got together these typical 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.909
 Present teleshow and shell 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.899
 image 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.899
 Rinteln WM 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:52.179
 Elephants with nice member of the left would choose 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.569
 then DEK 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.199
 so cool if you like that if you live the country in Berlin 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.049
 Islamabad for the cash register over-puffed corner that is by that it 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.369
 Beautiful is you have to go around 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.689
 not quite compare I've already tried on 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.079
 and this is 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.679
 not quite the same work 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.789
 do not do anything for that 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.620
 small device water costs owner much offended hair 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.880
 Per cent has to be pushed in. TechCrunch is above all this one 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.550
 Dry fixed furthermore, you can look beautiful is really what you can 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.669
 yes so a little to the 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.719
 Begass aggravate so on you can do it so it can be so if I 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.330
 have me for my painted shop 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.120
 that has a word and has and whether you have wondered what was there 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.719
 what's going on there is going on 

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:42.860
 can come about so far 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.069
 around 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.409
 is Solothurn 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:46.939
 Stratmann still been 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.399
 many threw a good base around hooded and all so so level 

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:53.120
 to bring and did it again yes 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.620
 so far they have been able to play the continental here with us 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.930
 Affected show what I can and will from the 4 when you roll 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.800
 and one ordered a comparison also played herself over her own 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.999
 equipment 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.109
 Mystery of the Quest Days works but you can afford a Steillage money 

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:11.680
 get back 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.340
 and who was fun and I did not
