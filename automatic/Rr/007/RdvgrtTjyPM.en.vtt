if<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.080> can<00:01:33.230> do<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.380> all<00:01:33.500> by<00:01:33.680> hand<00:01:33.980> I'm<00:01:34.700> going

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
if you can do it all by hand I'm going

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.190 
if you can do it all by hand I'm going
to<00:01:34.970> lock<00:01:35.120> this<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.480> place<00:01:35.690> real<00:01:35.930> quick

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
to lock this in place real quick

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.290 
to lock this in place real quick
we've<00:01:36.890> actually<00:01:37.010> got<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.280> jack<00:01:37.610> on<00:01:37.850> each<00:01:38.000> end

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
we've actually got a jack on each end

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.260 
we've actually got a jack on each end
the<00:01:38.600> jack<00:01:38.870> goes<00:01:39.050> for<00:01:39.290> 20<00:01:39.860> inches<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.280> stroke<00:01:40.550> in

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
the jack goes for 20 inches of stroke in

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.760 
the jack goes for 20 inches of stroke in
a<00:01:41.450> nutshell<00:01:41.630> you<00:01:41.900> can<00:01:42.020> take<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.320> main<00:01:42.500> mass

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
a nutshell you can take the main mass

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.080 
a nutshell you can take the main mass
that<00:01:43.010> we<00:01:43.100> have<00:01:43.340> here<00:01:43.580> guys

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
that we have here guys

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.520 
that we have here guys
lower<00:01:44.300> it<00:01:44.450> all<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.690> way<00:01:44.780> down<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:45.080> its<00:01:45.110> bottom

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
lower it all the way down to its bottom

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.490 
lower it all the way down to its bottom
position<00:01:46.010> okay<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:46.790> then<00:01:47.750> Jack<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.260> up<00:01:48.320> as

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
position okay and then Jack it up as

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.080 
position okay and then Jack it up as
high<00:01:48.620> as<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.860> can<00:01:49.040> either<00:01:49.520> put<00:01:49.700> a<00:01:49.730> barrel

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
high as you can either put a barrel

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.180 
high as you can either put a barrel
under<00:01:50.270> here<00:01:50.450> or<00:01:50.480> block<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:50.960> then<00:01:51.740> go<00:01:51.920> ahead<00:01:52.070> and

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
tip up so you can take these and move

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.000 
tip up so you can take these and move
them<00:03:37.800> in<00:03:37.860> an<00:03:37.980> upward<00:03:38.280> position<00:03:38.430> at<00:03:38.910> 90<00:03:39.300> degrees

them in an upward position at 90 degrees
there's<00:03:41.010> bolt<00:03:41.280> holes<00:03:41.490> in<00:03:41.610> place<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.270> once

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
there's bolt holes in place so once

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.730 
there's bolt holes in place so once
again<00:03:42.690> instead<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.990> having<00:03:43.080> it<00:03:43.320> out<00:03:43.410> this<00:03:43.560> way

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
again instead of having it out this way

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.840 
again instead of having it out this way
it's<00:03:43.890> actually<00:03:44.160> going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> tip<00:03:44.459> up<00:03:44.640> in<00:03:44.730> this

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
it's actually going to tip up in this

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.370 
it's actually going to tip up in this
direction<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.510> case<00:03:45.690> we're<00:03:45.870> trying<00:03:46.020> to<00:03:46.200> tie

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380
