 [music] 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.710
 hi to all motorists today we 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.369
 want to tell you about the new system 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.950
 pandora dxl 44 pages this is the second 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.220
 motorcycle protection system 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.530
 from the company alarm trade that 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.720
 first of all I want to say so 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.699
 This bracelet to control the system 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.160
 This bracelet performs the role without 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.550
 contact mark and quietly worn like 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.949
 The watch on the bracelet has two buttons varnish 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.059
 and he could ie turn on off 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.309
 guard 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.649
 as well as several LED 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.770
 indicators this bracelet can also 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.899
 use hands free mode and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 adjust the brush diameter as 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.250
 the most ordinary watches are also besides 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.770
 bracelet in this system is presented 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.750
 contactless tag label is exactly the same 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.180
 as for the automotive version of this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.440
 system tag housing embedded button 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.539
 which is used to include 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.850
 disarm 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.479
 further consider the remaining components 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.009
 This system will start with the base unit 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.619
 externally, the base unit is no different 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:25.399
 from previous models of this line 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.679
 block sizes are quite small and the block itself 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.509
 while tight on the outside 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.729
 unit has a connector for installation 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.830
 sim cards all other connectors 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.190
 are directly inside the block 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.679
 mini USB connector valet button and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.899
 2 and 4 GHz transmitter as well 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:44.090
 shock and tilt sensor all systems also 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.160
 There are reed sensors that can 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.340
 installed in principle at any place 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.160
 on a motorcycle it is also worth noting that in 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.310
 this system can install gps up 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.610
 antenna on ff 03 which does not require 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.220
 pulling wires from the block itself to 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.590
 antennas are also included with the system 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.459
 complete installation kit included 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.190
 wires 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.619
 with all necessary fuses 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.739
 wires are long enough problems 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.390
 installation should also arise in 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.950
 This system has a microphone which 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.560
 allows you to listen to all that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.870
 going around the bike just 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.700
 calling the system 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.640
 grafon plug simple plug 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.040
 unit led indicator which 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.150
 helps to customize the system as well 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.560
 report this mode of systems is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.319
 the system has detailed instructions for 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.090
 exploitation of which truth was found 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.340
 a bunch of grammatical errors 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.739
 Fortunately for the work of the system is not 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.500
 affects also there is an instruction for 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.569
 installation with a detailed wiring diagram 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.030
 in a minus at this system besides 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.340
 missing GPS receiver 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.920
 You can also note the absence 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.989
 additional lockout radio relay 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.450
 121 of this role and also bought 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.190
 separately also the complete set of the system is not 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.470
 SIM card included 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.260
