00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and personally I did he I did think he

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
and personally I did he I did think he
got<00:01:31.860> robbed<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.700> win<00:01:33.360> against<00:01:33.630> paki<00:01:33.869> on

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
their third fight or at the very least a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.399 
their third fight or at the very least a
draw<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.570> pacquiao<00:01:37.079> won<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
draw I don't think pacquiao won that

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.350 
draw I don't think pacquiao won that
fight<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.579> guess<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.030> could<00:01:39.180> say<00:01:39.329> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
fight and I guess you could say it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.530 
fight and I guess you could say it's

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
I think it will be an exciting fight

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.129 
I think it will be an exciting fight
between<00:05:40.979> Marquez<00:05:41.550> and<00:05:41.580> Manny<00:05:42.000> Pacquiao<00:05:42.479> but

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139
