 Our skin

 today we dedicate ourselves to celebrities in 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.930
 most intimate enemy of women and how 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.910
 we're going to do it with a massage and 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.040
 a draining and activator mask 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.300
 circulation before riding you 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.309
 I recommend that you give a good shower 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.050
 as well as did I beat exfoliates well in the 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.410
 skin let's do the massages them 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.410
 It seems 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 well we are ready to start with 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.899
 the most agile massages you can use 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.550
 with any cream you have in your 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.050
 house that's not the important thing because they're going 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.920
 to be the means for you to be 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.570
 do the massages 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.370
 you know why the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.739
 cellulitis first of all by 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.350
 genetic predisposition second bad 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.329
 food habits third stress and 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.010
 above all bad circulation which is what 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.629
 that we are going to work today good we are going to 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.070
 take a little cream what we're going to 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.019
 to do is heat it up a bit with the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.330
 hands and let's start all for this 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.009
 part draining the waste towards the 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.330
 ganglion area which is this one that 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.950
 find here in the groin and then 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.810
 let's continue with this part first 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.310
 let's start with this to not go 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.080
 accumulating because when we started by 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.820
 this sector what we do is accumulate 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.770
 waste in this area then we go 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.200
 eliminating this part little by little 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.610
 and then the other of these forms is 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.619
 they make the lymphatic drainages by 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.390
 example the second part of the massage the 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.800
 let's do with the knuckles putting 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.740
 a little more force what you 're going to do 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.780
 it's like little circles this massage with them 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 what he is going to do is destroy the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.100
 nodules of fat there is no problem 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.200
 it gets redder is more if it gets 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.119
 colorado is because the area still 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.100
 missing continue in treatment so 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.750
 let's continue with this form 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.240
 it's like it's getting me red 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.640
 also 7 to 21 that means we're 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.040
 working good to finish the massage 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.310
 what you are going to do is join the massage 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.020
 from the twin to the knee 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.270
 we go back to bet on the thigh and what 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.399
 It is to carry everything all to the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.100
 zone of anglais this part that is a 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.409
 part that gets stressed a lot when it's 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.780
 so stressed does not let it flow well 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.060
 circulation after massages 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 also in the knee what would it be that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.260
 have 5 minutes of massage in each 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.170
 leg if you could do that via 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.000
 it would be ideal 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.599
 good the last part of the treatment 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.520
 for cellulite is going to be a mask 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.340
 activators of circulation and drainage 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.470
 for that you're going to need 2 teaspoons 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.989
 spirulina one teaspoon oil 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.730
 olive and a little lemon juice blends 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.950
 everything and that's how you're going to be left with 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.700
 brush lotion we are going to apply it in the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.700
 affected area 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.030
 this mask you will let her act 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.470
 for 20 minutes I'm going to count the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.190
 properties of these three ingredients 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.220
 the lemon is antiseptic the spirulina is 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.420
 an alga is almost almost all chlorophyll what 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.730
 what is going to do is this mask is 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.320
 activate circulation and oil 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.180
 what olive is going to do is nurture the 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.830
 skin and help spirulina to run 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.240
 I hope you have been served in my 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.160
 advice because none of us like 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.420
 have cellulite all you need 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.250
 it's a little bit of will for you 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.540
 do this treatment good I wish you 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.540
 the best and I send you many kisses 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.890
 yes 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.269
 It's me 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.269
 no no 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.950
 ah
