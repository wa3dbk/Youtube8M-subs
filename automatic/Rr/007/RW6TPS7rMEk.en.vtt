00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.590 
highlighted the same situation they're
both<00:04:42.380> saying<00:04:42.620> exactly<00:04:42.949> what<00:04:43.250> I'm<00:04:43.400> saying<00:04:43.669> just

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
both saying exactly what I'm saying just

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.939 
both saying exactly what I'm saying just
in<00:04:44.750> a<00:04:44.840> different<00:04:44.960> context<00:04:47.500> well<00:04:48.500> maybe<00:04:48.740> I've

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
in a different context well maybe I've

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.980 
in a different context well maybe I've
made<00:04:49.099> a<00:04:49.130> big<00:04:49.370> deal<00:04:49.550> out<00:04:49.610> of<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:50.060> but<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.780> still

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
made a big deal out of this but I still

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.029 
made a big deal out of this but I still
think<00:04:51.199> that<00:04:51.260> we<00:04:51.410> should<00:04:51.590> be<00:04:51.680> paying<00:04:51.889> attention

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
think that we should be paying attention

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.339 
think that we should be paying attention
to<00:04:52.400> details<00:04:52.849> we<00:04:53.570> should<00:04:53.720> root<00:04:53.900> out<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.080> bad

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
to details we should root out the bad

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.150 
to details we should root out the bad
ones<00:04:54.620> early<00:04:54.979> keep<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:55.760> close<00:04:55.970> eye<00:04:56.180> on<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.419> pulse

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
ones early keep a close eye on the pulse

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.880 
ones early keep a close eye on the pulse
see<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.220> at<00:04:58.310> the<00:04:58.400> next<00:04:58.430> report
