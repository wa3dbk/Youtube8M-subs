00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
with air that pressurized environment

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.540 
with air that pressurized environment
fans<00:03:27.050> and<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.670> get<00:03:28.880> more<00:03:29.270> space<00:03:29.690> for<00:03:30.550> kilogram

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
fans and you get more space for kilogram

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.090 
fans and you get more space for kilogram
of<00:03:31.580> launched<00:03:32.060> it's<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:32.890> whereas<00:03:33.890> if<00:03:34.010> you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
of launched it's just whereas if you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.740 
of launched it's just whereas if you
launched<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.520> as<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> whole<00:03:35.210> integrated

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
launched it as a whole integrated

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.720 
launched it as a whole integrated
section<00:03:36.260> it's<00:03:36.830> basically<00:03:37.160> like<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.370> mobile

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
section it's basically like a mobile

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.100 
section it's basically like a mobile
home<00:03:37.850> it's<00:03:38.090> there<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:38.570> opened<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.960> door

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
home it's there you just opened the door

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.060 
home it's there you just opened the door
and<00:03:39.230> you're<00:03:39.350> ready<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.590> live

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
and you're ready to live

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.210

so<00:03:40.610> there's<00:03:40.820> trades<00:03:41.150> between<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.840> two<00:03:42.220> you

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
so there's trades between the two you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.680 
so there's trades between the two you
know<00:03:43.310> if<00:03:43.460> you<00:03:43.580> value<00:03:43.940> as<00:03:44.060> much<00:03:44.330> space<00:03:44.660> for

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
know if you value as much space for

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.330 
know if you value as much space for
possible<00:03:45.290> for<00:03:45.500> kilogram<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.040> launch<00:03:46.220> vehicle

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340

then<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.120> go<00:03:47.240> with<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.510> inflatable<00:03:47.780> if<00:03:48.770> you

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
then you go with the inflatable if you

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.670 
then you go with the inflatable if you
want<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.220> make<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.990> move-in<00:03:50.990> ready<00:03:51.020> as<00:03:51.440> soon<00:03:51.470> as

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
want to make it move-in ready as soon as

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.080

they got crew gets there you want

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.610 
they got crew gets there you want
