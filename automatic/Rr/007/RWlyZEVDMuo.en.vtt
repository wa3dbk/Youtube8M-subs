honestly<00:03:19.880> feel<00:03:20.569> that<00:03:20.600> threatened<00:03:21.410> so<00:03:21.680> they

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
honestly feel that threatened so they

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.009 
honestly feel that threatened so they
don't<00:03:22.519> school<00:03:22.790> together<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.450> much<00:03:23.690> but
