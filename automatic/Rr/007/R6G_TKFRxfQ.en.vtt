00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 same is also and it is not that he scored the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.259
 second goal of the important municipal 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 for you to win because here you follow 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.580
 undefeated and the commissioned team is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 very important a christ 4 the team so 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 good as surfing with such good 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.740
 players we knew it will be a match 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.470
 very hard physically with a lot 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.180
 intensity and so it was but programs that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.260
 we look for our points defined in 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.789
 the first 10 minutes practically 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.109
 things that had not been given very much and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.430
 never because they always had to suffer 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.050
 until the end to win the matches 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.429
 we were failing the first ones 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.990
 we did not put in goal chances and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.099
 after we see the matches today 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.110
 thank God we can put the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.700
 first and there we manage the game the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.739
 true that melgar is a great team and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.300
 We are happy to give you a return to 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.710
 dial after some time and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.789
 Missed, a goal must be scored again 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.370
 to goal so hopefully the streak 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.680
 continue this thanks to you we are with 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.300
 him and stuck the best match the best 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.140
 without triumph of his life 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.350
 as to 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
 suddenly to solve then the keys 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.440
 that we had I think the best not because 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.500
 we have arrived quite a lot and we have not had 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.030
 really the certainty to make goals 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.640
 I think this is a team that has just 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.320
 way then it was also a lot of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.840
 suddenly the physicist we touch against 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.190
 champion that was crystal then it was made 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.600
 very difficult uphill especially 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.979
 because people question is normal not 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.570
 when you lose with a team with so much 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.490
 tradition as munich all go to 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.660
 question but we are working to 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.350
 try to get the best way to 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.720
 opening and lic 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.460
 in the cope link to almost a file with 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.170
 this is very complicated but they follow the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.180
 fight because they are there is a very group 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.770
 fought very close sure we go 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.869
 to fight we are going to play the matches as 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.899
 we have been trying to propose 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.300
 always but but we know that the 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.710
 melgar and glass schools this one 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.119
 has many more players than us 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.830
 sometimes we have to supply 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.190
 players with juveniles like now that 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.590
 we are reaching for 20 and nothing 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.350
 I think the opening championship we're going 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.580
 to get it right let's make me fight 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.899
 I think we have gone equally to 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.899
 all to everything that we have been put 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.070
 in front of me I consider that people have 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.840
 have to be calm especially lynch 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.369
 harmonica that suffered because really 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.630
 I think that they are the only things that come 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.369
 results but they also have to do 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.780
 that we play against other teams that 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.580
 they also have enough staff that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.700
 money pelee that I think we're going to 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.039
 be fighting 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.239
 and put on the expectation not especially 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.920
 We can not promise because we're going to do 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.209
 champions but but surely we're going to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.260
 fight to half table up to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.280
 try to bother this one get in 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.720
 trying to get me I think it would be 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.550
 great to get some coupons 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 not condemned international will you do with 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.410
 fernando is well around here he fought 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.840
 that is with an ailment ended something 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.080
 hit demos with ice on the in the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.879
 left thigh that is as it is 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.500
 he fought a triumph that serves a lot that 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.599
 grab this group deserved this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.970
 university is a joy a joy 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.440
 all these people that the truth that is 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.569
 admirable what he does is not always 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.610
 pending of your team is always 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.370
 encouraging until the last and I think that 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.220
 today we ourselves deserved the triumph 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.870
 and these people also told me today not 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.319
 we have suffered as we have suffered 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.319
 forever 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.989
 what ammunition pre wins suffering from 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.329
 matches that we have won at 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.790
 last minute as the match Cienciano 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.889
 that they have tied us and we have not been 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.120
 containing we have already calm myself 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.599
 I think today we were forceful not 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.489
 Arrived from the beginning we knew 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.950
 take what we had and good is 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.780
 nothing calm think now in essence 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.250
 what has been key for you to recover 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.959
 your level so that you have a little more 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.079
 freedom on the court and you start to 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.370
 highlight the first thing I think a 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.280
 good recovery not after the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.599
 last year's election this one I had a 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.030
 good recovery a good 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.040
 preseason this year and nothing and the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.049
 Professor's confidence, I do not think that 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.459
 player always has to have the 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.590
 coach confidence of all his 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.319
 comrades and I think so this time 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.719
 that I have been maintaining and I hope so 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.819
 keep raising my level 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.319
 GarcÃ­a municipal player I do not know if 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.090
 there was some other possibility out there in 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.870
 other plots no I do not think we've had 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.639
 better matches to the block than good 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.769
 we had a bit of bad luck that 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.730
 they have not converted but I think that this one 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.530
 It was 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.480
 the most effective match we've had 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.280
 because I think we did not create so many 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.049
 Goal situations like other matches but 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.400
 the first two took shape and that 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.959
 gave us the peace of mind to handle the 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.430
 party that you had that margin that 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.959
 they did not score them today they had better 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.060
 matches the money defense had 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.270
 best matches is said I think that equal 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.070
 because no no no I'm coming to see you 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.100
 can i say the match 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.440
 against science, we also play very 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.840
 well I think they had a little more 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.580
 of offensive power or had more space 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.910
 to attack us and we went very well like this 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.890
 I do not think we're improving so much 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.620
 us in defense like the flyers 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.690
 forward and that's what's exciting for 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.010
 what comes later as you are 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.450
 feeling right now and municipal that 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.190
 you mean you could feel the heat of 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.600
 the people what this team represents 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.570
 that in Peru it is true that the 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.300
 swollen always encourages and is one of the 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.750
 few swollen people who do not insult almost 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.090
 never the player always 95 minutes 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.730
 encouraging screaming supporting so it's 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.190
 cute to play with these people and I think the 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.960
 triumph of today we dedicate 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.960
 mainly to them 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.850
 as to them and goodbye mainly with 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.740
 what art team I put a little bit 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.300
 it will be little difficult not with what bloated 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.710
 with what equipment could you compare this 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.980
 in Argentina 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.280
 not the truth is that even if there is not 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.230
 as many fans as Argentina is 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.260
 much more fanatic but I think it 's that 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.870
 you feel the heat of the people and I think 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.170
 what is it that they live it like as any 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.360
 great Argentine like a hurricane or a 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.370
 traditional team like that then I think that 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.670
 is coming out it 's nice to play here with you 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.770
 people always feeling that they encourage 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.040
 death so we are very happy 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.140
 to hear you barber companions now 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.900
 they are fernando good job michael for 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.940
 this victory I'm with municipal in 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.380
 these 45 initial minutes okay 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.360
 defending well attacking the 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.140
 pompei operation of equipment that 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.210
 he remains unbeaten in this field but 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.280
 I think that a first time I thought of 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.960
 where you count after the second time 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.960
 drew conclusions or today better 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.860
 before 12 minutes he has won 2 to 0 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:26.419
 first the goal against corner by 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.219
 try to get a new ball on 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.669
 second goal of damiÃ¡n and then he knew 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.469
 drive 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.120
 it seems to me that putting them handled them 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:34.099
 suddenly if I had accelerated a little more 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.780
 in 34 court could have entered the 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.759
 marker because this is getting revenge 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.879
 advanced the second time it seems to me that 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.979
 was shared the moment the melgar 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:45.500
 better new service had two options 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:49.159
 clear when he entered satin and rose the 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.530
 cool it matched the game no elche it 

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:52.789
 forgot about the mark of concern and 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.830
 set about creating football is what 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.020
 know how to do and had the opportunity to Munich 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.060
 as he also had opportunity to appear 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.560
 very good the crazy thin cutting center 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.120
 with so much security behind it seems to me that 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.099
 conclusion I think those three points 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:10.669
 important to me yes it seems to me that 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:12.889
 A new team is still arriving 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.040
 because their players today emulate days 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:18.910
 they were good level 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:21.550
 but all the rooms and model garcia and 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:24.340
 maidana are the important ones that the 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:28.350
 this triumph did not have the opportunity in 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.350
 the first kind of ending it with 30
