all<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> time<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> difference<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
all the time but the difference the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.700 
all the time but the difference the
answer<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.930> question<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> difference

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
answer your question the difference

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640 
answer your question the difference
would<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.659> main<00:01:30.840> difference<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.350> we

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
would be the main difference is that we

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920 
would be the main difference is that we
we<00:01:32.100> do<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> our<00:01:32.790> voice<00:01:33.000> acting<00:01:33.450> completely

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
we do all of our voice acting completely

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.440 
we do all of our voice acting completely
alone<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.829> you're<00:01:35.070> acting<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:36.270> other

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
alone so when you're acting with other

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
alone so when you're acting with other
people<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> sort<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.560> work<00:01:37.770> off<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
people you get to sort of work off of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.090 
people you get to sort of work off of
them<00:01:38.780> but<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.990> most<00:01:40.049> part<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.650> gravity

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
them but for the most part and gravity

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
them but for the most part and gravity
falls<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.000> my<00:01:42.299> lines<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.840> row

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
falls I just do all of my lines in a row

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.899 
falls I just do all of my lines in a row
and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.500> put<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.369> together<00:01:44.579> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and then they put it all together with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.069 
and then they put it all together with
everyone<00:01:45.149> else<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> make<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:45.899> like
