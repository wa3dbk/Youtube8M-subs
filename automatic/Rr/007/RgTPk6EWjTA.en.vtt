00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.270 
see how well it fits it fits very easily
and<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.140> like<00:01:38.329> snug<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.170> snag<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and very like snug but not to snag I

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
think it's perfectly fit and also it's

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
think it's perfectly fit and also it's
not<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.590> slippery<00:01:47.250> plastic<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.210> good

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
not like slippery plastic which is good

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.690 
not like slippery plastic which is good
because<00:01:48.689> some<00:01:49.020> cases<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.560> too<00:01:49.740> slippery<00:01:50.159> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
because some cases are too slippery and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.319 
because some cases are too slippery and
this<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.659> gripa<00:01:52.200> bowl<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> overall

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
this is very like gripa bowl so overall

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.389 
this is very like gripa bowl so overall
for<00:01:54.840> ten<00:01:55.110> dollars<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.009> really

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
for ten dollars I think it's really

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.219 
for ten dollars I think it's really
worth<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.790> because<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.570> such<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> good

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
worth it because you get such a good

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.130
