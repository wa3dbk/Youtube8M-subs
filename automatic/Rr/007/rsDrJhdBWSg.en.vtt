00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.960 

okay<00:00:01.260> so<00:00:01.319> let's<00:00:02.010> talk<00:00:02.250> about<00:00:02.429> sex

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay so let's talk about sex

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.740 
okay so let's talk about sex
determination<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.430> sex-linked<00:00:05.430> inheritance

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
determination and sex-linked inheritance

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.440 
determination and sex-linked inheritance
of<00:00:06.750> traits<00:00:07.490> so<00:00:08.490> we've<00:00:08.849> already<00:00:09.030> talked<00:00:09.300> about

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
of traits so we've already talked about

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.129 
of traits so we've already talked about
the<00:00:11.509> X<00:00:12.710> chromosomes<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:14.309> females<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.210> X<00:00:15.719> and

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the X chromosomes for females and X and

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.260 
the X chromosomes for females and X and
Y<00:00:16.699> chromosome<00:00:17.699> for<00:00:18.000> males<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.880> look<00:00:20.910> at

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
Y chromosome for males so if we look at

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.450 
Y chromosome for males so if we look at
just<00:00:21.900> opponents<00:00:22.380> impul<00:00:22.710> punnett<00:00:23.010> square<00:00:23.310> of

just opponents impul punnett square of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.769 
just opponents impul punnett square of
the<00:00:23.609> chromosomes<00:00:24.500> we've<00:00:25.500> got<00:00:25.800> our<00:00:26.490> mail<00:00:26.910> here

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the chromosomes we've got our mail here

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.630 
the chromosomes we've got our mail here
with<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> Y<00:00:28.260> chromosome<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.130> our<00:00:29.189> female

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
with the Y chromosome and our female

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
with the Y chromosome and our female
here<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.330> if<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.779> look<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> possible

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
here and if we look at the possible

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.130 
here and if we look at the possible
combinations<00:00:32.030> with<00:00:33.030> respect<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.719> these<00:00:33.840> sex

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
combinations with respect to these sex

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.430 
combinations with respect to these sex
chromosomes<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.219> get<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.610> girl<00:00:35.880> boy<00:00:36.719> girl

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
chromosomes we can get a girl boy girl

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.299 
chromosomes we can get a girl boy girl
or<00:00:37.829> boy<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.210> fifty-fifty<00:00:40.140> chance<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> that

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
or boy so fifty-fifty chance so that

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.619 
or boy so fifty-fifty chance so that
kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> keeps<00:00:41.640> our<00:00:41.850> gender<00:00:42.149> ratios

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
kind of keeps our gender ratios

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.700 
kind of keeps our gender ratios
relatively<00:00:43.290> even<00:00:43.710> okay<00:00:45.020> having<00:00:46.020> two<00:00:46.410> X

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
relatively even okay having two X

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
relatively even okay having two X
chromosomes<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:49.579> kind<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> safeguard<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
chromosomes is kind of a safeguard so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569 
chromosomes is kind of a safeguard so
the<00:00:51.870> second<00:00:52.289> X<00:00:52.440> chromosome<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the second X chromosome it's kind of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
the second X chromosome it's kind of
like<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.730> back-up<00:00:54.420> plan<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.110> there's<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
like a back-up plan if there's a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.270 
like a back-up plan if there's a
malfunction<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.680> males

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
malfunction on one of these so in males

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.849 
malfunction on one of these so in males
since<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.910> just<00:01:00.030> have<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.570> X<00:01:00.870> chromosome<00:01:01.320> we

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
since we just have one X chromosome we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
since we just have one X chromosome we
in<00:01:02.399> terms<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.760> me<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> other<00:01:03.780> males

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
in terms of me and all the other males

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.289 
in terms of me and all the other males
out<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.589> since<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.549> only<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.119> X

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
out there since they only have one X

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.560 
out there since they only have one X
chromosome<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.250> why<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.909> tiny<00:01:09.330> guy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
chromosome and the why is this tiny guy

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.260 
chromosome and the why is this tiny guy
that<00:01:09.869> doesn't<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.350> many<00:01:10.799> genes<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> we

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that doesn't have many genes on it we

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300 
that doesn't have many genes on it we
only<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.720> one<00:01:12.840> shot<00:01:13.439> at<00:01:13.770> getting<00:01:14.070> it

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
only really have one shot at getting it

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.789 
only really have one shot at getting it
right<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.939> you'll<00:01:15.570> find<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> lot<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
right so you'll find that a lot of

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.109 
right so you'll find that a lot of
diseases<00:01:18.439> associated<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:20.040> mutations<00:01:20.880> on

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
diseases associated with mutations on

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.940 
diseases associated with mutations on
the<00:01:21.240> X<00:01:21.420> chromosome<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:22.170> more<00:01:22.470> common<00:01:22.860> in

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the X chromosome are more common in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.660 
the X chromosome are more common in
males<00:01:23.159> because<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.270> only<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:25.049> mutation

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
males because we only need one mutation

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.300 
males because we only need one mutation
rather<00:01:26.670> than<00:01:27.000> having<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:28.080> copies<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
rather than having two copies of the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.870 
rather than having two copies of the
disease<00:01:29.640> delisle<00:01:30.060> okay<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.970> look<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
disease delisle okay so let's look at a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.670 
disease delisle okay so let's look at a
example<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.060> some<00:01:37.820> problems<00:01:38.820> here<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.680> color

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
example of some problems here so color

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.289 
example of some problems here so color
blind<00:01:41.070> man<00:01:41.340> let's<00:01:41.640> talk<00:01:41.759> about<00:01:41.880> color

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
blind man let's talk about color

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
blind man let's talk about color
blindness<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.890> those<00:01:44.040> genes

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
blindness so this is one of those genes

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.700 
blindness so this is one of those genes
where<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:47.130> normal<00:01:47.880> trait<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.689> being<00:01:49.020> able<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
where the normal trait for being able to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.910 
where the normal trait for being able to
see<00:01:50.070> color<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.509> picture<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
see color so like this picture here is a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.030 
see color so like this picture here is a
typical<00:01:53.759> color<00:01:54.420> test<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:55.040> red-green

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
typical color test for red-green

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.730 
typical color test for red-green
colorblindness<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:59.180> you<00:02:00.180> can't<00:02:00.890> see

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
colorblindness so if you can't see

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.699 
colorblindness so if you can't see
the<00:02:03.340> number<00:02:03.850> 25<00:02:04.720> here<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.939> are<00:02:07.119> color<00:02:07.360> blind

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
the number 25 here you are color blind

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.199 
the number 25 here you are color blind
because<00:02:08.709> you<00:02:08.890> gain<00:02:09.039> distinguish<00:02:09.550> between<00:02:09.729> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
because you gain distinguish between the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.990 
because you gain distinguish between the
Reds<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.050> green<00:02:11.230> colors<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.220> but

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
Reds and the green colors here but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.540 
Reds and the green colors here but
anyway<00:02:13.209> back<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.599> this<00:02:13.750> problem<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:17.550> right

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
anyway back to this problem here right

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.650 
anyway back to this problem here right
here<00:02:19.239> let's<00:02:19.720> get<00:02:19.840> rid<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:21.420> back<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.540> this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
here let's get rid of that back to this

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.729 
here let's get rid of that back to this
problem<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> color<00:02:23.950> blind<00:02:24.280> man<00:02:24.700> so

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
problem here so the color blind man so

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.930 
problem here so the color blind man so
we<00:02:26.739> know<00:02:26.970> color<00:02:27.970> blindness<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:29.790> x-linked<00:02:30.790> or

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
we know color blindness is a x-linked or

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.710 
we know color blindness is a x-linked or
sex-linked<00:02:31.750> trait<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.489> man<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:34.120> know<00:02:34.330> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
sex-linked trait so the man we know to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.199 
sex-linked trait so the man we know to

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
begin with he is XY so we'll use those

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.520 
begin with he is XY so we'll use those
symbols<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.019> we're<00:02:38.170> going<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.350> use

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
symbols and we're going to use

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.039 
symbols and we're going to use
superscripts<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:40.060> denote<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.569> alleles<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
superscripts to denote the alleles that

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.190 
superscripts to denote the alleles that
he<00:02:41.230> has<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.590> he's<00:02:41.769> colorblind<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.900> doesn't

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
he has so he's colorblind and it doesn't

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.780 
he has so he's colorblind and it doesn't
say<00:02:44.319> here<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:44.769> I'm<00:02:44.860> telling<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.250> now<00:02:45.430> color

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
say here but I'm telling you now color

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.380 
say here but I'm telling you now color
blindness<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.870> recessive<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:49.120> normal

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
blindness is recessive to the normal

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.259 
blindness is recessive to the normal
trait<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:49.930> he's<00:02:50.319> a<00:02:50.620> little<00:02:50.799> see<00:02:51.310> here<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.790> he's

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
trait so he's a little see here and he's

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.729 
trait so he's a little see here and he's
going<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.480> be<00:02:52.569> crossed<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.170> woman<00:02:53.590> who<00:02:53.709> is

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
going to be crossed with a woman who is

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.059 
going to be crossed with a woman who is
a<00:02:53.890> carrier<00:02:54.519> that's<00:02:55.269> not<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.600> term<00:02:55.959> we<00:02:56.170> mentioned

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
a carrier that's not a term we mentioned

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.289 
a carrier that's not a term we mentioned
before<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.120> carrier<00:02:58.930> is<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.230> person<00:03:00.190> who<00:03:00.299> has

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
before but a carrier is a person who has

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.300 
before but a carrier is a person who has
a<00:03:01.780> copy<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:03.400> recessive<00:03:04.360> disease<00:03:05.319> allele<00:03:05.860> but

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
a copy of a recessive disease allele but

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.729 
a copy of a recessive disease allele but
because<00:03:06.760> it's<00:03:07.420> recessive<00:03:07.870> just<00:03:08.320> having<00:03:08.590> one

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
because it's recessive just having one

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.420 
because it's recessive just having one
copy<00:03:09.090> she<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.269> see<00:03:10.450> color<00:03:10.660> fine<00:03:11.400> she's<00:03:12.400> a

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
copy she can see color fine she's a

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.400 
copy she can see color fine she's a
carrier<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.390> sense<00:03:13.660> that<00:03:13.780> she<00:03:14.260> can

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
carrier in the sense that she can

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.840 
carrier in the sense that she can
deliver<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:15.750> disease<00:03:16.750> trait<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.609> next

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
deliver that disease trait to the next

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.650 
deliver that disease trait to the next
generation<00:03:19.030> but<00:03:20.019> she<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:21.269> undetected<00:03:22.269> you

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660

generation but she is undetected you
know<00:03:22.780> typically<00:03:23.109> so<00:03:23.410> here's<00:03:23.590> her<00:03:23.709> genotype

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
know typically so here's her genotype

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.020 
know typically so here's her genotype
she<00:03:24.579> is<00:03:24.730> X<00:03:25.030> X<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:27.100> need<00:03:27.250> some<00:03:27.370> superscript

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
she is X X and we need some superscript

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.910 
she is X X and we need some superscript
so<00:03:28.269> she<00:03:28.359> can<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:28.930> normal<00:03:29.350> so<00:03:29.530> she's<00:03:29.680> got<00:03:29.829> at

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
so she can see normal so she's got at

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.890 
so she can see normal so she's got at
least<00:03:29.980> one<00:03:30.250> big<00:03:30.459> seat<00:03:30.730> but<00:03:31.269> she's<00:03:31.630> colorblind

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
least one big seat but she's colorblind

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.960 
least one big seat but she's colorblind
she's<00:03:32.650> carrying<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.250> color<00:03:33.549> blindness

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
she's carrying the color blindness

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.840 
she's carrying the color blindness
allele<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:34.930> she's<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.319> heterozygote<00:03:36.100> okay<00:03:36.700> so

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
allele so she's a heterozygote okay so

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.840 
allele so she's a heterozygote okay so
let's<00:03:37.150> make<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.359> Punnett<00:03:37.720> Square<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:38.620> this

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
going to be carriers okay and then if we

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.629 
going to be carriers okay and then if we
look<00:04:43.199> at<00:04:43.380> with<00:04:43.680> respect<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:45.949> males<00:04:46.949> over

other hand is going to be color blind ok
so<00:05:04.740> we<00:05:05.430> only<00:05:05.639> need<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.180> look<00:05:06.210> at<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.990> X

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
so we only need to look at the X

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.820 
so we only need to look at the X
chromosome<00:05:08.580> here<00:05:09.210> we<00:05:09.720> can<00:05:09.870> forget<00:05:10.229> about<00:05:10.380> the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
chromosome here we can forget about the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.460 
chromosome here we can forget about the
why<00:05:11.010> it<00:05:11.460> doesn't<00:05:11.940> even<00:05:12.060> have<00:05:12.389> that<00:05:12.630> location

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
why it doesn't even have that location

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.589 
why it doesn't even have that location
for<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:13.979> instructions<00:05:14.430> at<00:05:14.849> all<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.510> it

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:15.599 
for the instructions at all so it

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:17.180 
for the instructions at all so it
doesn't<00:05:15.780> even<00:05:15.810> count<00:05:16.169> we're<00:05:16.470> just<00:05:16.680> looking<00:05:17.039> at

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
doesn't even count we're just looking at

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.570 
doesn't even count we're just looking at
this<00:05:17.669> ok<00:05:18.539> so<00:05:18.599> the<00:05:19.500> same<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.860> actually<00:05:20.159> true<00:05:20.370> for

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
this ok so the same is actually true for

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.850 
this ok so the same is actually true for
their<00:05:20.669> sons<00:05:20.909> fifty<00:05:21.300> percent<00:05:21.659> will<00:05:22.500> have<00:05:22.680> it

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
their sons fifty percent will have it

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.029 
their sons fifty percent will have it
fifty<00:05:23.430> percent<00:05:23.699> won't<00:05:24.060> there<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:25.169> can't<00:05:25.560> have

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
fifty percent won't there you can't have

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.600 
fifty percent won't there you can't have
a<00:05:26.430> carrier<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.870> is<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:28.110> male<00:05:28.500> for<00:05:28.949> an<00:05:29.070> x-linked

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
a carrier that is a male for an x-linked

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.969 
a carrier that is a male for an x-linked
trait<00:05:29.699> because<00:05:30.180> if<00:05:30.539> they<00:05:30.720> have<00:05:30.960> one<00:05:31.260> copy<00:05:31.530> they

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
trait because if they have one copy they

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.260 
trait because if they have one copy they
have<00:05:32.159> the<00:05:32.430> disease<00:05:33.260> ok
