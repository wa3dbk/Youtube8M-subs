00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 hallöchen the ferry box is here and me 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.040
 I thought we'll look in there again 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.090
 verivox gets more expensive that we have yes 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 already noticed 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.160
 So the subscribers at least and costs 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.279
 then somehow just under 20 euros with 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:27.000
 shipping so let's see how I 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:36.590
 here again on war first 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:40.920
 we have crumbs here postbrief again 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:45.539
 You can write the participation on 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.070
 the direct debit procedure to do this 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.140
 form back so you can also sepa 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.340
 can change 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.170
 Okay, let's have a look 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.930
 First, a key chain in 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:04.199
 heart shape front v net but here naked 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.720
 news eyeshadow palette I think 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.960
 again interesting that I think 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 again interesting is here again 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.420
 try this movie pasted over 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.350
 Let's also from satisfied 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:30.590
 works then we'll see 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.990
 which seems to be very well pigmented 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 not pushy here that is white one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.570
 bit weak but chest makes you 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.530
 good impression I have to say I hold 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.689
 still a bit bad here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.320
 i make a good impression but very much 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.939
 very very very discreet so really 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.310
 subtle make- up are therefore probably too 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.110
 dwindle 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 we have hollywood mails here 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, I did not have that 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.149
 I just have to look somewhere 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.910
 where I have him in any box 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.030
 I had the one I had before 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.640
 but we do not have anything like that here either 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.860
 hand cream is here because the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.640
 hand cream maybe not there 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.140
 Smear where I just got that 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.570
 eyeshadow has lubricated that one 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.840
 bit worse but draws damn 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.620
 fast one had a typical 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.750
 stale natural cosmetics smell of air 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.630
 a bit of foot cream she really does 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.370
 for hunt stands hand on it has one 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.260
 some call not because of river cream 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.970
 that early morning-pine scary 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.410
 gladly used for foot creams and co 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.270
 and that's why these associations 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.460
 basically has is but actually 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.860
 only a pure natural cosmetics fragrance stops 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.460
 I still have a little Kreuth Rich 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:58.720
 I always associate the foot cream and 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:03:07.340
 what we have here easier on it 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:09.230
 little but still wants easy - touch what 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.680
 should that be that is such a tank 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.209
 or you blinded with fingers so 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.480
 a lot is already highlighting penh 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.080
 okay not concealer but highlighter 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 a highlight 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:35.959
 then let's see what I notice 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.940
 nothing should ever come of it 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:44.989
 do something or I mean 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:48.130
 but it is thought that 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.130
 Sometime something comes out 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.390
 that is probably a teacher 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.340
 highlighter because here happens 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.989
 nothing really happens from my god 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.050
 you just have to be patient and that is 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:08.850
 damn much patience a very nice 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:11.610
 color rose stitch 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.080
 But I give a nice shimmer 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.470
 I did not want to grow now 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.230
 rotate 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.459
 That's what I wanted to do 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.440
 very nice shimmer i have it myself 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.640
 now a little bit on it 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.100
 smeared i dont know if you are in the 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.860
 Camera looks but I like it 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.490
 he smells good too 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.140
 good, but that's nice 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.500
 yes that was the whole ferry boxe 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.680
 I'm trying now things here 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.660
 give halfway again or do 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.140
 I later left the number aside like that 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.570
 that's the whole box 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:53.280
 At first glance, it does not look very good 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.950
 but I find the eyeshadow 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.210
 palette and the highlighter really 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.460
 interesting I am glad that there still 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.810
 what came out has you got it like that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.220
 So I have to turn a lot so long 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.080
 never turned to something pen what 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.190
 came out 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.420
 but I liked the color I like 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.390
 the palette 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.310
 I find that really interesting 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.560
 hollywood mails I have as I said 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.680
 ever had 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.240
 this is a nice guti and now 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.780
 the hand cream does not convince me now 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.420
 really now I look with map 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.210
 there was this time probably not yet at 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.460
 Oh look now you can already before 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.050
 look on it now is the map 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.110
 Saved the card is now on the 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:39.810
 building 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.670
 we are seriously here now the vils 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:47.280
 trailer you have as a product 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.860
 scored for 599 now without misting me 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.960
 thought it would be special 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.670
 okay he is handmade vegan cute 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.900
 Well, there you can argue and 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:02.580
 practically you can also about it 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:03.780
 I now find it difficult to argue 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.750
 The product is valued as 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.370
 Surprise okay but as really as 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.950
 product in the shit that here 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.290
 Listed with price not nonsense 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.400
 the concealer peña now had highlighter 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.470
 or concealer well you can 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.570
 probably bathed use was there 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.680
 dark circles are always thought to be so good 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.810
 that make many healers 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.479
 but he has only such a rosé ton 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.979
 so I would not I would to him 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.389
 not as a highlight so i would like him 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:30.410
 as a highlight, the glitter also 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:33.270
 I would not use as a concealer 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.160
 he shimmers so I would 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.419
 As I said on the packaging stood up 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.419
 highlighter and not concealer 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.680
 highlighting peña is here on it 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.050
 nothing about concealer that is so 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.389
 also already error 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.830
 What's going on here, I'll say so 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.000
 as I said the hai light up and I like 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.889
 him anyway I think he is good as 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.710
 I can not care about the highlight now 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.860
 that is now a concealer or not 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:01.979
 to 16 euro the naked range costs 14 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:05.160
 euro and the hand cream eight euros and 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:09.110
 This hollywood is permanently unfortunately 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.110
 a surprise special 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.770
 good with the little mistakes 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.919
 now on the map and that here 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.389
 comes as a product comes sponge 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.400
 about it 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.919
 the palette and here as a highlighter 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.030
 tear it out but I personally think so 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.949
 this is my own taste 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.990
 Now the question is how do you see that 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:31.199
 write me that in the comments 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.360
 I like the box even if that is now 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.370
 as I said a bit strange there 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.470
 is with the card i still like her 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.139
 and I think the selection is good too 

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.659
 and as I said the palette speaks 

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:44.250
 me just and so if so 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:46.349
 a highlight or two highlights in 

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.340
 a box then can be there too 

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:48.740
 things still be with me now 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.150
 not so interested 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.740
 your opinion, I look forward to it in the 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:57.530
 comments to this and I would say, 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.530
 See you in the next video bye
