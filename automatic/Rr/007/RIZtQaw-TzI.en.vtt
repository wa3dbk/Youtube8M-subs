head<00:04:36.750> though<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.720> that's<00:04:39.840> what<00:04:39.990> it<00:04:40.050> looks<00:04:40.200> like

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
head though so that's what it looks like

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.500 
head though so that's what it looks like
there<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:40.800> that's<00:04:41.790> what<00:04:41.970> hawk<00:04:42.120> but<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.360> looks

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
there and that's what hawk but it looks

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.210 
there and that's what hawk but it looks
like<00:04:42.770> so<00:04:43.770> there's<00:04:43.950> a<00:04:44.010> side-by-side

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
like so there's a side-by-side

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.720 
like so there's a side-by-side
comparison<00:04:46.160> then<00:04:47.160> I'm<00:04:47.340> going<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.520> bring<00:04:47.670> you

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
comparison then I'm going to bring you

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.260 
comparison then I'm going to bring you
back<00:04:47.790> up<00:04:48.030> close<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:49.760> it's<00:04:50.760> going<00:04:50.910> to<00:04:50.970> take<00:04:51.030> off

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
back up close so it's going to take off

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.420 
back up close so it's going to take off
go<00:04:51.419> out<00:04:51.510> of<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:51.660> way<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:51.780> now<00:04:52.070> so<00:04:53.070> there<00:04:53.400> you

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
go out of the way for now so there you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.280 
go out of the way for now so there you
can<00:04:53.669> see<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.880> magnet<00:04:54.270> in<00:04:54.360> deca<00:04:54.570> forms<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
can see the magnet in deca forms and

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.380 
can see the magnet in deca forms and
then<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.250> has<00:04:56.370> kind<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.640> like<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.790> tail<00:04:57.150> thing

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
then it has kind of like a tail thing

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.360 
then it has kind of like a tail thing
kinda<00:04:57.960> like<00:04:57.990> some<00:04:58.230> water<00:04:58.500> monster<00:04:58.980> probably

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
kinda like some water monster probably

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.659 
kinda like some water monster probably
and<00:05:00.350> office<00:05:01.350> but<00:05:02.340> uh<00:05:02.390> looks<00:05:03.390> like<00:05:03.480> this<00:05:04.669> tale

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
and office but uh looks like this tale

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.730 
and office but uh looks like this tale
this<00:05:06.090> side<00:05:06.630> wing<00:05:06.840> gets<00:05:07.050> stuck<00:05:07.260> in<00:05:07.290> place<00:05:07.560> right

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
this side wing gets stuck in place right

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.430 
this side wing gets stuck in place right
here<00:05:07.910> kind<00:05:08.910> of<00:05:08.970> sucks<00:05:09.410> but<00:05:10.410> uh<00:05:10.490> yeah<00:05:11.490> not<00:05:11.850> bad

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
here kind of sucks but uh yeah not bad

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.720 
here kind of sucks but uh yeah not bad
so<00:05:13.440> let's<00:05:13.710> see<00:05:13.770> how<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:13.950> close<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.460> I<00:05:14.550> guess

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
so let's see how to close and I guess

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.080 
so let's see how to close and I guess
you<00:05:14.880> put<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.300> head<00:05:15.450> in<00:05:15.620> was<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.940> close<00:05:17.940> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
you put the head in was that close the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.810 
you put the head in was that close the
tail<00:05:18.330> like<00:05:18.600> Dora<00:05:19.200> Oscar<00:05:20.070> he<00:05:20.280> calls<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.520> like<00:05:20.580> da

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
tail like Dora Oscar he calls it like da

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.840 
tail like Dora Oscar he calls it like da
rack<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.300> took<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.260> link<00:05:22.440> first<00:05:22.560> probably<00:05:22.850> i'm

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
rack I took the link first probably i'm

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.880 
rack I took the link first probably i'm
gonna<00:05:24.000> try<00:05:24.060> to<00:05:24.120> get<00:05:24.360> with<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:24.479> wings<00:05:24.690> for<00:05:27.890> ya

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
gonna try to get with the wings for ya

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.590 
gonna try to get with the wings for ya
wings<00:05:29.160> first<00:05:30.080> no<00:05:31.080> maybe<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:32.360> don't<00:05:33.360> know<00:05:33.419> how<00:05:33.510> to

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
wings first no maybe I don't know how to

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.710 
wings first no maybe I don't know how to
do<00:05:33.690> this<00:05:34.040> tale<00:05:37.970> no<00:05:38.970> maybe<00:05:39.180> it<00:05:39.330> just<00:05:39.360> like<00:05:39.570> this

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
do this tale no maybe it just like this

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.680 
do this tale no maybe it just like this
I<00:05:39.870> don't<00:05:40.050> know<00:05:41.060> because<00:05:42.060> this<00:05:42.300> is<00:05:42.450> probably

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
I don't know because this is probably

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.620 
I don't know because this is probably
the<00:05:42.810> first<00:05:42.900> video<00:05:43.290> of<00:05:43.350> him<00:05:43.530> on<00:05:43.680> YouTube<00:05:44.190> also

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
so that means have to back and gun that

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.580 
so that means have to back and gun that
are<00:05:47.340> forcing<00:05:47.760> you<00:05:47.850> to<00:05:47.940> where<00:05:48.060> you<00:05:48.210> go<00:05:48.590> so

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
that's what it looks like in ball form

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.570 
that's what it looks like in ball form
it<00:05:51.060> has<00:05:51.120> these<00:05:51.570> two<00:05:51.900> things<00:05:52.140> right<00:05:52.350> here<00:05:52.580> kind

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580

DNA code on it that kind of makes me

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.420 
DNA code on it that kind of makes me
curious<00:06:14.390> because<00:06:15.390> otherwise<00:06:16.190> they'd<00:06:17.190> have<00:06:17.220> to
