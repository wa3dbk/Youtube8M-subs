00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.720
 my name is cyprien I'm 18 years old 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.679
 I live in Lille and I am of origin 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.769
 Indian and a few months ago I 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.470
 joined the group to adopt 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.789
 childhood struggling for that every 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:27.260
 adopted child having lost a father and a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.260
 mother always finds call nerves 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.120
 today the law is passed but she 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.660
 must be repealed in the name of the law 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.140
 the child and not the right to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.539
 the child 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.820
 all the children of the world must have 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.059
 the same as mine the one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.329
 to have been greeted by a dad and a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:00.629
 mom two years ago I went back in 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.940
 india to find my origins 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.530
 the head of the orphanage in 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 which I spent the last years 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.950
 of my life passed on to me the want of my 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.650
 biological mom she had vowed 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.030
 for me that I am happy with a 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.030
 father and mother 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.159
 I can say that in any 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.689
 family parent relationships and 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.880
 teens are not always 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.400
 evident 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.829
 I needed that moment of 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.950
 leaves both male and female 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.259
 effectively 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 at times I feel more need 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.000
 to go to my father for some 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:49.159
 subjects and to my mother for others because 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.159
 their sensitivity are different 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.390
 for me, my father and my mother are 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.030
 pillars in my life I found I 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.990
 the importance of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.990
 complementarity chest call is mayor 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.380
 what shocks me in this law is 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.840
 that the right to 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.620
 the child and not to the equilibrium of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.550
 the child a child is not a right 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.459
 Mr. President I do not criticize in 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.959
 no case love that by giving oneself two 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.920
 same-sex people 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.610
 but what I want to denounce today 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:37.390
 it's the fact that same-sex marriage 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.989
 in France would systematically give the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.640
 right to adoption 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.610
 you gentleman the president of the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.819
 republic president of all 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.100
 citizens on behalf of all children 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.100
 adopted 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:59.160
 have common sense think about balance 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.440
 children before interest adults 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.860
 listen to your people gathered on this day to 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.860
 Paris
