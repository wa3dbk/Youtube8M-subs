way I don't have to affect my water

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.779 
way I don't have to affect my water
system<00:00:53.879> inside<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.750> home<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:56.039> as<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
system inside my home and then as you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.630 
system inside my home and then as you
can<00:00:56.969> see<00:00:57.180> we've<00:00:57.420> hidden<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> behind

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
can see we've hidden this behind

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.819 
can see we've hidden this behind
planting<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.000> mend<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.109> for<00:01:01.260> cosmetic

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
planting which I mend just for cosmetic

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
planting which I mend just for cosmetic
reasons<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
reasons what you see here is a

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.840 
reasons what you see here is a
combination<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> brass<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.979> copper<00:01:05.159> fittings

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
combination of brass and copper fittings

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.600 
combination of brass and copper fittings
this<00:01:06.150> could<00:01:06.420> also<00:01:06.570> be<00:01:06.780> scheduled<00:01:07.560> ad<00:01:07.740> PVC

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
this could also be scheduled ad PVC

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.109 
this could also be scheduled ad PVC
which<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.200> white<00:01:10.619> PVC<00:01:11.159> because

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
which you don't see is white PVC because

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.630 
which you don't see is white PVC because
that<00:01:12.360> will<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.780> damaged<00:01:13.229> by<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> Sun<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.189> we

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that will be damaged by the Sun so we

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
that will be damaged by the Sun so we
don't<00:01:14.850> use<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.630> any<00:01:15.810> applications

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
don't use that for any applications

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.249 
don't use that for any applications
above-ground<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.180> other<00:01:18.330> benefit<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:18.990> this

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
above-ground the other benefit of this

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.370 
above-ground the other benefit of this
device<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.220> avoids<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> need<00:01:21.180> for

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
device is that it avoids the need for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.800 
device is that it avoids the need for
anti-siphon<00:01:22.380> valve<00:01:22.670> for<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> entire<00:01:24.150> system

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
anti-siphon valve for the entire system

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
anti-siphon valve for the entire system
and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:25.680> your<00:01:25.710> valves

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and then you can put your valves

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.039 
and then you can put your valves
underground<00:01:26.880> where<00:01:27.150> they're<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.450> visible

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
underground where they're not visible

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.010 
underground where they're not visible
and<00:01:28.290> they're<00:01:28.799> not<00:01:28.979> subject<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.820> frost<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
and they're not subject to frost and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
and they're not subject to frost and
things<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.329> also<00:01:33.890> enables<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
things like that so it also enables you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
things like that so it also enables you
to<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.369> worry<00:01:35.670> about<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> grade<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.140> for

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to not worry about what the grade is for

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.990 
to not worry about what the grade is for
your<00:01:37.590> property<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:38.400> you're<00:01:38.520> using<00:01:38.759> an

PVC is not supposed to be used above

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.479 
PVC is not supposed to be used above
ground<00:02:24.060> so<00:02:24.720> when<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:24.989> do<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.250> becomes

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
ground so when you do that it becomes

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.759 
ground so when you do that it becomes
brittle<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.450> over<00:02:27.690> time<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.200> very<00:02:28.379> easy<00:02:28.530> to

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
brittle and over time it's very easy to

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.490 
brittle and over time it's very easy to
crack<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.400> pipe<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.239> you<00:02:30.780> schedule<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.440> tea

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500

crack that pipe so you schedule a tea
when<00:02:31.769> doing<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:32.250> type<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.579> connection<00:02:33.180> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
when doing this type of connection the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.380 
when doing this type of connection the
other<00:02:34.049> thing<00:02:34.409> is<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.610> way<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:35.909> this

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
other thing is is that the way that this

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.930 
other thing is is that the way that this
prevents<00:02:37.049> water<00:02:37.349> from<00:02:37.769> siphoning<00:02:38.489> from<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
prevents water from siphoning from the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.839 
prevents water from siphoning from the

potable<00:02:42.569> water<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:43.170> through<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.159> here

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
potable water is through this right here

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.330 
potable water is through this right here
this<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.060> anti<00:02:45.540> siphon<00:02:46.049> device<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.739> this

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
this is the anti siphon device and this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.910 
this is the anti siphon device and this
allows<00:02:47.700> air<00:02:48.180> into<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.690> line<00:02:48.930> as<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> valve<00:02:49.680> is

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
allows air into the line as the valve is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.630 
allows air into the line as the valve is
shutting<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.549> when<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.359> air<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:52.640> allowed

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
shutting off when the air is allowed

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.420 
shutting off when the air is allowed
into<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.239> valve<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.500> fully<00:02:55.769> shut<00:02:56.129> down

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
into the valve this can fully shut down

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.520 
into the valve this can fully shut down
and<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.849> that<00:02:57.000> way<00:02:57.180> water<00:02:57.510> does<00:02:57.840> not<00:02:57.870> siphon

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
and in that way water does not siphon

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.649 
and in that way water does not siphon
back<00:02:58.769> into<00:02:59.220> your<00:02:59.370> home<00:02:59.579> potable<00:03:00.150> water<00:03:00.180> system

also<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.250> other<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.819> final<00:03:03.209> component<00:03:03.810> is

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
also the other the final component is

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.949 
also the other the final component is
that<00:03:04.290> installing<00:03:05.129> these<00:03:05.459> valves<00:03:06.120> one<00:03:06.690> needs

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
that installing these valves one needs

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.160 
that installing these valves one needs
to<00:03:07.230> install<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.159> valve<00:03:08.629> 6-inches<00:03:09.629> are<00:03:09.840> more

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
to install the valve 6-inches are more

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.280 
to install the valve 6-inches are more
higher<00:03:10.739> than<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:11.909> head<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.079> is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
higher than the head that this is

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.410 
higher than the head that this is
servicing<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.489> this<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.909> out<00:03:15.120> here

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
servicing so if this is out here

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.809
