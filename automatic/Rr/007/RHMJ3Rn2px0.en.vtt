00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.830
 these are the entrails of the psv bully 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.180
 the one that will ride in the super league 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.379
 formula 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.650
 and was supplied as a kit 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.769
 and is now being assembled on 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.929
 way to the final test in barcelona 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270
 the coming days we are a guest at 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.100
 finds that racing car motif in Belgium 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.810
 where Wim Coeckelberghs is in charge 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.160
 about the psv team 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.199
 We will keep our information first 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 body like the car 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.980
 so they were actually just 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 polly work and then the second is one 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.870
 prototype that pass that the show public 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.120
 built and tested by mila 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.800
 we went there and with me 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 very very very much straw between the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 taken in the garden 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.219
 also there you can get the plus and the minus 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.140
 see how they did it 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.200
 what is good what we do not like or 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.760
 we can possibly improve and yes 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.949
 shows we are so on the basis of one 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 bulletin board actually a the car actually 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.449
 start building and it looks like that 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.449
 out in the workplace 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.719
 your my neighbor is the one who goes 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.430
 test driving in the psv car 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.890
 he looks excited after his first 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.490
 introduction to the car 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.060
 750 horsepower be it a gap it cars 680 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.820
 weighs pounds 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.080
 Exclusive rider so will be on in the evening 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.140
 50 pounds come true when I transit 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.800
 so that is a very good ability 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.950
 weight ratio and the whole stem 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.650
 be quick on the key 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.580
 see when they passed as a test 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.010
 but i think we don't have too much 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.050
 have problems and what things can do 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.560
 learn to be able to ride enough laps 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.940
 but then it is already successful 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.470
 when they do it for your personal 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.170
 close if you get into seven of them after such a test 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.460
 feel good about it 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.530
 so maybe it could use some words 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.830
 with that pc car and him and me 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.650
 yes it's just look what i said 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.050
 that car is now so that's just one 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.270
 none very awkward and then all 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.960
 turns doing well and I have a 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.020
 good feeling 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.110
 afterwards then yes yes that is me too 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.780
 that happens the last few threads the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.900
 last screws and then the car goes 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.340
 in a huge truck on the way to 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.870
 Spain 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.090
 the truck that was taken over from 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.459
 the Williams Formula 1 team 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.440
 but the super league formula is whole 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.080
 other than the formula 1 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.880
 racing becomes more spectacular because the 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.580
 cars in principle 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.180
 much more daring to each other and so comes 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.209
 as it is often the exercise is to 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.070
 on the qualities of the driver the one 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.959
 with the best driver wind that is just that 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.550
 very simplistic thought that is very 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.019
 simple is that of course there is 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.820
 but it's like football 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.440
 it is the best team that is going to win and 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.640
 the team is obviously very sorry 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.570
 importance that there is a good color in the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.250
 is in the car 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.930
 but the technical staff is also whole 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.570
 important because they go together with 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.239
 the driver is actually the car 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.820
 adjust or make as it pleases him 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.470
 has or she if she is a female 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.550
 characters here is no that of course 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.519
 could also 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.230
 but who turned to a job and and the 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.080
 spirit is also 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.400
 in the sense of 10 must also find from 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.290
 each other because they have to come first 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.730
 each other go through the fire and that is 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.260
 important to get the right people and the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.220
 place correct characters together 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.220
 just like I play soccer 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.990
 [Laughter] 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.160
 the mechanics of the car look into each 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.160
 case to football
