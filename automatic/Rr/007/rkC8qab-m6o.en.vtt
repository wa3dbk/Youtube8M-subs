 it will be things not only of her site but of 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.870
 another one site 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.940
 so if you are interested then 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 keep watching the first three products 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.619
 I take your site to your Chamber of Skye 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.390
 same on the products on all everything i will leave 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 in infobox how do you know indian 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420
 cosmetics is famous for its 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.219
 miraculous properties 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.960
 handed down from generation to generation 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.969
 recipes of these miraculous creams 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 shampoo and many other remedies of course 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.200
 same as i love all natural 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.329
 I use mostly natural and I 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.399
 wanted to try indian cosmetics and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.410
 test it on yourself and first 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.850
 the product is herbal shampoo with me 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.469
 honey and vanilla 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.420
 he has a completely natural composition 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.180
 there are no harmful ones at all 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.789
 the ingredients its just a great smell 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.739
 I don't know whether it smells like vanilla or 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.480
 honey but he is very nice too 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.879
 there are such know eastern 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.949
 which notes I don't feel at all 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.840
 never in one of their shampoos 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.850
 the smell is just incredible again 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 I repeat I really liked that this 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.930
 shampoo foams just as well as 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.299
 shampoo from the company jason which for 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 volume is probably 2 natural shampoo 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.390
 which gives really such a good 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.150
 foam 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.040
 he washes my hair well he 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.259
 not at all confusing them even a little 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.310
 moisturizes a great shampoo just everything 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.290
 I can advise 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.509
 The next product is a face cream 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.540
 I recently ended my night cream 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.680
 so I decided to take the night cream he 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.220
 again herbal 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.869
 he was there on my one site had 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 such plastic is just enough 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.490
 All-natural packaging is not 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.049
 I will constantly repeat 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.640
 here is natural everywhere with him 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.890
 light enough consistency for 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.990
 night cream but despite this he 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.149
 very good and moisturizes at least 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.250
 On the whole not moistening is quite enough 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.259
 what is the most interesting in minutes your 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.119
 skin becomes completely matte I would 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.399
 even said that this cream can 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.619
 use and in the afternoon completely because 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.450
 face looks really matt but in 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 same time hydrated the only thing that 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.940
 you may not like either a little 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.210
 push it over for like me 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.160
 what did you like he smells like something masculine 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.410
 somehow may be a man's cologne 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.910
 or I do not know how some men's creams 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.830
 I would not say that it smells very 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.750
 strong besides very fast wind 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.000
 INDICATES a person probably about ten minutes 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.820
 exactly liked the method very cream with 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.470
 I take pleasure and by the way no 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.300
 acne lesions he also has not 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.040
 caused and the last product is the mind not 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.820
 is in such a small tin 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 jar, this facial mask with honey and 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:43.840
 my date there is clay 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:47.020
 mask she will now show you growth 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.150
 so here are the bags to the mask should be applied 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.490
 on face for about 15 minutes and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.590
 then of course wash everything with water and I 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.180
 probably kept a little smaller because 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.640
 that she is very fast to me 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.200
 dried up on my face I'm sure that you 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.850
 enjoy the effect after use 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.760
 this mask and the face becomes so 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.290
 know more velvety a little 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.810
 pores are narrowing and for me this 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.880
 really a bit unusual because 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.800
 that no mask restricts my pores here 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.570
 I have never seen such an effect 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.700
 this mask really does it 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.920
 I used four times and the result 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.500
 I am very pleased and by the way is also very 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.540
 pleasant smell so herbal a little 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.150
 sweetish and next products will be 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.360
 Of course the site Acher ordered 1 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.280
 giovanni mask is deep 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.330
 repair mask for damaged 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.860
 hair that is dyed damaged 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.200
 irons curling sharpen just for me 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.519
 the only thing they are not painted 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.090
 really great mask effect 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.500
 she reminded me a bit of a mask from the company 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.930
 natura siberica which is sea buckthorn 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.519
 the series is the only one I put on this mask 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.290
 for ten minutes like this and says 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.350
 somewhere for an hour and, accordingly, the result 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.870
 just excellent it turns out very 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.269
 I'm glad she ordered the following 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.880
 This shampoo from firm carries with this series 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.040
 red grapes i'm very much 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.209
 talked about these tools 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.690
 I didn't order the air conditioner because 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:10.330
 I still advise you to absolutely everyone 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.610
 those who have their hair dyed 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.950
 the air conditioner is just magical from precisely 7 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.019
 and red grapes are awesome aids 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.269
 I order probably already 5 times 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.250
 The next product is body lotion from 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.460
 firms dap step never tried 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.650
 earlier this company decided to try it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.210
 lotion with grapefruit and bergamot very 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.460
 such a light unobtrusive smell 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.220
 its citrus is light enough 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.860
 consistency absorbs very quickly 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.870
 so while I enjoy using it but I think 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.180
 that for the winter I do not have enough moisture 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.370
 will also tell you very much 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.940
 an interesting story I ordered myself so 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.870
 the same body lotion in films of the south smell 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.669
 vanilla and sweet orange and when i 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.490
 he opened the door and not even when his 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.860
 I opened the bowl in my hands so 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.169
 see something so strange there inside 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.390
 is open there it turns out 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.580
 mold imagine came me a cream 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.300
 For the body with the mold, I was just 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.040
 some horror shocked looked at the date 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.770
 Everything is fine with this but when I came 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.070
 spoiled decided to write about the herb 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.840
 I wrote in Russian, said that 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.400
 I got a spoiled product and 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.860
 Can you imagine me literally 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.080
 the next day responded apologized 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.810
 said that this will not happen again 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.120
 they also asked to send photos 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.490
 at the same time they said if you have me 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.830
 specially photographed everything to them 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.110
 sent by email and somewhere in the day 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.050
 they already returned the money to me 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.460
 satisfied with the quality of service all very 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.860
 quickly promptly 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.150
 just a million times they apologized to 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.130
 I was told that this is no longer 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.810
 so of course I repeat 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.820
 throw out just decided to leave for you 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.050
 I ordered myself such a remedy from 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.000
 firms gram green 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.760
 it is the same firm as washing powders 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.640
 which we showed it such a spray 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.320
 for different fabrics for blankets clothing 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.470
 generally can be used on any fabric 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.240
 i smell lavender and vanilia i 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.340
 I love the smell of lavender so I 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.990
 again I really liked this smell 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.729
 the only thing of course is very fast 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.310
 disappears so much I really liked 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.800
 also ordered a cream for eyes bring back 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.169
 This is a gel for the eyes of the firm forehead botany 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.690
 deprived of green tea that is not yet so 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.120
 it's cold I'll use gel during the day 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.910
 after all the cream of such 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.669
 heavy makeup is not on any cream well 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.710
 It lies down it is glass packaging 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.690
 not very convenient dispensers gives so much 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.820
 products as much as you need from him 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.850
 practically no smell he is completely 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.460
 imperceptible absorbed quickly in principle 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.070
 this is what i expected from this gel for 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.139
 eye and I liked them already active 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.150
 I use ordered osyp also here such 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.280
 Now the liquid crystal, I already have in 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.220
 solid form decided to try in liquid 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.110
 and besides, they have a very large 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.500
 a variety of different smells i myself 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.050
 I ordered with pomegranate and also I say 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.000
 Unfortunately I forgot to bring it in 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.880
 I really enjoyed it very much 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.949
 the unpleasant smell is exactly the same 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.320
 properties so who helps crystal 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:09.970
 just as you will only 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.460
 of course but it ends very quickly 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:15.039
 so I really liked it and everything 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.630
 I have nothing left I hope 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:18.760
 what did you like this video again 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.740
 I repeat all the links to all the products I 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.760
 I'll leave it in the infobox for now and until 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.440
 meeting in new videos 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.440
 hooked up a madhouse 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.500
 ringtones
