you can see gives off light which and
they<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.579> be

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
they don't think it's going to be

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.420 
they don't think it's going to be
anything<00:01:32.850> two<00:01:33.060> torches<00:01:33.450> but<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.979> could<00:01:35.340> be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
anything two torches but if could be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.399 
anything two torches but if could be
used<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> light<00:01:36.060> source<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> guest<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.140> as

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
used as a light source the guest so as

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
used as a light source the guest so as
you<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.680> its<00:01:37.799> primary<00:01:38.130> parent<00:01:38.490> secondary

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
you see its primary parent secondary

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
you see its primary parent secondary
power<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> then<00:01:39.659> also<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.170> see<00:01:40.470> these<00:01:40.650> I'm

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
power and then also you see these I'm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.380 
power and then also you see these I'm
not<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.400> sure<00:01:41.520> whether<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
not really sure whether this is like a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.389 
not really sure whether this is like a
new<00:01:42.600> leveling<00:01:43.079> sort<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> system<00:01:43.530> where<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
new leveling sort of system where you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.690 
new leveling sort of system where you
can<00:01:44.479> sad<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> diamond<00:01:46.229> click<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.979> me<00:01:47.280> what

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
can sad and a diamond click on me what

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490 
can sad and a diamond click on me what
you<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.329> click<00:01:48.479> done<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you want and then click done but it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.719 
you want and then click done but it
didn't<00:01:49.770> seem<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.890> work<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.250> moment<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.549> guess

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
didn't seem to work at moment I guess

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.039 
didn't seem to work at moment I guess
that's<00:01:50.880> why<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.329> would<00:01:51.479> work<00:01:51.600> in<00:01:51.720> progress<00:01:51.840> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that's why it would work in progress and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.440 
that's why it would work in progress and
why<00:01:52.229> Mojang<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.220> said<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.210> yet

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
why Mojang have said it's not yet

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
why Mojang have said it's not yet
completed<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> kind<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
completed because this is kind of the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.660 
completed because this is kind of the
block<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.369> they<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.810> noted<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.680> secret

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
block that they have noted as the secret

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.149 
block that they have noted as the secret
block<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.119> something<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.829> but<00:02:01.829> we'll

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
block or something like that but we'll

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
block or something like that but we'll
hopefully<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.329> updating<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> next

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
hopefully this will be updating the next

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.260 
hopefully this will be updating the next
snapshot<00:02:04.500> as<00:02:04.619> well<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> i'll<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> showing

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
that off again and try and work out what

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.029 
that off again and try and work out what
more<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.200> do<00:02:10.379> with<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:10.709> there's<00:02:10.890> anything
