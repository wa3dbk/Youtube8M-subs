00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.940 
and actually didn't will be like pretty
much<00:00:51.559> right<00:00:51.860> back<00:00:52.040> where<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:52.309> wasn't<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:53.590> so<00:00:54.590> I

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
much right back where I wasn't for so I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.830 
much right back where I wasn't for so I
had<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.309> basically<00:00:55.700> start<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:56.539> entire<00:00:56.780> thing

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
had to basically start the entire thing

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.470 
had to basically start the entire thing
over<00:00:57.320> with<00:00:57.610> experience<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.059> weapons<00:00:59.390> i

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
over with experience and the weapons i

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.270 
over with experience and the weapons i
already<00:00:59.809> had<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.789> thought<00:01:01.789> wait<00:01:02.210> usually

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.300 

yeah

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.709 

so<00:01:10.310> right<00:01:10.609> here<00:01:10.640> I'm<00:01:11.090> just<00:01:11.149> grabbing<00:01:11.390> with

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
so right here I'm just grabbing with

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.569 
so right here I'm just grabbing with
cash<00:01:13.359> because<00:01:14.359> cash<00:01:14.840> is<00:01:15.140> actually<00:01:15.469> very

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
cash because cash is actually very

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.240 
cash because cash is actually very
important<00:01:16.579> for<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:17.270> game<00:01:17.679> not<00:01:18.679> so<00:01:18.860> much<00:01:19.009> for

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
important for the game not so much for

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.260 
important for the game not so much for
