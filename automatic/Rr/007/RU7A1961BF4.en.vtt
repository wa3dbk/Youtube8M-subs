these<00:01:15.390> ends<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:15.960> pretty<00:01:16.259> simple<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:17.100> just

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
these ends really pretty simple you just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.580 
these ends really pretty simple you just
drill<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> half<00:01:17.880> inch<00:01:18.090> hole<00:01:18.509> these<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.409> half

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
drill a half inch hole these are half

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.700 
drill a half inch hole these are half
inch<00:01:19.799> woods<00:01:20.040> anchors<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.720> put<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> epoxy<00:01:22.320> on

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
inch woods anchors you put the epoxy on

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.710

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you have to put the washer and the nut

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
you have to put the washer and the nut
on<00:01:25.020> first<00:01:25.049> don't<00:01:25.740> make<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.100> mistake<00:01:26.280> don't

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
on first don't make that mistake don't

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
on first don't make that mistake don't
leave<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.119> off<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.350> actually<00:01:28.860> tap

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
leave that off and then you actually tap

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.219 
leave that off and then you actually tap
the<00:01:29.520> end<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> hammer<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> drive

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the end of this with a hammer and drive

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.410 
the end of this with a hammer and drive
this<00:01:31.530> into<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> concrete<00:01:32.310> much<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
this into the concrete much like you

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810 
this into the concrete much like you
would<00:01:33.450> drive<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> nail<00:01:34.140> into<00:01:34.409> wood<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> believe

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
would drive a nail into wood and believe

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.640 
would drive a nail into wood and believe
it<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.000> not<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.390> happens<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.170> tighten

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it or not what happens is you tighten

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.450 
it or not what happens is you tighten
the<00:01:37.740> nut<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.880> end<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.869> wedge<00:01:40.079> anchor<00:01:40.560> it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the nut this end of the wedge anchor it

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
the nut this end of the wedge anchor it
starts<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.119> pull<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> then

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
starts to pull this through and then

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.550 
starts to pull this through and then
this<00:01:44.189> expands<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.299> holds<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> anchor<00:01:46.439> in

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
this expands and holds the anchor in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.510 
this expands and holds the anchor in
place<00:01:46.700> takes<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.630> lot<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.649> pressure

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
place takes a lot of a lot of pressure

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
place takes a lot of a lot of pressure
or<00:01:50.880> tension<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.450> pull<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> wall

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
or tension to pull this out of the wall

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.850 
or tension to pull this out of the wall
believe<00:01:52.560> me<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> secondary<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:55.710> know

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
believe me but as a secondary you know

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.800 
believe me but as a secondary you know
defense<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.479> decks

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
defense you know because this decks

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.179 
defense you know because this decks
probably<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> weigh<00:01:58.500> about<00:01:58.590> 1,200

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
pounds so that means there's going to be

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.020 
pounds so that means there's going to be
only<00:02:00.689> three<00:02:01.290> four<00:02:01.799> four<00:02:02.369> hundred<00:02:02.610> pounds<00:02:02.969> on
