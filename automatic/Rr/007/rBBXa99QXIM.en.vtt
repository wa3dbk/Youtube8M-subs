00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.830
 the times to see with party songs 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.259
 de Haan 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:16.809
 he is in a state of upheaval, at least as far as his music is concerned 

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:19.989
 is currently releasing his first music video 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.399
 the 18-year-old plays and sings since the age of seven 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.539
 It is important to him to be authentic IGT but to which artists too 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.810
 he pays off 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.910
 So the question which often and honestly of role models I think 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.650
 Nothing 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.740
 because everyone should be a good role model for themselves and try that 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.300
 himself 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 m analyte to be a good role model 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.350
 but what should she not fix on the person what you always try 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.570
 to go to the rail 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.830
 there is no room for individuality 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.930
 Not every other artist sings that, he prefers to write his own 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.659
 own 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:01.389
 his songs play their own experiences and stories turn again therefore 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.019
 They are always about feelings and interpersonal relationships 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.550
 can enforce by Twins but songwriting not the songs 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.340
 develop spontaneously 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.820
 40 years 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.390
 his work 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.040
 but before that Michel 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.160
 and right at the moment where I actually do not think about anything else 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.520
 Should it work with other sales one or in the MaladiÃ¨re 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.600
 Then I tried to get a pencil because I have somewhere 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.430
 Write down what I'm thinking right now 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.300
 or it can, of course 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.290
 happen when I'm sitting at your bed or at home 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.520
 when I'm just traveling with friends 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.360
 no matter which situation it comes in the head and then I have to 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.870
 write down and 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.190
 that's how it works 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.110
 he also has the songs for his first album Kampf der GefÃ¼hle 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.090
 written 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.640
 He is currently working on his release together with his producer 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.010
 I want to give with my music 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.200
 TAS 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.460
 that's what my view two understands and that they are what I see 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.520
 to make a part of yourself 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.580
 and the music I follow 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.800
 should meet that as well a bit 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.219
 and I think I'm doing very well 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:13.909
 can be heard by Quenz on 16 September at the Mindelheim Old Town 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:14.459
 night 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 but we already have a little foretaste 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.689
 October 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.689
 an almost similar one 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.339
 were at it
