at<00:00:22.890> least<00:00:22.920> had<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> chance<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.730> practice

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
at least had a chance to practice

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720 
at least had a chance to practice
strumming<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.529> swap<00:00:26.009> him<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.550> one

strumming them and swap him from one
chord<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.149> other<00:00:31.640> what<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
chord to the other what I'm going to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
chord to the other what I'm going to
show<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.210> today<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.960> way<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> strumming

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
show you today is a way of strumming

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440 
show you today is a way of strumming
which<00:00:35.100> will<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.370> your<00:00:35.520> plane<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.030> much<00:00:36.239> more

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
which will make your plane so much more

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
which will make your plane so much more
interesting<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.530> here's<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> thing

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
interesting because here's the thing

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.000 
interesting because here's the thing
when<00:00:39.030> people<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.719> learn<00:00:39.989> guitar<00:00:40.380> usually

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
when people first learn guitar usually

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
when people first learn guitar usually
they<00:00:41.520> just<00:00:41.550> strum<00:00:42.030> language<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
they just strum language with the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:52.150 
they just strum language with the
plectrum<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.350> this

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.910 

and<00:00:52.910> that's<00:00:53.060> okay<00:00:53.450> but<00:00:53.510> after<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:53.960> while<00:00:54.200> you'll

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
and that's okay but after a while you'll

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.290 
and that's okay but after a while you'll
find<00:00:55.220> that<00:00:55.370> that<00:00:55.460> starts<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.940> sound<00:00:56.060> quite

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
find that that starts to sound quite

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.330 
find that that starts to sound quite
boring<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:57.080> what<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:57.500> want<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.739> do<00:00:57.920> is<00:00:57.950> give<00:00:58.220> you

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
boring so what I want to do is give you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.100 
boring so what I want to do is give you
a<00:00:58.400> more<00:00:58.640> interesting<00:00:59.059> strumming<00:00:59.720> pattern

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
a more interesting strumming pattern

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.840 
a more interesting strumming pattern
that<00:01:00.260> will<00:01:00.350> make<00:01:00.590> it<00:01:00.620> sound<00:01:01.100> alert<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:01.700> know<00:01:01.820> a

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
that will make it sound alert you know a

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.000 
that will make it sound alert you know a
lot<00:01:02.059> more<00:01:02.270> alive<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.140> also<00:01:03.739> i'm<00:01:03.830> going<00:01:03.950> to

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
lot more alive and also i'm going to

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.219 
lot more alive and also i'm going to
show<00:01:04.160> you<00:01:04.190> a<00:01:04.280> new<00:01:04.519> cord<00:01:04.879> today<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.750> G

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
show you a new cord today it's the G

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.160 
show you a new cord today it's the G
chord<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:06.800> so<00:01:07.550> this<00:01:07.940> strumming<00:01:08.300> pattern<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:09.140> a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
chord and so this strumming pattern is a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.440 
chord and so this strumming pattern is a
Down<00:01:09.470> stroke<00:01:10.150> an<00:01:11.150> upstroke<00:01:11.720> a<00:01:12.490> chop<00:01:13.490> I'll

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
Down stroke an upstroke a chop I'll

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.560 
Down stroke an upstroke a chop I'll
explain<00:01:14.630> that<00:01:14.900> in<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.229> minute<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.710> an<00:01:16.010> upstroke

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
explain that in a minute and an upstroke

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.820 
explain that in a minute and an upstroke
so<00:01:17.570> when<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:17.810> put<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.170> together<00:01:18.350> it<00:01:18.590> sounds

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
so when we put that together it sounds

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:33.120 
so when we put that together it sounds
like<00:01:18.979> this

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.830 

okay<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.550> can<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.330> gives<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.720> a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
okay and you can see that it gives it a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.080 
okay and you can see that it gives it a
more<00:01:36.020> interesting<00:01:36.470> sound<00:01:37.220> because<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.760> charm

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
more interesting sound because the charm

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.990 
more interesting sound because the charm
is<00:01:38.480> quite<00:01:39.110> percussive<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:40.310> me<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.670> sounds<00:01:40.940> a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
is quite percussive to me it sounds a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.310 
is quite percussive to me it sounds a
little<00:01:41.210> bit<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.480> drum<00:01:41.810> kit<00:01:41.840> when<00:01:42.200> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
little bit like a drum kit when the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.800 
little bit like a drum kit when the
drummer<00:01:42.530> hits<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.980> snare<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.610> especially<00:01:44.570> if

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
drummer hits the snare and especially if

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.630 
drummer hits the snare and especially if
you're<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.290> sort<00:01:45.410> of<00:01:45.530> person<00:01:45.590> that<00:01:45.980> might<00:01:46.430> be

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
you're the sort of person that might be

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.880 
you're the sort of person that might be
you<00:01:46.850> know<00:01:46.970> busking<00:01:47.480> on<00:01:47.570> your<00:01:47.780> own<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.260> play<00:01:48.770> an

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
you know busking on your own or play an

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.040 
you know busking on your own or play an
acoustic<00:01:49.130> guitar<00:01:49.760> then<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:50.600> really<00:01:50.930> going

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
acoustic guitar then it's really going

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.690 
acoustic guitar then it's really going
to<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:51.170> useful<00:01:51.440> for<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.979> get<00:01:52.160> used<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.610> this

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
to be useful for you to get used to this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.310 
to be useful for you to get used to this
strumming<00:01:53.090> pattern<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.840> they<00:01:53.900> will<00:01:54.050> make

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
strumming pattern and they will make

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.590 
strumming pattern and they will make
your<00:01:54.470> plane<00:01:54.650> sign<00:01:54.979> much<00:01:55.400> better<00:01:55.670> okay<00:01:56.540> so

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
your plane sign much better okay so

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.240 
your plane sign much better okay so
let's<00:01:56.990> begin<00:01:57.110> now<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.530> first<00:01:57.830> thing<00:01:58.010> I<00:01:58.160> want

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
let's begin now the first thing I want

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.100 
let's begin now the first thing I want
to<00:01:58.340> show<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.729> this<00:01:59.000> new<00:01:59.270> core<00:01:59.630> of<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.870> G

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
to show you is this new core of the G

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.840 
to show you is this new core of the G
chord<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.650> think<00:02:01.400> you'll<00:02:01.520> find<00:02:01.670> it

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
chord I think you'll find it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.550 
chord I think you'll find it
straightforward<00:02:02.150> it's<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.990> middle<00:02:03.140> finger

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
straightforward it's the middle finger

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.520 
straightforward it's the middle finger
on<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.710> sixth<00:02:04.100> string<00:02:04.130> at<00:02:04.370> fret<00:02:04.400> 3<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:06.259> first

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
on the sixth string at fret 3 the first

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.949 
on the sixth string at fret 3 the first
finger<00:02:06.770> on<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.280> fifth<00:02:07.580> string<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:08.179> fret<00:02:08.450> 2<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
finger on the fifth string of fret 2 and

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.580 
finger on the fifth string of fret 2 and
then<00:02:09.560> these<00:02:09.709> two<00:02:10.009> fingers<00:02:10.959> the<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.380> third

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
then these two fingers the the third

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.050 
then these two fingers the the third
finger<00:02:12.950> goes<00:02:13.100> on<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> second<00:02:13.730> string<00:02:13.850> at<00:02:14.030> fret

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
finger goes on the second string at fret

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.570 
finger goes on the second string at fret
3<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.200> little<00:02:15.470> finger<00:02:15.650> goes<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.190> next

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.970 
3 and the little finger goes right next
to<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.030> first<00:02:17.540> string<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:17.870> fret<00:02:17.900> 3<00:02:18.260> so

to it on the first string at fret 3 so
if<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.190> just<00:02:19.400> want<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.610> look<00:02:19.760> at<00:02:19.850> that<00:02:19.970> chord

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
if you just want to look at that chord

if you just want to look at that chord
diagram<00:02:20.720> next<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.110> me<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.530> clarify<00:02:22.010> what

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
diagram next to me just to clarify what

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.160 
diagram next to me just to clarify what
those<00:02:22.730> notes<00:02:23.000> are<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.540> you're<00:02:23.870> going<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.050> use

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
those notes are and you're going to use

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.030 
those notes are and you're going to use
the<00:02:24.320> plectrum<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.890> strum<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.550> strings

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the plectrum to strum all the strings

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.500 
the plectrum to strum all the strings
now<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.100> should<00:02:28.520> know<00:02:28.700> by<00:02:28.730> now<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.390> you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
now you should know by now if you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.850 
now you should know by now if you
remember<00:02:29.900> me<00:02:30.020> telling<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.410> in<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> last

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
remember me telling you in the last

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.860 
remember me telling you in the last
lesson<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.000> should<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.300> art<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.720> these

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
lesson that you should be art in these

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.570 
lesson that you should be art in these
fingers<00:02:33.320> up<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.739> there<00:02:33.860> should<00:02:34.040> be<00:02:34.130> plenty<00:02:34.280> of

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
fingers up and there should be plenty of

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.030 
fingers up and there should be plenty of
space<00:02:34.940> underneath<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.800> should

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
space underneath and you know you should

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.259 
space underneath and you know you should
be<00:02:37.130> holding<00:02:37.280> down<00:02:37.580> with<00:02:37.730> lots<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.000> pressure

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
be holding down with lots of pressure

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.630 
be holding down with lots of pressure
and<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.049> back<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.410> the<00:02:39.500> finger<00:02:39.980> shouldn't<00:02:40.489> be

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.850 
and the back of the finger shouldn't be
accidentally<00:02:41.480> touching<00:02:42.049> the<00:02:42.200> string<00:02:42.410> behind

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
accidentally touching the string behind

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.190 
accidentally touching the string behind
it<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.970> when<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.239> strum<00:02:44.540> all<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.930> all

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
it so that when you strum all the all

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
it so that when you strum all the all
the<00:02:45.230> notes<00:02:45.560> it<00:02:45.920> should<00:02:46.100> sound<00:02:46.250> like<00:02:46.370> this

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.450 

nice<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.240> clean<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.810> clear<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> need

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
nice and clean and clear so if you need

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.040 
nice and clean and clear so if you need
to<00:02:52.580> practice<00:02:52.760> that<00:02:53.030> for<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.390> second<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.930> know

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
to practice that for a second you know

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.840 
to practice that for a second you know
by<00:02:54.200> all<00:02:54.380> means<00:02:54.590> pause<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.160> video<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.700> just

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
by all means pause the video and just

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.120 
by all means pause the video and just
make<00:02:56.300> sure<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.540> got<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.840> right<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:57.830> this

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
make sure you got that right so this

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.220 
make sure you got that right so this
strumming<00:02:58.490> pattern<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.900> we're<00:03:00.050> going<00:03:00.140> to

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
strumming pattern so we're going to

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.630 
strumming pattern so we're going to
strum<00:03:00.440> downwards<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:02.540> then<00:03:02.750> upwards<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
strum downwards and then upwards and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.640 
strum downwards and then upwards and
then<00:03:04.820> we're<00:03:04.970> going<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.420> chop<00:03:05.780> right

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
then we're going to do this chop right

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.710 
then we're going to do this chop right
to<00:03:06.890> let<00:03:07.040> me<00:03:07.160> explain<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.790> now<00:03:08.000> now<00:03:08.420> what<00:03:08.600> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
to let me explain that now now what the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.080 
to let me explain that now now what the
chop<00:03:08.990> is<00:03:09.230> is<00:03:09.500> we're<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.490> use<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.820> palm

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
chop is is we're going to use the palm

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.600 
chop is is we're going to use the palm
of<00:03:11.120> our<00:03:11.480> hand<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:12.320> touch<00:03:12.680> all<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.310> strings

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
of our hand to touch all the strings

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.750 
of our hand to touch all the strings
like<00:03:13.880> this<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.810> what<00:03:14.960> happens<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.590> our<00:03:16.340> hand

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
like this and what happens is our hand

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760 
like this and what happens is our hand
comes<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.600> palm<00:03:17.840> touches<00:03:18.260> all<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.470> strings

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
comes the palm touches all the strings

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.220 
comes the palm touches all the strings
and<00:03:19.370> then<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.060> plectrum<00:03:20.480> follows<00:03:20.870> through

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
and then the plectrum follows through

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.140 
and then the plectrum follows through
but<00:03:21.590> because<00:03:22.220> we're<00:03:22.400> touching<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.850> strings

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
but because we're touching the strings

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.980 
but because we're touching the strings
all<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.540> notes<00:03:23.780> are<00:03:23.959> muted<00:03:24.700> but<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.959> you

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
all the notes are muted but that now you

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.600 
all the notes are muted but that now you
shouldn't<00:03:27.380> be<00:03:27.470> able<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.680> hear<00:03:27.860> any<00:03:28.040> notes<00:03:28.340> at

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
shouldn't be able to hear any notes at

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.120 
shouldn't be able to hear any notes at
all<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:29.000> you<00:03:29.120> can<00:03:29.300> hear<00:03:29.540> anything<00:03:30.070> like<00:03:31.070> that

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
all if you can hear anything like that

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.980 
all if you can hear anything like that
then<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.790> need<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.360> make<00:03:32.660> sure<00:03:32.690> you're

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
then you need to make sure you're

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.630 
then you need to make sure you're
holding<00:03:33.410> down<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:33.800> those<00:03:33.920> strings<00:03:34.310> with<00:03:34.490> more

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
holding down all those strings with more

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.060 
holding down all those strings with more
pressure<00:03:34.940> and<00:03:35.780> they<00:03:36.050> should<00:03:36.260> be<00:03:36.290> totally<00:03:36.620> dead

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
pressure and they should be totally dead

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.620 
pressure and they should be totally dead
so<00:03:40.070> that'll<00:03:40.430> take<00:03:40.640> a<00:03:40.670> little<00:03:40.850> bit<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.090> practice

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
so that'll take a little bit of practice

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.960 
so that'll take a little bit of practice
and<00:03:41.930> eventually<00:03:42.800> you<00:03:43.160> can<00:03:43.340> bring<00:03:43.580> your<00:03:43.730> hand

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and eventually you can bring your hand

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.290 
and eventually you can bring your hand
down<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:45.010> chop<00:03:46.010> all<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.490> one<00:03:46.670> motion<00:03:46.880> like

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
down and chop all in one motion like

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.710 
down and chop all in one motion like
that<00:03:50.709> okay<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.700> clarify<00:03:52.850> I'll<00:03:53.510> tell

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.330 
that okay so just to clarify I'll tell
you<00:03:53.840> again<00:03:54.050> make<00:03:54.380> sure<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.100> palm<00:03:55.310> of

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
you again make sure that the palm of

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.070 
you again make sure that the palm of
your<00:03:55.519> hand<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:56.000> laying<00:03:56.360> across<00:03:56.570> all<00:03:56.870> those

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
your hand is laying across all those

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.590 
your hand is laying across all those
strings<00:03:57.470> and<00:03:57.769> effectively<00:03:58.580> yo<00:03:59.000> killing<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
strings and effectively yo killing the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.120 
strings and effectively yo killing the
notes<00:03:59.950> okay<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.430> what<00:04:01.610> happens<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:03.130> you're

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
notes okay so what happens is you're

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.860 
notes okay so what happens is you're
going<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.280> practice<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.970> until<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:05.510> can<00:04:05.630> do<00:04:05.750> it

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
going to practice it until you can do it

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.780 
going to practice it until you can do it
like<00:04:06.019> that<00:04:06.050> nice<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.620> smooth<00:04:06.920> all<00:04:07.370> in<00:04:07.640> one

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
like that nice and smooth all in one

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.600 
like that nice and smooth all in one
motion<00:04:11.440> okay<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:12.500> that's<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:13.040> Chop<00:04:13.280> that's

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.520 
motion okay so that's the Chop that's
how<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:13.910> works<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.780> when<00:04:14.930> we<00:04:15.050> put<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.380> into

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
how it works so when we put that into

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.080 
how it works so when we put that into
the<00:04:15.739> strumming<00:04:16.100> pattern<00:04:16.519> we're<00:04:16.820> going<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.000> go

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
the strumming pattern we're going to go

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.999 
the strumming pattern we're going to go
down

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:43.129 

chop<00:04:21.009> and<00:04:21.220> then<00:04:21.669> up<00:04:21.820> again<00:04:22.470> sound<00:04:23.470> like<00:04:23.590> this

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.800 

ok<00:04:44.039> now<00:04:44.460> it's<00:04:44.759> easier<00:04:45.120> said<00:04:45.360> than<00:04:45.539> done<00:04:45.599> I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
ok now it's easier said than done I

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.749 
ok now it's easier said than done I
expect<00:04:46.710> that'll<00:04:46.949> take<00:04:47.219> you<00:04:47.310> quite<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.520> bit<00:04:47.669> of

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
expect that'll take you quite a bit of

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.790 
expect that'll take you quite a bit of
time<00:04:47.819> to<00:04:48.120> practice<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.599> I<00:04:48.990> mean<00:04:49.349> I<00:04:49.469> know<00:04:49.560> it

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
time to practice that I mean I know it

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.439 
time to practice that I mean I know it
takes<00:04:49.979> my<00:04:50.189> students<00:04:50.669> quite<00:04:50.849> a<00:04:50.879> while<00:04:51.150> before

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
takes my students quite a while before

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.390 
takes my students quite a while before
they<00:04:51.749> really<00:04:52.110> get<00:04:52.259> the<00:04:52.379> hang<00:04:52.529> of<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.219> that's

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
they really get the hang of it so that's

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.189 
they really get the hang of it so that's
brilliant<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:53.969> go<00:04:54.120> easy<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.569> yourself<00:04:54.990> that

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
brilliant so go easy on yourself that

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.510 
brilliant so go easy on yourself that
you<00:04:55.289> know<00:04:55.409> don't<00:04:55.710> don't<00:04:55.889> give<00:04:56.099> yourself<00:04:56.400> any

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
you know don't don't give yourself any

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.860 
you know don't don't give yourself any
pressure<00:04:56.909> to<00:04:57.180> be<00:04:57.270> able<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.479> play<00:04:57.599> that

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
pressure to be able to play that

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.929 
pressure to be able to play that
straightaway<00:04:58.499> be<00:04:59.279> patient<00:04:59.729> with<00:04:59.849> yourself
