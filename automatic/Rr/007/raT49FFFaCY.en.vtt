00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.080
 the theme is a crossover 2 titanium publishing houses and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.759
 today is an epic pompous zaruba comic 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 marvel against Odessa 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 learned about the existence of this comic I 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.559
 thought it must be something 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.600
 unreal cool but seeing the release date 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.699
 1996 decided not to read him not like 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.040
 I understand old comics for you 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.620
 classics and the works and the panache 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.420
 often plot them in oil but if i 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 already undertook to tell you about Kasavir 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.720
 and marvel and dc 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.580
 this comic bypass and i don't 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.830
 could after reading he leaves 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.720
 mixed feelings are kinda cool 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.930
 you just watched the alky 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.210
 superman but there is little but none 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.250
 let's keep in order remember the crossovers 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.110
 from the last issue the authors did not bother 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.970
 self explanations why characters 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.040
 different publishers are in the same 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.810
 the universe they wanted to show this one 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.549
 out daredevils together and just this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.619
 did immediately explain to us 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.540
 and that's because of this explanation suffers 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.390
 the plot is a good idea but 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.880
 implementation and so there is no it two 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.420
 entities that are very strong very 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.149
 hryvnia 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.859
 and yet they were brothers and between them enmity but 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.579
 fight in order to solve their 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.710
 disagreement 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.700
 they can not about what forces are equal and fight 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.710
 will last forever 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.899
 so they decide to push their heads together 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.930
 strongest representatives of the universes 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.790
 which they 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.190
 and say so the roof and how easy 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.350
 guess one has this universe 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.110
 and the second marvel, it was decided to hold 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.240
 11 fights a universe that holds more 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.190
 number of wins will not be touched and 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.979
 the universe that loses will 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.229
 destroyed and then we throw up 1 rotten 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.240
 tomato let's call it so the fact is that 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.410
 the winner is the one who is first 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 moving away from the enemy 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.210
 think not killed did not knock out a 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.350
 just immobilize that is seeing the name 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.179
 marvel against children 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.250
 I'm waiting to see the carnage between 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.320
 characters not to life and to death as 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.700
 say and you slip me the usual 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.130
 sparring pillow fights 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.260
 you seriously ok go on in order 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.209
 bring the heroes together the universe begin 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.190
 unite and at first the heroes are not 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.440
 understand what is happening but then in one 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.690
 wonderful moment realize everyone just 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.220
 It dawns on them as ordinary heroes 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.170
 people by the way people right away 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.670
 organize a tote and start 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.980
 to bet who will be the winner 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.140
 one way or another give battles were assigned 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.480
 the next argument against neymar 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.270
 catwoman vs electro flash 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.519

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.100
 silver surfer lantern 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.140
 captain marvel 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.390
 we now know him as shazam against 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.610
 torah batman vs captain america 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.459
 super fight against spiderman 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.519

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.600
 with 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.640
 moments starts to teleport to 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.010
 places of fights and here we are shoved rotten 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.440
 a tomato tightly scuffles terribly short 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.080
 well drawn and even all the characters 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.540
 Absolutely all numbers Samokhil both lead 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.220
 during the battle sincere dialogue Olya do not want 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.350
 fight with you we could be 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.540
 friends but we have for our sake 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.040
 universes yes i understand it is made to 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.140
 show all the drama 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.880
 and irony but do it with each 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.860
 pairs of characters and that's great 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.480
 triggered at home and Jubil who 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.640
 fall in love with each other and is equal 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.040
 winning and never hitting because we 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.860
 Remember you just need to immobilize 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.120
 he tied her up and won the battle of the century 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.160
 as written in the comic book 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.230
 not only is some fights so stupid 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.680
 end some altogether shown 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.390
 at god 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.519
 for example wolverine staple bit 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.709
 fist-fired they give in 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.810
 in a pair and then logan just gets up and 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.850
 smokes a cigar and we have to 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.769
 understand that he won and how do I know 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.900
 what were they doing maybe they were doing 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.880
 something else after which too many not 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.390
 against a cigarette as a result 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.130
 duel 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.170
 I will not tell the profession at the end 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.739
 release just show you the tabular yourself 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.750
 have a look 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.970
 but about some tell and worth 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.950
 for example blow and flash due recently 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.450
 the increased popularity of these characters 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.090
 very often began to compare 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.950
 so here flash is shown faster 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.489
 easily overtook mercury and sprinkled it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.579
 blows 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.380
 sorry for the spider he got superfight yes 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.960
 ok why one of the most popular 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.390
 Marvel heroes got a minor 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.310
 the hero of disi his goddamned but also not 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.050
 especially beat the superfight just flew in 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.940
 transformer immobilizes itself 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.520
 but 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.140
 and the rule of the fight supsa and hulk also not 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.870
 such a furnace as it could be 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.850
 ending fused theme of power is not disclosed here 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.010
 what i liked is gps fights 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.110
 batman they fought a few hours and 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.510
 understood that the one who will win 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.910
 will fall about exhaustion but again ending 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.640
 snow they fought in the sewer and here I am 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.410
 by washes it off with a stream of water and it starts 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.300
 sink fighters saves him 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.730
 and from that I was immobilized in the water 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.590
 he loses well let's move on to the junction 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.840
 and take something there conferred and 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.850
 united in one thereby connecting and 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.570
 heroes here we get the universe 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.090
 amalgam 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.730
 who was charged with wolverine black 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.160
 coffee jacobs superman super soldier and 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.950
 others also eye glued together recruiting 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.960
 interesting robby us jubili but long us 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.830
 admire them and give the brothers something 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.080
 there again in the collection 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.960
 sever everything back and decide to fight 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.480
 yourself and it seems to foreshadow the end to both 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.430
 universe heroes are aware of this and understanding 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.890
 that they cannot change anything 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.170
 taken day and prepare for death but 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.970
 here the brothers look at the cop and 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.669
 Batman in front of their eyes rushes 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.690
 their lives and they are disturbed by this 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.610
 stop it all 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.580
 roll it all back wipe hero 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.060
 the memory of the issue turned out to be negative 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.440
 the vein 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.300
 I generally try to talk about 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.790
 good comics are the ones i like 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.770
 me and most pleasant yes and you probably 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.810
 about good comics more interesting to listen 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.700
 but this comic means that the battle 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.919
 two comics universes merged this 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.020
 uniquely but as a historical fact he 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.730
 of value therefore learn about 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.919
 it does not hurt so and finally 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.230
 still say that I liked 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.180
 comic amusing love line jubilee 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.900
 Robin JB himself moved to work 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.180
 Daily Planet 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.580
 there was also a parker who went along 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.040
 claus is funny because first 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.840
 girl parker give the brand the very first 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.320
 see more in the issue of selling 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.870
 the spider 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.910
 So these Brand was too similar to 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.400
 Lois because of this spider came up with Mary 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.650
 Jane 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.199
 I was he was not like Superman 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.449
 rascal pit begins to glue the train and she 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.880

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.400
 raspberry verbal skirmish wolverine and 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.860
 This guy amused as well by 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.660
 In a big way , everything was still there a line with 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.699
 splinters that broke away from these 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.680
 brothers after the big bang and 2 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.780
 dudes who were busy with one of them 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.150
