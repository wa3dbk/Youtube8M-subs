00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.750
 talking to editorials jm tried to bring 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 another tutorial for you 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 and today I'll be teaching here the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.690
 improve the microphone quality of 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.690
 you 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.680
 Good. Come on, the first time you go there. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.269
 control panel of you my son 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.570
 here control panel setting 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.540
 windows 7 is here to start menu 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:01.580
 I think under the computer was 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.810
 on the controls explained goss you do not see 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.440
 in hardware and sounds 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:11.290
 I do not know how to say 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.290
 but it's not like that, joÃ£o vinson 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.259
 select a microphone and a microphone. 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.320
 you have the right button of 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.780
 property 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 the first flap you do not ground me 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.300
 the second is that option that had 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.840
 selected you take out 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.490
 is this not all that if you speak the voice you 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.490
 will go out on the streets that your mother 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:45.310
 here is the microphone sensitivity of 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.940
 you noticed how if one low 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.210
 and now the only little one is diminishing 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.140
 and not increasing and increases the yo 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.310
 sensitivity 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.070
 will increase and capture air in the voice 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.150
 There's something here in the microphone if you 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.150
 leave everything i do not know 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.920
 here are clean refinements in my 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.280
 I think the drive is out of date 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.519
 I know where it would disappear that correction 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.080
 room noise suppression I think 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.360
 It seems like these things if you want 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.440
 cultivate more fear that water that does not 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.440
 left nothing activated 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:35.630
 now you will come advanced 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.630
 your channel will be 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.270
 the channel 2 16 bits I think they will be 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.530
 cd quality and 6 change coloco 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.670
 studio quality 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.810
 beauty 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.989
 do not apply here 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.239
 if they want to increase the quality of 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.099
 You also see each other's audio 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.870
 thing properties levels all not without 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.000
 I just let my surround 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.819
 and intensity equalization 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.790
 Just leave these two here. 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.150
 in instant mode of the selected ones 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.450
 the advanced sme put quality 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.680
 studio also 24-bit places the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.680
 studio quality 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.660
 the other if you want to record and how 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.480
 voice of you before telling you now 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.030
 can read from one of them in the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.410
 you in the search bar puts a 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.330
 sound recorder and records the audio agents 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.850
 can record how you are now 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.730
 then do the setup and record 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.790
 new to see if there was a 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.860
 so ok if the manager is there 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.620
