00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 Hi guys here, it's a rematch again 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.030
 and today I have a really cool video 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.330
 very interesting that we talk 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.320
 Come on, I'll ask you. 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.640
 star you know that it's star 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.920
 this video I want to talk about it 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 that few comment and sometimes 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 realize 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 about the athletes who have star what 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.730
 after all star or is in my way 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.710
 understand this I usually say that the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.899
 star is a light that accompanies the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.649
 the different superstars 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.930
 the geniuses out of series but after all 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.430
 how to know if the guy has or does not have 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.670
 star 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.800
 This is really hard to figure out. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 but may be noticeable for some 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.809
 people with more vision and that is why 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.359
 I'm telling you to pay attention. 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.539
 the smallest details that happen with 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.150
 you daily that your trainings 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.100
 those people who stand out in their 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.790
 others naturally have the possibility 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 to have an accompanying star in your life 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.700
 if this is your case stay tuned and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.430
 let her act like you 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 asks the signs star 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.259
 it signals you to do things that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.020
 is not even thinking of doing and makes a 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.900
 time to another and everything goes right 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
 the star puts you unaware of the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.939
 right place at the right time 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.060
 the star makes you perform moves that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.759
 ever imagined doing and it works 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.399
 the star brings the ball to you always 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.290
 that there is a great opportunity to turn 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 the star puts the ball at her feet 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.240
 exactly at the right time 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.700
 even if you are within the area 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.360
 you in the clyster hidden in the midst of 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.490
 others 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.469
 the ball had thought it was exactly us 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.380
 your feet for you to do the goal 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.030

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.460
 many different 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.760
 I think but you have to take care of her otherwise 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.979
