 to fix namely patrice evra and 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:10.640
 then I take a white where mine 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 to marry eyebrows 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.569
 then I take from hendrix

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:29.689
 Go out for the mobile lie 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:32.239

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.200
 move up to make up the eyes 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.150
 to intensify I take one 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.870
 brown tone and would that again in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.870
 The eyelid and blind is light 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.540
 because this time i have a worse one 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.930
 I would like to have eye make-up 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.120
 newton as I'm real and give it up 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.910
 Unfortunately I forgot the eyeliner 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.630
 to catch up with that you see 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.570
 Of course, expensive eyelashes with one 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.950
 brown the planner sculptures of mine 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.200
 dearest with a lighter lipstick 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.660
 you can also accept it if 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.690
 you want to fill my lips now 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.240
 then everything dazzles 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.990
 so it's not too hard 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:34.040
 looks and then comes only one 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.610
 lipgloss over it and that's done 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.610
 with the lips 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.130
 in time, the glue is also on 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.730
 a little bit dried it does 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.980
 just stick a little bit and if so how 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.620
 which can also have pressed firmly 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.440
 we rather dried this way finished 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.479
 is squeezing with eyelash curler 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.970
 then we do not have one 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.690
 heavy feeling with the eyelashes and you 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.830
 are also stuck with your eyelashes 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.900
 pressed together 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.000
 then we can push again and 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.710
 finished is the mega I hope it has 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.580
