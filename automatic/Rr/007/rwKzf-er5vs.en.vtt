00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
walking right next to them in broad

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.179 
walking right next to them in broad
daylight<00:02:23.360> but<00:02:23.780> they<00:02:23.900> don't<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:24.349> you<00:02:24.530> even<00:02:24.950> on

daylight but they don't see you even on

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.710 
daylight but they don't see you even on
the<00:02:25.310> normal<00:02:25.610> difficulty<00:02:26.030> I'm<00:02:26.329> playing<00:02:26.569> on

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
the normal difficulty I'm playing on

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.680 
the normal difficulty I'm playing on
Spartan<00:02:27.319> gameplay<00:02:28.040> mode<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:29.360> keep<00:02:29.540> hugging

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
Spartan gameplay mode just keep hugging

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.509 
Spartan gameplay mode just keep hugging
that<00:02:30.019> wall<00:02:30.290> all<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.650> way<00:02:30.799> to<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.129> outside<00:02:31.250> of

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
that wall all the way to the outside of

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.789 
that wall all the way to the outside of
the<00:02:31.670> map<00:02:31.909> you<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.900> my<00:02:33.019> game<00:02:33.079> is<00:02:33.409> saving

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
the map you see that my game is saving

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.410 
the map you see that my game is saving
so<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:33.980> believe<00:02:34.310> there<00:02:34.489> is<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.640> checkpoint<00:02:34.940> here

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
so I believe there is a checkpoint here

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.259 
so I believe there is a checkpoint here
if<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.690> fail<00:02:36.110> just<00:02:36.379> walk<00:02:37.370> across<00:02:37.519> here<00:02:38.090> up

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
if you fail just walk across here up

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.020 
if you fail just walk across here up
onto<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.230> ladder<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.950> you're<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.879> be

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
onto this ladder and you're going to be

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.369 
onto this ladder and you're going to be
needing<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.569> go<00:02:41.659> into<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.930> control<00:02:42.349> room

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
needing to go into that control room

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.899 
needing to go into that control room
directly<00:02:43.010> in<00:02:43.069> front<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.340> me<00:02:43.459> there<00:02:43.670> will<00:02:43.879> be

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
directly in front of me there will be

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.970 
directly in front of me there will be
one<00:02:44.239> enemy<00:02:44.359> in<00:02:44.659> this<00:02:44.750> control<00:02:45.170> room<00:02:45.349> if<00:02:45.560> you've

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
one enemy in this control room if you've

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.800 
one enemy in this control room if you've
done<00:02:46.129> it<00:02:46.159> fast<00:02:46.519> enough<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.090> kept<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.599> pace

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
done it fast enough and kept the pace

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.380 
done it fast enough and kept the pace
with<00:02:48.019> me<00:02:48.230> he<00:02:48.769> will<00:02:48.920> be<00:02:49.040> turned<00:02:49.280> around<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.940> not

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
with me he will be turned around and not

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.539 
with me he will be turned around and not
paying<00:02:50.629> attention<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.019> you<00:02:51.230> flick<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.129> switch

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
paying attention to you flick the switch

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.119 
paying attention to you flick the switch
which<00:02:52.819> will<00:02:53.060> kill<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.780> -<00:02:54.170> wind<00:02:54.440> turbine<00:02:54.859> and

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
which will kill this - wind turbine and

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.920 
which will kill this - wind turbine and
then<00:02:55.700> go<00:02:55.970> through<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.299> wind<00:02:56.450> turbine<00:02:56.780> to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
then go through the wind turbine to

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.899 
then go through the wind turbine to
trigger<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.650> cinematic<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.430> get<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.819> the

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
trigger the cinematic and get to the

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.199 
trigger the cinematic and get to the
next<00:02:59.060> area<00:03:00.040> now<00:03:01.040> this<00:03:01.280> is<00:03:01.430> by<00:03:01.579> far<00:03:01.849> the<00:03:01.909> longest

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
next area now this is by far the longest

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.270 
next area now this is by far the longest
level<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.900> requires<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.769> play<00:03:04.129> it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
level that requires you to play it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.430 
level that requires you to play it
completely<00:03:04.819> stealthily<00:03:05.299> but<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.230> really

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
completely stealthily but it's really

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.800 
completely stealthily but it's really
not<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.889> bad<00:03:07.190> if<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:08.150> follow<00:03:08.480> along

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
not that bad if you just follow along

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.640

there's two enemies right there which
are<00:03:58.459> very<00:03:58.760> easily<00:03:59.060> avoided<00:03:59.750> if<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.409> just<00:04:00.590> stay

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
are very easily avoided if you just stay

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.500 
are very easily avoided if you just stay
along<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.220> left<00:04:01.400> side<00:04:01.579> here<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:02.120> stay

along the left side here and then stay
in<00:04:02.540> the<00:04:02.690> shadows<00:04:03.079> make<00:04:03.379> sure<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.680> stay<00:04:03.859> out<00:04:03.919> of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
in the shadows make sure you stay out of

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.430 
in the shadows make sure you stay out of
the<00:04:04.099> light<00:04:04.280> source<00:04:04.549> now<00:04:05.180> this<00:04:05.329> next<00:04:05.540> part<00:04:05.810> is<00:04:06.079> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
the light source now this next part is a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.330 
the light source now this next part is a
little<00:04:06.620> bit<00:04:06.829> tricky

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
little bit tricky

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.210 
little bit tricky
but<00:04:07.489> what<00:04:07.669> you<00:04:07.760> should<00:04:07.790> do<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.560> walk<00:04:09.560> forward

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
but what you should do is walk forward

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.219 
but what you should do is walk forward
as<00:04:10.459> fast<00:04:10.909> as<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.389> into<00:04:11.569> that<00:04:11.780> door<00:04:12.019> before

it starts opening and make sure you get

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.439 
it starts opening and make sure you get
behind<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:15.290> box<00:04:15.590> as<00:04:15.829> fast<00:04:16.099> as<00:04:16.400> possible<00:04:17.000> if

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
behind this box as fast as possible if

behind this box as fast as possible if
you're<00:04:17.599> not<00:04:17.630> fast<00:04:18.019> enough<00:04:18.229> sometimes<00:04:18.650> they

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
you're not fast enough sometimes they

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.979 
you're not fast enough sometimes they
will<00:04:19.190> see<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.609> these<00:04:20.150> guys<00:04:20.389> actually<00:04:20.659> got<00:04:20.930> a

will see you these guys actually got a
little<00:04:21.169> bit<00:04:21.409> suspicious<00:04:21.650> of<00:04:22.310> my<00:04:22.700> movement<00:04:23.270> but

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
little bit suspicious of my movement but

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.360 
little bit suspicious of my movement but
as<00:04:24.169> long<00:04:24.320> as<00:04:24.469> you<00:04:24.560> stay<00:04:24.800> here<00:04:25.070> they<00:04:25.250> won't
