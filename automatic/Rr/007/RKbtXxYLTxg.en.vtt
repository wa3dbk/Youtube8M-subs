growth get more videos up because that

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.600 
growth get more videos up because that
they<00:02:05.050> at<00:02:05.349> the<00:02:05.560> time<00:02:05.739> he<00:02:05.830> only<00:02:05.890> had<00:02:06.069> one<00:02:06.280> video

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.609 
they at the time he only had one video
up<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.239> waited<00:02:07.539> until<00:02:07.810> then<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.379> he<00:02:08.470> came

up so I waited until then and he came

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.139 
up so I waited until then and he came
back<00:02:08.679> around<00:02:09.099> so<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.369> guess<00:02:09.520> everything<00:02:09.789> works

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149
