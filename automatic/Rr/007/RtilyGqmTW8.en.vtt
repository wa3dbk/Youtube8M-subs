um<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.790> looked<00:02:06.329> nice<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> wore

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
um it looked nice but it kind of wore

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.619 
um it looked nice but it kind of wore
off<00:02:07.770> quick<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.280> then<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.789> used<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.239> second

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.119 
off quick and then I used it the second
day<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.929> applied<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.500> differently<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
day and I applied it differently and

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.010 
day and I applied it differently and

the first time I used the puff thing and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.900 
the first time I used the puff thing and
I<00:02:16.380> applicate<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.340> didn't

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I applicate it like that and I didn't

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.300 
I applicate it like that and I didn't
like<00:02:18.030> how<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.270> looked<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:19.680> know<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.830> liked

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.300 
and I was wearing it so using a brush is
definitely<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.690> way<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:24.990> with<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.440> and
