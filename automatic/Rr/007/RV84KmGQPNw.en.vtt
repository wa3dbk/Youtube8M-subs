00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
these pets have some articulation the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.330 
these pets have some articulation the
head<00:01:42.289> can<00:01:42.649> move<00:01:43.659> from<00:01:44.659> side<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:45.170> side<00:01:45.319> it<00:01:46.159> only

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
head can move from side to side it only

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.069 
head can move from side to side it only
goes<00:01:46.609> that<00:01:46.880> far<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.359> wouldn't<00:01:47.600> go<00:01:47.719> all<00:01:47.899> the<00:01:48.049> way

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
goes that far it wouldn't go all the way

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.190 
goes that far it wouldn't go all the way
around<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.840> legs<00:01:51.049> move

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.130 

I<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.469> see<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:56.000> articulation<00:01:56.960> is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
I can see that the articulation is

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.609 
I can see that the articulation is
actually<00:01:57.590> better<00:01:57.799> than<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.159> had<00:01:58.579> expected<00:01:59.619> and

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
actually better than I had expected and

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.580 
actually better than I had expected and
I'm<00:02:00.799> really<00:02:01.549> pleased<00:02:01.939> with<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:02.210> you<00:02:03.140> could<00:02:03.289> put

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
I'm really pleased with it you could put

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.539 
I'm really pleased with it you could put
the<00:02:04.310> puppy<00:02:04.640> in<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.850> sitting<00:02:05.210> position<00:02:06.310> turn<00:02:07.310> his

head or her head stand them obviously if

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.759 
head or her head stand them obviously if
you<00:02:12.980> wanted<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:14.569> puppy<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.050> be<00:02:15.140> standing<00:02:15.650> up

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
you wanted the puppy to be standing up

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.940 
you wanted the puppy to be standing up
against<00:02:16.250> something<00:02:16.459> that's<00:02:17.650> pretty<00:02:18.650> cute

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
against something that's pretty cute

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.660 
against something that's pretty cute
coconut<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.720> $28<00:02:23.720> excuse<00:02:24.530> me<00:02:24.709> coconut<00:02:25.220> oh<00:02:25.400> no

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
coconut is $28 excuse me coconut oh no

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.720 
coconut is $28 excuse me coconut oh no
that's<00:02:25.849> right<00:02:26.000> $28<00:02:27.190> which<00:02:28.190> is<00:02:28.340> kind<00:02:28.640> of

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
that's right $28 which is kind of

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.270 
that's right $28 which is kind of
expensive<00:02:29.420> but<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.290> think<00:02:30.380> with<00:02:30.980> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
expensive but I think with the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.559 
expensive but I think with the
articulation<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.920> fact<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.400> she's<00:02:35.360> so

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
articulation and the fact that she's so

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.400 
articulation and the fact that she's so
poseable<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.790> kind<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.209> at<00:02:38.540> least<00:02:38.750> justifies

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
poseable that kind of at least justifies

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.500 
poseable that kind of at least justifies
the<00:02:39.620> expense<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.099> little<00:02:40.400> bit<00:02:40.549> I'm<00:02:41.299> going<00:02:41.420> to

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
the expense a little bit I'm going to

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.470 
the expense a little bit I'm going to

show you some of the older pets this is
pepper<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:46.569> heard<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.959> new<00:02:47.989> pets<00:02:48.440> were

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
pepper I heard that the new pets were

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.020 
pepper I heard that the new pets were
smaller<00:02:50.530> or<00:02:51.530> excuse<00:02:51.769> me<00:02:51.829> larger<00:02:52.430> than<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.000> old

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
smaller or excuse me larger than the old

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.140 
smaller or excuse me larger than the old
pets<00:02:53.480> but<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.170> don't<00:02:55.069> have<00:02:55.280> any<00:02:55.579> I<00:02:55.790> don't<00:02:55.940> have

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
pets but I don't have any I don't have

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.059 
pets but I don't have any I don't have
an<00:02:56.239> old<00:02:56.420> coconut<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.230> he<00:02:57.380> may<00:02:57.530> actually<00:02:57.709> be

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
an old coconut so he may actually be

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.059 
an old coconut so he may actually be
bigger<00:02:58.310> than<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.670> old<00:02:58.700> coconut<00:02:59.290> but<00:03:00.290> overall

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
bigger than the old coconut but overall

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.129 
bigger than the old coconut but overall
skill<00:03:01.489> he's<00:03:01.819> pretty<00:03:02.120> similar<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:03.560> pepper<00:03:05.139> this

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
skill he's pretty similar to pepper this

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.809 
skill he's pretty similar to pepper this
is<00:03:06.319> honey<00:03:06.620> which<00:03:06.950> is<00:03:06.980> an<00:03:07.250> even<00:03:07.400> older<00:03:07.910> pet<00:03:09.819> and

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
is honey which is an even older pet and

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.879 
is honey which is an even older pet and
again<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.359> can<00:03:11.540> see<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.900> scale<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.709> two

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
again you can see the scale on the two

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:17.250 
again you can see the scale on the two
of<00:03:13.010> these<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:13.549> really<00:03:14.239> all<00:03:14.359> that<00:03:14.540> different

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.920 

this<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.440> also<00:03:18.650> hard<00:03:19.069> body<00:03:19.420> so<00:03:20.420> it's<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.720> pepper

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
this is also hard body so it's a pepper

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.870 
this is also hard body so it's a pepper
hard<00:03:21.380> body<00:03:21.650> underneath<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.310> soft<00:03:22.579> fur

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
hard body underneath the soft fur

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.870 
hard body underneath the soft fur
there's<00:03:23.450> no<00:03:23.690> articulation<00:03:24.620> at<00:03:24.769> all<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.280> pepper

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
there's no articulation at all in pepper

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.259 
there's no articulation at all in pepper
or<00:03:26.150> honey<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> do<00:03:28.069> think<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.489> articulation

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
or honey so I do think the articulation

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.960 
or honey so I do think the articulation
is<00:03:29.600> quite<00:03:30.109> an<00:03:30.260> improvement<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.980> don't<00:03:31.819> remember

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
is quite an improvement I don't remember

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.960 
is quite an improvement I don't remember
what<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.329> price<00:03:32.600> was<00:03:32.959> on<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.560> old<00:03:33.739> pets<00:03:34.190> but

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
what the price was on the old pets but

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.289 
what the price was on the old pets but
definitely<00:03:35.540> there<00:03:35.720> has<00:03:35.959> been<00:03:36.260> an<00:03:36.440> increase<00:03:37.010> in

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
definitely there has been an increase in

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.240 
definitely there has been an increase in
the<00:03:38.299> price<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.870> lot<00:03:39.139> of<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.530> target<00:03:40.130> age

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
the price but a lot of the target age

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.210 
the price but a lot of the target age
girls<00:03:40.959> seem<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:41.989> really<00:03:42.319> be<00:03:42.470> interested<00:03:43.099> in
