00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
different block likes and it'll make it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.120 
different block likes and it'll make it
steel<00:01:11.670> drum<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.040> make<00:01:14.040> he

make another one on this side first off
we're<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> start<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.200> eight

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
we're going to start off with eight

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.380 
we're going to start off with eight
repeaters<00:01:33.170> each<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> space<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.950> between

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
repeaters each with a space in between

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.080 
repeaters each with a space in between
them

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.080 

I<00:01:42.320> may<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.350> put<00:01:43.710> redstone<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.490> each<00:01:44.729> side<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I may I put redstone on each side of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.849 
I may I put redstone on each side of
them<00:01:45.359> connecting<00:01:46.229> them<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.530> together<00:01:51.859> and

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:52.859 
them connecting them all together and

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.719 
them connecting them all together and
then<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.609> to<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:54.000> input

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
then it's going to go out to an input

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.940 
then it's going to go out to an input
from<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.569> have<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.079> button

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
from there you're going to have a button

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440 
from there you're going to have a button
or<00:01:59.189> pressure<00:01:59.520> plate<00:01:59.819> or<00:02:00.000> whatever<00:02:00.209> you<00:02:00.329> guys

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
or pressure plate or whatever you guys

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.559 
or pressure plate or whatever you guys
need<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.810> use<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.350> power<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.209> this<00:02:03.209> scenario

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
need to use to power this this scenario

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.309 
need to use to power this this scenario
and<00:02:03.719> use<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> button<00:02:05.149> see<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.209> the<00:02:06.509> connection

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
and use a button see as the connection

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.660 
and use a button see as the connection
goes<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.859> line<00:02:08.039> here<00:02:10.310> all<00:02:11.310> right<00:02:11.430> from

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
goes down the line here all right from

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.190 
goes down the line here all right from
there<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:12.000> guys<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> connect<00:02:12.810> these<00:02:12.989> out

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
there you guys want to connect these out

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.630 
there you guys want to connect these out
side<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:17.190> go<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:17.489> note<00:02:17.700> blocks
