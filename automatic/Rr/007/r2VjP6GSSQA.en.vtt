 Waterfall soldier morale 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.380
 It takes a step forward but it is a momentary return 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:10.000
 There is also this mini-program award, and when you press this mini-program button 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.000
 It's like the TV I 'm doing right now, so I 'm going to move and say this and press 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.640
 It looks like this 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.620

 That's why the picture comes out 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.269
 You can see doing this 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.190
 I in such Fu 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:54.590
 It is this, but the neighborhood 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.470
 It was avasi genie jet, but all the water in the pond had been removed 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:03.150
 Such Fu in to 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:05.960
 Until now, I'd had a Toka Toka day eyes Come pretty muddy here to Fu say 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.080
 The water was draining while scooping 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.240
 There is such a thing in China 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.480
 What with this 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.430
 Morning assembly 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.359
 When I approached like this 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.359
 That what is on 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.490
 It is a turtle 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.490
 Ujauja is so turtle 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:30.650
 I told you that turtles 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:33.370
 We are doing this all entered bottle in when changing the water of the pond in the place of the orange 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.370
 You put in 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.040
 You can see the picture on the big screen like this 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.660
 I'm just connecting to the camera, so I'm going to use usb memory or sd card 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.860
 I can also see it 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.460
 But I will not connected turtle is directly now 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.460
 Such feeling 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.040
 In I'd had even this kind of voice I love where I went to grandma in the wind say selfish 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.449
 If you ask 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.610
 It seems that all love is dead 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.289
 To in sludge 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.289
 I guess water has become dirty in 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:12.320
 So in the end two minutes voice is dead, so I have to change water so all love is 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:15.009
 It seems to have buried in the shrine of the soil Kedoe 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.340
 As only a ska eyes as a ball type 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.560
 I'm writing in the water now 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.139
 Hey If you do not give in place of fast water 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.669
 These guys are dead , if you're like this 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:32.230
 If you look at the picture on this big screen like this, the reaction is slow 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:38.700
 Slightly more than a PC 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:40.500
 And a little exposed vomiting in but it is do not is slow cartilage other videos 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.990
 I hope you feel like this 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.740
 It has become a little knitting 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:51.699
 It is the sound of the speaker 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.830
 So far the noise of Biz is so bad until you see it on analog TV until the boom 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:58.690
 I do not feel particularly 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:01.300
 Commonly found are minute but probably will do different evident if is wearing or the calibration of the speakers in this 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.930
 Analog TV 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:11.440
 It feels like it does not change at all 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:18.360
 I finally're talking in the visited port and the mouth is a little there Tan also the Rutteyuu shift 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.360
 I've shifted slightly and try to put the feel good deviated slightly Toka movement of the mouth, etc. 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.200
 I have a little deviation 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:32.840
 Since only a much Tteyuu if you look at with care 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:37.810
 Well maybe someone who just cares will bother 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:41.550
 Well, that's the extent I usually see 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.400
 I 'm not sure I'm not sure but I know people can understand 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.400
 It is feeling 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.620
 regza 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:55.070
 37 z こ う い う like this 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.070
 I occupy the room and behind it 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.610
 Aunt got weak 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.300
 The times change 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.889
 Also this way when the 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.440
 Such a thing has arrived 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:13.070
 It was to say 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.070
 Well then 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:16.480
 Say'm destruction TV 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.380
 About this 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:25.220
 21 b The Board now also Who's it this many years 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:30.440
 If you think that it will be used carefully when you use it 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:33.430
 Even the first 26 inch TV or so will normally complain about 50,000 in the June period 

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:36.670
 4 or frame nurses thin does not go to pieces 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:40.650
 You can buy for 30,000 without the recording function 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:44.129
 If you use it for a long time, the recording function is good. 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:49.460
 If I don't have the recording function, I can't see it and I 'm sitting 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:51.050
 I think after all to buy something after all Marue's Gavel is another 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.969
 This 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.460
 I think that I want to use it carefully 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:57.030
 Not say that 

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:02.570
 that's all 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:02.570
 The web is led by Zar 37 z 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.510
 aug24 

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:10.020
 Will not come after one month 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.020
 goodbye 

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.399
