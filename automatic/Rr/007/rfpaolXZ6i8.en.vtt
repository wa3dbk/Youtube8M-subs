00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone in the end there is one friend 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.710
 who did something from the tractor to the reserve then 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.190
 mobile tires and it turned out very 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.160
 interesting results i remember 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.689
 that the strider showed himself very badly 

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:17.230
 very bad cut and it is very much them 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.400
 tied here in this rubber 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 and so when I got a strider 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.830
 of course I really wanted to 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.819
 conduct the same train 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.149
 he is not that I just want to protect 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.909
 strider and absolutely do not know how he himself 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.289
 will lead well just as they say one is better 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.490
 time to try than to see 100 times 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.210
 in his that is this guy he compared a 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.170
 second knife for comparison he took with 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.140
 little fingers 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 military well I will take my pair mile 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.010
 I think it will be 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.470
 with about the same 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.410
 well let's see 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.060
 although slashing strider 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.060
 it had a tale m points 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.040
 that is, among he is quite atonen eve 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.150
 voice point is quite big 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.030
 here and see how it cuts cleanly from 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 the boxes 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
 just try it 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 pleased not easy but he cuts 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.720
 yes of course felt very strongly 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 resistance 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.620
 by the way this tire has a copper kurt 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.300
 inside that is not easy 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 some kind of kapron court perfect poor 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.440
 getting a knife 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 except at least to do something 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.010
 very well kept coating or is it 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.889
 slightly stained foundation 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:16.379
 such are glitter media capital straight 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.379
 here to cover that knife 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.999
 throw the other side 

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:28.149
 in parliament 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.719
 always of course not 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.719
 from heaven and earth to enter into composition 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.389
 with psv 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.049
 and confidentially to a long cut 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.429
 strider and it seemed to me that 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.519
 document it is less common 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.959
 compote I would just pierce a tire 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.819
 in pairs or just 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.199
 i don't know it is denied 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.119
 just distributed it 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.119
 in one fell swoop 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.209
 now i'm in my own words 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.529
 eyes 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.529
 convinced that of course 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:17.829
 rezo strider 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.989
 can not be compared with such 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.489
 knives as a spider militia 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.120
 but in the circle of the side, I believe that this is already 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.029
 completely different class another 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.759
 purpose 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.509
 and well, then there is a very limited trust. 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.839
 can not be judged by the whole knife only 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.779
 based on one such test 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 Well, of course I did for myself 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:42.769
 photo sure you already saw 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.359
 as far as it was 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.529
 rub 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.099
 how strong was the contrast between cutting 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.539
 with a tractor and 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:51.699
 options 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.509
 thank you all for watching bye 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.939
 bye Bye
