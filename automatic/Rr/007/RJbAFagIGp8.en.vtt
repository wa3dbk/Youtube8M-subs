00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
company which is what I was told at

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.030 
company which is what I was told at
least<00:04:21.690> here<00:04:21.870> in<00:04:21.960> the<00:04:22.049> United<00:04:22.320> States<00:04:22.380> I'm<00:04:22.919> not

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
least here in the United States I'm not

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.610 
least here in the United States I'm not
sure<00:04:23.220> if<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.370> can<00:04:23.400> get<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.700> anywhere<00:04:23.940> else<00:04:24.090> but

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
sure if you can get it anywhere else but

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.320 
sure if you can get it anywhere else but
so<00:04:25.620> I've<00:04:26.010> harshed<00:04:26.610> part<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.060> reason

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
so I've harshed part of the reason

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330 
so I've harshed part of the reason
was<00:04:27.509> because<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.169> I<00:04:28.199> also<00:04:28.590> wanted<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.189> get

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
was because of that I also wanted to get

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.999 
was because of that I also wanted to get
the<00:04:29.490> Chanel<00:04:29.789> because<00:04:29.970> ironically<00:04:30.930> i<00:04:31.439> could

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
the Chanel because ironically i could

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.700 
the Chanel because ironically i could
not<00:04:32.189> get<00:04:32.370> my<00:04:32.490> hands<00:04:32.939> on<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.659> EPI<00:04:34.229> Cytron<00:04:34.650> card

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
not get my hands on the EPI Cytron card

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.640 
not get my hands on the EPI Cytron card
holder<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.580> i<00:04:36.449> bought<00:04:36.659> this<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.409> then<00:04:37.620> I

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
holder and i bought this and then I

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.070 
holder and i bought this and then I
think<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:39.599> weekend<00:04:40.219> after<00:04:41.219> I<00:04:41.639> received<00:04:42.509> this

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
think the weekend after I received this

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.890 
think the weekend after I received this
is<00:04:43.409> when<00:04:44.219> I<00:04:44.250> actually<00:04:44.669> went<00:04:45.539> on<00:04:45.659> a<00:04:45.719> vacation

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
is when I actually went on a vacation

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.830 
is when I actually went on a vacation
and<00:04:46.500> I<00:04:46.590> went<00:04:46.770> to<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.490> went<00:04:47.849> to<00:04:48.090> a<00:04:48.210> louboutin

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
and I went to I went to a louboutin

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.659 
and I went to I went to a louboutin
store<00:04:49.020> and<00:04:49.349> they<00:04:49.740> actually<00:04:49.860> had<00:04:50.039> it<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.370> stock

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
store and they actually had it in stock

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.080 
store and they actually had it in stock
so<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:52.050> was<00:04:52.800> just<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.159> wow<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> can't<00:04:54.030> believe

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
so I was just like wow I can't believe

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.610 
so I was just like wow I can't believe
that<00:04:54.449> they<00:04:54.569> actually<00:04:54.689> have<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.289> of<00:04:55.379> course

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
that they actually have it and of course

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.200 
that they actually have it and of course
I<00:04:55.740> had<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.889> get<00:04:56.129> it<00:04:56.159> since<00:04:56.520> there<00:04:56.789> was<00:04:56.939> such<00:04:57.180> a

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
I had to get it since there was such a

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.730 
I had to get it since there was such a
long<00:04:57.539> a<00:04:59.210> time<00:05:00.210> period<00:05:00.479> of<00:05:00.659> me<00:05:00.840> wanting<00:05:01.319> it<00:05:01.469> I

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
long a time period of me wanting it I

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.749 
long a time period of me wanting it I
guess<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:02.400> just<00:05:02.550> what<00:05:02.819> made<00:05:02.969> me<00:05:03.090> decide<00:05:03.120> to

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 
guess that's just what made me decide to

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.879 
guess that's just what made me decide to
get<00:05:05.759> both<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.360> don't<00:05:06.599> see<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:06.870> as<00:05:07.050> unnecessary<00:05:07.349> I

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
get both I don't see it as unnecessary I

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.830 
get both I don't see it as unnecessary I
use<00:05:08.610> each<00:05:08.909> one<00:05:08.940> for<00:05:09.719> different<00:05:10.680> purposes<00:05:10.800> and

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
use each one for different purposes and

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.219 
use each one for different purposes and
I<00:05:12.840> love<00:05:13.469> both<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.710> them<00:05:13.860> equally<00:05:15.199> although<00:05:16.199> I
