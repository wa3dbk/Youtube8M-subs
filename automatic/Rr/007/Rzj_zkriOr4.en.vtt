00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hey this is Jeff sheets you know in the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.860 
hey this is Jeff sheets you know in the
last<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.880> we<00:00:06.149> talked<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.450> little<00:00:06.569> bit<00:00:06.690> about

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
last video we talked a little bit about

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.470 
last video we talked a little bit about
going<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.680> our<00:00:07.770> F<00:00:07.980> sharp<00:00:08.280> note<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.850> transition

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
going to our F sharp note to transition

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.029 
going to our F sharp note to transition
from<00:00:09.510> our<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:10.080> chord<00:00:10.320> n<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:11.340> our<00:00:11.459> four<00:00:11.699> chord<00:00:12.000> D

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
from our one chord n to our four chord D

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.039 
from our one chord n to our four chord D
900d<00:00:14.039> and<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.940> f-sharp<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.539> actually<00:00:15.869> the

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
900d and that f-sharp is actually the

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.279 
900d and that f-sharp is actually the
third<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.710> D<00:00:17.070> which<00:00:17.850> makes<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.270> work<00:00:18.509> but<00:00:19.140> it's

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
third of D which makes it work but it's

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.810 
third of D which makes it work but it's
not<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.830> found<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.220> our<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.550> minor

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
not actually found in our a minor

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.720 
not actually found in our a minor
pentatonic<00:00:21.300> scale<00:00:21.929> we<00:00:22.349> talked<00:00:22.589> about<00:00:22.859> how<00:00:23.099> if

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
pentatonic scale we talked about how if

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.329 
pentatonic scale we talked about how if
I<00:00:23.939> add<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.660> f-sharp<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.829> minor

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
I add the f-sharp to the a minor

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.939 
I add the f-sharp to the a minor
pentatonic<00:00:26.759> scale<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:28.169> moves<00:00:28.409> me<00:00:28.529> really

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
pentatonic scale it moves me really

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.640 
pentatonic scale it moves me really
close<00:00:29.159> to<00:00:29.339> the<00:00:29.369> Dorian<00:00:29.939> scale<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.079> add<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
close to the Dorian scale if I add the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410 
close to the Dorian scale if I add the
other<00:00:31.890> note<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.700> talked<00:00:32.910> about<00:00:33.060> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
other note that we talked about the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.440 
other note that we talked about the
beano<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.950> actually<00:00:35.340> gives<00:00:35.460> me<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> Dorian

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
beano that actually gives me the Dorian

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.150 
beano that actually gives me the Dorian
scale<00:00:38.690> hey<00:00:39.690> Dorian<00:00:40.170> basically<00:00:40.710> based<00:00:40.920> off<00:00:41.130> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
scale hey Dorian basically based off of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
scale hey Dorian basically based off of
a<00:00:43.790> sharp<00:00:49.580> that's<00:00:50.580> our<00:00:50.760> Dorian<00:00:51.240> scale<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.110> we

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a sharp that's our Dorian scale so we

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
a sharp that's our Dorian scale so we
can<00:00:52.380> play<00:00:52.590> Dorian<00:00:53.490> over<00:00:53.820> over<00:00:54.300> various<00:00:54.720> blues

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
can play Dorian over over various blues

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.780 
can play Dorian over over various blues
progressions<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.100> want<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> stretch<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
progressions if we want to stretch out a

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.240 
progressions if we want to stretch out a
little<00:00:56.880> bit<00:00:57.150> so<00:00:58.110> today<00:00:58.890> we're<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.130> look

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
little bit so today we're going to look

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.180 
little bit so today we're going to look
at<00:00:59.400> a<00:00:59.610> lick<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.420> actually<00:01:00.870> uses<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.800> other

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
at a lick that actually uses that other

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.069 
at a lick that actually uses that other
note<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:04.430> to<00:01:05.430> create<00:01:05.700> sort<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.479> very

note the be to create sort of a very
kind<00:01:07.649> of<00:01:07.829> feeling<00:01:08.249> lick<00:01:08.579> when<00:01:09.149> we<00:01:09.179> play<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
kind of feeling lick when we play that

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
kind of feeling lick when we play that
note<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.020> B<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> either<00:01:10.499> the<00:01:10.649> second<00:01:11.340> or<00:01:11.399> it's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
note the B is either the second or it's

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.260 
note the B is either the second or it's
also<00:01:12.329> called<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.719> ninth<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.289> can<00:01:13.499> we<00:01:13.679> do<00:01:14.270> we

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
also called the ninth right can we do we

ninth of it tends to make things you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.709 
ninth of it tends to make things you
know<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.600> floaty<00:01:22.409> feeling<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:23.249> a

a seven at the beach it's been a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.809 
a seven at the beach it's been a
dominant<00:01:36.270> ninth<00:01:36.569> if<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.859> go<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.249> four<00:01:38.460> chord

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
dominant ninth if I go to the four chord

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.139 
dominant ninth if I go to the four chord
right<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.359> rd<00:01:39.950> 929<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.429> I<00:01:41.609> add<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> meat

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
right which is rd 929 if I add the meat

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.209 
right which is rd 929 if I add the meat
over<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> top<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:44.069> gives<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> D<00:01:45.060> 13

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
over the top of that it gives me a D 13

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.469 
over the top of that it gives me a D 13
that's<00:01:47.219> kinda<00:01:47.549> cool<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.060> get<00:01:48.209> kind<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that's kinda cool you can get kind of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
that's kinda cool you can get kind of
some<00:01:48.659> neat<00:01:48.810> stuff<00:01:48.840> with<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.289> playing<00:01:49.799> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
some neat stuff with that playing just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.279 
some neat stuff with that playing just
as<00:01:50.939> far<00:01:51.179> as<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.359> chord<00:01:51.569> progression<00:01:51.959> guys<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
as far as a chord progression guys if I

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.230 
as far as a chord progression guys if I
just<00:01:52.499> play<00:01:52.679> those<00:01:53.069> chords<00:01:53.369> instead<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.969> rashmi

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
just play those chords instead of rashmi

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.749 
just play those chords instead of rashmi
a<00:01:54.689> 7<00:01:55.259> p-9<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.270> had<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.079> there

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.429 

seems<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.880> no<00:02:03.149> constant<00:02:03.780> makes<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> sort<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
seems that no constant makes it sort of

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
seems that no constant makes it sort of
a<00:02:04.530> drone<00:02:05.119> over<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.360> top<00:02:06.740> so<00:02:07.740> if<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.640> rhythm<00:02:08.970> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
a drone over the top so if the rhythm is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.740 
a drone over the top so if the rhythm is

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
it then when we go to the D none let's

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:14.470 
it then when we go to the D none let's
do<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> piece<00:03:08.769> when<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:10.189> need<00:03:13.030> like<00:03:14.030> a<00:03:14.060> double

your beam out into your a minor
pentatonic<00:04:27.780> scale<00:04:28.580> it<00:04:29.580> gives<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> a

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
pentatonic scale it gives you the a

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.080 
pentatonic scale it gives you the a
Dorian<00:04:30.630> scale<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:32.370> don't<00:04:32.640> have<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.940> add

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090

Dorian scale and you don't have to add
them<00:04:33.660> both<00:04:33.840> all<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.200> time<00:04:34.440> in<00:04:34.650> other<00:04:34.770> words<00:04:34.920> I

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
them both all the time in other words I

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:45.920 
them both all the time in other words I

can play an a minor pentatonic lick back
to<00:04:46.170> regular

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.040 

here<00:05:02.790> I'm<00:05:02.940> adding<00:05:03.180> those<00:05:03.480> in<00:05:03.660> there<00:05:03.780> sometimes

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
here I'm adding those in there sometimes

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.590 
here I'm adding those in there sometimes
and<00:05:04.440> sometimes<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.890> plain<00:05:05.010> great<00:05:05.600> it's

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
and sometimes just plain great it's

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.390 
and sometimes just plain great it's
better<00:05:06.810> tonics<00:05:07.140> gonna<00:05:07.320> give<00:05:07.470> you<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:10.400> real

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
better tonics gonna give you that real

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.460 
better tonics gonna give you that real
bluesy<00:05:11.820> feel<00:05:12.030> so<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:12.510> we<00:05:12.660> do<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.260> all<00:05:13.440> the

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
bluesy feel so if we do this all the

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.590 
bluesy feel so if we do this all the
time<00:05:13.590> we<00:05:13.950> sort<00:05:14.340> of<00:05:14.430> lose<00:05:14.580> some<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.820> that<00:05:14.940> so<00:05:15.510> if

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
time we sort of lose some of that so if

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.780 
time we sort of lose some of that so if
we're<00:05:15.750> playing<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.050> pentatonic<00:05:19.670> but<00:05:20.670> add

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
we're playing the pentatonic but add

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.840 
we're playing the pentatonic but add
those<00:05:21.000> in<00:05:21.180> there<00:05:21.300> so<00:05:25.280> it's<00:05:26.280> a<00:05:26.400> nice<00:05:26.550> transition

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
those in there so it's a nice transition
