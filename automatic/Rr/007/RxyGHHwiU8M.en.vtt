00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
we're going to start a course with a

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.200 
we're going to start a course with a
sword<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:11.460> good<00:00:11.580> way<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> start<00:00:11.969> where<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
sword and a good way to start where the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.850 
sword and a good way to start where the
sword<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.840> straight<00:00:13.170> edge<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.620> don't

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
sword is with a straight edge you don't

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.910 
sword is with a straight edge you don't
have<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.109> good<00:00:16.260> thing<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.740> at

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
have to but it's a good thing to have at

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.500 
have to but it's a good thing to have at
least<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.220> few<00:00:17.369> straighted<00:00:17.730> lines<00:00:18.060> underneath

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
least a few straighted lines underneath

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.009 
least a few straighted lines underneath
to<00:00:19.289> give<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.560> guide<00:00:23.750> okay

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to give you a guide okay

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
to give you a guide okay
so<00:00:26.330> once<00:00:27.330> we<00:00:27.539> have<00:00:27.750> where<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> center<00:00:28.740> point

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
so once we have where the center point

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.959 
so once we have where the center point
is<00:00:30.920> good<00:00:31.920> thing<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> remember<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:32.460> swords

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
is good thing to remember about swords

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.500 
is good thing to remember about swords
is<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.420> handle<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.140> narrower<00:00:34.469> than

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
is that the handle is much narrower than

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.660 
is that the handle is much narrower than
the<00:00:36.510> blade<00:00:37.070> unless<00:00:38.070> you're<00:00:38.280> talking<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.879> rapier

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
the blade unless you're talking a rapier

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.830 
the blade unless you're talking a rapier
where<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.940> may<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.719> same<00:00:42.960> size<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
where it may be about the same size a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.260 
where it may be about the same size a
pommel<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.710> very<00:00:46.980> important<00:00:47.460> element<00:00:47.610> which

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
pommel is a very important element which

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.180 
pommel is a very important element which
is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.539> very<00:00:48.719> end<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> sword<00:00:49.649> opposite

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
is the very end of the sword opposite

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.670 
is the very end of the sword opposite
the<00:00:50.309> point<00:00:50.719> it's<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:51.930> important<00:00:52.379> element

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the point it's very important element

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.020 
the point it's very important element
actually<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> gives<00:00:53.340> balance<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
actually because it gives balance to the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
actually because it gives balance to the
sword<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.809> something<00:00:55.170> solid<00:00:55.550> the

Roman<00:01:26.189> swords<00:01:27.890> we're<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.189> give

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
Roman swords we're just going to give

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.999 
Roman swords we're just going to give
this<00:01:29.399> one<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> basic<00:01:29.939> straight<00:01:30.179> cross<00:01:30.539> guard

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
this one a basic straight cross guard

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.200 
this one a basic straight cross guard
now<00:01:32.009> you've<00:01:32.159> got<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:32.460> straight<00:01:32.729> line<00:01:32.909> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
now you've got your straight line for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
now you've got your straight line for
your<00:01:33.329> blade<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:34.289> maybe<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.590> don't<00:01:34.770> want<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
your blade but maybe you don't want a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.809 
your blade but maybe you don't want a
straight<00:01:35.219> blade<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.380> at<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.619> point<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.729> you

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
straight blade so at that point what you

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:49.160 
straight blade so at that point what you
might<00:01:39.030> do<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:41.000> just<00:01:42.439> follow<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.770> same<00:01:47.039> time<00:01:48.170> on

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
might do is just follow the same time on

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.289 
might do is just follow the same time on
each<00:01:49.439> side<00:01:50.299> we<00:01:51.299> wanted<00:01:51.599> it<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.720> come<00:01:51.929> out<00:01:52.170> here

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
each side we wanted it to come out here

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:00.199 
each side we wanted it to come out here
and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.509> maybe<00:01:54.659> broader<00:01:55.319> again<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:59.209> then

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
and then maybe broader again and then

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.550 
and then maybe broader again and then
have<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> nice<00:02:00.569> curved<00:02:01.069> tip<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.439> you

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
have a nice curved tip but because you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.870 
have a nice curved tip but because you
had<00:02:04.679> your<00:02:04.709> center<00:02:05.099> line<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.459> knew<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
had your center line you knew what to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.130 
had your center line you knew what to
follow<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.170> there's<00:02:07.349> your<00:02:07.500> basic<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> sword

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
follow so there's your basic on a sword

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.559 
follow so there's your basic on a sword
your<00:02:10.140> handle<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.769> be<00:02:10.970> wrapped<00:02:11.970> leather<00:02:12.299> just

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
your handle can be wrapped leather just

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.699 
your handle can be wrapped leather just
do<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.780> zigzag<00:02:13.489> it's<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.519> good<00:02:15.319> easy<00:02:16.319> way<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
do a zigzag it's a good easy way to

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.680 
do a zigzag it's a good easy way to
cover<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.400> put<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> little<00:02:18.180> shading<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.600> it

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
cover that put a little shading on it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.080 
cover that put a little shading on it
make<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.930> darker<00:02:19.230> than<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.470> rest<00:02:19.880> now<00:02:20.880> let's

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
make it darker than the rest now let's

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.240 
make it darker than the rest now let's
say<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.239> wanted<00:02:21.540> war<00:02:21.720> than<00:02:21.870> battle<00:02:22.170> axe<00:02:22.350> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
say you wanted war than battle axe you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.199 
say you wanted war than battle axe you
have<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.489> worry<00:02:23.639> as<00:02:23.760> much<00:02:23.790> about<00:02:23.940> your

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
have to worry as much about your

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.289 
have to worry as much about your
straight<00:02:24.480> edge<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.900> because<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.180> as
