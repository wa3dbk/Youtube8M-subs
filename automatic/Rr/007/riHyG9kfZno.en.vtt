mask but you can't remove the mask so

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.540 
mask but you can't remove the mask so
you<00:04:47.150> would<00:04:47.390> have<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.810> have<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.680> hair<00:04:48.950> person

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
version of Excalibur I think I think

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.640 

so<00:05:19.380> now<00:05:19.590> let's<00:05:20.370> get<00:05:20.550> these<00:05:20.730> figuring<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.650> nice

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
so now let's get these figuring a nice

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.190 
so now let's get these figuring a nice
pose<00:05:23.040> and<00:05:23.370> I'll<00:05:23.790> get<00:05:24.000> back<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.960> show

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
pose and I'll get back to you to show

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.650 
pose and I'll get back to you to show
you<00:05:25.260> the<00:05:25.470> post<00:05:28.160> all<00:05:29.160> right<00:05:29.700> here<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.210> can<00:05:30.419> see

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
you the post all right here you can see

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.770 
you the post all right here you can see
one<00:05:31.110> of<00:05:31.260> the<00:05:31.410> example<00:05:31.889> poses<00:05:32.250> which<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.790> one<00:05:33.750> of

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
one of the example poses which is one of

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.210 
one of the example poses which is one of
those<00:05:34.080> with<00:05:34.800> her<00:05:34.950> pointing<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.070> is<00:05:38.100> a

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
those with her pointing so this is a

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.340 
those with her pointing so this is a
quite<00:05:38.460> simple<00:05:39.000> post<00:05:39.240> but<00:05:39.630> I<00:05:39.660> will<00:05:39.900> experiment

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
quite simple post but I will experiment

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.250 
quite simple post but I will experiment
more<00:05:40.800> advanced<00:05:41.130> poses<00:05:41.669> later<00:05:42.260> the

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
more advanced poses later the

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.860 
more advanced poses later the
articulation<00:05:43.919> is<00:05:44.220> just<00:05:44.820> about<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.120> same<00:05:45.450> as

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
articulation is just about the same as

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.970 
articulation is just about the same as
the<00:05:46.139> regular<00:05:47.030> saber<00:05:48.030> figma<00:05:48.630> because<00:05:49.020> they<00:05:49.889> are

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
the regular saber figma because they are

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.720 
the regular saber figma because they are
very<00:05:50.160> similar<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:51.390> see<00:05:51.600> here<00:05:51.840> I<00:05:52.020> attached<00:05:52.470> the

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:52.730 
very similar you see here I attached the

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.070 
very similar you see here I attached the
shouting<00:05:53.730> face<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:55.160> nurse<00:05:56.160> word<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:57.080> that

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
shouting face a nurse word and that

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:10.580 
shouting face a nurse word and that
pointing<00:05:58.650> finger<00:05:59.130> hand

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.190 

now<00:06:11.250> let's<00:06:11.790> compare<00:06:12.090> her<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:14.570> the<00:06:15.570> regular

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
now let's compare her to the regular

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:25.010 
now let's compare her to the regular
saber<00:06:20.330> can<00:06:21.330> put<00:06:21.510> them<00:06:21.660> like<00:06:21.840> this<00:06:23.600> so<00:06:24.600> now<00:06:24.780> they

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
saber can put them like this so now they

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.850 
saber can put them like this so now they
are<00:06:25.110> going<00:06:25.260> to<00:06:25.410> fight<00:06:26.360> and<00:06:27.360> I<00:06:28.260> think<00:06:28.560> they<00:06:28.740> are

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
are going to fight and I think they are

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.370 
are going to fight and I think they are
both<00:06:29.040> about<00:06:29.550> the<00:06:29.970> same<00:06:30.210> height<00:06:30.690> so<00:06:31.050> they<00:06:31.230> are

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
both about the same height so they are

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.210 
both about the same height so they are
not<00:06:31.620> much<00:06:32.370> difference<00:06:32.880> in<00:06:33.570> size<00:06:34.560> so<00:06:37.220> that's

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
not much difference in size so that's

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.670 
not much difference in size so that's
very<00:06:38.340> good<00:06:38.850> I<00:06:38.880> think<00:06:41.810> so<00:06:42.810> here<00:06:43.050> we<00:06:43.080> have<00:06:43.230> both

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 
very good I think so here we have both

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.750 
very good I think so here we have both
versions<00:06:44.070> of<00:06:44.460> saber<00:06:48.980> the<00:06:49.980> really<00:06:50.250> evil<00:06:50.580> one

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
versions of saber the really evil one

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:58.210 
versions of saber the really evil one
and<00:06:50.970> the<00:06:51.570> good<00:06:51.690> one<00:06:53.600> and<00:06:55.370> Shiro<00:06:56.370> is<00:06:56.810> very

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 
and the good one and Shiro is very
