no<00:02:06.070> I'm<00:02:06.310> not<00:02:06.490> doing<00:02:06.790> very<00:02:06.970> well<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:10.030> course<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
no I'm not doing very well of course the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.670 
no I'm not doing very well of course the

at the top left where the 100 is there

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.060 
at the top left where the 100 is there
will<00:02:22.120> increase<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.870> value<00:02:23.110> every<00:02:23.740> time<00:02:23.950> you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
will increase in value every time you

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.960 
will increase in value every time you
hit<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:26.020> drop<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.950> side<00:02:27.310> again<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:27.940> I

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
hit it and I drop to the side again so I

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.720 
hit it and I drop to the side again so I
can't<00:02:28.240> demonstrate<00:02:28.420> those<00:02:29.050> cards<00:02:29.740> in<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
can't demonstrate those cards in the

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.660 
can't demonstrate those cards in the
middle<00:02:31.060> there<00:02:31.270> I<00:02:31.920> thing<00:02:32.920> getting<00:02:33.130> all<00:02:33.340> five<00:02:33.640> of

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
middle there I thing getting all five of

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.520 
middle there I thing getting all five of
them<00:02:34.060> gives<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.540> jackpot<00:02:34.840> bonus<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.940> I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
them gives you a jackpot bonus but I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.660 
them gives you a jackpot bonus but I
haven't<00:02:38.530> played<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.860> game<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.430> long<00:02:39.610> I

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
haven't played this game in so long I

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.410 
haven't played this game in so long I
really<00:02:40.120> don't<00:02:40.330> remember<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.700> there<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
really don't remember and there is a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.890 
really don't remember and there is a
hole<00:02:46.840> on<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.650> top<00:02:47.770> right<00:02:48.220> there<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.780> you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
hole on the top right there if you

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.750 
hole on the top right there if you
managed<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.739> hit<00:02:50.770> that<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.430> will<00:02:51.550> be

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
managed to hit that you will be

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.290 
managed to hit that you will be
transported<00:02:52.720> into<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.440> bonus<00:02:53.980> game<00:02:54.300> which

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
transported into a bonus game which

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.990 
transported into a bonus game which
hopefully<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.110> can<00:02:56.290> get<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:57.100> but<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.450> really<00:03:00.000> have

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
hopefully I can get to but I really have

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.820 
hopefully I can get to but I really have
my<00:03:01.330> doubts<00:03:01.570> at<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.020> point<00:03:02.350> since<00:03:02.530> we're<00:03:02.739> on

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
my doubts at this point since we're on

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.610 
my doubts at this point since we're on

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.779 

and<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.020> think<00:04:52.259> that<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.770> original<00:04:53.039> pinball

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
and to think that the original pinball

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.059 
and to think that the original pinball
games<00:04:54.090> didn't<00:04:54.689> even<00:04:54.930> have<00:04:55.110> flippers<00:04:55.620> just

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
games didn't even have flippers just

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.110 
games didn't even have flippers just
shut<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.610> ball<00:04:56.819> in<00:04:57.409> and<00:04:58.639> just<00:04:59.639> hope<00:04:59.819> for<00:04:59.909> the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
shut the ball in and just hope for the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.969 
shut the ball in and just hope for the
best<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.629> it<00:05:00.779> would<00:05:00.900> land<00:05:01.169> somewhere<00:05:01.740> that

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
best that it would land somewhere that

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.980 
best that it would land somewhere that
would<00:05:02.360> be<00:05:03.360> worth<00:05:03.539> a<00:05:03.659> lot<00:05:03.749> of<00:05:03.930> points<00:05:05.749> we<00:05:06.749> called

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
would be worth a lot of points we called

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.670 
would be worth a lot of points we called
it<00:05:07.139> bagatelle<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:08.129> that<00:05:08.400> early<00:05:08.819> day<00:05:12.469> you<00:05:13.469> see
