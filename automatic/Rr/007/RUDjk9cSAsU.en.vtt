00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 as different as they may be, they are all sweet and tasty 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.170
 Superman needs sugar 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.149
 Glucose syrup 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:10.779
 water 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.579
 citric acid 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.400
 Dye and flavors that make Bomberman after tinkering 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.970
 Frank Hertog can make candies he first pours water and sugar into it 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 this machine lid will be unheard of the whole 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.289
 if this mixture is 110 degrees Celsius warm then comes once luck 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.319
 big red too 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.319
 everything will go crazy again 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.070
 because this mixture is at 140 degrees hot is still the lemon prizes 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.580
 whole mixture then comes in this copper kettle 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.060
 Franchitti under the machine pushes a lever down 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.200
 and already the formation water samples out colorful and wide 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.620
 this is now the supreme of this romance to Franco and donations 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.220
 do" 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.070
 Of course, in Rohrau Mare Factory the Counter 8 is the color 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 really only because of the magpie 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
 for taste, the Orange Rover comes to it 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 The whole thing has to be mixed well 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.770
 after that, all the mass comes in this bowl and the bowl on the table 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.890
 The BOM BOM Assist is not only sweet and sticky it is also very hot 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 That's why Frank is pulling gloves 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.470
 then the crowd turned Heimeroth 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.970
 and he takes a pair of scissors and a small one instead of the big sweet 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.970
 Bits off 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 the big chunk throws up because this machine is POS rolled 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.549
 the little piece hangs this hook and then draws Aachen 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.350
 he makes it longer and longer because of the air in the bomb mass 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.140
 what does it mean that small air bubbles form the bomb mass 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 Hertha 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.799
 because Frank is done he takes the brighter Bomberman to the pact-sitting 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.059
 other things in the machine 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.249
 what happens here shifts 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.320
 these two bomber crowds are getting longer and 4 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.010
 they are going back and forth violence 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.190
 when they finally come out and what the machine is they are so good 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.089
 liked 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.789
 but not long enough, therefore, Frank misses the candy strictly between 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.849
 this Rietschen 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.929
 the ten strand getting longer and longer that he finally 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.749
 delayed in a machine 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.269
 kg back 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.509
 and on the other hand, finished sweets come out again 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.369
 that makes on average 1 

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.659
 Frank that with the machine 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.729
 then then works something way 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.739
 and you see the crucial Menden this formal 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.909
 Passed by this fresh, please sweet candy strand 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.989
 then stamp masses push away 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.870
 when that happens, those stalls come back and the candy Chlumsky 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.079
 at night 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.730
 after that, the hot candy just has to run over a cool band Preston 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.729
 World s has cooled down into a collection container 

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:22.879
 and then you just have to suck that
