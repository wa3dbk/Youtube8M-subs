it up looks just like a normal Z Z 10
device<00:03:49.940> let's<00:03:50.940> check<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.300> what<00:03:51.420> OS<00:03:51.660> it's

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
device let's check out what OS it's

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.940 
device let's check out what OS it's
running<00:03:52.050> real<00:03:52.200> quick<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:55.530> one's<00:03:55.769> actually

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
running real quick this one's actually

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.540 
running real quick this one's actually
running<00:03:56.630> 10<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:59.000> 1.27<00:04:00.000> 88<00:04:01.100> so<00:04:02.100> it's<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.280> fairly

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
running 10 to 1.27 88 so it's a fairly

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.040 
running 10 to 1.27 88 so it's a fairly
newer<00:04:02.910> OS<00:04:03.860> from<00:04:04.860> what<00:04:05.040> we've<00:04:05.190> seen<00:04:05.480> I<00:04:06.480> did

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
newer OS from what we've seen I did

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.930 
newer OS from what we've seen I did
stick<00:04:07.350> my<00:04:07.500> t-mobile<00:04:07.800> SIM<00:04:07.860> card<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.520> here

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
stick my t-mobile SIM card in here

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.830 
stick my t-mobile SIM card in here
it<00:04:09.810> is<00:04:10.110> pulling<00:04:10.440> for<00:04:10.980> G<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.940> not<00:04:11.970> pulling<00:04:12.360> 4G

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
it is pulling for G it is not pulling 4G

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.120 
it is pulling for G it is not pulling 4G
LTE<00:04:13.640> so<00:04:14.640> you<00:04:15.450> know<00:04:15.540> if<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.170> want<00:04:16.410> a<00:04:16.530> decent

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
LTE so you know if you want a decent

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.130 
LTE so you know if you want a decent
device<00:04:17.430> at<00:04:17.790> a<00:04:17.820> reasonable<00:04:18.239> price<00:04:18.360> the<00:04:18.720> z3<00:04:18.900> is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
device at a reasonable price the z3 is

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.920 
device at a reasonable price the z3 is
definitely<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.620> way<00:04:19.709> to<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:20.570> but<00:04:21.570> if<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.780> want

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
definitely the way to go but if you want

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.100 
definitely the way to go but if you want
L<00:04:22.019> to<00:04:22.170> eat<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:23.220> Z<00:04:23.400> tart<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.790> xxx<00:04:24.030> or<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.690> z10

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
L to eat the Z tart the xxx or the z10

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.460 
L to eat the Z tart the xxx or the z10
would<00:04:25.320> be<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.530> you<00:04:26.100> know<00:04:26.130> my<00:04:26.400> way<00:04:26.580> to<00:04:26.640> go<00:04:26.850> so

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
would be the you know my way to go so

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.320 
would be the you know my way to go so
basically<00:04:28.470> all<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:29.100> your<00:04:29.310> icons<00:04:29.640> are<00:04:30.120> still

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
the same nothing's really changed there

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.040 
the same nothing's really changed there
of<00:04:35.700> course<00:04:35.850> when<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.090> booted<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.510> device<00:04:36.780> up

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
of course when I booted the device up

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.770 
of course when I booted the device up
there<00:04:37.620> was<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> ton<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.070> app<00:04:38.340> updates<00:04:38.940> which<00:04:39.630> I

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780

to me as the Z 30 as you can see maybe

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.740 
to me as the Z 30 as you can see maybe
you<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.340> maybe<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.640> can't<00:05:29.940> through<00:05:30.210> the<00:05:30.330> lens

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
of the camera I'm not a hundred percent

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.140 
of the camera I'm not a hundred percent
sure<00:05:32.070> but<00:05:32.520> all<00:05:33.300> in<00:05:33.480> all<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:34.700> got<00:05:35.700> your<00:05:35.850> squared

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
sure but all in all you got your squared

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.490 
sure but all in all you got your squared
edges<00:05:36.510> and<00:05:37.940> on<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.390> 30<00:05:39.660> it's<00:05:40.410> all<00:05:40.620> rounded<00:05:41.100> so

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
edges and on the 30 it's all rounded so

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.140 
edges and on the 30 it's all rounded so
it's<00:05:43.500> almost<00:05:43.710> like<00:05:43.919> to<00:05:44.610> me<00:05:44.730> it's<00:05:44.850> almost<00:05:45.000> like

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
it's almost like to me it's almost like

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.020 
it's almost like to me it's almost like
a<00:05:45.180> Nokia<00:05:45.570> device<00:05:45.950> where<00:05:46.950> it's<00:05:47.610> all<00:05:47.760> squared

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
close to the same it's not much

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.360

your micro SD card at the top both just

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.700 
your micro SD card at the top both just
slide<00:06:38.419> it<00:06:38.539> in<00:06:38.600> there<00:06:38.750> push<00:06:39.050> it<00:06:39.199> in<00:06:39.289> and<00:06:39.470> locks

and then you just close it back up and

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.779 
and then you just close it back up and
it<00:06:43.430> becomes<00:06:44.090> one<00:06:44.330> part<00:06:44.570> of<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.720> device<00:06:45.050> so

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:45.789 
it becomes one part of the device so

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:51.490 
it becomes one part of the device so
overall<00:06:47.620> look<00:06:48.620> and<00:06:48.770> feel<00:06:48.830> of<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.250> z3<00:06:50.500> versus

overall look and feel of the z3 versus

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.300 
overall look and feel of the z3 versus
the<00:06:51.710> z30

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
the z30

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.140 
the z30
it's<00:06:53.240> a<00:06:53.300> very<00:06:53.630> nice<00:06:53.870> very<00:06:54.470> well<00:06:54.919> made<00:06:55.280> device
