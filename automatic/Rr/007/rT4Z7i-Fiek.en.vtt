white screen and here is the Sun
reflection<00:00:47.670> as<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.840> see

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.579 

as<00:01:01.400> you<00:01:02.400> can<00:01:02.580> see<00:01:02.790> both<00:01:03.090> phones<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:04.350> the

as you can see both phones are at the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:18.780 
as you can see both phones are at the
max<00:01:04.830> brightness<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.520> the<00:01:05.640> moment

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.320 

you<00:01:19.330> can<00:01:19.540> see<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.750> on<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.560> camera<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.550> node

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
you can see that on the camera the node

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.570 
you can see that on the camera the node
full<00:01:22.600> screen<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.170> looking<00:01:23.920> little<00:01:24.190> bit<00:01:24.370> more

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
full screen is looking little bit more

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.200 
full screen is looking little bit more
pinkish<00:01:24.970> as<00:01:25.210> compared<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.840> s5<00:01:26.830> screen<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
pinkish as compared to the s5 screen the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.840 
pinkish as compared to the s5 screen the
viewing<00:01:28.720> angles<00:01:29.200> are<00:01:29.410> great<00:01:29.890> on<00:01:30.160> either

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
viewing angles are great on either

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.810 
viewing angles are great on either
device<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.780> looks<00:01:32.740> pretty<00:01:33.010> similar<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.520> me

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
device and looks pretty similar to me

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.900 
device and looks pretty similar to me
both<00:01:34.810> are<00:01:35.080> using<00:01:35.500> my<00:01:36.010> LED<00:01:36.280> screen<00:01:36.610> so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
both are using my LED screen so

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.020 
both are using my LED screen so
obviously<00:01:37.480> they<00:01:37.840> have<00:01:38.020> great<00:01:38.760> viewing<00:01:39.760> angles

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
obviously they have great viewing angles

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.500 
obviously they have great viewing angles
and<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.710> shadows<00:01:42.130> as<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:42.790> can<00:01:42.940> see<00:01:43.210> here

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
and in the shadows as you can see here

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.440 
and in the shadows as you can see here
it<00:01:44.320> seems<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.860> s5<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.460> little<00:01:46.090> bit<00:01:46.240> brighter

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
it seems the s5 is little bit brighter

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.020 
it seems the s5 is little bit brighter
once<00:01:47.410> again<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.830> can<00:01:48.040> see<00:01:48.070> both<00:01:48.430> devices<00:01:48.820> are

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
once again you can see both devices are

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.800 
once again you can see both devices are
running<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.870> max<00:01:50.640> brightness<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.180> I'm<00:01:52.600> using

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
running in max brightness and I'm using

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.350 
running in max brightness and I'm using
the<00:01:53.080> basic<00:01:53.290> screen<00:01:53.770> mode<00:01:54.009> on<00:01:54.220> node<00:01:54.460> 4<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.030> on

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
the basic screen mode on node 4 and on

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.650 
the basic screen mode on node 4 and on
as<00:01:55.660> five<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.710> am<00:01:56.830> using<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.660> professional

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
as five I am using the professional

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:15.730 
as five I am using the professional
photo<00:01:58.900> mode

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.850 

so<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.520> seems<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.880> me<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.150> s5<00:02:17.900> has<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.590> slight

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so it seems to me that s5 has a slight

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.270 
so it seems to me that s5 has a slight
advantage<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:20.000> shadows<00:02:20.470> whereas<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
advantage in the shadows whereas in the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.330 
advantage in the shadows whereas in the
sunlight<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:23.720> note<00:02:24.140> 4<00:02:24.350> has<00:02:24.620> slight<00:02:24.920> advantage

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
sunlight the note 4 has slight advantage

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.970 
sunlight the note 4 has slight advantage
as<00:02:25.970> far<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.660> sunlight<00:02:27.140> visibility<00:02:27.770> is

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980
