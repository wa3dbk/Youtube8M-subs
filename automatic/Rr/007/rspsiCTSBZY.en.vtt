am<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.369> being<00:01:56.579> overly<00:01:57.299> harsh<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.840> by<00:01:58.020> seeing

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

hard<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.060> like<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.420> say<00:02:03.570> when<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.840> see

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
hard because like you say when you see

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.600 
hard because like you say when you see
it<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:04.890> bowling<00:02:05.280> but<00:02:05.399> there<00:02:05.520> are

as you would a bowling ball but the

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.550 
as you would a bowling ball but the
problem<00:02:30.180> was<00:02:30.269> then<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.720> every<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.470> then

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
problem was then that every now and then

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.470 
problem was then that every now and then
the<00:02:32.190> ball<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:32.760> it's<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.150> first<00:02:33.329> person

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480

the ball because it's in first person
view<00:02:33.870> sure<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> then<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.709> ball<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:34.890> start

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
view sure and then the ball just start

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.130 
view sure and then the ball just start
jumping<00:02:35.819> over<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.480> place<00:02:36.690> even<00:02:36.930> though<00:02:36.989> your

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
jumping over the place even though your

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.960 
jumping over the place even though your
hands<00:02:37.319> perfectly<00:02:37.650> still<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.280> clearly<00:02:38.610> try<00:02:38.909> to

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
hands perfectly still so clearly try to

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.640 
hands perfectly still so clearly try to
figure<00:02:39.209> out<00:02:39.299> which<00:02:39.510> hanging<00:02:39.840> exactly<00:02:40.409> yeah

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
figure out which hanging exactly yeah

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.300 
figure out which hanging exactly yeah
and<00:02:41.129> then<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:42.180> we<00:02:42.299> were<00:02:42.360> saying<00:02:42.510> before<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
and then like we were saying before the

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.250 
and then like we were saying before the
way<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:44.730> tell<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.150> where<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.230> are

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
way it will tell you where you are

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
way it will tell you where you are
aligned<00:02:46.829> is<00:02:47.099> by<00:02:47.250> lighting<00:02:47.519> up<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.849> areas<00:02:48.090> that

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
aligned is by lighting up the areas that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.580 
aligned is by lighting up the areas that
you<00:02:48.239> get<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.569> lanes<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:49.079> say<00:02:49.230> right<00:02:49.410> your

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
you get in the lanes to say right your

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.839 
you get in the lanes to say right your
stud<00:02:49.799> if<00:02:49.950> you're<00:02:50.099> smack<00:02:50.519> bang<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> middle

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
stud if you're smack bang in the middle

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.869 
stud if you're smack bang in the middle
but<00:02:51.599> then<00:02:51.750> as<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.709> low<00:02:52.859> your<00:02:53.040> arm<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.700> ball

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
but then as you low your arm the ball

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.069 
but then as you low your arm the ball
disappears<00:02:54.359> so<00:02:54.510> you're<00:02:54.629> wondering<00:02:54.930> right

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
disappears so you're wondering right

enough<00:03:10.890> um<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:12.269> anywhere<00:03:12.480> near<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.989> games

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
enough um we're anywhere near the games

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.849 
enough um we're anywhere near the games
particularly<00:03:14.120> good<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.239> comparison<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:16.019> think

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
particularly good in comparison I think

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.440 
particularly good in comparison I think
you<00:03:16.950> said<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.549> they<00:03:18.180> can<00:03:18.329> be<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.419> little

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
you said that it they can be a little

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.030 
you said that it they can be a little
bit<00:03:18.660> inconsistent<00:03:19.049> from<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.470> inter<00:03:19.680> game<00:03:19.799> but

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
bit inconsistent from the inter game but

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.250 
bit inconsistent from the inter game but

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
it looks so static and so I just dull

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.860 
it looks so static and so I just dull
yeah<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.940> the<00:05:38.030> problem<00:05:38.150> is<00:05:38.330> as<00:05:38.450> well<00:05:38.630> it's

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
yeah and the problem is as well it's

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.589 
yeah and the problem is as well it's
even<00:05:39.020> worse<00:05:39.320> on<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:40.340> defensive<00:05:41.240> side<00:05:41.300> of<00:05:41.479> the

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
even worse on the defensive side of the

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:42.700 
even worse on the defensive side of the
ball<00:05:41.660> because<00:05:42.020> soon<00:05:42.200> as<00:05:42.260> you<00:05:42.349> lose<00:05:42.500> possession

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
ball because soon as you lose possession

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.980 
ball because soon as you lose possession
you<00:05:43.580> just<00:05:43.820> automatically<00:05:44.210> snap<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.660> control

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
you just automatically snap to control

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.900 
you just automatically snap to control
the<00:05:45.110> keeper<00:05:45.440> never<00:05:46.070> for<00:05:46.250> those<00:05:46.400> chances<00:05:46.820> that

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
the keeper never for those chances that

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.400 
the keeper never for those chances that
I<00:05:47.000> intercept<00:05:47.449> the<00:05:47.539> balls<00:05:47.720> are<00:05:47.930> dependent<00:05:48.289> out

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
I intercept the balls are dependent out

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.409 
I intercept the balls are dependent out
