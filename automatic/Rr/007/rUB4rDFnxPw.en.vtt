 [Music] 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.730
 the soldiers of light and the warriors 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.020
 of darkness 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.020
 they faced each other 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.239
 for the control of the chalk of the future 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.900
 that controls our destiny 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:48.010
 neither side got 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.320
 and a truce was established 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.100
 for centuries the swallow has been 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.810

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.049
 by the guardians of the nasa 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.049
 [Music] 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.690
 and if you want to prevent the war that you put 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.690
 end to all wars 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.379
 [Music] 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.379
 [Applause] 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.200
 they must find the object that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.860
 it will change everything 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.860
 to me 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.260
 [Music] 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.780
