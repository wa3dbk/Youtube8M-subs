00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:10.600
 and in the morning 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.880
 very good morning welcome to this 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.500
 space as important as it is 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.130
 crafts and we come today 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.890
 with a very special reason that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:29.060
 then we will elaborate it from the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:33.590
 next way we're going to need 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.940
 The following materials in this case 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.720
 we will make it with lilies 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.949
 we also place the complement 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:49.360
 with some roses foliage and ornaments 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.960
 that are indispensable good 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.240
 first 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.440
 we set the base 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.440
 why 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.590
 then we continue with the second step 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.360
 which we are going to place the roses and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.869
 before placing it we have to have in 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.780
 account of looking to fix it suddenly 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.149
 some petal this one for the transport 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 for anything to be bathed then 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.610
 you have to accommodate it well 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.160
 in this case we are going to place the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.510
 flowers in such a way that we are going 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:57.400
 resemble a garden is not this arrangement is 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.400
 totally spontaneous 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.910
 but not forgetting in any way that 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.910
 take your style 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:16.590
 As we have finished putting the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.440
 roses then 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.599
 we proceed to place some twigs that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.599
 in this case it would be the leather fern 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.579
 i 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.760
 this to give you a bit of greenery 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:34.540
 so that we have the most natural 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.540
 which can 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.680
 support the ornaments and is the complement 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.680
 of all 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.750
 This is already the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.750
 the last step we have 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.950
 we are always used to look at 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.440
 spaces where there is a need 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.280
 place it be the flowers and 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.920
 foliage 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.920
 taking into account that you do not recharge it 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.159
 that it's not that the supposedly fix 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.379
 we will not be too overloaded 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.379
 or lack of flowers 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.550
 and to the last complement we put 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.880
 these ix or philia that will also give you 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:45.890
 a touch as very tender very harmonious 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:49.400
 then this that we already put him 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.230
 as well as in very small quantities for 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.230
 that no more than give you a few rays 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.010
 and there it is 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.549
 live the morning
