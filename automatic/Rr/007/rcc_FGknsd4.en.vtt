00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hey people today what's right hearty 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.550
 is meat plant or 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.929
 bulks meatballs or meat 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.179
 can you choose and that will be 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.969
 it does not have to be any meatballs 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.170
 but they shall be filled 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.949
 or you put with something 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.359
 very special 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:26.430
 you need day meat onions 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.840
 garlic salt pepper from the day before or 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.160
 you just take toast bread I have 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 are here fully was taken on boat 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 the filling of an avocado and for 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:40.079
 Cover bacon because it tastes with bacon 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 Everything better first if you have a bread 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.829
 from the day before then you have to first 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.420
 good times soften in cold water 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.440
 with the toast I would have done it too 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.420
 but then i dont take that much water 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.129
 because it is already soft then that comes 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.110
 faked or compared to 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.670
 this will be a small piece for you 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.370
 and then you do one 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.989
 nice cup out of it sometimes 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.760
 Management now thinks I'm doing to me 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.410
 the onions cut small pieces 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.989
 together with the garlic 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.670
 that comes to the meat sausage mass 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.600
 Add it to my albert, too 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.790
 still in there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.530
 because a tablespoon must of the whole 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.200
 even more refined then is the mass 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.689
 finished the groundmass and now comes 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 the special and the avocado 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.960
 incisive of their vocal and small 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.420
 pieces then you take an avocado 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.979
 dice and encase him with the meat 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.540
 with the meat mass then forms the one 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.950
 beautiful bulette out of it can do that then 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.450
 directly into the pan 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.549
 That's why six to eight minutes are allowed 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.400
 in the hot pan nice crispy 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 be fried or theo coat that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 of course, even before, of course 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.460
 Bacon you shape a classic bulette 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.170
 without the avocado in it and then take 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.090
 just bacon yours around this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 bulette drum wraps that comes too short 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.299
 fried in the pan 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.579
 they want a great tip if you not only 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.620
 that the fat begins to splash 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.720
 I just salt and a little bit 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.120
 this then binds the liquid out 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.530
 leaking the meat and then you have 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.990
 no problem with annoying 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.860
 fat splash first try this with 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.880
 bacon now taken so much bread 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 Now that I have the European election program 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.540
 meat plant still tastes one 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.160
 a little better because that's one more thing 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.870
 creamy component thereby gives 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.810
 a little bit more bacon because I have 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.580
 just a strip wrapped around and so on 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.560
 you can taste the recipe I have 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.420
 by the way, from the magazine muti 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.520

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.740

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 creative simple few ingredients 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.650

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.810

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.350

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.720
