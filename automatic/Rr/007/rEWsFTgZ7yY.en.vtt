00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
yep that's probably the best place to

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.140 
yep that's probably the best place to

necessarily<00:03:08.150> going<00:03:08.689> to<00:03:08.840> hit<00:03:08.989> okay<00:03:09.379> there<00:03:09.560> we

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
necessarily going to hit okay there we

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.849 
necessarily going to hit okay there we
go

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
go

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.379 
go

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
now now we're getting some percentages

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.420 
now now we're getting some percentages
all<00:03:11.569> this<00:03:11.689> is<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:11.989> be<00:03:12.049> close<00:03:12.319> 49<00:03:12.889> percent

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
all this is going to be close 49 percent

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.300 
all this is going to be close 49 percent
49<00:03:14.120> oh<00:03:14.530> man<00:03:15.530> okay

49 oh man okay
look<00:03:17.030> at<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.359> 50%<00:03:18.079> two<00:03:18.620> stars<00:03:19.329> making<00:03:20.329> it

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
look at that 50% two stars making it

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.289 
look at that 50% two stars making it
look<00:03:20.540> easy<00:03:20.720> like<00:03:21.079> golly<00:03:21.349> dawn<00:03:21.590> does<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.299> well
