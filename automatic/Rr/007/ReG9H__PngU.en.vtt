00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
game because you know I've heard all

between battlefield 3 and black ops 2 I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.230 
between battlefield 3 and black ops 2 I
think<00:01:20.340> I'd<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> little<00:01:20.939> bit<00:01:21.060> more

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240

because<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.610> biggest<00:01:24.180> complaint<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.720> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
because my biggest complaint in this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.780 
because my biggest complaint in this
game<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.680> much<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.860> netcode<00:01:26.250> issues

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
game is not so much the netcode issues

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
here I go trying to experiment saying

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
here I go trying to experiment saying
okay<00:02:00.750> how<00:02:00.899> fast<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.380> quick<00:02:01.619> scope<00:02:01.950> I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
okay how fast can this quick scope I

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.450 
okay how fast can this quick scope I
don't<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:04.290> didn't<00:02:04.530> kill<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
don't know but it didn't kill them but

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.089 
don't know but it didn't kill them but
assisted<00:02:06.360> suicide<00:02:06.869> whatever<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.069> but

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
assisted suicide whatever that is but

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.410 
assisted suicide whatever that is but
I'm<00:02:08.369> guessing<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.789> left<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> with<00:02:09.209> such<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
I'm guessing I left it with such a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.050 
I'm guessing I left it with such a
little<00:02:09.810> pull<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.530> health<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.009> he<00:02:11.670> fell<00:02:11.879> off

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
little pull of health that he fell off

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
little pull of health that he fell off
now<00:02:12.330> we'll<00:02:12.480> go<00:02:12.599> back<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:12.959> other<00:02:13.110> weapon

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
now we'll go back to this other weapon

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.280 
now we'll go back to this other weapon
another<00:02:14.280> weapon<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.140> something

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
another weapon and this is something

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.250 
another weapon and this is something
that's<00:02:16.500> more<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.250> my<00:02:17.700> alley<00:02:17.810> this<00:02:18.810> weapon<00:02:19.020> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
that's more up my alley this weapon I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.420 
that's more up my alley this weapon I
shot<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> right<00:02:19.680> there<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.010> figure<00:02:20.160> out<00:02:20.280> if

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
shot it right there to figure out if

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.890 
shot it right there to figure out if
it's<00:02:20.550> full<00:02:20.730> auto<00:02:20.970> or<00:02:21.180> single<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:21.600> whatever

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
it's full auto or single or whatever

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.930 
it's full auto or single or whatever
because<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.230> have<00:02:22.350> no<00:02:22.500> idea<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:23.490> might<00:02:23.790> be

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
because I have no idea this might be

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.110 
because I have no idea this might be
something<00:02:24.180> that's<00:02:24.569> more<00:02:24.930> up<00:02:25.230> my<00:02:25.709> alley

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
something that's more up my alley

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.000 
something that's more up my alley
something<00:02:27.120> that's<00:02:27.270> more<00:02:27.990> accurate<00:02:28.230> medium

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
something that's more accurate medium

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.770 
something that's more accurate medium
range<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:29.940> thing<00:02:30.120> I've<00:02:30.239> noticed<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:30.569> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
range then thing I've noticed about the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.720 
range then thing I've noticed about the
SMGs<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> sure<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.980> rush<00:02:32.190> with<00:02:32.370> them<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
SMGs is sure you can rush with them and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.090 
SMGs is sure you can rush with them and
they've<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.239> ton<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.569> rate<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.230> fire<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:35.010> at

need<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> reflex<00:02:59.190> sight<00:02:59.430> but<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.120> is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
need the reflex sight but there is

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.509 
need the reflex sight but there is
something<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.690> does<00:03:00.930> slow<00:03:01.230> down<00:03:01.440> by<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> d/s

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
something that does slow down by a d/s

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.250 
something that does slow down by a d/s
sensitivity<00:03:03.239> please<00:03:03.870> make<00:03:04.110> that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
sensitivity please make that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.290 
sensitivity please make that
recommendation<00:03:04.519> but<00:03:05.519> mind<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.060> don't<00:03:06.150> like

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
thing I learned you could cook nades in

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.180 
thing I learned you could cook nades in
this<00:03:36.090> game<00:03:36.269> why<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.750> not<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.530> battlefield

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
this game why is that not in battlefield

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.610 
this game why is that not in battlefield
3<00:03:38.390> cooking<00:03:39.390> nades<00:03:39.630> how<00:03:39.959> many<00:03:40.140> how<00:03:40.290> many<00:03:40.350> games

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
3 cooking nades how many how many games

a burnt piece of toast so ill cooking

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.280 
a burnt piece of toast so ill cooking
aids<00:03:50.489> that's<00:03:50.730> an<00:03:50.820> amazing<00:03:51.150> thing<00:03:51.420> that's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
aids that's an amazing thing that's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650 
aids that's an amazing thing that's
awesome<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.549> hip<00:03:53.670> firing<00:03:53.940> sensitivity<00:03:54.630> I

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
awesome the hip firing sensitivity I

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.319 
awesome the hip firing sensitivity I
have<00:03:55.019> matched<00:03:55.410> up<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.709> battlefield<00:03:56.400> 3<00:03:56.670> almost

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
have matched up to battlefield 3 almost

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.840 
have matched up to battlefield 3 almost
perfectly<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.560> you'll<00:03:58.709> see<00:03:58.920> why<00:03:59.190> my<00:03:59.220> accuracy

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
perfectly so you'll see why my accuracy

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.560 
perfectly so you'll see why my accuracy
is<00:04:00.030> quite<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.299> bit<00:04:00.540> more<00:04:01.820> higher<00:04:02.820> with<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
is quite a bit more higher with the

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.860 
is quite a bit more higher with the
hipfire<00:04:03.810> then<00:04:04.350> you<00:04:04.829> know<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.250> 80s<00:04:05.790> stuff<00:04:06.150> so

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
hipfire then you know the 80s stuff so

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.360 
hipfire then you know the 80s stuff so
you<00:04:07.320> know<00:04:07.410> I've<00:04:07.530> learned<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.859> kind<00:04:08.100> of<00:04:08.160> switch

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you know I've learned to kind of switch

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.509 
you know I've learned to kind of switch
back<00:04:08.700> pop<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.780> then<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.620> say<00:04:11.010> okay<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.430> guy

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
back pop that then I say okay that guy

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:12.770 
back pop that then I say okay that guy
is<00:04:11.579> probably<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.970> building<00:04:12.329> i'm<00:04:12.450> not<00:04:12.630> going

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
is probably the building i'm not going

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.759 
is probably the building i'm not going
to<00:04:12.840> throw<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.109> that<00:04:13.200> way<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:13.410> i'm<00:04:13.590> going<00:04:13.680> to

throw in the middle now here's the old

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.039 
throw in the middle now here's the old
bait-and-switch<00:04:16.400> think<00:04:17.400> I'm<00:04:17.519> run<00:04:17.669> away<00:04:18.049> come

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
bait-and-switch think I'm run away come

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.779 
bait-and-switch think I'm run away come
back<00:04:19.079> take<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.890> hip<00:04:20.100> fire<00:04:20.310> because<00:04:20.640> usually

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
back take a hip fire because usually
