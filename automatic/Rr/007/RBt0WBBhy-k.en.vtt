00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
foot of t8 in this case I didn't have

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.580 
foot of t8 in this case I didn't have
quite<00:01:38.950> as<00:01:39.159> much<00:01:39.310> material<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.060> work<00:01:40.210> with<00:01:40.479> so<00:01:41.350> I

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
quite as much material to work with so I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
quite as much material to work with so I
went<00:01:41.920> a<00:01:42.070> little<00:01:42.100> short<00:01:42.640> or<00:01:42.820> ended<00:01:43.060> up<00:01:43.180> with

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
went a little short or ended up with

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.120 
went a little short or ended up with
about<00:01:44.590> two<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.610> half<00:01:45.990> roughly<00:01:46.990> five<00:01:47.409> seven

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
about two and a half roughly five seven

about two and a half roughly five seven
and<00:01:48.189> a<00:01:48.310> half<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.789> then<00:01:49.000> ten<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.649> have<00:01:50.799> to<00:01:50.920> do<00:01:51.009> a

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
and a half and then ten you have to do a

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.440 
and a half and then ten you have to do a
little<00:01:51.189> bit<00:01:51.399> of<00:01:51.430> planning<00:01:51.729> ahead<00:01:51.939> of<00:01:52.060> time<00:01:52.180> to

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
little bit of planning ahead of time to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.910 
little bit of planning ahead of time to
make<00:01:52.479> sure<00:01:52.630> that<00:01:52.869> you<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:53.560> enough<00:01:53.770> material

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
make sure that you have enough material

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.529 
make sure that you have enough material
to<00:01:54.280> go<00:01:54.399> around<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.820> don't<00:01:54.969> just<00:01:55.360> start

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
to go around you don't just start

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:56.940 
to go around you don't just start
cutting<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:55.960> welding<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.469> finding<00:01:56.829> out<00:01:56.920> you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
cutting and welding and finding out you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.520 
cutting and welding and finding out you
don't<00:01:57.189> have<00:01:57.340> enough<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.689> work<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.140> out<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.289> piece

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
don't have enough so work it out a piece

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.490 
don't have enough so work it out a piece
of<00:01:59.560> paper<00:01:59.710> first<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.840> other<00:02:01.990> thing<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.259> want<00:02:02.439> to

of paper first the other thing I want to
mention<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.920> I'm<00:02:03.039> using<00:02:03.219> a<00:02:03.430> simple<00:02:03.850> overlap

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
mention is I'm using a simple overlap

apart<00:02:12.370> bla<00:02:12.580> bla<00:02:12.790> bla<00:02:12.850> so<00:02:13.570> I'll<00:02:13.690> show<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.960> a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
apart bla bla bla so I'll show you a

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.590 
apart bla bla bla so I'll show you a
different<00:02:14.880> connection<00:02:15.880> method<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.480> I've

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
different connection method that I've

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.600 
different connection method that I've
used<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.140> if<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.800> look<00:02:17.980> carefully<00:02:18.160> you'll

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
used and if you look carefully you'll

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.060 
used and if you look carefully you'll
see<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.060> there<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.330> t8<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.110> both<00:02:20.590> sides<00:02:20.890> of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
see that there is t8 on both sides of

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.160 
see that there is t8 on both sides of
the<00:02:21.160> floater<00:02:21.720> essentially<00:02:22.720> what<00:02:22.840> I've<00:02:22.960> done

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
the floater essentially what I've done

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.580 
the floater essentially what I've done
here<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.590> I've<00:02:23.890> made<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:25.500> tippler

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
here is I've made a tippler

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.470 
here is I've made a tippler
typical<00:02:27.370> tip<00:02:27.550> loop<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.940> I've<00:02:28.090> shown<00:02:28.270> in<00:02:28.390> my

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
typical tip loop like I've shown in my

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.800 
typical tip loop like I've shown in my
other<00:02:28.630> videos<00:02:28.989> except<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.430> loop<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.910> about

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
other videos except the loop is about

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.500 
other videos except the loop is about
six<00:02:32.650> inches<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.250> total<00:02:33.400> length<00:02:33.610> three<00:02:34.300> inches

six inches in total length three inches
on<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.780> side<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:36.340> what<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.580> do<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:37.060> cut

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
on the side and then what I do is I cut

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.330 
on the side and then what I do is I cut
the<00:02:37.390> end<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.720> loop<00:02:37.959> insert<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.099> floater

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
the end of that loop insert the floater

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.170 
the end of that loop insert the floater

in between and weld both sides it's very

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.020

strong it'll never come apart the only

strong it'll never come apart the only
thing<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.209> have<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.330> watch<00:02:46.540> out<00:02:46.720> for<00:02:47.019> as<00:02:47.260> usual

thing you have to watch out for as usual

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.809 
thing you have to watch out for as usual
is<00:02:47.860> you<00:02:48.010> have<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.280> be<00:02:48.370> careful<00:02:48.730> not

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
is you have to be careful not

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.030 
is you have to be careful not
overcooking<00:02:49.360> this<00:02:49.630> area<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.200> not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
overcooking this area and not

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.210 
overcooking this area and not
overcooking<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.730> area<00:02:52.060> but<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:54.010> won't

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
overcooking this area but that won't

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.790 
overcooking this area but that won't
come<00:02:54.400> apart<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:55.060> if<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.440> worries

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
come apart so if you if you have worries

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.949 
come apart so if you if you have worries
about<00:02:57.040> doing<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.340> single<00:02:57.550> overlap<00:02:58.030> do<00:02:58.569> a<00:02:58.600> double

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
about doing a single overlap do a double

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.350 
about doing a single overlap do a double
overlap<00:02:59.350> it<00:03:00.280> works<00:03:00.459> just<00:03:00.730> as<00:03:00.850> well<00:03:00.880> it's<00:03:01.239> just

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
overlap it works just as well it's just

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.910 
overlap it works just as well it's just
a<00:03:01.420> little<00:03:01.630> bit<00:03:01.720> more<00:03:01.840> tedious<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.440> do<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
a little bit more tedious to do and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.300 
a little bit more tedious to do and
it'll<00:03:03.819> last<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.090> lifetime<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.950> there<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.280> have

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
it'll last a lifetime so there you have

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.840 
it'll last a lifetime so there you have
it

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
particular wallet I have an orange loop

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.259 
particular wallet I have an orange loop
which<00:03:47.230> tells<00:03:47.530> me<00:03:47.739> that<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.459> 15<00:03:49.030> foot<00:03:49.239> long

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
which tells me that this is 15 foot long

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.050

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
tips before you start welding you should

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.009 
tips before you start welding you should
assemble<00:04:09.549> your<00:04:09.819> materials<00:04:10.329> measure<00:04:10.750> them
