00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
he really gave me was um I had my racks

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.440 
he really gave me was um I had my racks
on<00:01:42.009> my<00:01:42.130> wall<00:01:42.340> were<00:01:42.549> a<00:01:42.579> little<00:01:42.759> bit<00:01:42.969> different

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
on my wall were a little bit different

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.029 
on my wall were a little bit different
and<00:01:43.600> he<00:01:43.990> was<00:01:44.140> like<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.350> know<00:01:44.469> what<00:01:44.649> I<00:01:44.799> think

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.469 
and he was like you know what I think
you<00:01:45.130> should<00:01:45.159> do<00:01:45.430> this<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:46.000> think<00:01:46.060> ever

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
you should do this and I think ever

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.660 
you should do this and I think ever
since<00:01:46.600> he<00:01:46.869> gave<00:01:47.049> me<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.530> opinion<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.369> you

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
since he gave me that opinion and you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.130 
since he gave me that opinion and you
know<00:01:48.789> how<00:01:48.969> he<00:01:49.030> thinks<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.659> should<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.930> it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
know how he thinks that it should be it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.830 
know how he thinks that it should be it
really<00:01:51.070> made<00:01:51.340> a<00:01:51.369> difference<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.030> store<00:01:52.270> so

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840
