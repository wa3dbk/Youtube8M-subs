short<00:02:19.879> very<00:02:20.810> very<00:02:21.680> short<00:02:22.129> and<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:23.120> know<00:02:23.390> I'm

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
short very very short and you know I'm

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.229 
short very very short and you know I'm
not<00:02:23.750> even<00:02:23.989> really<00:02:24.080> sure<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.680> works<00:02:25.340> as<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
not even really sure it works as a

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.509 
not even really sure it works as a
standalone<00:02:26.810> album<00:02:27.349> either<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.980> me<00:02:28.099> this<00:02:28.310> album

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
standalone album either to me this album

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.740 
standalone album either to me this album
just<00:02:28.700> kind<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.060> sounds<00:02:29.360> like<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> very

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
just kind of sounds like a very

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.759 
just kind of sounds like a very
disjointed<00:02:30.670> collection<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.910> b-sides<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
disjointed collection of b-sides and and

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.160 
disjointed collection of b-sides and and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
afterthoughts from clear moon and and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.110 
afterthoughts from clear moon and and
some<00:02:36.379> black<00:02:36.680> metal<00:02:36.950> inspired<00:02:37.430> tracks<00:02:37.819> that

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
some black metal inspired tracks that

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.780 
some black metal inspired tracks that
wouldn't<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:39.049> really<00:02:39.379> logically<00:02:40.220> fit<00:02:40.580> on

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
wouldn't have really logically fit on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.530 
wouldn't have really logically fit on
that<00:02:41.090> album

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that album

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.000 
that album
I<00:02:41.660> don't<00:02:41.900> think<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.319> maybe<00:02:42.500> we're<00:02:42.739> written

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
I don't think and maybe we're written

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.559 
I don't think and maybe we're written
too<00:02:43.190> late<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.549> actually<00:02:43.700> make<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.180> onto<00:02:44.299> wins

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569

drone just like on clear moon he's got
some<00:03:07.610> really<00:03:07.730> kind<00:03:07.940> of<00:03:08.000> sharp<00:03:08.360> guitars<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.560> an

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
well but this song eventually kind of

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.509 
well but this song eventually kind of
segues<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.569> quieter<00:03:15.260> section<00:03:15.739> where<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.340> do

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519
