00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.319
 as an example of having deteriorated 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.460
 plastified paved zucker achieve 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.530
 Zado present the epithelium of the skin 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.710
 skin is composed of two parts 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.710
 main 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.270
 the superficial part is composed of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.550
 epithelial tissue is called the epidermis 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.760
 The deepest part is composed of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.460
 connective tissue and is called a 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.340
 epidermis differs from the dermis 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
 presence of juxtaposed cells while 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.469
 in the dermis to an abundant matrix is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.600
 Cell among epidermal cells is 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.690
 a stratified empire paved 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.719
 stratified zucker because it is 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.370
 formed by several cell layers 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.020
 paved used zucker because the 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.449
 more superficial cells have 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.480
 shape and are impregnated with the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.480
 keratin protein to epidermis usually 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 has four layers the basal layer 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:12.510
 bedridden in pink granular layer and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.030
 corneal layer in the basal layer also 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.369
 called germ extract is the most 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 of the epidermal layers is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.900
 formed by a layer of cells 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.909
 public services on the basis of 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.430
 has an intense division capacity 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.509
 continuously produced new cell phone 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.759
 reports of other cell types 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.250
 the thorny layer is located 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.470
 above the basal layer is formed 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.509
 mainly because the torch those in the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.340
 base of this layer have poetic form 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.590
 and at the apex flattened form bedded 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.380
 is formed by a few layers 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.229
 of flattened queiroz in process of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 apoptosis or the process of death 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.680
 cell phone 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.729
 this layer marks the transition between 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.850
 part alive and dead skin layer 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.310
 cornea is formed by the posts deaths 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.500
 of keratin and lipids that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.649
 confers on this layer resistance to 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.110
 friction waterproofing other function 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.960
 of this layer is to make it difficult for 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.970
 microorganisms the horny layer is 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.560
 constant desquamation process at 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.810
 epidermis as all tissues 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.350
 epithelial cells is attached to a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.440
 connective tissue by a basement membrane 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.050
 remember that epithelial tissues are 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.060
 vascular diseases and are nourished 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 nutrients that diffuse from vessels 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.510
 blood vessels present in the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 adjacent conjunctive 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.250
 in the present case in the dermis
