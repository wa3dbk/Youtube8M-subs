00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
with that I'm ambivalent I think that is

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
with that I'm ambivalent I think that is
it's<00:00:29.160> pretty<00:00:29.340> good<00:00:29.580> because<00:00:30.000> uh<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.720> know

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's pretty good because uh you know

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
it's pretty good because uh you know

we're gonna be saving a lot more trees
and<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.450> makes<00:00:33.600> sense<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.200> know<00:00:34.230> everything's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
and it makes sense you know everything's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.220 
and it makes sense you know everything's
going<00:00:35.160> digital<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.149> natural<00:00:36.600> evolution

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
going digital it's a natural evolution

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.069

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
couple months it's either going in the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.290 
couple months it's either going in the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399

say bookless world where everything's
online<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.710> accurate<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> good

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
online if it's accurate then it's a good

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
online if it's accurate then it's a good

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
thing but if they're so quick to get it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
thing but if they're so quick to get it
out<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.949> they're<00:00:59.070> not<00:00:59.190> fact-checking<00:00:59.730> or

the whole system the printed word has

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.410 
the whole system the printed word has
value<00:01:04.350> beyond<00:01:05.689> what<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:08.420> instantaneously

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
value beyond what can be instantaneously

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810

mark a page I worry about a form of
censorship<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.650> has<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.600> opportunity

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
censorship that just has a opportunity

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
censorship that just has a opportunity
to<00:01:18.960> exist<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.009> digital<00:01:20.189> world<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:20.909> would

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to exist in a digital world how would

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.310 
to exist in a digital world how would
you<00:01:21.090> feel<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.270> schools<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.110> completely

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
you feel about schools going completely

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.230 
you feel about schools going completely
digital<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.009> instead<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.400> having<00:01:23.580> textbooks

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
digital and instead of having textbooks

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840 
digital and instead of having textbooks
having<00:01:24.630> computers<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.710> tablets<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.520> don't

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
having computers and tablets I don't

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.760 
having computers and tablets I don't
think<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.060> would<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.080> mean<00:01:28.619> but

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
think I would like that I mean but

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
think I would like that I mean but
that's<00:01:28.979> me<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.490> yeah<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.119> my

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's me and that's yeah it's my

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.679 
that's me and that's yeah it's my
experience<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.290> awesome<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.689> our

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
experience that be awesome but our

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.910 
experience that be awesome but our
economy<00:01:34.079> can't<00:01:34.259> afford<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> hair<00:01:34.770> right<00:01:34.890> now

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
economy can't afford the hair right now

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.609 
economy can't afford the hair right now
I<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.180> gets<00:01:36.630> information<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.409> kids

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
I think if it gets information to kids

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
I think if it gets information to kids
in<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> cheaper<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.850> widely<00:01:39.299> available

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
in a cheaper and more widely available

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
in a cheaper and more widely available
way<00:01:39.930> that's<00:01:40.170> great<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.920> saves<00:01:41.159> me

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
way that's great and if it saves me

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.219 
way that's great and if it saves me
money<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.610> college<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.270> even<00:01:42.570> better<00:01:42.720> as

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
money in college that's even better as

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.639 
money in college that's even better as
an<00:01:43.530> educator<00:01:44.070> in<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.970> lifelong<00:01:45.780> student<00:01:46.350> I

the<00:02:49.970> online<00:02:50.360> textbook<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.170> why<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.320> hard<00:02:51.500> copy

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
the online textbook so why the hard copy

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.320 
the online textbook so why the hard copy
when<00:02:52.160> it<00:02:52.280> comes<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.580> reading<00:02:52.820> on<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:52.970> computer

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
when it comes to reading on a computer

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.880 
when it comes to reading on a computer
screen<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.780> just<00:02:53.990> I<00:02:54.140> don't<00:02:54.200> know<00:02:54.380> your<00:02:54.770> eyes

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
screen you just I don't know your eyes

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.949 
screen you just I don't know your eyes
zone<00:02:55.190> out<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.459> it's<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.300> little<00:02:56.510> bit<00:02:56.630> harder<00:02:56.930> to

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
zone out and it's a little bit harder to

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.860 
zone out and it's a little bit harder to
digest<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.070> so<00:02:58.220> maybe<00:02:58.580> not<00:02:58.940> getting<00:02:59.570> rid<00:02:59.840> of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
digest and so maybe not getting rid of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.550 
digest and so maybe not getting rid of
books<00:03:01.270> completely<00:03:02.270> because<00:03:02.870> they<00:03:03.050> need<00:03:03.320> to

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
books completely because they need to

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.410 
books completely because they need to
serve<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> purpose<00:03:04.190> for<00:03:04.400> those<00:03:04.790> people<00:03:05.240> who

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
serve a purpose for those people who

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.170 
serve a purpose for those people who
learn<00:03:05.840> best<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.590> way<00:03:06.800> all<00:03:07.220> readings<00:03:07.610> good<00:03:07.880> so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
learn best that way all readings good so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.360 
learn best that way all readings good so
I<00:03:08.420> think<00:03:09.050> if<00:03:09.200> it's<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.530> screen<00:03:09.860> or<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.100> book

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
I think if it's on the screen or a book

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.670 
I think if it's on the screen or a book
it's<00:03:10.640> not<00:03:10.820> gonna<00:03:10.940> matter<00:03:11.290> someday<00:03:12.290> we'll<00:03:12.440> just

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
it's not gonna matter someday we'll just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.290 
it's not gonna matter someday we'll just
have<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> bunch<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.310> tablets<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.060> dump
