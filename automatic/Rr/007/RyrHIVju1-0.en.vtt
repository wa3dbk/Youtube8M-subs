okay<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.880> draw<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.740> helicopter<00:00:25.740> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
okay how do we draw a helicopter and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.620 
okay how do we draw a helicopter and
what<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.750> start<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
what do you want to do is start with a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.170 
what do you want to do is start with a
kind<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.869> an<00:00:31.080> ellipse<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.030> it's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
kind of a an ellipse like that it's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.330 
kind of a an ellipse like that it's
going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> main<00:00:33.750> body<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> then

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
going to be the main body and then

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.360 
going to be the main body and then
follow<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.200> line<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:37.800> around<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
follow this line here down around and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
follow this line here down around and
around<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:39.300> bit<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.899> okay<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.710> that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
around a bit like that okay so that's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
around a bit like that okay so that's
going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.250> kind<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.420> front<00:00:42.690> nose

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
going to be kind of the the front nose

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.900 
going to be kind of the the front nose
section<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.690> then<00:00:45.710> from<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.219> where<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
section and then from here where that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.410 
section and then from here where that
joins<00:00:49.010> I'm<00:00:50.010> gonna<00:00:50.340> bring<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> curve<00:00:51.090> around

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
joins I'm gonna bring a curve around

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
joins I'm gonna bring a curve around
like<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.140> that's<00:00:53.129> gonna<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.489> kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
like that that's gonna be kind of at the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.590 
like that that's gonna be kind of at the
line<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> windows<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> main<00:00:57.390> window

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
line of the windows so the main window

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.510 
line of the windows so the main window
will<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> start<00:00:58.980> there

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
will and to start there

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.110 
will and to start there
another<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.690> curve<00:01:01.160> up<00:01:02.160> there<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> then

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
another little curve up there and then

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.469 
another little curve up there and then
that's<00:01:03.329> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.589> move<00:01:04.670> around<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's going to move around like that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.210 
that's going to move around like that
and<00:01:06.540> that'll<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.560> front<00:01:07.799> wing<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> think

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and that'll be the front wing I think

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.560 
and that'll be the front wing I think
you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> shape<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> coming

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
you can see the shape of it coming

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
you can see the shape of it coming
already<00:01:10.250> they're<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.790> side

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
already they're going to one little side

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.160 
already they're going to one little side
windows<00:01:12.450> down<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.380> as<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.430> like<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
windows down there as well and like that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490 
windows down there as well and like that
good<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:18.299> top<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:19.140> kind<00:01:19.409> of

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
good I'm now up on top here you kind of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.749 
good I'm now up on top here you kind of
got<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.159> engine<00:01:20.810> gubbins<00:01:22.700> kind<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
got all the the engine gubbins kind of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.520 
got all the the engine gubbins kind of
like<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:25.380> that'd<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.979> rotor<00:01:26.610> head

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
like that and that'd be the rotor head

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
like that and that'd be the rotor head
and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.860> sticking<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:29.880> you're

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and then sticking out of the back you're

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.230 
and then sticking out of the back you're
gonna<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.520> how<00:01:32.520> we<00:01:32.579> doing<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.000> yeah

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
gonna have the kind of tail plane

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.260 
gonna have the kind of tail plane
sections<00:01:47.399> coming<00:01:47.700> out<00:01:47.790> there<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.060> you've

sections coming out there and you've
also<00:01:48.420> got<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.840> tail<00:01:49.200> plane<00:01:49.439> sections

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
also got little tail plane sections

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.260 
also got little tail plane sections
sticking<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.369> sideways<00:01:50.670> I'm<00:01:50.970> not<00:01:51.060> quite<00:01:51.240> sure

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
sticking out sideways I'm not quite sure

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.760 
sticking out sideways I'm not quite sure
what<00:01:51.570> they're<00:01:51.750> called<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.229> sure<00:01:52.439> someone

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
what they're called I'm sure someone

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.490 
what they're called I'm sure someone
will<00:01:52.799> let<00:01:53.100> me<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:54.240> let's<00:01:54.869> kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.200> looking

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
will let me know I let's kind of looking

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.060 
will let me know I let's kind of looking
there<00:01:55.850> now<00:01:57.350> you're<00:01:58.350> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> get

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
there now you're going to want to get

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.440 
there now you're going to want to get
this<00:02:00.890> ellipse<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> rotor<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.180> now

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
this ellipse for the rotor in here now

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
this ellipse for the rotor in here now
so<00:02:04.049> that's<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> center<00:02:05.189> as<00:02:05.399> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
so that's going to be the center as you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.170 
so that's going to be the center as you
put<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.790> must<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> bit<00:02:06.299> higher<00:02:07.280> and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.590 

and<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.390> cut<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.990> kind<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.380> feels<00:02:13.680> right

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
and that's cut that kind of feels right

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.670 
and that's cut that kind of feels right
okay<00:02:15.630> at<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.170> angle<00:02:16.560> that's<00:02:17.390> sort<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.680> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
okay at this angle that's sort of it the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.100 
okay at this angle that's sort of it the
rotor<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.520> just<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.540> difficult<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.960> take

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
rotor is just really difficult to take

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.900 
rotor is just really difficult to take
me<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> long<00:02:22.410> time<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.710> work<00:02:22.830> out<00:02:23.070> how<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.640> draw

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
me a long time to work out how to draw

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.340 
me a long time to work out how to draw
the<00:02:23.970> rotor<00:02:24.240> so<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> hope<00:02:24.840> I'm<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> give

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
the rotor so I hope I'm going to give

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.200 
the rotor so I hope I'm going to give
you<00:02:25.440> some<00:02:25.620> tips<00:02:26.550> on<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:28.670> and<00:02:29.670> you're<00:02:30.090> going

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
you some tips on that and you're going

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.870 
you some tips on that and you're going
to<00:02:30.300> see<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.990> skids<00:02:31.350> um<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.700> other

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
to see that the skids um on the other

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.110 
to see that the skids um on the other
side<00:02:33.710> will<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:34.920> be<00:02:35.070> kind<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> sneaking<00:02:35.970> in

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
side will just be kind of sneaking in

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.760 
side will just be kind of sneaking in
underneath<00:02:36.570> there<00:02:36.930> okay<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.740> can

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
underneath there okay I think we can

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.370 
underneath there okay I think we can
draw<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.690> now<00:02:39.960> what<00:02:40.110> I'm<00:02:40.200> going<00:02:40.320> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
draw this in there now what I'm going to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.970 
draw this in there now what I'm going to
do<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.130> draw<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.600> rotor<00:02:42.840> first<00:02:43.320> now

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
do is is draw the the rotor first now

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.720 
do is is draw the the rotor first now
draw<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> line<00:02:44.760> out<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.860> middle<00:02:47.400> right

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
draw a line out to the middle right

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.780 
draw a line out to the middle right
there<00:02:48.590> we're<00:02:49.590> going<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.770> assume<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.760> a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
there we're going to assume this is a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.290 
there we're going to assume this is a
two<00:02:51.060> rotor<00:02:51.800> kind<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.890> plane<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.730> okay

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
two rotor kind of plane like this okay

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.780 
two rotor kind of plane like this okay
so<00:02:55.260> that's<00:02:55.440> kind<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.710> where<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.250> rotor<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.700> of

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
so that's kind of where the rotor is of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.860 
so that's kind of where the rotor is of
the<00:02:56.850> mate<00:02:56.970> we're<00:02:57.150> going<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.510> feeling

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the mate we're going to get this feeling

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.040 
the mate we're going to get this feeling
of<00:02:57.930> speed<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.400> want<00:02:59.520> to<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.790> is<00:03:00.770> just

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
of speed so what you want to do is just

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.210 
of speed so what you want to do is just
draw<00:03:04.050> some<00:03:04.470> little<00:03:04.590> lines<00:03:04.890> hinting<00:03:05.490> at<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
draw some little lines hinting at the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.670 
draw some little lines hinting at the
kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.280> circumference<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.300> where<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.440> rotor

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
kind of circumference of where the rotor

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.550 
kind of circumference of where the rotor
is<00:03:10.920> spinning<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:12.140> don't<00:03:13.140> want<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.320> draw<00:03:13.500> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
is spinning you don't want to draw the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.410 
is spinning you don't want to draw the
whole<00:03:13.860> thing<00:03:14.220> just<00:03:14.459> it's<00:03:14.790> just<00:03:14.850> kind<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.180> very

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
whole thing just it's just kind of very

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.610 
whole thing just it's just kind of very
broken<00:03:15.660> up<00:03:15.870> line<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.730> then<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.209> top<00:03:18.620> of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
broken up line and then as the top of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.860 
broken up line and then as the top of
your<00:03:19.890> rotor<00:03:20.130> blade<00:03:20.490> yeah<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:23.870> following

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
your rotor blade yeah and following

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.110 
your rotor blade yeah and following
these<00:03:25.140> lines<00:03:25.440> out<00:03:25.680> they<00:03:26.520> want<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.730> be<00:03:26.820> quite

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
these lines out they want to be quite

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.510 
these lines out they want to be quite
nice<00:03:28.020> quite<00:03:28.290> close<00:03:28.800> together<00:03:29.040> at<00:03:29.430> the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
nice quite close together at the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.080 
nice quite close together at the
beginning<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.240> then<00:03:30.720> getting<00:03:31.580> further<00:03:32.580> apart

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
beginning and then getting further apart

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.520 
beginning and then getting further apart
because<00:03:33.270> it's<00:03:33.540> going<00:03:33.750> faster<00:03:34.200> at<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> edge

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
because it's going faster at the edge

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
because it's going faster at the edge
and<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:34.950> it's<00:03:35.130> spinning<00:03:35.550> faster<00:03:36.060> as<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.420> you

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and so it's spinning faster as that you

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.350 
and so it's spinning faster as that you
see<00:03:36.720> less<00:03:36.930> of<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.470> see<00:03:37.650> what<00:03:37.860> I<00:03:37.890> mean

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
see less of it if you see what I mean

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.300 
see less of it if you see what I mean
it's<00:03:39.360> kind<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.750> same<00:03:39.930> thickness<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:40.500> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
it's kind of the same thickness but the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.620 
it's kind of the same thickness but the
actual<00:03:41.580> rotor<00:03:41.760> blade<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> same<00:03:42.390> thickness

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
actual rotor blade is the same thickness

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.570 
actual rotor blade is the same thickness
but<00:03:43.050> because<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:43.890> further<00:03:44.190> out<00:03:44.250> it's

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
but because it's further out it's

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.120 
but because it's further out it's
spinning<00:03:45.030> faster<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.620> there's<00:03:46.860> more<00:03:47.040> of

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
spinning faster and so there's more of

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.900 
spinning faster and so there's more of
it<00:03:47.250> spread<00:03:47.670> out

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
it spread out

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.199 
it spread out
well<00:03:48.600> it's<00:03:49.560> physics<00:03:49.980> okay

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
well it's physics okay

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.560 
well it's physics okay
so<00:03:51.420> anyway<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.770> get<00:03:53.010> towards<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.459> edge<00:03:53.760> it

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
so anyway as you get towards the edge it

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.900 
so anyway as you get towards the edge it
will<00:03:54.840> get<00:03:55.080> lighter<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.920> as<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.430> get<00:03:56.580> towards

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
will get lighter and as you get towards

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.030 
will get lighter and as you get towards
the<00:03:57.000> center<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.660> will<00:03:57.690> get<00:03:58.110> darker<00:03:58.590> does<00:03:58.890> that

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the center it will get darker does that

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.190 
the center it will get darker does that
make<00:03:59.160> sense<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.790> then<00:04:00.570> you're<00:04:00.720> gonna<00:04:00.900> want<00:04:01.170> a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
make sense and then you're gonna want a

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.880 
make sense and then you're gonna want a
few<00:04:01.470> more<00:04:01.650> kind<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.209> little<00:04:03.209> whirly<00:04:04.020> marks<00:04:04.709> in

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
few more kind of little whirly marks in

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.020 
few more kind of little whirly marks in
like<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.310> all<00:04:05.970> right<00:04:06.090> then<00:04:06.330> you<00:04:06.420> can<00:04:06.600> draw<00:04:07.110> in

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
like that all right then you can draw in

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.570 
like that all right then you can draw in
this<00:04:09.030> bit<00:04:09.480> that's<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.500> engine<00:04:10.770> housing<00:04:11.310> there

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
this bit that's the engine housing there

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.640 
this bit that's the engine housing there
and<00:04:12.920> follow<00:04:13.920> all<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.370> way<00:04:14.430> around<00:04:14.790> like<00:04:14.940> that

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
and follow all the way around like that

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.120 
and follow all the way around like that
there's<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.859> bubble<00:04:17.239> for<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.330> windscreen

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
there's the bubble for the windscreen

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.819 
there's the bubble for the windscreen
there's<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.370> nose

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
there's the nose

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.920 
there's the nose
bring<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.580> man<00:04:22.639> up<00:04:23.090> don't<00:04:23.419> take<00:04:23.599> that<00:04:23.720> all

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
bring that man up don't take that all

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.499 
bring that man up don't take that all
the<00:04:24.259> way<00:04:24.349> up<00:04:24.470> and<00:04:25.000> simply<00:04:26.000> they<00:04:26.150> don't<00:04:26.360> take

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
the way up and simply they don't take

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.749 
the way up and simply they don't take
that<00:04:26.629> all<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.870> way<00:04:26.960> down<00:04:27.319> there<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:28.550> will

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
that all the way down there that will

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.999 
that all the way down there that will
come<00:04:29.030> all<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.780> way<00:04:29.810> down<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.259> then<00:04:30.409> up<00:04:30.650> to

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
come all the way down and then up to

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.290 
come all the way down and then up to
that<00:04:31.190> tail<00:04:31.520> part<00:04:32.680> bring<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.970> little<00:04:34.970> winged

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
that tail part bring that little winged

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.770 
that tail part bring that little winged
tail<00:04:35.599> wing<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.110> suppose<00:04:36.349> it<00:04:36.500> is<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:37.629> will<00:04:38.629> get

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
tail wing I suppose it is that will get

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.719 
tail wing I suppose it is that will get
underneath<00:04:39.080> it<00:04:39.530> there<00:04:39.830> now<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.550> you've<00:04:40.639> got

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
underneath it there now that you've got

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:41.950 
underneath it there now that you've got
the<00:04:40.819> same<00:04:40.970> thing<00:04:41.030> going<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.509> here<00:04:41.569> with<00:04:41.870> this

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
the same thing going on here with this

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.219 
the same thing going on here with this
tail<00:04:42.199> rotor<00:04:42.610> okay<00:04:43.610> so<00:04:44.449> if<00:04:44.629> you<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:44.780> kind<00:04:45.169> of

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
tail rotor okay so if you just kind of

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.559 
tail rotor okay so if you just kind of
draw<00:04:45.500> a<00:04:47.139> hint<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.409> the<00:04:48.680> edge<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.909> then<00:04:50.210> it

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
draw a hint of the edge and then it

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.320 
draw a hint of the edge and then it
starts<00:04:51.050> off<00:04:51.229> dark<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.919> it<00:04:52.039> gets<00:04:52.310> wider<00:04:53.060> and

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
starts off dark and it gets wider and

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.010 
starts off dark and it gets wider and
wider<00:04:53.389> and<00:04:53.750> wider<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.440> lighter<00:04:54.800> as<00:04:55.159> it<00:04:55.280> goes

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
wider and wider and lighter as it goes

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.659 
wider and wider and lighter as it goes
like<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:57.379> may<00:04:57.650> put<00:04:57.919> some<00:04:57.949> more<00:04:58.219> marks<00:04:58.550> in

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
like that you may put some more marks in

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.700 
like that you may put some more marks in
there<00:04:58.849> and<00:04:59.030> then<00:04:59.120> you<00:04:59.240> little<00:04:59.710> one<00:05:00.710> down<00:05:00.919> below

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
there and then you little one down below

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.879 
there and then you little one down below
put<00:05:03.710> those<00:05:03.830> side<00:05:04.099> windows<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.729> like<00:05:05.150> that

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
put those side windows in like that

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.930 
put those side windows in like that
and<00:05:07.030> your<00:05:08.590> skids<00:05:11.080> coming<00:05:12.080> in<00:05:12.199> there<00:05:12.349> like<00:05:12.590> that

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
and your skids coming in there like that

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:21.279 
and your skids coming in there like that
and<00:05:16.629> like<00:05:17.629> that<00:05:17.690> um<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:19.250> could<00:05:19.400> probably<00:05:20.289> put

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
and like that um you could probably put

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.740 
and like that um you could probably put
the<00:05:22.360> pilot<00:05:23.360> in<00:05:23.479> there<00:05:23.719> with<00:05:23.960> his<00:05:24.080> joystick<00:05:24.349> and

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
the pilot in there with his joystick and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.209 
the pilot in there with his joystick and
then<00:05:26.750> this<00:05:26.870> will<00:05:27.050> be<00:05:27.110> can<00:05:27.620> occur<00:05:27.889> around

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:28.219 
then this will be can occur around

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:32.680 
then this will be can occur around
layers<00:05:28.729> so<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.000> wonder<00:05:29.240> heaven<00:05:31.599> mm-hmm

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
layers so you wonder heaven mm-hmm

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.689 
layers so you wonder heaven mm-hmm
there's<00:05:33.349> the<00:05:33.500> pilot<00:05:34.990> with<00:05:35.990> his<00:05:36.199> joystick<00:05:36.699> as

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
there's the pilot with his joystick as

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.790 
there's the pilot with his joystick as
the<00:05:38.060> engine<00:05:38.539> dies<00:05:38.840> Dublin<00:05:39.199> though<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.529> dial

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
the engine dies Dublin though the dial

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.790 
the engine dies Dublin though the dial
with<00:05:40.099> some<00:05:41.380> controllers<00:05:42.380> as<00:05:42.529> a<00:05:42.560> letter

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
with some controllers as a letter

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.760 
with some controllers as a letter
looking<00:05:43.130> book<00:05:43.419> that's<00:05:44.419> the<00:05:44.509> other<00:05:44.719> side<00:05:45.050> put<00:05:45.710> a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
looking book that's the other side put a

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.730 
looking book that's the other side put a
little<00:05:45.979> bit<00:05:46.099> of<00:05:46.219> wish<00:05:46.849> lines<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:48.380> that<00:05:48.409> would

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
little bit of wish lines so that would

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.600 
little bit of wish lines so that would
be<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:49.569> shininess<00:05:50.569> of<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:50.930> glass<00:05:51.610> because

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
be the shininess of the glass because

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.850 
be the shininess of the glass because
when<00:05:52.940> we<00:05:53.060> can<00:05:53.180> dark<00:05:53.569> her<00:05:53.750> in<00:05:53.900> there<00:05:54.110> and<00:05:54.139> he's

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
when we can dark her in there and he's

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.640 
when we can dark her in there and he's
probably<00:05:55.099> flying<00:05:55.490> down<00:05:55.819> the<00:05:55.940> front<00:05:56.120> and<00:05:56.930> he

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
probably flying down the front and he

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.550 
probably flying down the front and he
could<00:05:57.979> if<00:05:58.819> you're<00:05:59.000> clever<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.659> think<00:05:59.930> maybe<00:06:00.169> put

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
could if you're clever I think maybe put

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.730 
could if you're clever I think maybe put
a<00:06:00.590> kind<00:06:00.889> of<00:06:00.949> a<00:06:01.009> nose<00:06:01.520> cone<00:06:02.229> effect<00:06:03.229> on<00:06:03.469> there

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
a kind of a nose cone effect on there

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.779 
a kind of a nose cone effect on there
and<00:06:04.210> follow<00:06:05.210> that<00:06:05.449> shape<00:06:05.779> around<00:06:06.020> there<00:06:06.789> so

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
and follow that shape around there so

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.249 
and follow that shape around there so
you<00:06:07.879> can<00:06:08.000> put<00:06:08.120> the<00:06:08.210> nose<00:06:08.360> cone<00:06:08.659> kind<00:06:09.020> of<00:06:09.110> like

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
you can put the nose cone kind of like

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:16.659 
you can put the nose cone kind of like
that<00:06:09.500> and<00:06:10.479> you<00:06:11.479> know<00:06:11.659> maybe<00:06:12.169> it's<00:06:13.840> flash<00:06:15.669> thing

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
that and you know maybe it's flash thing

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.300 
that and you know maybe it's flash thing
down<00:06:16.909> the<00:06:17.060> side<00:06:17.330> of<00:06:17.360> it<00:06:19.389> something<00:06:20.389> like<00:06:20.539> that

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
down the side of it something like that

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.310 
down the side of it something like that
and<00:06:21.750> be<00:06:22.750> two<00:06:23.530> six<00:06:24.250> one<00:06:24.630> three<00:06:25.630> I<00:06:25.960> don't<00:06:26.260> know

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
and be two six one three I don't know

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.390 
and be two six one three I don't know
what<00:06:26.470> that<00:06:26.620> means<00:06:26.830> somebody<00:06:27.160> will<00:06:27.310> probably

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
what that means somebody will probably

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.770 
what that means somebody will probably
sue<00:06:27.760> me<00:06:27.910> now<00:06:28.060> because<00:06:28.180> I've<00:06:28.360> used<00:06:28.540> their

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
sue me now because I've used their

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.300 
sue me now because I've used their
number<00:06:29.560> I<00:06:29.620> just<00:06:29.860> made<00:06:30.010> it<00:06:30.160> up<00:06:30.310> sighs<00:06:30.750> okay<00:06:31.750> and

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
number I just made it up sighs okay and

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.110 
number I just made it up sighs okay and
if<00:06:33.310> you<00:06:33.370> put<00:06:33.580> some<00:06:34.350> clouds<00:06:35.350> in<00:06:35.860> there<00:06:36.190> and<00:06:36.550> a

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
if you put some clouds in there and a

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.210 
if you put some clouds in there and a
few<00:06:37.270> little<00:06:37.419> kind<00:06:37.780> of<00:06:37.840> wobble<00:06:38.230> marks<00:06:39.010> like

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
few little kind of wobble marks like

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.120 
few little kind of wobble marks like
that<00:06:39.460> and<00:06:39.700> there<00:06:40.060> you<00:06:40.090> have<00:06:40.210> your<00:06:41.130> cartoon

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130 
that and there you have your cartoon

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.100 
that and there you have your cartoon
helicopter<00:06:42.850> and<00:06:43.210> when<00:06:43.360> you<00:06:43.450> know<00:06:43.570> it's<00:06:43.780> dry

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
helicopter and when you know it's dry

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.690 
helicopter and when you know it's dry
you<00:06:44.440> can<00:06:44.470> just<00:06:44.940> erase<00:06:45.940> all<00:06:46.240> those<00:06:46.600> lines<00:06:47.290> out

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
you can just erase all those lines out

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.510

know how you did it but it's just very

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.720 
know how you did it but it's just very
basic<00:06:54.520> simple<00:06:55.000> shapes<00:06:55.419> which<00:06:55.660> you<00:06:55.780> build<00:06:55.990> on

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
basic simple shapes which you build on

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.340 
basic simple shapes which you build on
and<00:06:57.730> there's<00:06:57.940> your<00:06:58.210> helicopter<00:06:58.810> six<00:06:59.020> minutes

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
and there's your helicopter six minutes

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.380 
and there's your helicopter six minutes
that's<00:06:59.500> big<00:06:59.680> you<00:07:00.550> can<00:07:00.730> put<00:07:00.880> some<00:07:01.000> little<00:07:01.240> bits

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.390 
that's big you can put some little bits

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.260 
that's big you can put some little bits
of<00:07:01.480> shading<00:07:01.990> in<00:07:02.140> like<00:07:02.620> that<00:07:02.950> just<00:07:03.250> to<00:07:03.430> give<00:07:04.240> it

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
of shading in like that just to give it

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.510 
of shading in like that just to give it
a<00:07:04.419> bit<00:07:04.570> of<00:07:04.720> depth<00:07:04.960> you<00:07:05.860> could<00:07:06.100> put<00:07:06.280> a<00:07:06.310> bit<00:07:06.490> of

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
a bit of depth you could put a bit of

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.170 
a bit of depth you could put a bit of
shading<00:07:06.910> in<00:07:07.180> there<00:07:07.419> as<00:07:07.630> well<00:07:07.930> and<00:07:08.320> maybe<00:07:09.180> just

shading in there as well and maybe just

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.180 
shading in there as well and maybe just
round<00:07:10.480> the<00:07:10.600> back<00:07:10.810> there<00:07:11.080> and<00:07:11.380> maybe<00:07:11.680> down<00:07:11.950> the

round the back there and maybe down the

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.670 
round the back there and maybe down the
back<00:07:12.370> banners<00:07:13.180> you<00:07:13.870> can<00:07:14.050> do<00:07:14.169> all<00:07:14.320> sorts<00:07:14.650> of
