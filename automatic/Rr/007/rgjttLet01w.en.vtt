strange<00:02:19.660> to<00:02:19.780> me<00:02:19.989> what's<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.350> long

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
strange to me what's this long

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.460 
strange to me what's this long
three-quarter<00:02:21.820> inch<00:02:21.970> rod<00:02:22.330> doing<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
three-quarter inch rod doing on the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.560 
three-quarter inch rod doing on the
front<00:02:23.709> of<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> boat<00:02:24.190> yeah<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:25.209> call<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.510> a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
front of the boat yeah we call it a

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.900 
front of the boat yeah we call it a
baton<00:02:25.959> same<00:02:26.200> thing<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> rod<00:02:26.860> that's<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.640> guide

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
baton same thing as a rod that's a guide

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.970 
baton same thing as a rod that's a guide
for<00:02:28.330> our<00:02:28.480> plane<00:02:28.810> we're<00:02:29.110> trying<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.500> prepare

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
for our plane we're trying to prepare

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.220 
for our plane we're trying to prepare
landing<00:02:30.640> for<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.970> next<00:02:31.269> plane<00:02:31.570> which<00:02:31.900> laps

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
landing for the next plane which laps

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.500 
landing for the next plane which laps
over<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.800> first<00:02:33.010> plank<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.120> next

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
over the first plank so be this next

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.080 
over the first plank so be this next
planks<00:02:34.810> got<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.080> go<00:02:35.170> in<00:02:35.290> like<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.500> somehow

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
planks got to go in like that somehow

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.090 
planks got to go in like that somehow
exactly<00:02:37.090> there<00:02:37.360> has<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:37.720> be<00:02:37.750> watertight<00:02:38.140> so

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
exactly there has to be watertight so

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.670 
exactly there has to be watertight so
what<00:02:39.459> we've<00:02:39.610> done<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:40.030> devised<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.930> guide<00:02:41.290> on

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
what we've done is devised a guide on

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.710 
what we've done is devised a guide on
the<00:02:41.800> side<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:42.250> plane<00:02:42.610> which<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.450> three

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the side of this plane which is three

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.259 
the side of this plane which is three
quarters<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.260> an<00:02:44.470> inch<00:02:44.709> from<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.670> bottom<00:02:45.880> or

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
quarters of an inch from the bottom or

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.180 
quarters of an inch from the bottom or
the<00:02:46.300> cutting<00:02:46.750> edge<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.230> plane<00:02:47.470> alright<00:02:48.010> so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
the cutting edge of the plane alright so

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.070 
the cutting edge of the plane alright so
at<00:02:48.459> any<00:02:48.670> point<00:02:48.760> this<00:02:49.120> rods<00:02:49.420> can<00:02:49.720> be<00:02:49.810> free

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
at any point this rods can be free

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.170 
at any point this rods can be free
that's<00:02:50.440> a<00:02:50.590> very<00:02:50.890> precise<00:02:51.340> knit<00:02:51.610> yeah<00:02:51.760> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
that's a very precise knit yeah that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.180 
that's a very precise knit yeah that
this<00:02:52.480> rod<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:52.750> three-quarter<00:02:53.590> too<00:02:53.769> so<00:02:53.980> if<00:02:54.070> we

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
this rod is three-quarter too so if we

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.710 
this rod is three-quarter too so if we
lay<00:02:54.340> this<00:02:54.550> on<00:02:54.730> here<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> cutting<00:02:55.540> action

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
lay this on here the cutting action

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.699 
lay this on here the cutting action
takes<00:02:56.200> place<00:02:56.350> as<00:02:56.800> if<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.900> was<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.110> guide<00:02:59.440> on

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
takes place as if there was a guide on

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.229 
takes place as if there was a guide on
the<00:02:59.860> bottom<00:03:00.250> that's<00:03:00.459> where<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:00.820> plank<00:03:01.090> is

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
the bottom that's where the plank is

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.150 
the bottom that's where the plank is
gonna<00:03:01.420> be<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.750> if<00:03:01.810> i<00:03:01.930> push<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:02.350> along<00:03:02.530> here

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
gonna be and if i push this along here

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.490 
gonna be and if i push this along here

using a copper tack you could use a

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.800 
using a copper tack you could use a
rivet<00:03:43.160> here<00:03:43.460> but<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.060> old<00:03:44.210> builders<00:03:44.630> that

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
to lock around the grains so how'd you
