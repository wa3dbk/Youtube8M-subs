00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Why such a dream with super premiums 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.910
 pixel and today we are going to do the analysis of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.650
 the sennheiser rs 180 and I take advantage and they 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.929
 I show front how is it that there are more 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 or less so they realize that both 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.710
 they are occupied by the head, notice that they are 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 headphones circulates oral ie go 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.520
 around the ear are not surmountable 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949
 is innovan is above they go around 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.689
 from the ear the ear or in this case not 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.760
 is touched by absolutely nothing nor 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.560
 nobody pressing direct mixed everything 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.849
 bordered around and if they are pretty 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.800
 big guys but how will I say 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.870
 after they are very light and very comfortable 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 let's see them a little bit more closely 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.100
 that we have in the box the headphones and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.809
 the base we're going to talk a little bit about the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.030
 basis that makes that the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.320
 headphones are wireless we 're going 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 to meet with in the front 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.829
 the on / off button and 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
 also the automatic control of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.910
 gain that is called ls or that as you 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.430
 we say what it is 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.750
 electronics later in the back 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.210
 we will not find with the connectors 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 coaxial for for example the line out 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.199
 left and right that are in the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 audio inces that we want to put sound 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.129
 by some player or whatever 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.990
 we also have an attenuator of 8 should 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.520
 in this case I always light 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.100
 but it must but we can and we want 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.560
 make it dim all eight of these layer 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.299
 down and we have here also the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.009
 connector for power ie the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.479
 transformer that goes to the wall above 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.250
 notice that we are going to understand each other 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 connectors that will touch against the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.299
 headphones that are there to be able 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 charge them just as they are in 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.330
 auctions and that said that we take the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.890
 base here in the box in addition to the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 headphones the base and the cables 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.039
 coaxial we are going to meet with the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.619
 classic 3.5 millimeter collector 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.840
 standard and also that goes towards the other 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.880
 side also to 3.5 millimeters but came 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.709
 luckily with a club adapter 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 great that would go for example even without 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.979
 complicated a guitar or whatever it was 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.119
 so this is good that comes as 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.030
 accessory because sometimes you have to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.020
 buy it and they are not very cheap and apart 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.190
 because we do not feel like a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 hardware store we buy is good that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.310
 come directly in the box if we see 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.429
 the design we will see that we can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.549
 extend the cups to a maximum here to 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.959
 create a head and track and then if 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.780
 we shrink it, let's see that the glasses 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.429
 they can move freely and they go to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 achieve quite well with the head 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.060
 notice that we have an angle of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.640
 separation of what would become this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
 part of here very wide so that they 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.370
 worry I know they're going to be 100 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.620
 very well shod against his head 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 then we have some glasses that if the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.940
 We can throw them out to be able to 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.010
 change them or to access directly to 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.910
 the battery these go with batteries is not 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.110
 forget 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.550
 if we want to clean the glasses also what 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.380
 we can do let's take out the other 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.560
 there is also a battery on each side 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.090
 we are going to put this cup there to click and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.490
 then it's already after we have here 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.930
 also participates in the pad of 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.240
 the top that is the one that goes to 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.190
 tell your head disregard for this 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.780
 lack of medication here are not going to occur 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.310
 because this fits very well with the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.620
 head will never get to touch here 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.970
 up so it will not go away after 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.070
 we have in the part on the right 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.750
 we have the buttons that unfortunately 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.520
 they are very unintuitive they are all 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.470
 together and it's half complicated to 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.420
 beginning remember memory that makes 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.760
 every little thing we have balances that right 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.620
 which we should never touch 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.730
 because if not then we focus for 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.770
 that the adopted unless we have a 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.570
 very good habit after the button 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.100
 turned on and that we touched lit the led 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.170
 and the volume control up and 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.280
 down again they are unintuitive 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.410
 at the beginning they are going to have a channel 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.270
 setting because it's not like a control of 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.860
 Playstation Xbox that we played and 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.810
 we can use it without seeing 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.280
 here is the complicated nest later in 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 the part of the left we do not have anything 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.230
 more than these are particularly 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.060
 good headphones are called open type 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.830
 of headphones that we have here and this 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.870
 means that the back is 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.450
 open to the elements, which is why 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.580
 they are closed and if they never heard 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.570
 headphones of this type are the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.610
 I can describe as follows 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.500
 imagine that you are listening to audio 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.540
 with speakers and the window of his 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.130
 good open room basically it 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.959
 is going to listen like that is to say they are not going to 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.270
 isolate absolutely nothing are going to be able to 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.770
 listen to everything from outside but it's going to 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.360
 listen with using stage a little more 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.490
 broad say as if they were 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.440
 listening in a larger area than 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.670
 with the headphones then let's talk about 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.860
 the sound quality because if you 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.239
 they listen badly for here we want them and the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.850
 true that they sound good enough is 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.400
 very similar sound to the sennheiser h 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.470
 of 202 where we have a treble 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.810
 pretty colored not shrill but 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.190
 colored and some serious that could 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.600
 be a little more controlled but 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.980
 The unfortunate 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.049
 means for me need a little bit 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.150
 more detail they need to deepen a 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.070
 little bit more in the media, although 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.870
 listen very much like the 8 202 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.150
 they listen a little better in genius 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.889
 and sometimes complicated to describe how it 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.389
 listening to headphones although 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.770
 they listen decently well to me for 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.060
 the price as I will say more during 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.250
 the conclusions sure I'm going to 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.320
 repeat and be sure this could win 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.840
 listened a little better but the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.030
 listening experience knows open back 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.889
 it's also a bit different so there's 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.590
 have to take into account this that 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.770
 I said when deciding whether to buy them 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.080
 or not if we talk about the range of 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.240
 the base of the headphones to the 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.010
 headphones we're not going to have drama that 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.320
 traverse some walls now yes what 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.960
 let's extend by 50 meters forget 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.210
 adhesive on the problem and how very good 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.310
 what I have to emphasize is that as 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.930
 that we move away if we take to that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.940
 cut the good signal endorsed was cut 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.800
 but as we move will not 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.930
 lower the sound quality and that for me 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.010
 it's very very important because if we do not go 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.110
 to have to be around all the time 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.940
 of the base and this would give us good as well 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.039
 which in general seemed to me to be 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.370
 pretty well done and let's talk about the subject 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.840
 of comfort there are no circus headphones 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.190
 murals is to say that they go around 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.830
 whole ear notice that here I would enter 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.270
 the whole ear with the middle does not touch 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.560
 absolutely no part the ear 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.889
 all this proper this goes 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.300
 otherwise we will say it again no 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:37.380
 there are headphones like this but from there 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.450
 but that they are more comfortable for long 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.570
 listening sessions that these up 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.130
 now all that it provides are 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.110
 impressively comfortable but 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.400
 It really is important because 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.100
 substitution I can have in my 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.160
 head for 4 hours 5 hours and they are so 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.690
 light and so comfortable because the stain 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.510
 it's not even that it squeezes a lot 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.060
 annoying for nothing that can really 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.200
 use them for hours and we can even 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.760
 example we have to cook 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.430
 listen to music and forget that 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.930
 we have over and keep listening to that 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.620
 it's great if what you're looking for is 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.550
 comfort 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.280
 this is unbeatable really is very very 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.560
 good the comfort of ere ere 180 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.850
 I wish I had them that comfortable in 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.470
 other skills that will be heard 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.200
 best 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.550
 but it's really impressive how well 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.590
 that feels in the head indicates it to the 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.420
 sant and what little bothers things that 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.920
 for me it is key as conclusion 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.720
 I sincerely believe that they could have 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.250
 listened a little better is to say the 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.410
 quality heard as I told you is 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.810
 pretty similar a little better like 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.130
 that of the h of 202 that are basically 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.810
 the best selling headphones in high 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.050
 near argentina and they are quite 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.700
 known I think they are expensive for the 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.400
 audio quality that they offer now yes 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.889
 we are talking purely in comfort 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.199
 only of comfort 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.749
 they are unbeatable they really are great 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:56.939
 because they are super super comfortable very 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:59.279
 light as I said and if again 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:07:00.060
 if you are looking for comfort so far for me 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.159
 there is no better option 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.169
 I can be with these places 8 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.419
 hours and I dared to give an account of what 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.550
 really exceedingly comfortable that they are 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.729
 so if they look for those barbarians and they 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.199
 they look for super quality hype there is important 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:15.629
 and recontra detailed with a sound 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.370
 huge station they will not find it is 

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.870
 say they listen well but could 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.770
 have listened a little better like that 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.419
 that now it's up to you tell me 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.849
 under the comments they thought if the 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.889
 they would buy or not and if they already have them 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:29.029
 they think and why and we see each other in 

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:29.029
 next videos 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.890
 if you liked it because you did not like it 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:40.180
 we have social networks and you can all 

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:43.180
 subscribe also the truth 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.180
