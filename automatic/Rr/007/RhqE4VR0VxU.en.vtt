00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.590 
sag up to just over a thousand pounds of
load<00:00:39.289> so<00:00:40.010> pretty<00:00:40.309> impressive<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.059> their

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
load so pretty impressive and their

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.809 
load so pretty impressive and their
valve<00:00:41.839> so<00:00:42.229> that<00:00:42.260> when<00:00:42.649> you<00:00:43.039> don't<00:00:43.249> have<00:00:43.370> a<00:00:43.519> load

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:43.819 
valve so that when you don't have a load

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.270 
valve so that when you don't have a load
they<00:00:44.600> ride<00:00:44.870> like<00:00:45.109> they're<00:00:45.319> OEM<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.069> when<00:00:46.190> you

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
they ride like they're OEM and when you

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.549 
they ride like they're OEM and when you
do<00:00:46.429> have<00:00:46.609> our<00:00:46.969> load<00:00:47.210> they<00:00:47.960> automatically

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
do have our load they automatically

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.099 
do have our load they automatically
adjust<00:00:49.069> and<00:00:49.309> stiffen<00:00:50.089> up<00:00:50.179> your<00:00:50.389> the<00:00:50.749> rear<00:00:50.960> end

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
adjust and stiffen up your the rear end

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.139 
adjust and stiffen up your the rear end
of<00:00:51.199> your<00:00:51.260> vehicle<00:00:51.739> which<00:00:52.249> makes<00:00:52.519> it<00:00:52.760> more

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
of your vehicle which makes it more

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.689 
of your vehicle which makes it more
comfortable<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.839> more<00:00:54.379> importantly<00:00:54.889> safer

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
comfortable and more importantly safer

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.189 
comfortable and more importantly safer
while<00:00:56.059> traveling<00:00:56.569> down<00:00:56.749> the<00:00:56.899> highway

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
while traveling down the highway

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.379 
while traveling down the highway
so<00:00:57.739> basically<00:00:58.249> we're<00:00:58.519> it<00:00:58.609> on<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.850> street<00:00:59.149> this

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
so basically we're it on the street this

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:06.700 
so basically we're it on the street this
is<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.600> way<00:00:59.870> to<00:00:59.929> go

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.260 

so<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.700> shocks<00:01:09.000> on

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so as we going to put these shocks on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.510 
so as we going to put these shocks on
these<00:01:09.480> can<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.050> difficult

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
these can be a really difficult

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.500 
these can be a really difficult
installation<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.730> can<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.060> very

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
installation or they can be a very very

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.540 
installation or they can be a very very
easy<00:01:12.840> installation<00:01:13.410> we<00:01:13.830> did<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.160> hard<00:01:14.370> way

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
easy installation we did in the hard way

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.120 
easy installation we did in the hard way
first<00:01:14.910> the<00:01:15.690> hard<00:01:15.900> way<00:01:16.080> looks<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
first the hard way looks like this you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.250 
first the hard way looks like this you
jack<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.940> rear<00:01:18.240> differential<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
jack it up by the rear differential and

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.800 
jack it up by the rear differential and
that<00:01:19.740> compresses<00:01:20.250> your<00:01:20.610> suspension<00:01:21.270> clear<00:01:21.600> up

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that compresses your suspension clear up

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.930 
that compresses your suspension clear up
and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.290> when<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.590> put<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.070> bloat

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
and then when you go to put the bloat

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.300 
and then when you go to put the bloat
adjusting<00:01:24.540> tight<00:01:24.869> adjusting<00:01:25.680> shocks<00:01:26.010> on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
adjusting tight adjusting shocks on

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.609 
adjusting tight adjusting shocks on
you'll<00:01:27.090> find<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.540> they're<00:01:27.810> sticking<00:01:28.380> clear

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you'll find that they're sticking clear

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.130 
you'll find that they're sticking clear
down<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:29.760> four<00:01:30.240> or<00:01:30.330> five<00:01:30.479> inches<00:01:30.510> below

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
down about four or five inches below

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.120 
down about four or five inches below
where<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.040> point<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.690> contact<00:01:33.690> or<00:01:34.130> fastening

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
where the point of contact or fastening

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.430 
where the point of contact or fastening
is<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.910> so<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.180> have<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> jack<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.170> push

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
is and so you have to use a jack to push

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.950 
is and so you have to use a jack to push
it<00:01:37.590> up<00:01:37.680> into<00:01:37.800> place<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.580> then<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.660> and

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it up into place and then get it in and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
it up into place and then get it in and
you're<00:01:40.050> working<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.500> pry<00:01:40.800> bar<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.550> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you're working with a pry bar in here in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910 
you're working with a pry bar in here in

is<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:56.940> really<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:57.630> easy<00:01:58.020> job<00:01:58.410> if<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
is a really really easy job if you do it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.810 
is a really really easy job if you do it
my<00:01:59.310> way<00:01:59.580> my<00:02:00.509> way<00:02:00.539> is<00:02:01.050> support<00:02:02.039> it<00:02:02.160> by<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.369> frame

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
my way my way is support it by the frame

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.790 
my way my way is support it by the frame
in<00:02:03.090> front<00:02:03.539> of<00:02:03.630> these<00:02:03.750> control<00:02:04.229> arms<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.770> you

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
in front of these control arms if you

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.010 
in front of these control arms if you
follow<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.369> control<00:02:05.729> arm<00:02:05.970> forward<00:02:06.479> there's<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
follow the control arm forward there's a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380 
follow the control arm forward there's a
little<00:02:07.350> box<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> frame<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
little box and then the frame it's

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.850 
little box and then the frame it's
double<00:02:09.750> layered<00:02:10.049> that's<00:02:10.290> where<00:02:10.500> we<00:02:10.649> have

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
double layered that's where we have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280 
double layered that's where we have
those<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.400> then<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.239> had<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.510> Jack<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.959> up<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
those and then we had to Jack this up a

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.870 
those and then we had to Jack this up a
little<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.739> because<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.280> way<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.760> it

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
little bit because the way we have it

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.199 
little bit because the way we have it
now<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.420> you'll<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.530> near<00:02:16.709> future

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
now as you'll see in the near future

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.990 
now as you'll see in the near future
these<00:02:18.209> shocks<00:02:18.540> will<00:02:19.080> be<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.650> exactly<00:02:20.340> lined

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
these shocks will be right exactly lined

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.240 
these shocks will be right exactly lined
up<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.540> be<00:02:21.720> where<00:02:21.989> they<00:02:22.140> need<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.350> be<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.860> was

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
up to be where they need to be I was

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.520 
up to be where they need to be I was
upside<00:02:23.580> down<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.480> idea<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.500> I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
upside down but you get the idea so I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.550 
upside down but you get the idea so I
have<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.799> 15<00:02:26.280> millimeter<00:02:26.640> socket<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.630> also<00:02:28.170> have

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
have a 15 millimeter socket I also have

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.380 
have a 15 millimeter socket I also have
a<00:02:28.590> 14<00:02:29.130> millimeter<00:02:29.370> wrench<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.150> could<00:02:30.269> be

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
a 14 millimeter wrench it could be

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.750 
a 14 millimeter wrench it could be
half-inch<00:02:30.870> or<00:02:31.049> whatever

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
half-inch or whatever

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.780 
half-inch or whatever
basically<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.720> put<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.989> your<00:02:34.140> 15<00:02:34.500> millimeter

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
basically you put on your 15 millimeter

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.280 
basically you put on your 15 millimeter
back<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:36.000> out<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.180> little<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.450> then<00:02:39.870> it's<00:02:40.019> just

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
back it out a little and then it's just

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
back it out a little and then it's just
going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.560> that's<00:02:41.310> where<00:02:41.610> your<00:02:41.730> wrench<00:02:41.970> comes

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
going to that's where your wrench comes

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.310 
going to that's where your wrench comes
in<00:02:42.660> put<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> wrench<00:02:43.620> here<00:02:44.750> and<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.959> pull<00:02:46.170> it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
in put the wrench here and just pull it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.770 
in put the wrench here and just pull it
out<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.590> rest<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> way<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:48.390> makes<00:02:48.630> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
out the rest of the way that makes it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.850 
out the rest of the way that makes it
really<00:02:48.989> easy<00:02:50.329> and<00:02:51.329> then<00:02:51.600> you're<00:02:52.049> shot<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.620> see

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
really easy and then you're shot you see

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.800 
really easy and then you're shot you see
that<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> just<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.640> rut<00:02:54.180> just<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.630> right

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that it's just a rut just the right

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.319 
that it's just a rut just the right
position<00:02:55.100> where<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.280> back<00:02:56.459> axles<00:02:56.940> hanging

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
position where the back axles hanging

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.509 
position where the back axles hanging
down<00:02:57.540> but<00:02:57.780> supported<00:02:58.410> where<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.769> matches<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
down but supported where it matches the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.410 
down but supported where it matches the
link<00:03:00.269> criteria<00:03:01.049> needed<00:03:01.670> as<00:03:02.670> I<00:03:02.820> said<00:03:03.030> earlier

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
link criteria needed as I said earlier

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.539 
link criteria needed as I said earlier
these<00:03:03.600> are<00:03:03.840> also<00:03:04.110> kind<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.890> height<00:03:05.100> adjust

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
these are also kind of a height adjust

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.220 
these are also kind of a height adjust
they<00:03:05.940> raise<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.360> back<00:03:06.540> end<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> vehicle

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
they raise the back end of the vehicle

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.840 
they raise the back end of the vehicle
up<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:07.980> bit<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.549> give<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.730> that

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
same size it's the 15 millimeter you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.800 
same size it's the 15 millimeter you
just<00:03:32.709> reach<00:03:32.920> in<00:03:33.189> there<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.970> it's<00:03:34.329> supported

of spring when you do gunsmithing
the<00:05:02.660> springs<00:05:03.110> are<00:05:03.290> some<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.620> hardest

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
the springs are some of the hardest
