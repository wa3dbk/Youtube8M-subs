the left of the stoplight okay so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.420 
the left of the stoplight okay so
installation<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> immediately<00:00:54.780> underneath

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
installation is immediately underneath

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.400 
installation is immediately underneath
the<00:00:56.430> stalk<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> rearview

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the stalk for the for the rearview

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:08.810 
the stalk for the for the rearview
mirror<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:02.149> wiring<00:01:05.810> just<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.670> this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
mirror and wiring just here so in this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
mirror and wiring just here so in this
particular<00:01:09.090> case<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.750> two<00:01:09.960> channels<00:01:10.350> so

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
particular case is two channels so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
particular case is two channels so
there's<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.250> additional<00:01:11.460> wire<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there's an additional wire so one is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.070 
there's an additional wire so one is
power<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> left<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> connection<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
power to the left and the connection to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.859 
power to the left and the connection to
the<00:01:16.170> rear<00:01:16.320> camera<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> right<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the rear camera to the to the right it

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.870 
the rear camera to the to the right it
travels<00:01:19.320> up<00:01:22.040> travels<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.159> behind<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> rear

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
travels up travels up behind the rear

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.569 
travels up travels up behind the rear
view<00:01:24.119> mirror<00:01:24.720> mount<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:28.400> this<00:01:29.400> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
view mirror mount and then this is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.719 
view mirror mount and then this is
really<00:01:29.790> hard<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.750> along<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.729> inside

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
really hard to do then along the inside

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.819 
really hard to do then along the inside
the<00:01:32.880> headlining<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.049> bring<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the headlining and then I bring it I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.630 
the headlining and then I bring it I
brought<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:38.960> just<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:41.430> then

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
brought it down just here and then

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.270 
brought it down just here and then
wrapped<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.240> inside<00:01:44.360> inside<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.600> rubber

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
wrapped it inside inside this rubber

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.969 
wrapped it inside inside this rubber

so in back of the car comes along and

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.310 
so in back of the car comes along and
one<00:02:04.680> wire<00:02:04.890> then<00:02:05.160> branches<00:02:05.640> out<00:02:06.170> through<00:02:07.170> this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
one wire then branches out through this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.590 
one wire then branches out through this
connection<00:02:07.650> here<00:02:08.190> inside<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.240> headlining

six hours but you can have it all the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.390 
six hours but you can have it all the
way<00:03:42.090> through<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.420> infinity<00:03:43.160> these<00:03:44.160> two

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
way through to infinity these two

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.070 
way through to infinity these two
switches<00:03:44.700> here<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.450> and<00:03:45.569> two

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
switches here one and two

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.550 
switches here one and two
control<00:03:46.819> control<00:03:47.819> the<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:51.290> voltage<00:03:52.290> shut

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
control control the the voltage shut

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.400 
control control the the voltage shut
down<00:03:52.739> on<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.980> battery<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.900> at<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.989> moment<00:03:55.110> set

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
down on the battery so at the moment set

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.100 
down on the battery so at the moment set
for<00:03:55.560> eleven<00:03:55.830> point<00:03:56.010> eight<00:03:56.630> that<00:03:57.630> would<00:03:57.810> set<00:03:57.989> it

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
for eleven point eight that would set it

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.620 
for eleven point eight that would set it
to<00:03:58.200> 12<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.190> when<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.910> battery<00:04:00.209> gets<00:04:00.330> down<00:04:00.599> to

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
to 12 so when the battery gets down to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.070 
to 12 so when the battery gets down to
12<00:04:00.989> volts<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.280> system<00:04:03.239> will<00:04:03.360> shut<00:04:03.540> down<00:04:03.599> so<00:04:04.019> it

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
12 volts the system will shut down so it

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.830 
12 volts the system will shut down so it
doesn't<00:04:04.110> drain<00:04:04.470> your<00:04:04.560> battery<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.690> hope<00:04:06.690> that

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
doesn't drain your battery I hope that

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.140 
doesn't drain your battery I hope that
helps
