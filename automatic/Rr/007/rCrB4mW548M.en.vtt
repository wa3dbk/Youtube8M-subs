to<00:00:29.470> me<00:00:29.770> and<00:00:30.070> they<00:00:30.820> were<00:00:30.880> probably<00:00:31.119> all

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
to me and they were probably all

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.260 
to me and they were probably all
wonderful<00:00:31.899> but<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.550> focused<00:00:33.550> on<00:00:33.700> the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
wonderful but I focused on the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.450 
wonderful but I focused on the
credentials<00:00:34.930> of<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.260> doctors<00:00:35.680> and<00:00:36.100> I<00:00:36.340> was

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
really impressed with dr. Wernicke I

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.500 
really impressed with dr. Wernicke I
would<00:00:39.399> have<00:00:39.489> liked<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.699> have<00:00:39.910> had<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.120> video

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510

like<00:00:40.989> this<00:00:41.019> to<00:00:41.829> help<00:00:42.100> me<00:00:42.309> make<00:00:42.550> my<00:00:42.730> decision

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
like this to help me make my decision

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.520 
like this to help me make my decision
because<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.510> did<00:00:43.809> delay<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.769> lot<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.499> have<00:00:47.499> I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
because I did delay it a lot and have I

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.369 
because I did delay it a lot and have I
had<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:47.949> it<00:00:48.160> would<00:00:48.280> have<00:00:48.370> helped<00:00:48.640> but<00:00:49.379> many

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
had this it would have helped but many

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.099 
had this it would have helped but many
of<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.649> surgeons<00:00:51.519> probably<00:00:52.480> would<00:00:52.870> have<00:00:52.929> been

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
of the surgeons probably would have been

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.160 
of the surgeons probably would have been
just<00:00:53.379> as<00:00:53.530> good<00:00:53.710> or<00:00:53.769> as<00:00:54.010> good<00:00:54.399> maybe<00:00:54.640> but<00:00:55.359> I<00:00:55.659> just

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
just as good or as good maybe but I just

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.439 
just as good or as good maybe but I just
my<00:00:56.679> gut<00:00:56.859> kept<00:00:57.100> going<00:00:57.370> back<00:00:57.519> to<00:00:57.699> dr.<00:00:58.059> Wernicke

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.130 
my gut kept going back to dr. Wernicke
and<00:00:58.839> that's<00:00:59.499> why<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.769> chose<00:01:00.069> him
