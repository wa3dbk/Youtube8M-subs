so<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.420> was<00:02:10.539> getting<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> little<00:02:10.869> discouraged

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
so I was getting a little discouraged

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.590 
so I was getting a little discouraged
and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:11.799> that<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.310> young<00:02:12.610> 8-point<00:02:13.150> came<00:02:13.390> up

and then that this young 8-point came up

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.009 
and then that this young 8-point came up
and<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.769> know<00:02:14.920> he's<00:02:15.040> he's<00:02:16.000> got<00:02:16.239> some<00:02:16.540> he's<00:02:16.810> got

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
and you know he's he's got some he's got

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.320 
and you know he's he's got some he's got
nice<00:02:17.230> antlers<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:17.950> he's<00:02:18.130> his<00:02:18.730> body<00:02:19.030> looks

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330

so I figured you know it's hard to top

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.229 
so I figured you know it's hard to top

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
don't reproduce so it looks like it's

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.620 
don't reproduce so it looks like it's
kind<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.370> paying<00:03:21.609> off<00:03:21.819> we've<00:03:22.209> been<00:03:22.299> doing<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
kind of paying off we've been doing it

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.099

for<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:23.109> long<00:03:23.410> time<00:03:23.650> now<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:25.109> hopefully

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
for a long time now and hopefully

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.140 
for a long time now and hopefully
hopefully<00:03:26.920> neighbors<00:03:27.549> will<00:03:27.670> be<00:03:27.790> doing<00:03:28.060> the

hopefully neighbors will be doing the

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.420 
hopefully neighbors will be doing the
same<00:03:28.299> thing<00:03:28.630> because<00:03:29.100> everybody's<00:03:30.100> hunting
