00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:14.680
 Hello tunnel channel are you increase the video of the work relationship that always say I today 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:18.080
 I'm up to now , but my profile video 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.530
 I want to apply 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.530
 Par 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.150
 The name is written as nele and is called sleep 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 It is the origin of the name but there is no reason in particular 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.990
 I was variously thought I so wanted to form of n 2-channel what people tb 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:48.500
 I didn't know what to say and I put it on the channel nails 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.500
 dee 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.640
 If you are in the age of 20, I am in my twenties 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.350
 yeah 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.890
 It is moon because it is private for a while 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.370
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.370
 Yup 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:15.260
 The tree that started the emergency is about 5 years ago 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.120
 The reason I started is written in detail on the blog, but I will start under the influence of my brother 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.230
 It became 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.230
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:29.970
 I often do very glad if I have suggestions Toka does not have any trade 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.520
 Many things can be won in common with my brother 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.020
 Let's go too much because it will be a variety of songs 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.080
 I can't afford the cards that have them or that's what I'm trading now 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.160
 I do not think 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.160
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.049
 It is interpersonal relationship 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420
 what's called ads 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:01.410
 I think I'm pretty much everyone going there, so I think I'm going to fight and I'm still a little 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 I'm there is seen once more of the site I rather be've done ad scheme 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.150
 It seems that it is difficult to set up a little 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.510
 I have not introduced 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:17.730
 This video creation and crab now a little busy after 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:21.920
 It is the present condition that there is no place to get used to yet, and there is no time to do it now 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.920
 In fact it relies say Toka rail 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.780
 I'd see people are quite doing in Toka wall of 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.780
 Over there 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.790
 Hitomi I'm a stranger 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.750
 [musics] 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:42.230
 I 'm so nervous that I never have to dale 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.409
 Actually so 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.390
 Do I have thought that if it is not now possible to rule 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.390
 That's easy, but it looks like this 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.010
 Self-introduction videos 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.110
 I was allowed to shoot 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:04.819
 If you want to hear something again 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:07.160
 I think that I would like to answer as long as I can write in the comment section if there is any 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:14.930
 It was more than a joint channel 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.930
