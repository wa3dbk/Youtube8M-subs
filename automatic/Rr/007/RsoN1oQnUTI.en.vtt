00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.420
 hello and welcome one more day to another 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.360
 three w video is hunting fishing and diving 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.420
 today we are going to fish the carp with a choke 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.660
 for this we are going to use 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.180
 cane in this telescopic case that is a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.840
 little tougher than normal good 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.520
 in addition to that we are going to use a 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.120
 fish hook 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.680
 a sledgehammer and a primer in terms of 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.890
 the primers tell you that there are 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.750
 different types we have this one that goes the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.350
 last thread and this is where the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.910
 ball the difference between this and this is 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.390
 that is our hook we put it 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.750
 inside the primer and here and here is not worth 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.570
 well then let's proceed to put it on 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.420
 take the primer is worth in this case I 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.150
 I'm going to take this for as you can see we're going to 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.560
 pass it here 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.560
 we will go through the thread 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.909
 6 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.880
 that is a closer to run 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.060
 once we have the primer we are going to 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.369
 put the emery knife and sometimes I put 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.899
 from the primer to the slag a ballot by 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.000
 if anything so that the cut with the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.000
 Muddle is not too big 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 that 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.659
 but 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.479
 we're 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.479
 We cut the excess right 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.870
 and then we will place our hook 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.870
 as I have placed a sledgehammer 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.509
 I have prepared one of the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.290
 characteristics that our 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.990
 low line is to be short as well as 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.070
 other times it goes longer is a little bit 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.740
 make it short 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.600
 what I do also to this bass of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 line is 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.190
 and put a small lead 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.640
 so that it stays floating outside the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.069
 primer 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.840
 good and now we have it for your 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:26.370
 next is 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.370
 fill our primer 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 for this we already have the reserved 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.550
 prepared vale 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.640
 what we do is embed what's good 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.110
 everything we tighten a little bit either 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.110
 too much because we do not want to 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.500
 come out and as I said in this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.240
 primed in one of the things that I do 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.240
 It's the hook 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.840
 we find 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.840
 we put the hook inside the priming 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.800
 a little bit 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.420
 so when they dissolve the on the ground 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.430
 it comes out and stays free 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.459
 Well, this is all, it is not very 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.910
 complicated voucher let's proceed to 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.910
 throw 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.319
 for this video I will also have 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.230
 the collaboration of a friend of mine is 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.459
 Javier a 16 year old fisherman 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.459
 that will be fine 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.160
 I tried to take out the tent by this system 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.160
 we put it already we have it launched we put 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.390
 our street 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 very important thing you have to open 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.310
 loosen the spool so that when the 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.070
 carp itch do not notice resistance and 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.140
 then he and the poplars good for today 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.460
 we have javi here who is the one who is going 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.490
 to act as a collaborator and will try 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.270
 take out some marquee with the system 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.270
 primer 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.360
 As you can see, what he is doing is 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.440
 fill the primer once 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.440
 fill in the primer 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.090
 puts the bait on the hook in this case 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:20.900
 corn you can put putty worms and what 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.389
 introduces a tad in the primer then 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.160
 I cover it for without paying much because 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.270
 it gets prepared very much it would take a long time to leave 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.389
 of the hook is valid and already available 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.389
 throw 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.719
 As you can see, our little 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.969
 great collaborator javier and now he's going to 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:07.810
 try to take it out one of the things 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:10.599
 main thing is the cane always 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.870
 very high to try to climb the maximum 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:15.310
 possible to the tent because since one of 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.960
 The advantages of the tent are 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.810
 when erase has great strength 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.060
 then he will always try to have it 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.389
 up and dominate the direction of the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.389
 letter 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.200
 You see a lot of patience when he notices 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.200
 that loose a little bit because it already takes and goes 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.560
 picking up some spool laps like that 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.800
 until finally I have it in the sac 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.800
 dora 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.039
 this time it is a tent 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:24.909
 pretty pity since javier like 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:28.969
 You see, it's costing him a lot to get the 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:31.849
 important not to force it to not break and 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:36.069
 especially also the address put 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.069
 that can be entangled in the toys 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.930
 all right 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:54.479
 i 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:16.069
 this time as you are watching javi 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:18.199
 in addition to carp is brought half swamp is 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:21.259
 important always put it out for 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.969
 below and not move it until the 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:29.050
 tent over once the 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:29.050
 tent over rose and bravo 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.810
 good friends because in this video and you 

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:06.530
 we have taught little catch the conservative 

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:09.910
 here has been the artist of today and 

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.910
 I wait for another video 

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.630
 Y
