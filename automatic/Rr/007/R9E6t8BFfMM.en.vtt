00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
expand out into the actual room so they

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
expand out into the actual room so they
actually<00:00:47.700> made<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
actually made it so that it was just the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.529 
actually made it so that it was just the
full<00:00:49.649> room<00:00:49.950> even<00:00:50.850> before<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.149> walked<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
full room even before you walked in

full room even before you walked in
there<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.079> was<00:00:52.620> definitely<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.219> cool

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
there so that was definitely really cool

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700

with<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.030> 3d<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.660> know<00:00:54.750> obviously<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.260> first

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
with a 3d you know obviously I first

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.639 
with a 3d you know obviously I first
started<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> game<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> 3d<00:00:57.570> effect<00:00:57.649> but

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
started the game with the 3d effect but

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.020 
started the game with the 3d effect but
after<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.010> while<00:00:59.129> I've<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.579> been<00:00:59.730> putting<00:00:59.969> on

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
after a while I've just been putting on

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
after a while I've just been putting on
the<00:01:00.149> 3d<00:01:00.390> effect<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.840> cutscenes<00:01:01.350> because

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the 3d effect with the cutscenes because

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
the 3d effect with the cutscenes because
it<00:01:01.890> seems<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.789> cutscenes<00:01:03.239> had<00:01:03.449> cooler

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
it seems like the cutscenes had cooler

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.230 
it seems like the cutscenes had cooler
3d<00:01:04.199> effects<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.890> um<00:01:05.070> every<00:01:05.939> once<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
sped up really fast or slow down on a

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.650

lot<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.560> cutscenes<00:02:51.010> seem<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.640> I<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:52.450> kind

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
lot of the cutscenes seem to I just kind

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.330 
lot of the cutscenes seem to I just kind
of<00:02:52.780> speed<00:02:53.410> through<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.860> seems<00:02:54.100> like<00:02:54.250> they

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
of speed through it seems like they

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.490 
of speed through it seems like they
really<00:02:54.489> sped<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:54.940> up<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.330> obviously<00:02:56.140> they've

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
really sped it up on obviously they've

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.930 
really sped it up on obviously they've
been<00:02:56.709> getting<00:02:56.830> probably<00:02:57.370> complaints<00:02:57.820> about

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
been getting probably complaints about

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.570 
been getting probably complaints about
how<00:02:58.270> slow<00:02:58.780> some<00:02:59.080> cuttings<00:02:59.500> are<00:02:59.650> or<00:03:00.100> even<00:03:00.489> the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
how slow some cuttings are or even the

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.940 
how slow some cuttings are or even the
text<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.120> know<00:03:01.209> all<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.480> text<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.050> um<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.800> no

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
text you know all the text is um it's no

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.320 
text you know all the text is um it's no
longer<00:03:03.190> centered<00:03:03.700> which<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.030> kind<00:03:04.239> of

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
longer centered which is kind of

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.840 
longer centered which is kind of
annoying<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.830> know<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.220> whatever<00:03:06.580> but

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
annoying but you know it's whatever but

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.850 
annoying but you know it's whatever but
they<00:03:06.970> definitely<00:03:07.180> sped<00:03:07.540> up<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.660> text<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
they definitely sped up the text and the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.100 
they definitely sped up the text and the
actual<00:03:09.190> cutscenes<00:03:09.760> or<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.810> regular

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
actual cutscenes or just regular

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.100 
actual cutscenes or just regular
gameplay<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:12.760> on<00:03:13.030> some<00:03:13.690> parts<00:03:13.959> I'm

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
gameplay of it so on some parts I'm

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.870 
gameplay of it so on some parts I'm
thankful<00:03:14.410> for<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.800> but<00:03:15.250> other<00:03:15.400> parts<00:03:15.640> I'm

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
thankful for that but other parts I'm

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.640 
thankful for that but other parts I'm
just<00:03:16.030> kind<00:03:16.209> of<00:03:16.270> like<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.959> really<00:03:17.140> loses<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
just kind of like it really loses the

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.640 
just kind of like it really loses the
effect<00:03:17.739> when<00:03:18.190> it's<00:03:18.310> not<00:03:18.489> slow<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.030> dramatic

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
effect when it's not slow and dramatic

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
doing it ok back to the textures I'm

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.330 
doing it ok back to the textures I'm
normally<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.390> don't<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.930> when<00:03:56.260> games<00:03:56.530> have

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
normally I don't like when games have

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.770 
normally I don't like when games have
remakes<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.060> textures<00:03:58.450> are<00:03:58.570> so

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
remakes and the textures are so

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.300 
remakes and the textures are so
different<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.530> game<00:03:59.739> is<00:03:59.890> pretty<00:04:00.070> much

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
different that the game is pretty much

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.060 
different that the game is pretty much
like<00:04:00.450> completely<00:04:01.450> different<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.170> I<00:04:02.440> love<00:04:02.980> how

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
like completely different but I love how

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.830 
like completely different but I love how
the<00:04:03.130> textures<00:04:03.670> actually<00:04:04.060> makes<00:04:04.269> sense<00:04:04.420> in

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
the textures actually makes sense in

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.270 
the textures actually makes sense in
this<00:04:04.930> game<00:04:05.170> now<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.380> know<00:04:05.560> everything<00:04:05.680> flows

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
this game now you know everything flows

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.550 
this game now you know everything flows
everything's<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:07.360> not<00:04:07.750> kind<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.170> like<00:04:08.350> you

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
everything's just not kind of like you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.069 
everything's just not kind of like you
know<00:04:08.590> what's<00:04:09.430> why<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.209> they're<00:04:10.660> like<00:04:10.989> it

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
know what's why is that they're like it

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.530 
know what's why is that they're like it
doesn't<00:04:11.200> make<00:04:11.350> sense<00:04:11.680> um<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:13.000> playing<00:04:13.360> the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
doesn't make sense um so playing the

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.469 
doesn't make sense um so playing the
game<00:04:13.750> I've<00:04:14.110> only<00:04:14.530> seen<00:04:14.829> a<00:04:14.890> few<00:04:15.209> things<00:04:16.209> that
