essentially being a woman was a
pre-existing<00:01:36.930> condition<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> justified

generally you can't discriminate against

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
generally you can't discriminate against
women<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:48.149> terms<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.659> how<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> how<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.530> charge

women in terms of how you how you charge

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.020 
women in terms of how you how you charge
folks<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.490> you'll<00:01:53.670> find

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.749 
folks but you know what what you'll find
I<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:57.320> marketplace<00:01:58.759> will

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
I think is that the the marketplace will

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.770 
I think is that the the marketplace will
be<00:01:59.909> stable<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:02.520> know<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.939> premiums<00:02:03.420> are

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
be stable and you know the premiums are

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.590 
be stable and you know the premiums are

going to be reflective of the fact that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.089 
going to be reflective of the fact that
there<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.079> lot<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.619> people<00:02:07.979> who<00:02:08.069> have

marketplaces<00:02:11.430> get

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
marketplaces get

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.980

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440

all signed up by March 31st in which

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
case there probably would be a line a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.840 
case there probably would be a line a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
little bit in terms of signing up on but

signed<00:02:37.310> up<00:02:37.520> then<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.360> could<00:02:38.570> assure<00:02:38.810> that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
signed up then you could assure that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.770 
signed up then you could assure that
probably<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.610> premiums<00:02:41.060> would<00:02:41.300> go<00:02:41.540> down

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
probably the premiums would go down

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.950 
probably the premiums would go down
significantly<00:02:42.760> next<00:02:43.760> year<00:02:43.940> just<00:02:44.180> because<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
significantly next year just because the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.290 
significantly next year just because the
pool<00:02:45.200> would<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.530> gone<00:02:46.430> beyond<00:02:46.850> what<00:02:47.150> the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
pool would have gone beyond what the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.710 
pool would have gone beyond what the
insurance<00:02:47.420> companies<00:02:48.400> anticipated<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.630> know

insurance companies anticipated you know

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
insurance companies anticipated you know
the<00:02:50.870> basic<00:02:51.380> principle<00:02:51.770> insurance<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.310> pretty

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
the basic principle insurance is pretty

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.770 
the basic principle insurance is pretty
straightforward<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.120> more<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.420> can<00:02:53.540> spread

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
straightforward the more you can spread

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.960 
straightforward the more you can spread
the<00:02:53.900> risk<00:02:54.050> with<00:02:54.380> more<00:02:54.560> people<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.940> better

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
the risk with more people the better

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.710 
the risk with more people the better
deal<00:02:56.900> you're<00:02:57.140> going<00:02:57.320> to<00:02:57.380> get<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.660> now<00:02:59.660> the

large enough that I'm confident the

program<00:03:06.830> will<00:03:07.010> be<00:03:07.130> stable<00:03:07.430> but<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:08.390> look

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
program will be stable but we look

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.030 
program will be stable but we look
forward<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.960> seeing<00:03:09.230> more<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.620> more<00:03:09.770> people

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
forward to seeing more and more people

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.980 
forward to seeing more and more people
take<00:03:10.340> advantage<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:10.970> as<00:03:11.180> some<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
take advantage of it as some of the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.440 
take advantage of it as some of the
politics<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.710> the<00:03:13.580> thing<00:03:13.790> get<00:03:14.030> drained<00:03:14.300> away

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
politics of the thing get drained away

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.570 
politics of the thing get drained away
as<00:03:14.810> people<00:03:15.350> start<00:03:15.590> feeling<00:03:15.920> more<00:03:16.070> confident

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
as people start feeling more confident

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.350 
as people start feeling more confident
