00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
here it's a little bit tricky i think

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.350 
here it's a little bit tricky i think
these<00:00:30.040> guys<00:00:30.190> are<00:00:30.250> trying<00:00:30.700> to<00:00:30.820> account<00:00:31.060> for<00:00:31.210> the

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
these guys are trying to account for the

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.110 
these guys are trying to account for the
current<00:00:31.600> which<00:00:32.320> again<00:00:32.470> is<00:00:32.529> pretty<00:00:32.890> strong<00:00:33.190> it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
current which again is pretty strong it

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.760 
current which again is pretty strong it
looks<00:00:34.330> like<00:00:34.420> Icarus<00:00:35.020> is<00:00:35.170> controlling<00:00:35.740> the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
looks like Icarus is controlling the

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.830 
looks like Icarus is controlling the
start<00:00:36.100> right<00:00:36.310> here<00:00:36.630> hopefully<00:00:37.630> they<00:00:37.750> don't

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
start right here hopefully they don't

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.080 
start right here hopefully they don't
have<00:00:38.020> their<00:00:38.170> timing<00:00:38.650> wrong<00:00:38.860> with<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.160> card<00:00:39.400> we

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
have their timing wrong with the card we

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.400 
have their timing wrong with the card we
got<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.239> lot<00:00:40.450> of<00:00:40.480> votes<00:00:40.690> now<00:00:40.930> starting<00:00:41.320> to
