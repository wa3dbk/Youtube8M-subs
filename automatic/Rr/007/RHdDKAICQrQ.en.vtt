00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
the hole on the bottom of there that you

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.640 
the hole on the bottom of there that you
can<00:01:34.240> stick<00:01:34.480> it<00:01:34.570> on<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.780> top<00:01:34.930> of<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.200> pencil<00:01:35.620> or

pander yeah whatever that fits on really
but<00:01:38.440> I<00:01:38.500> think<00:01:38.530> it's<00:01:38.800> been<00:01:38.920> four<00:01:39.130> pencils<00:01:39.840> all

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
but I think it's been four pencils all

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.310 
but I think it's been four pencils all
right<00:01:41.020> and<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.710> frog<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:43.050> looks<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.140> little

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
right and that frog is looks a little

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.440 
right and that frog is looks a little
different<00:01:44.500> in<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:44.800> picture<00:01:45.160> but<00:01:45.610> looks<00:01:46.360> like

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
different in that picture but looks like

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.520 
different in that picture but looks like
it's<00:01:46.810> four<00:01:47.800> thirty<00:01:47.830> two<00:01:49.170> unless<00:01:50.170> I'm<00:01:50.200> mistaken

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
it's four thirty two unless I'm mistaken

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.310 
it's four thirty two unless I'm mistaken
and<00:01:51.070> there's<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.280> better<00:01:52.210> match<00:01:52.479> in<00:01:52.720> color<00:01:52.990> but

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
and there's a better match in color but

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.630 
and there's a better match in color but
I<00:01:53.590> guess<00:01:54.009> that's<00:01:54.280> probably<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:56.220> already<00:01:57.220> now

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640
