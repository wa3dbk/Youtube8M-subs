anything<00:00:24.960> now<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.500> need<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.859> place<00:00:26.099> down<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
anything now we need to place down the

anything now we need to place down the
village<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.300> exact<00:00:28.080> spot<00:00:28.490> you<00:00:29.490> can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
village in that exact spot you can

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.659 
village in that exact spot you can
diversify<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.779> bit<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.369> want

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669

if<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.180> want<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.290> towers<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.040> in

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
if you want all of these towers to be in

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.930 
if you want all of these towers to be in
range<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.730> well<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.440> well<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.649> range

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
range as well as well the range

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
range as well as well the range
extending<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> top<00:00:39.360> right<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:40.100> didn't<00:00:41.100> use

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
extending to the top right I didn't use

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.549 
extending to the top right I didn't use
it<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.790> time<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.629> use<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.290> place

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it this time but you can use it to place

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.760 
it this time but you can use it to place
in<00:00:43.739> our<00:00:43.920> ice<00:00:44.129> town<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.230> that<00:00:46.230> helps<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
in our ice town and that helps you a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.540 
in our ice town and that helps you a
little<00:00:47.010> bit<00:00:47.129> better

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
little bit better

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.549 
little bit better
anyway<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.239> using<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.750> ice<00:00:48.960> special

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
anyway I'm using the ice special

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.650 
anyway I'm using the ice special
building<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> ice<00:00:50.640> cavern<00:00:51.120> or<00:00:51.300> whatever

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
building so the ice cavern or whatever

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.180 
building so the ice cavern or whatever
it's<00:00:51.840> called

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
it's called

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's called
it<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:54.059> necessary<00:00:54.690> by<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> way

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
it is not actually necessary by the way

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.799 
it is not actually necessary by the way
don't<00:00:55.620> forget<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:56.340> switch<00:00:56.940> your<00:00:57.180> tool<00:00:57.510> gonna

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
don't forget to switch your tool gonna

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
don't forget to switch your tool gonna
reduce<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.500> first<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.820> blues<00:01:00.059> get

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
reduce to first if some blues get

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.420 
reduce to first if some blues get
through<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.530> ice<00:01:01.680> tower<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.219> hold

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
through because the ice tower will hold

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.820 
through because the ice tower will hold
off<00:01:02.579> most<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.180> them<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:03.600> yeah<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.379> normal

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
off most of them but yeah if normal

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.440 
off most of them but yeah if normal
balloons<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.309> through<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.240> did<00:01:06.420> here

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
balloons get through like they did here

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.710 
balloons get through like they did here
that<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.680> unnecessary<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that is just unnecessary and I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.140 
that is just unnecessary and I
completely<00:01:10.110> messed<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.100> any<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
completely messed it up but any of it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.820 
completely messed it up but any of it
doesn't<00:01:12.479> matter<00:01:12.630> we're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.530> continue

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
doesn't matter we're going to continue

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
doesn't matter we're going to continue
on<00:01:14.070> by<00:01:14.280> making<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> ice<00:01:14.909> tower<00:01:15.210> into<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> two

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
on by making the ice tower into a two

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.109 
on by making the ice tower into a two
and<00:01:15.930> three<00:01:16.170> first<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> glue<00:01:17.610> tower<00:01:17.850> into

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and three first then the glue tower into

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.100 
and three first then the glue tower into
tune<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.040> now<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.340> kind<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> mix<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> there

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
tune to now you can kind of mix it there

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.859 
tune to now you can kind of mix it there
and<00:01:22.259> mix<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> match<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.310> don't<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
and mix and match that but don't do the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.719 
and mix and match that but don't do the

two<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.450> three<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> good<00:01:58.020> enough<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.500> don't

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
two and three is good enough or don't

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.429 
two and three is good enough or don't
upgrade<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> village<00:02:00.450> tab<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.229> my

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
upgrade the village tab that was my

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.980 
upgrade the village tab that was my
mistake<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.219> should<00:02:02.280> still<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> 0-0<00:02:03.570> village

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
mistake it should still be a 0-0 village

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.069 
mistake it should still be a 0-0 village
here<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:05.250> upgraded<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.060> accidentally<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
here and I upgraded that accidentally I

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.570 
here and I upgraded that accidentally I
kind<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.009> wasn't

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
kind of wasn't

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.870 
kind of wasn't
thinking<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.070> that<00:02:11.310> otherwise<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
thinking so don't do that otherwise you

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.970 
thinking so don't do that otherwise you
need<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.150> sell<00:02:12.420> your<00:02:12.570> ice<00:02:12.750> tower<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.500> rebuild

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
need to sell your ice tower and rebuild

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.920 
need to sell your ice tower and rebuild
it<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.700> not<00:02:14.880> necessary<00:02:15.450> here<00:02:15.690> once

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
it but it's not necessary here once

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.750 
it but it's not necessary here once
again<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.530> are<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.040> use<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.460> special

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
again we are going to use this special

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.760 
again we are going to use this special
ability<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.570> glue<00:02:18.810> tower<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.320> tune<00:02:19.470> for

ability on the glue tower the tune for

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.680 
ability on the glue tower the tune for
blue<00:02:19.950> tower<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.760> deal<00:02:20.970> with<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> camel<00:02:21.540> it's

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
blue tower to deal with the camel it's

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.500 
blue tower to deal with the camel it's
your<00:02:21.810> only<00:02:22.020> way<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.380> deal<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.890> camel<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.510> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
your only way to deal with camel and I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.690 
your only way to deal with camel and I
do<00:02:24.570> recommend<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.320> build<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.860> glue<00:02:26.280> towers

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
do recommend you build to glue towers

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.680 
do recommend you build to glue towers
although<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.870> not<00:02:27.900> entirely<00:02:28.560> necessary

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
although that is not entirely necessary

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.840 
although that is not entirely necessary
you<00:02:30.690> can<00:02:30.720> work<00:02:31.080> with<00:02:31.350> one<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.490> have<00:02:32.700> to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
you can work with one but you have to

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.490 
you can work with one but you have to
rebuild<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.570> couple<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.930> times<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.350> it's

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
rebuild it a couple of times so it's

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.210 
rebuild it a couple of times so it's
easier<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.430> two<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:37.220> yeah

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
easier to go with two and then just yeah

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.820 
easier to go with two and then just yeah
just<00:02:38.550> do<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.240> like<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> anyhow<00:02:40.380> we're<00:02:40.650> going

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
just do it like that anyhow we're going

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.990 
just do it like that anyhow we're going
to<00:02:41.150> rebuild<00:02:42.150> our<00:02:42.510> thing<00:02:43.230> here<00:02:43.440> about<00:02:43.650> 46<00:02:44.580> meets

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
to rebuild our thing here about 46 meets

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.710 
to rebuild our thing here about 46 meets
the<00:02:45.870> four<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.260> zero<00:02:47.090> as<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the four and zero as you can see the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.740 
the four and zero as you can see the
four<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.050> zero<00:02:50.570> village<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.740> then<00:02:52.890> one-step

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
four and zero village and then one-step

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.800 
four and zero village and then one-step
Pink's<00:02:54.750> reach<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.830> top<00:02:56.040> rights<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.850> Earth<00:02:57.480> so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
Pink's reach the top rights of Earth so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.500 
Pink's reach the top rights of Earth so
basically<00:02:58.440> if<00:02:58.740> they<00:02:58.890> go<00:02:59.100> around<00:02:59.310> the<00:03:00.270> earth

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
basically if they go around the earth

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.600 
basically if they go around the earth
and<00:03:00.810> then<00:03:01.170> when<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:01.740> reach<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.160> top<00:03:02.370> right

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and then when they reach the top right

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.040 
and then when they reach the top right
again<00:03:04.430> yeah<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.000> need<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.360> use<00:03:06.900> your

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
again yeah then you need to use your

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.890 
again yeah then you need to use your
glue<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:08.070> round<00:03:08.400> wasn't<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.209> too

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
glue this round wasn't really too

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.020 
glue this round wasn't really too
complex<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.100> next<00:03:11.340> round<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.880> to

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
complex but the next round is going to

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.930 
complex but the next round is going to
be<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.180> little<00:03:12.600> bit<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.890> next<00:03:14.160> time<00:03:14.430> there

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
be a little bit so the next time there

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.259 
be a little bit so the next time there
are<00:03:15.320> camera<00:03:16.320> links<00:03:16.680> coming<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.000> little

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
are camera links coming it's a little

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.140 
are camera links coming it's a little
bit<00:03:18.390> tighter<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.500> need<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:20.220> use<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.880> four

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
bit tighter you need to use it four

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.699 
bit tighter you need to use it four
times<00:03:21.360> than<00:03:21.630> otherwise<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:22.080> would<00:03:22.200> need<00:03:22.350> to

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
times than otherwise you would need to

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.530 
times than otherwise you would need to
use<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.040> five<00:03:23.310> times<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.420> not

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
use it five times and that is just not

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.650 
use it five times and that is just not
something<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.260> would<00:03:25.380> want<00:03:26.300> anyhow<00:03:27.300> by<00:03:27.480> now

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
something you would want anyhow by now

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.960 
something you would want anyhow by now
you<00:03:27.720> should<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.140> something<00:03:28.709> like<00:03:28.860> 54<00:03:29.670> lives

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
you should have something like 54 lives

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.140 
you should have something like 54 lives
I<00:03:30.150> have<00:03:30.300> 44<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.290> lost<00:03:31.590> quite<00:03:31.860> a<00:03:31.920> few<00:03:32.120> well

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
I have 44 so I lost quite a few well

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.410 
I have 44 so I lost quite a few well
unnecessary<00:03:34.050> blunt<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:35.820> as<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.120> can<00:03:36.209> see

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
unnecessary blunt and as you can see

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.770 
unnecessary blunt and as you can see
this<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.320> our<00:03:37.739> next<00:03:38.010> round<00:03:38.390> this<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.630> the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
this is our next round this is the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.100 
this is our next round this is the
complex<00:03:40.140> runs<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:41.100> first<00:03:41.340> loop<00:03:41.670> goes<00:03:42.030> off<00:03:42.300> we

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
complex runs the first loop goes off we

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.440 
complex runs the first loop goes off we
still<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:43.890> available<00:03:44.220> second<00:03:45.030> glucose

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
still have one available second glucose

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.390 
still have one available second glucose
off<00:03:45.660> as<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.019> can<00:03:46.170> see<00:03:46.320> I'm<00:03:46.440> using<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:47.010> once

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
off as you can see I'm using that once

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.910 
off as you can see I'm using that once
they<00:03:47.550> passed<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.269> earth<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:49.320> are<00:03:49.860> in

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
they passed the earth and then are in

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.180 
they passed the earth and then are in
the<00:03:50.220> top<00:03:50.430> right<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.269> third<00:03:51.600> glue

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
the top right is the third glue

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.680 
the top right is the third glue
rebuilding<00:03:53.190> every<00:03:53.489> time<00:03:53.730> of<00:03:53.880> course<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.330> then

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
rebuilding every time of course and then

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.150 
rebuilding every time of course and then
the<00:03:54.780> fourth<00:03:55.050> one<00:03:55.260> which<00:03:55.500> is<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> little<00:03:56.070> bit

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
the fourth one which is a little bit

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
everything well pretty much gets taken

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.930 
everything well pretty much gets taken
out<00:04:12.989> by<00:04:13.290> these<00:04:13.350> blue<00:04:13.769> towers<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.519> just<00:04:14.760> out
