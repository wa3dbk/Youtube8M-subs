hey Ted here today we're going to do a
slide<00:00:25.220> solo<00:00:25.640> in<00:00:26.000> standard<00:00:26.480> tuning<00:00:26.689> in<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.260> key

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
slide solo in standard tuning in the key

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.770 
slide solo in standard tuning in the key
of<00:00:27.500> e<00:00:28.930> I've<00:00:29.930> done<00:00:30.349> one<00:00:30.619> before<00:00:30.800> that<00:00:31.369> was<00:00:31.780> was

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
of e I've done one before that was was

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.600 
of e I've done one before that was was
this<00:00:33.320> one's<00:00:33.590> going<00:00:33.739> to<00:00:33.800> be<00:00:33.890> a<00:00:34.010> little<00:00:34.220> bit<00:00:34.430> more

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
this one's going to be a little bit more

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.009 
this one's going to be a little bit more
advanced<00:00:35.180> we're<00:00:35.329> going<00:00:35.450> to<00:00:35.510> move<00:00:35.660> around<00:00:35.780> the

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
advanced we're going to move around the

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.880 
advanced we're going to move around the
neck<00:00:36.260> a<00:00:36.290> little<00:00:36.440> bit<00:00:36.710> more<00:00:37.040> with<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.370> one<00:00:38.890> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
neck a little bit more with this one and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.500 
neck a little bit more with this one and
of<00:00:40.010> course<00:00:40.250> moving<00:00:40.519> around<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.000> neck<00:00:41.180> means

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
of course moving around the neck means

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.100 
of course moving around the neck means
working<00:00:42.140> on<00:00:42.440> our<00:00:42.970> muting<00:00:43.970> and<00:00:44.300> especially

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
working on our muting and especially

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.000 
working on our muting and especially
working<00:00:45.320> on<00:00:45.650> our<00:00:45.890> intonation<00:00:47.080> so<00:00:48.080> let's<00:00:48.800> get

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
working on our intonation so let's get

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.360 
working on our intonation so let's get
started<00:00:50.680> here's<00:00:51.680> what<00:00:51.890> it's<00:00:52.010> going<00:00:52.070> to<00:00:52.220> sound

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
started here's what it's going to sound

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:38.500 
started here's what it's going to sound
like

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.940 

okay<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.540> let's<00:01:42.540> let's<00:01:43.110> dig<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.440> little<00:01:43.590> deeper

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
okay so let's let's dig a little deeper

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.240 
okay so let's let's dig a little deeper
into<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.250> thing<00:01:45.590> one<00:01:46.590> thing<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.860> didn't<00:01:47.070> want

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
into this thing one thing I didn't want

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.250 
into this thing one thing I didn't want
to<00:01:47.370> do<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.880> didn't<00:01:48.420> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> spend<00:01:48.840> too<00:01:49.110> much

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
to do I didn't want to spend too much

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.450 
to do I didn't want to spend too much
time<00:01:49.320> today<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:52.080> ninth<00:01:52.320> fret<00:01:54.800> because<00:01:55.800> our

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
time today on the ninth fret because our

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.500 
time today on the ninth fret because our
beginning<00:01:57.150> solo<00:01:57.660> in<00:01:58.220> standard<00:01:59.220> tuning<00:01:59.510> was

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
beginning solo in standard tuning was

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.810 
beginning solo in standard tuning was
all<00:02:00.840> based<00:02:01.200> around<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:03.650> particular

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
all based around that particular

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
all based around that particular
position<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.630> where<00:02:06.960> when<00:02:07.800> you're

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
position which is where when you're

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.710 
position which is where when you're
playing<00:02:08.160> slide<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.030> santur<00:02:09.300> tuning<00:02:09.600> that's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
playing slide and santur tuning that's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.590 
playing slide and santur tuning that's
kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.290> where<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:11.040> gravitate<00:02:11.610> which<00:02:12.450> is

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
kind of where you gravitate which is

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.720 
kind of where you gravitate which is
fine<00:02:12.840> because<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> closest<00:02:14.520> thing<00:02:14.670> to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
fine because it's the closest thing to

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.930 
fine because it's the closest thing to
open<00:02:15.090> tuning<00:02:15.420> we<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:16.140> our<00:02:16.580> guitar<00:02:17.580> in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
open tuning we have on our guitar in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.900 
open tuning we have on our guitar in
standard<00:02:18.420> tuning<00:02:18.890> if<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> don't<00:02:20.190> understand

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
standard tuning if you don't understand

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.290 
standard tuning if you don't understand
what<00:02:21.030> I'm<00:02:21.120> talking<00:02:21.240> about<00:02:21.650> go<00:02:22.650> back<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.300> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
what I'm talking about go back to the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.900 
what I'm talking about go back to the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
basic slide licks and standard tuning or

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.580 
basic slide licks and standard tuning or
the<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.320> basic<00:02:28.890> solo<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:31.020> tried<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.470> move

the or the basic solo so I tried to move
it<00:02:31.709> around<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:32.130> little<00:02:32.160> bit<00:02:32.400> more<00:02:32.900> less

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
it around a little bit more less

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.160 
it around a little bit more less
standard<00:02:37.430> less<00:02:38.430> standard<00:02:39.060> standard<00:02:39.750> tuning

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
standard less standard standard tuning

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.300

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
to do that but I do start out in that

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.780 
to do that but I do start out in that
position<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.040> end<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.519> that<00:03:02.640> position

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
position and I do end in that position

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.300 
position and I do end in that position
it's<00:03:03.599> everything<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:04.110> between<00:03:04.230> that's<00:03:04.980> going

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
it's everything in between that's going

it's everything in between that's going
to<00:03:05.489> out<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.030> way<00:03:06.769> okay<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.400> first

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
to out of the way okay so that first

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.449 
to out of the way okay so that first
phrase<00:03:09.180> has<00:03:10.110> been<00:03:10.290> covered<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.769> death<00:03:10.980> already

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
phrase has been covered to death already

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:23.890 
phrase has been covered to death already
on<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:12.060> earlier<00:03:12.660> videos<00:03:15.260> then<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:16.410> go

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.759 

okay<00:03:24.799> so<00:03:24.860> we're<00:03:25.129> really<00:03:25.430> moving<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:27.590> and

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
okay so we're really moving a up and

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:36.550 
okay so we're really moving a up and
down<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.099> neck<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.640> way

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:48.280 

okay<00:03:37.560> here<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.069> is<00:03:38.159> super<00:03:38.670> duper<00:03:38.790> slow

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.229 

in<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.349> little<00:03:49.590> cord<00:03:52.430> okay<00:03:53.430> then<00:03:53.790> we're<00:03:53.969> moving

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
in a little cord okay then we're moving

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.559 
in a little cord okay then we're moving
on<00:03:54.390> to<00:03:54.569> our<00:03:54.659> a<00:03:54.810> cord

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.910 

I<00:04:00.749> want<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.260> talk<00:04:01.409> a<00:04:01.439> little<00:04:01.620> bit<00:04:01.890> about

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
I want to talk a little bit about

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.339 
I want to talk a little bit about
technique<00:04:02.790> you'll<00:04:03.150> notice<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.079> am

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
technique you'll notice that I am

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.770 
technique you'll notice that I am
tilting<00:04:04.950> my<00:04:05.159> slide<00:04:05.989> out<00:04:06.989> away<00:04:07.769> from<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
tilting my slide out away from the

back down a little bit when I go to the
second<00:04:22.049> string

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.050 
neck here at the 6th fret on the 4th
string<00:05:01.960> I'm<00:05:03.070> ending<00:05:04.070> that<00:05:04.250> phrase<00:05:04.580> on<00:05:04.910> the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
string I'm ending that phrase on the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:14.460

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.490 

now<00:05:15.470> I'm<00:05:15.620> reversing<00:05:16.190> my<00:05:16.520> tilt<00:05:17.060> here<00:05:17.449> when<00:05:18.410> I'm

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
now I'm reversing my tilt here when I'm

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.089 
now I'm reversing my tilt here when I'm
playing<00:05:18.680> on<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:18.919> 6th<00:05:19.340> string<00:05:21.099> because

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
playing on the 6th string because

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.310 
playing on the 6th string because
especially<00:05:22.610> when<00:05:22.759> you<00:05:22.849> get<00:05:22.970> round<00:05:23.810> strings

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
especially when you get round strings

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.839 
especially when you get round strings
that's<00:05:25.039> where<00:05:25.370> you<00:05:25.550> get<00:05:25.729> your<00:05:26.060> extra<00:05:26.539> noise

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
that's where you get your extra noise

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.520 
that's where you get your extra noise
that<00:05:28.849> you<00:05:29.060> typically<00:05:29.690> don't<00:05:29.900> want<00:05:30.050> sometimes

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
that you typically don't want sometimes

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.770 
that you typically don't want sometimes
you<00:05:30.919> sometimes<00:05:31.250> you'll<00:05:31.580> want<00:05:31.759> that<00:05:31.910> raspy

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
you sometimes you'll want that raspy

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.640 
you sometimes you'll want that raspy
sound<00:05:34.780> but<00:05:35.780> you<00:05:35.870> want<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.080> be<00:05:36.199> able<00:05:36.289> to<00:05:36.410> know

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
sound but you want to be able to know

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.950 
sound but you want to be able to know
you<00:05:37.009> want<00:05:37.160> to<00:05:37.250> know<00:05:37.370> how<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.639> avoid<00:05:38.090> it<00:05:40.960> I'm
