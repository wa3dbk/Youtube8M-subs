00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
we go ok so my old base where I used to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.709 
we go ok so my old base where I used to
spawn<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.890> around<00:00:59.390> around<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> shore

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the distance that's it's a marker I used

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.609

on<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.549> old<00:01:17.670> save<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:20.750> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> most<00:01:21.960> part<00:01:22.080> my

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
on my old save and for the most part my

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
on my old save and for the most part my
old<00:01:23.220> base<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.909> pretty<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.450> intact<00:01:25.759> just<00:01:26.930> well

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
old base is pretty much intact just well

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.300 
old base is pretty much intact just well
you'll<00:01:28.259> see<00:01:30.590> hard<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> explain<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.189> words

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you'll see hard to explain in words

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.280 
you'll see hard to explain in words
really<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:36.450> got<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:36.720> holes<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.170> it

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
really it's got some holes in it

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
really it's got some holes in it
basically<00:01:41.420> that's<00:01:42.420> good<00:01:42.659> enough<00:01:46.009> ok<00:01:47.450> there's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
basically that's good enough ok there's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.249 
basically that's good enough ok there's
my<00:01:48.509> castle<00:01:49.049> off<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.350> distance<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:51.259> floating

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
my castle off in the distance I floating

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.000 
my castle off in the distance I floating
castle<00:01:53.030> above<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> fortress<00:01:55.340> look<00:01:56.340> over<00:01:56.430> here

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
castle above the fortress look over here

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:09.330 
castle above the fortress look over here
I<00:01:58.100> think<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.760> is<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.120> minecart<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.720> I<00:02:01.240> yeah

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.260 

use<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.460> Mayan<00:02:10.700> card<00:02:10.940> to<00:02:11.000> get<00:02:11.090> there<00:02:11.240> a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
use this Mayan card to get there a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:25.270 
use this Mayan card to get there a
little<00:02:11.360> faster

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.980 

if<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.460> notice<00:02:26.760> there's<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> there's<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> wall

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
if you notice there's a there's a wall

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.050 
if you notice there's a there's a wall
missing<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.920> my<00:02:29.070> base<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.520> don't<00:02:32.700> remember

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
missing in my base and I don't remember

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
missing in my base and I don't remember
oh<00:02:33.300> yeah<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.260> grandville<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.710> did<00:02:34.830> what

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
oh yeah that is grandville I did what

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.340 
oh yeah that is grandville I did what
that<00:02:35.100> there

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.980 

it<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.500> big<00:02:41.680> hole<00:02:41.890> in<00:02:41.920> my<00:02:42.160> wall<00:02:42.990> gigantic

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
it is a big hole in my wall gigantic

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.390 
it is a big hole in my wall gigantic
square<00:02:44.380> hole<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.490> pretty<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.070> did<00:02:48.250> that

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
square hole it's pretty but I did that

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.770 
square hole it's pretty but I did that
remember<00:02:48.670> did<00:02:48.970> not<00:02:49.120> work

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
remember did not work

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.930 
remember did not work
I<00:02:50.870> guess<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:51.440> must<00:02:51.620> be<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.069> corruption<00:02:52.910> that

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
I guess this must be the corruption that

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:03.970 
I guess this must be the corruption that
caused<00:02:53.360> me<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.690> be<00:02:53.720> unable<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.410> see<00:03:02.920> there<00:03:03.920> you

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
some crates but that's no big deal

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.190 
some crates but that's no big deal
because<00:04:03.950> they<00:04:04.130> were<00:04:04.190> empty<00:04:04.810> some<00:04:05.810> crates<00:04:06.110> were

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
because they were empty some crates were

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.120 
because they were empty some crates were
over<00:04:06.350> here<00:04:06.530> those<00:04:06.769> chests<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:08.049> then<00:04:09.049> a

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
over here those chests that is then a

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.830 
over here those chests that is then a
minecart<00:04:10.130> track<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.640> went<00:04:10.820> from<00:04:11.000> my<00:04:11.360> upper

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
minecart track that went from my upper

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.240 
minecart track that went from my upper
portion<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.410> space<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.070> lower

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
portion of the space to the lower

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.960 
portion of the space to the lower
portion<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.780> some<00:04:15.019> stairs<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:15.829> that's<00:04:16.700> gone

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
portion and some stairs so that's gone

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.560 
portion and some stairs so that's gone
but<00:04:18.370> I'm<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:19.430> really<00:04:19.700> using<00:04:20.060> this<00:04:20.269> area

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
but I'm not really using this area

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.819 
but I'm not really using this area
anymore<00:04:20.720> so<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.109> guess<00:04:21.289> doesn't<00:04:21.500> really<00:04:21.620> matter

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
anymore so I guess doesn't really matter

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.670 
anymore so I guess doesn't really matter
but<00:04:22.100> just<00:04:22.910> sort<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.150> bizarre<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:26.530> can't<00:04:27.530> even

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
but just sort of bizarre so can't even

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.750 
but just sort of bizarre so can't even
get<00:04:27.800> up<00:04:27.890> there<00:04:28.039> anymore<00:04:28.220> i<00:04:28.340> used<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.640> have

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760
