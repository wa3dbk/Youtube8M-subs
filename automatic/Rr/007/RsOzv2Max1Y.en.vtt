00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.960
 Speak there guys, youtube, well, it's a fan. 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.450
 and welcome to another video and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'm here today at the gp of singapore which is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 a circuit at night and today besides being 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.760
 bringing this circuit looks only 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.800
 surpassed here 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 then the veto will stop me not 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 caught in addition to circuits and at night I 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.300
 I'm running here with michael 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 schumacher 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 I do not know, I think he's a good driver. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.260
 Good, now that we've been through here 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.669
 Everyone is ahead of me. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.440
 Can I be commenting more? 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.420
 tranquility 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.149
 Let's go in this video besides being 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.160
 bringing this gp here that he is well 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.110
 nice though if it should be a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.300
 little bad back running because he is 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.000
 very narrow you do not have much 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
 escape it then you're doing it 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.260
 it is very difficult to overcome, but I 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.760
 I think it's going to be giving some 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 good tips for you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 in this video I wanted to emphasize a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.829
 little use of the brakes 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.379
 I do not know if this matters a lot 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.019
 Yes, how do I use the three more? 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.110
 that at some point it is good to 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.659
 people know a little, and have a sense of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.240
 some things 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.240
 this gp is that it has enough curves 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.930
 You already noticed and are curved so well. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.729
 closed so you'll be using 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.229
 let's not say a little more of the 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.009
 brakes than perhaps in some others 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.400
 gp's normal as soon as they are a little 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.110
 less curves and the trend is more 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420
 here is you do not have a gain of 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.869
 very high speed is because the curves 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.270
 they are very closed you need to be 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.979
 braking well before, in some cases even 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.780
 You have to can not be accelerating. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.610
 because if you accelerate too much you will not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 You will be getting to do things but 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 Stop talking here, you lickers. 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.649
 come on 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.520
 You're seeing here that I'm just 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.680
 braking quieted accelerating very little 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.200
 This will wear out the brakes a lot. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 so much so that if you go searching a little 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.399
 you will come to the conclusion that the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.189
 level of brake wear here is 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.810
 very high as well as the braking level 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.330
 here we completed a lap and already 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.190
 we are well ahead of our seal 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.050
 enemy opponents 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.610
 let's go on then continuing 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.350
 I was talking until it seems that this 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.030
 comment that is not being recorded to the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.430
 I live by the cuts I'm making 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.650
 yes it's being recorded when you're talking a 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.530
 bit more of the brakes I could have 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.570
 Tell you, I know you and many times. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.300
 depending on the difficulty I think 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.250
 he has braking assistance and this 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.040
 it helps you a lot not to spend the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.720
 brakes in such an exaggerated way is not 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.970
 because you'll often have to 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.460
 Are you going to the box to change the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.340
 your tires because you frei or others and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.050
 This may be wasting time. 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.600
 and this is not good when 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.400
 You're in a very long race. 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.740
 in my case I'm just experiencing a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.150
 three lap race then you do not have 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:59.160
 much why not braking then 11 will be if 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.980
 You're going to run little runs. 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.680
 long I do not even recommend a lot but 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.990
 if you are going to run the normal race 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.400
 even though it's the one you go to 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.560
 boxes at least three or four 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.000
 Sometimes I recommend you, of course. 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.190
 saving the brakes so you do not 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.500
 have to follow the boxes to 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.870
 I 'm changing, I 'm already messing around. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.250
 here too but coming back to talk about 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.470
 braking assistance 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.450
 if you have played a difficulty 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.000
 low as it is in my case I'm playing the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.040
 It is easy to even have this 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.250
 brake assist and not have to okay 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.500
 going so often to the pits 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.540
 Are you going to not be paying? 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.330
 a lot of attention on these debts but if you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.930
 already a hardcore player who uses 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.670
 even his silver skill braking and everything 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.160
 that scheme of yourself is 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.100
 controlling all parts of the car 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.500
 So I advise you to do what? 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.709
 you do as you now accelerate one 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.840
 and is already starting to slow down. 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.130
 because you're going to have people lose a 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.020
 little speed 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.910
 only so when you reach a curve 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.370
 you will be at a slower speed than 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.320
 Not now, she was already telling me there. 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.660
 brake just started braking before 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.850
 so I'm starting to accelerate 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.730
 before and this I'll be losing 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:20.160
 speed obviously carry braking 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.039
 before it will only gain speed 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.870
 begin to accelerate as I now see the 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.160
 next corner I'll show you going 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.260
 fire here 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.240
 this is our neutral let's say so 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.460
 that we have let's make this curve 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.930
 here is very fast and time to start 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.270
 brake marking 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.980
 I started braking before serving then 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.380
 here I already have the possibility of 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.830
 be accelerating before you see here 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.810
 I already started to brake and that gives me a 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.790
 six seconds advantage as the staff 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.310
 side and just tell me now 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.100
 then I brake before only I get to 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.650
 accelerate before in a certain way let's 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.910
 I do not know. 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.790
 two brakes 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.980
 only as soon as I can explain 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.650
 depending on the difficulty you are experiencing 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.660
 playing if you are braking before your 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.010
 opponents will overcoming this 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.810
 it's not good at all 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.910
 only as I'm playing it easy here 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.060
 I may be leaving to screw it up 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.800
 later or even well to those who 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.390
 some silver cases performing 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.210
 you have to be 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.360
 failing later because in these cases the 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.240
 your opponents start France as it is 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.890
 The tips that I'm giving now 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.410
 simplifying if you 're running 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.900
 it is not with the braking assistance 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.720
 I advise you to leave here the 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.380
 braking assistance for the car to 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.810
 you 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.970
 if you are using the manual control 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.800
 fully manual brake I 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.050
 I advise you to start doing there 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.850
 years so that you can get the 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.550
 speed up before you need 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.650
 exceed both modes if you have 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.010
 consistency or not I advise that 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.810
 you start to brake after it works 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.430
 almost on top of the curve because so you 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.770
 Will you be able to spend your time? 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.630
 opponent more easily 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.100
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.230
 have understood the tips I wanted 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.260
 Pass it on to you if you liked the video 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:14.780
 leave them I read your favorite and then it is 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.780
 This a kiss a hug and I went
