00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.939 

we're<00:00:47.080> going<00:00:47.200> to<00:00:47.290> use<00:00:48.120> lemon<00:00:49.120> what<00:00:49.300> duck

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.049 

the<00:00:54.949> hook<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:55.460> is<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:55.870> TM<00:00:56.870> go<00:00:58.059> $24.99

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059

barbless<00:00:59.690> black<00:01:00.050> hook

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.180 

I<00:01:06.350> think<00:01:07.070> that<00:01:07.220> having<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.950> hook<00:01:09.950> that's

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
I think that having the hook that's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.900 
I think that having the hook that's
black<00:01:11.830> because<00:01:12.830> it's<00:01:12.980> not<00:01:13.130> as<00:01:13.280> shiny<00:01:13.610> and

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 
black because it's not as shiny and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.680 
black because it's not as shiny and
smooth<00:01:14.270> as<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:15.340> bronze<00:01:16.340> hook<00:01:16.640> actually<00:01:17.210> holds

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
smooth as the bronze hook actually holds

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.260 
smooth as the bronze hook actually holds
