00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.590
 The exhaust system is specially adapted to the new Mégane Renault Sport 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.950
 Low back pressure allows optimization of engine performance 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.059
 An acoustic behavior lets them speed while they search 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.539
 that part of the module is looking at it being transferred to the passenger compartment 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.419
 For this purpose, a bypass sends the inlet system pressure to take impulses 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.910
 fire 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.739
 which is inside a special unit 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.599
 the unit transforms the drug impulse decisively and distributes it 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.599
 inside the passenger compartment 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.220
 In the new Mega 9 o'clock sport is a short graduated Baker 4 6 course 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
 manual transmission 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.650
 the cup chassis was chosen so is the gearbox with a limited slip differential 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.560
 fitted 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.530
 be transmitted by this mechanism of torque to the wheel that the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 Strongest grip has to ensure maximum propulsion 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.970
 the wheelbase of the new Mégane UNO Sport is equal to the Mégane Coupé 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.050
 However, dampers and springs were the sporty character of the vehicle 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.560
 customized 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 therefore, the vehicle height is slightly reduced 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.000
 the track width is increased 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.510
 and the game radio's behavior of the front and rear dampers firmer 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.960
 the concept of the front axle was taken over by Mégane Renault Sport there 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.780
 however, applies the advancements 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 which were made for the Clio Renault Sport 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.409
 The home carriers are therefore made of aluminum 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.240
 and the lower aluminum wishbone who holds a horizontal mounted 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 Ball bolt to optimize the Hawks geometry 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.730
 As the engine entered framework conditions, the generation is used the first time with 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.659
 introduced to the new Mégane, it was specific to them 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.840
 for the Mégane Renault Sport 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.110
 the rear axle was not taken over by 19 because this is stiffer than 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.179
 that of the new Mégane Coupé 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.320
 because vehicles with Tahar factory 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.630
 in front of the box this one had and the feathers once more tightened around 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.210
 to guarantee maximum grip in sporty driving 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.569
 any hectic power steering 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.380
 benefits from a more direct steering ratio 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.640
 and a child falls the sporty nature of the new Mégane 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.640
 Ono Sport has been adjusted 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.489
 the new Mégane Renault Sport is still 18 inch rims the every suspension 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.489
 can be combined with appropriate tires 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.569
 19 inch wheels are available as options 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.029
 The new Mégane Renault Sport is equipped with a tire repair as standard 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:56.999
 cottage 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:03.119
 however, a spare wheel of size 135 80 r 17 is available as an option 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.989
 important 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.699
 The spare wheel can only be mounted on the rear axle 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.839
 in a flat tire on a front wheel knew that Werberat on the side of the 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:19.329
 defective tire instead of the rear wheel 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.619
 then the front wheel must be replaced behind the rear wheel 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.519
 At the front, the vehicle is driven by Brenscheidt with a diameter of 43 mm 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.239
 Millimeters and 28 millimeters thick as well as Brembo four-piston calipers 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.849
 delayed 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.489
 the rear brake work with discs of 92 millimeters in diameter and the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.919
 eleven millimeters thick as well as floating a piston calipers 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.059
 Special features of the new Mégane kappt suspension 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.909
 The four rotors have cool slits to heat the Orfeo too 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:53.700
 optimize 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.849
 and thus to improve the stem cells during intensive use of the brakes 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.259
 In addition, the calipers are painted red
