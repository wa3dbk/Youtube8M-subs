 wrecks this is the first champion he 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.750
 first champion unique in its kind in 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.680
 to be harmed by others 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.920
 made by Jamie Black and her voice in 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.350
 Spanish is made by martín soto to this 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.840
 last you will remember it from remus lupine in 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.040
 harry potter and professor antonio in 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.110
 the superpowerful girls number 3 the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.269
 Original design was not brawn 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.670
 exactly a muscular man and with 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.540
 big mustache brom was going to be called in a 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.210
 home yes yes the engineering exists that was going 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.920
 to be originally a painter and his shield 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.270
 was going to be a shield of tech sheikhs 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.520
 number 4 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.829
 browne was the first champ the fig 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.719
 flames in having a unique animation and 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.810
 exclusively to attack the 

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:20.060
 turrets was also the second champion 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.400
 in having a double animation for your 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.860
 joke 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.470
 number 5 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.920
 brawn's name could come from the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.020
 word brown which means strength of the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.260
 word mist changed to a mode 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.970
 masculine this Latin word is used 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.550
 to talk about a winter or the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.710
 frosts although there is also a 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:47.060
 ice cream shop that has the same name 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 number 6 a reference of brown could 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.510
 be its huge resemblance to álex amstrong 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.150
 anime full metal alchemist also 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.150
 in our master tree there is a 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.280
 unstoppable demolition and called demolition 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.710
 if we extend it a little bit it has a big 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.340
 similar with broun 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.860
 number 7 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.170
 with the launch of brawn there is a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.870
 mini game called pixel pore 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 starring brown and lioness in the 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.840
 typical 8-bit ping pong game with 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.129
 brom and lioness hitting a small one 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.990
 unfortunately the page of this game 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.360
 is no longer available 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.540
 number 8 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.910
 the dragonboat aspect has an error 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.970
 in the splash er we can see the scar 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.520
 of brawn from the left side while 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.270
 the aspect within the game has it 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.730
 right side this same aspect as the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.590
 circus trick where the taker puts the 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.360
 head in the mouth of a lion but the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.360
 style of our good friend brom 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.190
 number 9 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.830
 yes in the abyss of laments 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.720
 we feed a pore this will come out 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.180
 a small black mustache in appearance 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.459
 classic and it will be coffee in any of the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.920
 two other aspects and although what 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.840
 we remember this little pore with mustache 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.800
 he also made an appearance in the is 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.000
 pleasure of winter lulú 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.250
 number 10 the appearance brom the tiger could 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.880
 be inspired by a fan art where 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.670
 they called brawn wrestling though 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.040
 now we know that this really is 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.410
 based on the well-known Japanese fighter 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.310
 as tiger mask 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.320
 number 11 brown has a couple of phrases 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.480
 direct encouragement for us the 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.320
 invoker is these are the following 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.280
 for your best effort do not lose the 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.200
 encouragement and the next two sentences are a 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.920
 little more to the interpretation of 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.680
 the more people you have left over night 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.870
 the stars shine 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.360
 this phrase could have been a way of 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.820
 what lightning will motivate us to give the best of 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.600
 ourselves even when a game 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.180
 it looks totally lost while the 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.340
 next phrase is an obvious invitation 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.870
 to take breaks between the 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.830
 games to have a better 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.310
 concentration is very important to take 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.350
 a break also has multiple 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.800
 interactions with champions and objects 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.260
 between them they should enlist any boots the 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.700

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.440
 possible interactions 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.710
