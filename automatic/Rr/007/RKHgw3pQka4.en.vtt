the planet works with a lot of the Pro
Tour<00:00:44.250> teams<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.379> were<00:00:46.500> lucky<00:00:46.680> enough

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
Tour teams and so we were lucky enough

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
Tour teams and so we were lucky enough
to<00:00:47.039> hook<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.430> him<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.760> 2010<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.539> start

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
to hook up with him in 2010 and start

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.139 
to hook up with him in 2010 and start
this<00:00:48.870> project<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.700> spent<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> lot<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
this project and and we spent a lot of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.430 
this project and and we spent a lot of
time<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> tunnel<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.960> come<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
time in the tunnel and come up with a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
time in the tunnel and come up with a
system<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.309> works<00:00:53.940> within<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> frame<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
system that works within the frame and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
system that works within the frame and
rewards<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.649> different<00:00:56.010> parts<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
rewards that the different parts of the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.869 
rewards that the different parts of the
frame

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
frame

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.029

where<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.149> zones<00:00:57.420> front<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.930> rear<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.890> what

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
where the zones front and rear so what

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.889 
where the zones front and rear so what
we<00:00:59.129> have<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> two<00:00:59.910> millimeter<00:01:00.180> wider<00:01:00.539> front

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
we have is a two millimeter wider front

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.490 
we have is a two millimeter wider front
rim<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.530> ten<00:01:01.770> millimeters<00:01:02.250> shallower<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
rim it's ten millimeters shallower and a

rim it's ten millimeters shallower and a
ten<00:01:04.500> millimeter<00:01:04.739> wider<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.850> deeper<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
ten millimeter wider or deeper and and

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
ten millimeter wider or deeper and and
two<00:01:06.930> millimeter<00:01:07.320> narrower<00:01:07.740> rear<00:01:08.070> wheel

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
two millimeter narrower rear wheel

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.120 
two millimeter narrower rear wheel
obviously<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.140> three<00:01:10.320> four<00:01:10.530> stands<00:01:10.890> for

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
obviously and the three four stands for

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.330 
obviously and the three four stands for
35<00:01:11.520> 45<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> you

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
35 45 so what you get out of that is you

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.609 
35 45 so what you get out of that is you
get<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:15.030> aerodynamic<00:01:15.150> fast<00:01:16.049> wheel<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
get a more aerodynamic fast wheel in the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.280 
get a more aerodynamic fast wheel in the
back<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.100> has<00:01:17.280> better<00:01:17.549> state<00:01:18.090> clearance<00:01:18.509> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
back that has better state clearance for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
back that has better state clearance for
the<00:01:19.380> aerodynamic<00:01:20.100> benefit<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> get

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the aerodynamic benefit and then you get

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
the aerodynamic benefit and then you get
a<00:01:21.030> more<00:01:21.240> stable<00:01:21.450> front<00:01:21.930> wheel<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> manage

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a more stable front wheel to manage

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.880 
a more stable front wheel to manage
crosswinds<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.350> nature<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> these

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
crosswinds so in the nature of these

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
crosswinds so in the nature of these
wheels<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.610> ride<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> much<00:01:27.000> deeper

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
wheels is you can ride a much deeper

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
wheels is you can ride a much deeper
wheel<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.280> lesson<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
wheel with the with a lesson to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.420 
wheel with the with a lesson to
crosswind<00:01:30.509> effect<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.680> crosswinds<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
crosswind effect and the crosswinds that

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.160 
crosswind effect and the crosswinds that
you<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.670> pick<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.060> become<00:01:33.390> very<00:01:33.600> predictable

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
you do pick up become very predictable

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.670 
you do pick up become very predictable
and<00:01:34.470> easy<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.829> ride<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.930> it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.530> great

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and easy to ride so it's a it's a great

and easy to ride so it's a it's a great
riding<00:01:38.070> product<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.780> kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> cures

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
riding product and and it kind of cures

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.490 
riding product and and it kind of cures
that<00:01:41.240> twitchiness<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.630> people<00:01:42.899> didn't<00:01:43.350> like

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that twitchiness that people didn't like

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.429 
that twitchiness that people didn't like

tubular this has been a big deal for us

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.330 
tubular this has been a big deal for us
because<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:58.290> pushes<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.159> as

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
because it really pushes what we do as

that we mold in and get the stiffnesses

that we mold in and get the stiffnesses
that<00:02:02.660> we<00:02:02.780> require<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.380> our<00:02:03.470> product<00:02:03.920> but<00:02:04.760> it

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
that we require of our product but it

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.090 
that we require of our product but it
allows<00:02:05.660> us<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.050> finally<00:02:06.410> launch<00:02:06.620> something

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
allows us to finally launch something

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.310 
allows us to finally launch something
that<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.400> it's<00:02:07.730> a<00:02:07.880> true<00:02:08.060> era<00:02:08.300> will<00:02:08.570> a<00:02:08.600> true<00:02:08.900> TT

discs<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.670> rides<00:02:16.670> way<00:02:17.000> better<00:02:17.240> with<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.660> ride

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900

comfortable and then of course the
weights<00:02:21.260> greatly<00:02:21.950> reduced<00:02:22.310> over<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.640> disc<00:02:22.970> so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
weights greatly reduced over a disc so

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.960 
weights greatly reduced over a disc so
it's<00:02:23.420> very<00:02:23.600> very<00:02:23.870> fast<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.560> spool<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:24.890> and<00:02:25.310> easy

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
it's very very fast to spool up and easy

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.120 
it's very very fast to spool up and easy
to<00:02:26.180> keep<00:02:26.330> spinning

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
that's about what we've been up to and I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.280 
that's about what we've been up to and I
