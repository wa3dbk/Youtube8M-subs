00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.959
Oswaldo de Oliveira,
new head coach of Santos FC,

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.266
Which was your first impression
when you got at the Training Center,

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.496
with a new Coaching Staff...

00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:23.344
after 9 years.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.592
I'm very happy to be here
once again,

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.458
it's my third time here,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.190
I'm back to Santos FC,
to Santos city,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.341
I'm going to meet
all the friends I left here,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.242
it's a unique moment.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.473
To be able to work for this team
is an honor,

00:00:49.177 --> 00:00:52.520
I'm very fond of Santos FC,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.873
and to come live in this city
once again is very important,

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:03.276
this is a very happy moment.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.478
What's your goal in 2014?

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.685
What are you going to do
and achieve here at Santos FC?

00:01:10.168 --> 00:01:12.789
We're beginning a new work,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.615
we're going to give more consistency
to what was done...

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.365
when Muricy and Claudinei
were here,

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.957
I'll try to keep up
with everything that has been done,

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:27.662
working accordingly with
all the established guidelines,

00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:31.330
we'll take their work forward,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.152
in order to achieve our goals.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:39.265
I also am...

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.718
willing to correct everything
that happened back in 2005,

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:53.465
I didn't have the chance
to do what I had planned.

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.791
I'm taking this opportunity
very seriously,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.724
I want to take Santos FC to the top,

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.237
that's where the Club belongs,
everybody knows it,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.317
Santos FC belongs in the top,

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:15.733
and I hope I manage
to make it happen.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:18.451
The team has signed
Leandro Damião,

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.117
and has players such as
Montillo and Arouca,

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.424
Edu Dracena,
who are top players,

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.858
it's a strong team...

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:28.881
to fight for the
São Paulo State Championship,

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.428
the Brazilian Championship
and also the Copa Sudamericana.

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:36.229
That's true,
they are great players,

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.182
and I have already worked
with three of them:

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.302
Edu Dracena, Léo
and Arouca.

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.026
I worked with Léo
when I was here back in 2005,

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.446
with Arouca at Fluminense
back in 2006,

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.746
and Edu Dracena at Cruzeiro
back in 2006.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.648
I haven't worked with
the other players so far,

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.939
but I have played against
most of them,

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.155
and this is indeed a qualified team,

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.890
and we'll work in order to...

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.384
make this team produce results...

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.285
in order to fulfill
all of our fans expectations.

00:03:15.514 --> 00:03:19.052
We are aware of the fact
that we're going to face good teams,

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.086
they are also getting ready,

00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:23.472
they are great teams,

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.472
both regionally and nationally,

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.474
those are the competitions
we'll be playing,

00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:34.966
but that's what we must do,

00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:38.119
we know what we have to do,

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.319
and we'll work really hard...

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.585
in order to overcome
all of them.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.181
- Welcome to Santos FC and good luck.
- Thank you, let's do it.
