00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.710
 Yup 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:07.320
 Ah 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.320
 Hmm 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.490
 Cruise Maniac Sound Low 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.840
 It is useful 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.780
 This costume 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:22.410
 It is semi-acoustic 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:27.610
 First of all, chefs who come with a neck shake are 64 years of thin type 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.580
 As you can see from the side, it is quite a bad shake 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.270
 Overall this 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.970
 I wonder if there's a clatter behind this head . 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.000
 We put the volute order to have this kind of strength or 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.070
 After all that's the current arrangement 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Including such a part 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 This semi goes this way 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.550
 I am making 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.750
 After the top 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.740
 Kedomo is the top run but we have become a sleep live of maple 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.050
 To the middle 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:02.310
 The spruce is sandwiched by it that more acoustic sound 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.110
 As you can get 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.240
 I have arranged this side 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.830
 Pickup does 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.340
