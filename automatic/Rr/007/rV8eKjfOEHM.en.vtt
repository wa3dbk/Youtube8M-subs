00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.200
 i 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.070
 good as they are, I hope very well 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.330
 welcome to the tenth recommendation 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.580
 rando 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 10 recommendations run two new without 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.480
 count all the other years that 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.220
 I recommended in three animes to talk 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.570
 very happy that this decision is 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.820
 growing and good of the anime that I am going 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.670
 to recommend today is union in comedy 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.859
 action fantasy adventures also things 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.510
 supernatural is great and good is 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.580
 an animal well the seasons that I think 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.800
 that they are going to love him I am talking about nothing 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.260
 his note that I also known as of 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.719
 be deadly sins or good simply the ones 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.430
 seven capital sins several because not 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.079
 you know nothing the animists to seasons 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.489
 are lousy the best thing is to bake them 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.530
 I recommend things pieces silences all 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.120
 the stories this is anime 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.680
 history tells us about the 7 sins2 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.570
 capitals' who were a group of 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.149
 warriors that apparently trusted to 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.949
 knock down the kingdom of italy and good what 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.840
 that the severe pulsar and strips of the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.520
 over it looks like it was the young 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.890
 also known as the knights 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.270
 sacred but these types the beings 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.070
 supposedly ten years later 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.630
 ruined their reputation because they 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.210
 they were the ones from above the kingdoms 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.539
 killing the king but luckily his daughter 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.149
 elisabeth is still alive and happy tripoli 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.009
 because a cartoon is still alive in good 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.420
 as the princess told them if she lived and 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.429
 puts in search of the seven sins 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.890
 capitals to recover the kingdom 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.570
 enemies to allies and allies 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.729
 to resolution to confusion 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.380
 I do not tell you anymore if this anime 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.880
 true that at first I was not convinced 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.860
 a lot for the appearance of certain 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.380
 characters but I have to confess that to 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.210
 the 15 minutes or so is already 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.770
 is fascinated me I like that lately 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.479
 they are taking out many there are tables and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.009
 mediaeval because it's good to relive the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.569
 inch before and personally I do not 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.490
 I like it very much but I feel that now 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.319
 quite healthy to like in a certain way 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.610
 it seems something innovative, so to speak 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.860
 I was sick of everything that is 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.899
 futuristic and tourist and a view 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.789
 corner sight century or hero of this date 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.380
 date of that date and how the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.000
 anime resin this season so 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.259
 many chapters there is not to see but 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.360
 sincerely they became my 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.360
 bookmarks next to edit forms 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.009

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.569
