00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.689
 what are sprouting granites not 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.279
 Normally when you get the granites 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.800
 and those apparitions begin to appear 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.050
 of pus can be eliminated with that if 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.180
 for oily skin you know there are girls 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.399
 especially that they make up ideas and 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.750

 wash yourself a proper cleaning 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.230
 because this treatment is ideal in addition to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.640
 they of antibacterial treatments if 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.079
 this mud treatment of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.149
 spectacular because what he's going to do is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.219
 penetrate the face and at the same time 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.070
 that penetrates is going to be that it expels the skin 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.050
 all the impurities already therefore that's why 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.730
 is a regeneration inspector that is going to 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.469

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.610
 treatment on the face and now not 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.680
 would merely emit cynthia it becomes a 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.390
 every 15 days is a treatment 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.160
 spectacular that you do not need 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.210
 being doing momentarily is the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.909
 advantage of the track 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.950
 so good right now jane started and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.229
 a previous cleaning was done on the face 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.360
 what we did to be able to apply the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.520
 mud look at the mud come right now in 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.530
 screen yes we can see well in powder 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.210
 but if you are seeing on screen us 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.820
 can make someone take a powder 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.740
 the mud and this is going to obviously 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.050
 make a mix with assets so that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.330
 can work on the face and it is placed 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.100
 we have previously applied it in 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 the other part of the face leaves it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 approximately a housewife has to 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.369
 know 20 minutes 20 minutes is going to be that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.860
 effect of expelling all impurities 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.810
 dead spots of the skin and now yes 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.429
 We will remove it immediately if you already 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.380
 it seems that it is already dry exactly 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.360
 we will advance you already for time in 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.210
 screen if you see you see the difference of 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.490
 before and after if and when it dries 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 completely the mud we see 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 that starts to crack and there it is 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.990
 when we are the indicative 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.690
 principal in which we already owe 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.580
 remove it if it's there again 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.830
 brings that mud therapy mud therapy 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 obviously being antibacterial the same 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.640
 extensor time if then it will give you 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.120
 thank you institute that makes sessions 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.220
 obviously suitable for what is acne 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.959
 is going to be an effect if cativo what 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.599
 we need in acne is to dry 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.310
 those granites that normally we can not 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.110
 for that appearance then that's going to 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.939
 achieve this type of masks 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.590
 look you see now then stick excuse 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.629
 to interrupt after withdrawing the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.579
 mud therapy mask that I owe 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.959
 to do already normally we have 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.209
 to hydrate after having cleansed 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.010
 totally that face we are going to 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.599
 place what is an acid ampoule 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.489
 hyaluronic can be spectacular for 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.109
 the patient injection not normally 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.549
 we handle injections because 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.650
 you know the acne skins are very 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.540
 sensitive then if we indicate 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.769
 with an injection it's going to be a bit 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.840
 painful for the patient then 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.489
 what we do is moisturize with 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.739
 ampoules of hyaluronic acid that are going 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.450
 addressed for each patient are not 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.030
