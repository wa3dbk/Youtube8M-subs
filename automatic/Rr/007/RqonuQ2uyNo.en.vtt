00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.060
 Imagine a ZDF 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.890
 correspondent such as katrin 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.450
 eigendorf would be a Russian 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.010
 send an interview to news broadcasters 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 and to the psychology of ours 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.610
 Chancellor and the negative 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.769
 German media as uniformity 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.560
 certainly would not like to describe 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.330
 seen by your employer 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 Now has a Russian journalist named 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.130
 constantin golden second just that done 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.720
 and in an interview with phoenix 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.600
 in the head of the Russian president 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.219
 how much does it hurt? 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.010
 the russian president that he is not 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.110
 with these g7 the former times g8 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.630
 were there, I would say that it was 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 if it is quite painful for him 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.280
 the psychology of our president 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.500
 which is not that easy 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.899
 then you should say that you 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.670
 is quite offended that one with 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 all sorts of means and that way 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 demonstratively trying to isolate and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.110
 to show that Russia is not a part 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.050
 this western world is 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.180
 that's why he wants, for example 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.299
 the day after tomorrow with the Italian 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.859
 premier renzi meet therefore tries 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.990
 you also on these days possible 

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.579
 as actively as possible his connections too 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.029
 China and other Asian partners 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:18.359
 to show that it is not connected there 

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:22.289
 either it was the Merkel one 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:25.079
 modern of the usa is or if not that 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:29.009
 then the posts show customers of the 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.779
 Europe disintegrates golden branch worked 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.090
 at the time still at the Russian 

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:35.549
 ntw and was allegedly after the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.499
 statements canceled without notice 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.979
 but he has his notice already in 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:42.869
 march at n-tv filed a story for 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.909
 the media of a medienmacher the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.979
 in the sense of former rtl 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.409
 presenter lisa a dramatic 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.329
 I wanted to organize a departure 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.489
 not dramatically enough an interview 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.079
 he did not want to give us ntb 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.909
 There is no official statement 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.709
 but a cut as golden 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.289
 branch nor a so-called party line 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.779
 cream reporter was and indeed whole twelve 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.819
 has for years bet up arbitrariness 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:07.619
 clearly the russia is closer than you 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.149
 just think about the sea 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.500
 Russians and Germans are also about the 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.790
 new gas pipeline north stream connected 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.410
 the pipeline starts in russian 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.540
 vyborg and runs through the baltic sea 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.100
 to Mecklenburg Vorpommern one of the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.020
 poorest german federal states 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.760
 But that is also the node of the 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.590
 interests of dozens of Germans and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.460
 in spite of everything, Russian companies 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.460
 work together 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.020
 russia means dutch for some 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.180
 no longer economy and human rights 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.370
 but especially russian culture you 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.690
 will be extraordinary this year 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.610
 presents here are guest games of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.770
 mariinsky theater as well as the exhibition 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.360
 icons from the andrea breth museum 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.280
 instead of that comes the week of 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.709
 Russian language and the festival of 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.550
 a total of over 200 classical music 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.410
 events 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.480
 Russia is closer than you think 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.770
 does not have to open window but only 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.770
 be a bit curious 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.730
 not even two months ago 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.320
 But Poroshenko Berlin visits the location 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.090
 has changed drastically the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.430
 Chancellor Angela Merkel comes after 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.830
 Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin and 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.340
 Foreign Minister John Kerry negotiates 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.340
 with immense 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.830
 during this first peace try 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.510
 Poroshenko tries again for Russia 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.860
 the protracted conflict in the east 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.860
 to blame ukraine
