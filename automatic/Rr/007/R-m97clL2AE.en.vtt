right<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.970> guys<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
right here as you guys can see is the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.960 
right here as you guys can see is the
EOD<00:01:40.110> tech<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> guys<00:01:41.250> can't<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.759> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
EOD tech but what you guys can't see is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.899 
EOD tech but what you guys can't see is
stock<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.659> FMJ<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.430> reason<00:01:44.640> behind<00:01:44.729> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
stock in FMJ so the reason behind the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.700 
stock in FMJ so the reason behind the
EOD<00:01:45.270> tech<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.689> basically<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
EOD tech is basically just because I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.130 
EOD tech is basically just because I
don't<00:01:47.040> like<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> iron<00:01:47.640> sights<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.090> much<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
don't like the iron sights that much so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.719 
don't like the iron sights that much so
I<00:01:49.229> threw<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> on<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> second<00:01:50.549> reason

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I threw this on in the second reason

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.770 
I threw this on in the second reason
behind<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.630> bought

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
behind that is because I just bought

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420 
behind that is because I just bought
this<00:01:51.930> camo<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.710> gonna<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:53.070> one<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.310> these

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
this camo so I'm gonna use one of these

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.010 
this camo so I'm gonna use one of these
sights<00:01:53.700> no<00:01:53.880> matter<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.689> gonna<00:01:54.840> pay

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
sights no matter what I'm not gonna pay

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.039 
sights no matter what I'm not gonna pay
for<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.470> not<00:01:55.560> use<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.479> so

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
for it and not use it so do that on so

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.209 
for it and not use it so do that on so
basically<00:01:58.439> that's<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> only<00:01:58.920> reasoning

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
basically that's the only reasoning

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.969 
basically that's the only reasoning
behind<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.579> but<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.899> stock<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.560> that's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
behind that but for the stock and that's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.380 
behind that but for the stock and that's
the<00:02:02.100> second<00:02:02.430> part<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.729> actually<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.299> up

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the second part of this actually the up

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.850 
the second part of this actually the up
through<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> stock<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.710> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
through the stock I'm because I like to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.319 
through the stock I'm because I like to
like<00:02:05.100> aim<00:02:05.340> down<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.640> sights<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:06.090> little<00:02:06.119> bit

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
like aim down the sights a little bit

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.359 
like aim down the sights a little bit
more<00:02:06.479> with<00:02:06.630> assault<00:02:07.020> rifles<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.129> like<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
more with assault rifles and I like to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.589 
more with assault rifles and I like to
move<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.819> bit<00:02:08.970> quicker<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:09.509> you

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
move a little bit quicker and I'm you

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.820 
move a little bit quicker and I'm you
doing<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.170> everyone<00:02:10.619> knows<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
doing that because everyone knows that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.199 
doing that because everyone knows that
when<00:02:11.129> you're<00:02:11.190> aiming<00:02:11.340> down<00:02:11.580> sights<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> move

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
when you're aiming down sights you move

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
when you're aiming down sights you move
a<00:02:12.300> bit<00:02:12.510> slower

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
a bit slower

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900 
a bit slower
but<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.920> stock<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.430> basically<00:02:14.760> just

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
but with the stock you basically just

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.460 
but with the stock you basically just
get<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.390> move<00:02:15.540> around<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.870> bit<00:02:15.900> quicker<00:02:16.230> like

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
get to move around a bit quicker like

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.310 
get to move around a bit quicker like
stalker<00:02:16.800> from<00:02:17.070> mw3<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.180> that's<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.080> reason

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
stalker from mw3 so that's the reason

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.020 
stalker from mw3 so that's the reason
behind<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.620> stock<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:20.430> FMJ<00:02:21.000> I

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
behind the stock on this and then FMJ I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.820 
behind the stock on this and then FMJ I
got<00:02:21.390> tired<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.720> people<00:02:21.960> running<00:02:22.290> around<00:02:22.380> doors

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
got tired of people running around doors

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.410 
got tired of people running around doors
and<00:02:23.160> walls<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.550> stuff<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.880> me<00:02:24.030> not<00:02:24.210> getting

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
and walls and stuff and me not getting

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.210 
and walls and stuff and me not getting
the<00:02:24.480> kill<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.380> I<00:02:25.410> threw<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.710> on<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.190> a

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the kill so I threw that on to get a

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220 
the kill so I threw that on to get a
little<00:02:26.490> bit<00:02:26.700> more<00:02:26.880> penetration<00:02:27.630> there<00:02:27.870> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
little bit more penetration there so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.230 
little bit more penetration there so
that's<00:02:29.190> basically<00:02:29.460> why<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.820> running<00:02:30.120> my

aiming down sights are now and everyone

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.030 
aiming down sights are now and everyone

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
knows that toughness makes us see a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130 
knows that toughness makes us see a
flinch<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.490> little<00:02:53.520> less<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.960> that

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
flinch a little less and I like that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.930 
flinch a little less and I like that
because<00:02:55.320> I<00:02:55.680> aim<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.160> sights<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.640> lot<00:02:56.820> on

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
because I aim down the sights a lot on

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240 
because I aim down the sights a lot on
this<00:02:57.060> weapon<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.960> do<00:02:58.380> want<00:02:58.680> toughness<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.190> I

this weapon so I do want toughness so I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.500 
this weapon so I do want toughness so I
don't<00:02:59.460> get<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.670> flinch<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.300> hit<00:03:00.480> my

you can hit people with without aiming

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.890 
you can hit people with without aiming
down<00:03:32.459> sights<00:03:32.730> from<00:03:32.940> pretty<00:03:33.150> close<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.690> medium

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
down sights from pretty close to medium

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.690 
down sights from pretty close to medium
range<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.560> close<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.890> medium<00:03:35.010> range<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.489> guess

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
range like close to medium range I guess

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.729 
range like close to medium range I guess

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
had a 40 or 38 and two gameplay but I've

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.600 
had a 40 or 38 and two gameplay but I've
ruined<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:17.020> yeah<00:05:17.500> and<00:05:17.920> let's<00:05:18.400> get<00:05:18.460> talking

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
ruined it so yeah and let's get talking

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.610 
ruined it so yeah and let's get talking
about<00:05:18.880> perks<00:05:19.270> for<00:05:19.450> this<00:05:19.690> so<00:05:19.990> basically<00:05:20.260> I

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
about perks for this so basically I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.410 
about perks for this so basically I
believe<00:05:20.860> this<00:05:21.250> gun<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.610> good<00:05:21.820> make<00:05:22.150> and<00:05:22.390> I

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
believe this gun is good make and I

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.970 
believe this gun is good make and I
guess<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.660> could<00:05:22.780> say<00:05:22.930> with<00:05:23.110> no<00:05:23.290> perks<00:05:23.590> on<00:05:23.800> it

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
guess you could say with no perks on it

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.340 
guess you could say with no perks on it
or<00:05:24.520> not<00:05:24.700> perks<00:05:24.970> attachments<00:05:25.600> you<00:05:26.080> could<00:05:26.200> run

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
or not perks attachments you could run

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.960 
or not perks attachments you could run
this<00:05:26.440> thing<00:05:26.590> naked<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.220> it<00:05:27.520> would<00:05:27.670> be<00:05:27.790> pretty

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
this thing naked and it would be pretty

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.720 
this thing naked and it would be pretty
decent<00:05:28.240> itself<00:05:28.780> so<00:05:29.100> basically<00:05:30.100> go<00:05:30.340> on<00:05:30.520> through

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
decent itself so basically go on through

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.130 
decent itself so basically go on through
whatever<00:05:30.850> you<00:05:31.090> want<00:05:31.270> but<00:05:31.570> you<00:05:31.780> might<00:05:31.930> want<00:05:32.110> to

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
whatever you want but you might want to

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.700 
whatever you want but you might want to
try<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.560> one<00:05:32.710> on<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:33.010> grip<00:05:33.250> on<00:05:33.400> here<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:34.000> I

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
try it the one on the grip on here the I

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.660 
try it the one on the grip on here the I
think<00:05:35.710> it's<00:05:35.890> called<00:05:36.010> a<00:05:36.130> grip<00:05:36.280> or<00:05:36.400> something

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
think it's called a grip or something

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.450 
think it's called a grip or something
there<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:37.380> slit<00:05:38.380> hand<00:05:38.680> grip<00:05:38.950> or<00:05:39.100> whatever<00:05:39.340> it

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
there the slit hand grip or whatever it

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.920 
there the slit hand grip or whatever it
is<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.730> weird<00:05:39.940> grip<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.480> one<00:05:40.630> that<00:05:40.780> like

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
is the weird grip the one that like

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.240 
is the weird grip the one that like
makes<00:05:41.170> you<00:05:41.230> like<00:05:41.410> aim<00:05:41.620> a<00:05:41.650> little<00:05:41.950> bit<00:05:42.040> quicker

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
makes you like aim a little bit quicker

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.150 
makes you like aim a little bit quicker
but<00:05:42.390> that's<00:05:43.390> just<00:05:43.540> my<00:05:43.890> opinion<00:05:44.890> and<00:05:45.010> then

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
but that's just my opinion and then

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.920 
but that's just my opinion and then
another<00:05:45.370> one<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:45.820> maybe<00:05:46.030> fast<00:05:46.390> next<00:05:46.660> because
