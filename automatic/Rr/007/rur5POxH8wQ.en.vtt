 this the day of the premiere of down 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.249
 a tutorial 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.730
 our understanding is not necessary information about the application 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.889
 called sexenio 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.869
 what that sense is very simple 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.909
 in this sense 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.439
 who does serve to send 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.130
 free message 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 via the internet with our iphone or ipod touch 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.599

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.300

 are excepted he told us 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.600
 I hope that while Mexico we have to put 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.940
 the number 52 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.940
 before the number to which we are going to send the message 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.160
 for example 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.410
 I thought to send a message in Mexico we have to put 52 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.300
 inquired into the number 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.650

 but stop the other countries cent the world 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.290
 I think they are called 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.630
 telephone prefixes 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.220
 If Miraflores Presidential Fail 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.190

 buenos aires - stay here in the country 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.700
 I'm going to leave this day for the page of the double crime are the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.000
 three children that are the number you have to put up to the beginning 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.170
 to join the number of murders 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.970
 he is faithful and 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.670
 good sample of your ability 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.159
 magnet here you are going to find something that says the connect phone prefix connect 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.220
 and they're going to come down here 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.110
 another part of the countries 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.369
 and all his three children 6 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.980
 he says of implicit prices 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.110
 for example to 15 years in the index 93 that is the number 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.780
 for example if they rise that in the entity 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.929
 they have to write down the number 93 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 before the selector where will they send the message 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.899
 for example there is always someone who reveals the dollar 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.069
 To climb 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.859

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.930
 if so, they will be going to approach this right 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.359
 they are still on the street 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:35.299

 for example its in Argentina 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.799
 for example here is the Argentina 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.900
 they have to put the number 54 up to the beginning 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.229
 This is the main road element of Argentina 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.359

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.090
 outside of your country 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.749
 this for example in the case of Mexico 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:44.179
 they are going to send messages to Colombia or Spain only to the mythical 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.199

 our country 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.560
