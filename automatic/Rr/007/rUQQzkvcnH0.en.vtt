here<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.859> exactly<00:00:23.160> what<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
here to you is just exactly what it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.820 
here to you is just exactly what it
looks<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> bobcat<00:00:25.230> bobcat

looks like this is on a bobcat bobcat
set<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.189> standard<00:00:26.580> many<00:00:26.760> many<00:00:26.939> years<00:00:27.210> ago

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
set the standard many many years ago

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480 
set the standard many many years ago
that<00:00:27.539> others<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.140> followed<00:00:28.349> there's<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> lot

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that others have followed there's a lot

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.950 
that others have followed there's a lot
of<00:00:29.609> old<00:00:29.760> machines<00:00:30.269> around<00:00:30.539> from<00:00:30.810> other

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of old machines around from other

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.569 
of old machines around from other
manufacturers<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.859> will<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.250> fit<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
manufacturers that will not fit the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.819 
manufacturers that will not fit the
universal<00:00:33.030> standard<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.200> easiest<00:00:34.680> way<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
universal standard the easiest way to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.770 
universal standard the easiest way to
tell<00:00:35.130> if<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.489> universal<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.630> look

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
tell if it's a universal is just look

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
tell if it's a universal is just look
here<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.410> should<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.590> two<00:00:37.890> levers<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.340> top

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
here you should have two levers on top

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
here you should have two levers on top
but<00:00:39.239> drive<00:00:39.450> two<00:00:39.719> pins<00:00:39.960> out<00:00:40.110> at<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> bottom

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
but drive two pins out at the bottom

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590 
but drive two pins out at the bottom
that's<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.160> most<00:00:41.309> common<00:00:41.640> way<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.360> tell

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
that's the most common way just to tell

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
that's the most common way just to tell
now<00:00:43.379> there's<00:00:43.559> some<00:00:43.680> older<00:00:43.890> case<00:00:44.070> machines

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
now there's some older case machines

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.430 
now there's some older case machines
around<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> Pens<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.200> slightly

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
around that have the Pens in a slightly

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.240 
around that have the Pens in a slightly
different<00:00:46.649> place

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
different place

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.799 
different place
we<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.640> menu<00:00:48.030> our<00:00:48.120> manufacturer

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
we actually menu our manufacturer

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.529 
we actually menu our manufacturer
attachments<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> fit<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.010> location<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
attachments to fit that location if you

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
attachments to fit that location if you
measure<00:00:51.809> across<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> quick<00:00:53.039> attach<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
measure across do a quick attach it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
measure across do a quick attach it
should<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:54.090> 44<00:00:54.719> inches<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.829> ever<00:00:55.920> take

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
should be about 44 inches you ever take

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
should be about 44 inches you ever take
about<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.460> half<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.879> inch<00:00:56.969> most<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.539> them<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.780> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
about a half an inch most of them are in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.560 
about a half an inch most of them are in
that<00:00:58.410> 44<00:00:58.859> inch<00:00:59.039> range<00:00:59.309> from<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> top<00:01:00.359> here

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that 44 inch range from the top here

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.849 
that 44 inch range from the top here
there's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.930> lip<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.320> fits<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
there's a little lip that fits in the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
there's a little lip that fits in the
cup<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.609> attachment<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.019> down<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
cup of the attachment and down to the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
cup of the attachment and down to the
heel<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.010> we're<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.400> radius<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.210> back

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
heel here we're actually radius is back

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.289 
heel here we're actually radius is back
that's<00:01:07.110> 15<00:01:07.619> inches<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.119> thing

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that's 15 inches then the other thing

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.520 
that's 15 inches then the other thing
you'll<00:01:09.479> notice<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.840> you'll<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.350> two

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you'll notice is you'll see these two

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
you'll notice is you'll see these two
levers<00:01:10.770> now<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> power<00:01:11.670> bobcat<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.270> my

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
levers now I have a power bobcat on my

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.760 
levers now I have a power bobcat on my
machine<00:01:12.570> which<00:01:12.900> means<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.260> hydraulically

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
machine which means it's hydraulically

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
machine which means it's hydraulically
operated<00:01:13.830> but<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.090> operate<00:01:15.509> this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
operated but I can actually operate this

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240 
operated but I can actually operate this
one<00:01:15.869> manual<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.259> well<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.710> show<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:16.950> so

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
one manual as well just to show you so

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
one manual as well just to show you so
if<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.549> reach<00:01:17.759> over<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.930> push

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
if I go reach over here and I just push

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
if I go reach over here and I just push
these<00:01:19.229> levers<00:01:19.439> down<00:01:22.009> you'll<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.159> two<00:01:23.310> pins

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
these levers down you'll see two pins

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.460 
these levers down you'll see two pins
pop<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> bottom<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:25.259> what

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
pop out the bottom here that's what

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.899 
pop out the bottom here that's what
you're<00:01:25.619> looking<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.189> your<00:01:26.220> quick
