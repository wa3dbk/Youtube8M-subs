00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.290 
putting two different things together
once<00:01:39.980> we<00:01:40.100> get<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.310> holos<00:01:40.610> together<00:01:40.940> we<00:01:41.150> can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.539 

once<00:01:54.409> a<00:01:54.530> student<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.890> comfortable<00:01:55.280> with<00:01:55.369> half

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:26.830 

so<00:02:10.890> these<00:02:10.979> are<00:02:11.189> sort<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> swan

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.289 

now<00:02:28.159> up<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.519> point<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:30.030> don't<00:02:30.180> have

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
now up to this point we don't have

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.059 
now up to this point we don't have
anything<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.720> really<00:02:31.140> sounds<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.590> what

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
anything that really sounds like what

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.039 
anything that really sounds like what
you<00:02:32.159> would<00:02:32.250> hear<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.579> record<00:02:33.030> what<00:02:33.810> we<00:02:33.900> do

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
you would hear on a record what we do

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.259 
you would hear on a record what we do
next<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.620> drop<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.760> eighth<00:02:35.909> notes<00:02:36.180> that

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
next is we drop the eighth notes that

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.670 
next is we drop the eighth notes that
are<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> downbeat<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:36.959> only<00:02:37.379> play<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
are on the downbeat and only play the

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
eighth notes that are on the upbeat so

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.289 
eighth notes that are on the upbeat so
