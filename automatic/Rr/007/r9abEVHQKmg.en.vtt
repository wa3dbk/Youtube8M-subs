00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
hot enough it will actually start to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
hot enough it will actually start to
you'll<00:01:49.320> see<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.649> movement<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.240> know

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270

it starts getting a little dimply you
can<00:01:52.920> start<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.369> curl<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can start to see some curl like the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.590 
can start to see some curl like the
small<00:01:54.689> small<00:01:55.530> soft<00:01:55.829> soft<00:01:56.240> splashing<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.329> waves

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
small small soft soft splashing of waves

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.539 
small small soft soft splashing of waves
inside<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.259> okay<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.340> hot

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
inside of it okay that's pretty hot

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.580 
inside of it okay that's pretty hot
right<00:01:59.700> there

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.570 

that's<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.830> sear<00:02:05.010> about<00:02:05.250> two<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.550> three

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
that's going to sear about two to three

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.910 
that's going to sear about two to three
minutes<00:02:05.760> right<00:02:06.180> there<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.570> pan<00:02:06.870> I'm<00:02:07.740> not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
minutes right there in that pan I'm not

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.990 
minutes right there in that pan I'm not
going<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.130> touch<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.370> right<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:08.790> because

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
going to touch it right now because

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.670 
going to touch it right now because
immediately<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.930> it<00:02:10.440> has<00:02:10.650> a

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
immediately it's going to it has a

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.230 
immediately it's going to it has a
tendency<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.280> stick<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.850> bottom<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
tendency to stick to the bottom of the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.750 
tendency to stick to the bottom of the
pan<00:02:12.450> first<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:12.960> as<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.710> sees<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> crust

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
pan first and as it sees it as a crust

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.490 
pan first and as it sees it as a crust
develops<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> bottom<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.870> fish<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
develops on the bottom of the fish it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.400 
develops on the bottom of the fish it
will<00:02:16.620> actually<00:02:16.740> lift<00:02:17.160> right<00:02:17.460> off<00:02:17.490> so<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:19.260> not

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
will actually lift right off so do not

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.200 
will actually lift right off so do not
touch<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:19.950> do<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.310> try<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.490> move<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.850> just

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
touch it now do not try to move it just

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.520 
touch it now do not try to move it just
wait<00:02:21.360> till<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.720> char<00:02:21.990> starts<00:02:22.350> happening

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
wait till that char starts happening

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
wait till that char starts happening
that's<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.250> sear<00:02:23.520> happens<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.120> lift

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that's that sear happens and they lift

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:35.240 
that's that sear happens and they lift
right<00:02:24.540> off<00:02:32.030> get<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> nice<00:02:33.270> little<00:02:34.250> golden

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
right off get a nice little golden

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.390 
right off get a nice little golden
chance<00:02:35.520> here<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.180> baby<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:38.070> what<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.220> would

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
do now cuz I'd let it bubble right in

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.000 
do now cuz I'd let it bubble right in
that<00:02:41.250> pan<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:42.330> into<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.660> hot<00:02:42.840> oven<00:02:46.010> 500

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that pan right into a hot oven 500

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.190 
that pan right into a hot oven 500
degree<00:02:47.430> oven<00:02:47.810> i'd<00:02:48.810> say<00:02:49.640> maybe<00:02:50.640> three<00:02:51.450> four<00:02:51.840> I'd

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
degree oven i'd say maybe three four I'd

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.360 
degree oven i'd say maybe three four I'd
say<00:02:52.380> three<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.620> five<00:02:52.830> minutes<00:02:53.040> something<00:02:53.280> like

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
say three to five minutes something like

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.160 
say three to five minutes something like
that<00:02:53.580> maybe<00:02:53.790> six<00:02:54.180> depending<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.870> how<00:02:54.960> well

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
that maybe six depending on how well

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.900 
that maybe six depending on how well
you've<00:02:55.350> done<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.710> like<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:56.040> cook<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.670> fish

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
you've done you like your cook your fish

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.370 
you've done you like your cook your fish
cooked<00:02:57.180> but<00:02:57.300> that's<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.540> pretty<00:02:57.720> dense<00:02:57.930> pieces

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
cooked but that's a pretty dense pieces

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.070 
cooked but that's a pretty dense pieces
of<00:02:58.470> halibut<00:02:58.830> here<00:02:59.300> it's<00:03:00.300> pretty<00:03:00.510> meaty<00:03:00.750> fish

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
of halibut here it's pretty meaty fish

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.920 
of halibut here it's pretty meaty fish
so<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:02.370> acts<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.910> lot<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.090> steak<00:03:03.540> when<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:03.840> in

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
so it acts a lot like steak when it's in

so it acts a lot like steak when it's in
the<00:03:04.020> oven<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:04.740> it's<00:03:04.890> going<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.070> cook<00:03:05.280> just<00:03:05.459> like

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.360 
there you go so with fish it's if the
texture<00:03:38.480> holds<00:03:39.380> together<00:03:39.530> but<00:03:39.980> there's<00:03:40.130> also

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
texture holds together but there's also

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.920 
texture holds together but there's also
the<00:03:40.610> green<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.240> sort<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.600> large

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
the green of it it's sort of like large

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.340 
the green of it it's sort of like large
flake<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.590> big<00:03:43.310> heavy<00:03:43.550> structure<00:03:44.030> for<00:03:44.540> halibut

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
flake a big heavy structure for halibut

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.350 
flake a big heavy structure for halibut
and<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.830> gets<00:03:45.950> finer<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:46.880> you<00:03:46.970> just<00:03:47.120> want<00:03:47.300> to

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
and it gets finer but you just want to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.210 
and it gets finer but you just want to
push<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:47.900> basically<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.860> want<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.130> have

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
push it and basically you want to have

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.270 
push it and basically you want to have
that<00:03:49.340> firmness<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.260> holds<00:03:51.440> together<00:03:51.680> but

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
that firmness that it holds together but

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.310 
that firmness that it holds together but
that<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.520> almost<00:03:52.760> wants<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.420> break<00:03:53.600> apart<00:03:53.720> you

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
that it almost wants to break apart you

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.540 
that it almost wants to break apart you
know<00:03:54.410> when<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.650> fish<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:54.860> flaked<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.430> can

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
know when the fish is flaked you can

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.770 
know when the fish is flaked you can
really<00:03:55.700> flake<00:03:55.940> it<00:03:56.090> off<00:03:56.210> that<00:03:56.420> means<00:03:56.600> it's

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
really flake it off that means it's

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.180 
really flake it off that means it's
overcooked<00:03:57.170> that<00:03:57.560> means<00:03:57.770> you<00:03:57.860> went<00:03:57.980> too<00:03:58.160> far

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
overcooked that means you went too far

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.850 
overcooked that means you went too far
but<00:03:58.850> if<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.060> wants<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.870> break<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.290> then<00:04:00.740> it

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
but if it wants to break and then it

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.050 
but if it wants to break and then it
just<00:04:01.010> holds<00:04:01.310> up<00:04:01.430> that's<00:04:01.700> great<00:04:01.970> also<00:04:02.690> at<00:04:03.620> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
just holds up that's great also at the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.520 
just holds up that's great also at the
break<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.090> where<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.420> fibers<00:04:05.840> sometimes

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
break of where the fibers sometimes

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.290 
break of where the fibers sometimes
you'll<00:04:06.740> just<00:04:06.950> see<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.130> little<00:04:07.580> bit<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:07.790> moisture

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
you'll just see a little bit of moisture

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.240 
you'll just see a little bit of moisture
come<00:04:08.660> out<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.900> here<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.200> if<00:04:09.530> that's<00:04:09.710> clear<00:04:10.070> a

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
come out of here and if that's clear a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.560 
come out of here and if that's clear a
little<00:04:10.460> bit<00:04:10.640> clearer<00:04:10.850> maybe<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.240> little<00:04:11.420> bit

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
little bit clearer maybe a little bit

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.090 
little bit clearer maybe a little bit
milky<00:04:11.900> that's<00:04:12.380> good<00:04:12.590> that<00:04:12.740> means<00:04:12.770> it's

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
milky that's good that means it's

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.520 
milky that's good that means it's
probably<00:04:13.250> cooked<00:04:13.640> all<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.030> way<00:04:14.090> through<00:04:14.150> so

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
probably cooked all the way through so

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.259 
probably cooked all the way through so
push<00:04:15.530> push<00:04:15.770> push<00:04:15.800> if<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.549> feels<00:04:16.970> like<00:04:17.090> it

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
push push push if it just feels like it

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.370 
push push push if it just feels like it
wants<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.510> break<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:17.840> it's<00:04:17.989> hanging<00:04:18.200> together

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
wants a break but it's hanging together

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.270 
wants a break but it's hanging together
then<00:04:18.980> the<00:04:19.130> fish<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.459> cooked

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.150 

little<00:04:24.970> arugula<00:04:27.330> little<00:04:28.330> olive<00:04:28.600> oil<00:04:32.040> maybe<00:04:33.040> a

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
little arugula little olive oil maybe a

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.990 
little arugula little olive oil maybe a
splash<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.669> lemon<00:04:35.130> really<00:04:36.130> we<00:04:36.550> got<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.730> summer

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
splash of lemon really we got a summer

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.480 
splash of lemon really we got a summer
meal<00:04:37.240> right<00:04:37.450> here
