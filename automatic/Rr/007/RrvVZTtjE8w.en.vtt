00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.870 
professor at Cal State San Bernardino
and<00:01:56.890> he<00:01:57.010> decides<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.400> go<00:01:57.490> out<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:57.790> this

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
and he decides to go out and do this

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.950 
and he decides to go out and do this
instead<00:01:58.180> I'll<00:01:58.390> know<00:01:58.540> how<00:01:58.659> much<00:01:58.810> they're

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
instead I'll know how much they're

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.930 
instead I'll know how much they're
paying<00:01:58.990> maybe<00:01:59.470> not<00:01:59.650> much<00:01:59.800> or<00:02:00.159> if<00:02:00.640> it's<00:02:00.760> based

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
paying maybe not much or if it's based

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.310 
paying maybe not much or if it's based
in<00:02:01.090> money<00:02:01.300> but<00:02:01.390> like<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:01.810> said<00:02:01.870> you<00:02:02.080> have<00:02:02.229> this

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
in money but like I said you have this

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.290 
in money but like I said you have this
mentality<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.860> if<00:02:03.159> there's<00:02:03.460> drug<00:02:03.940> dealers

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
mentality that if there's drug dealers

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.500 
mentality that if there's drug dealers
or<00:02:04.800> gang<00:02:05.800> drug<00:02:06.190> dealing<00:02:06.550> on<00:02:06.640> top<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.090> that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
or gang drug dealing on top of it that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.449 
or gang drug dealing on top of it that
that's<00:02:07.750> generally<00:02:08.229> their<00:02:08.349> life<00:02:08.590> mm-hmm<00:02:09.340> and

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
that's generally their life mm-hmm and

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.440 
that's generally their life mm-hmm and
maybe<00:02:09.609> that's<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:09.969> difference<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.329> I'm

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
maybe that's the difference is I'm

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.970 
maybe that's the difference is I'm
saying<00:02:10.719> biker<00:02:11.469> gangs<00:02:11.799> they<00:02:12.310> kind<00:02:12.579> of<00:02:12.609> made<00:02:12.760> up

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
saying biker gangs they kind of made up

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.009
