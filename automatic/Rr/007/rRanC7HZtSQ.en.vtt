00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 very good everyone i'm dzeko do this 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 video tutorial I will show you how 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.510
 run windows 95 and windows games 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.030
 98 in windows 7 for this we have two 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.880
 options one of them is to hit the button 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.500
 right to the executable of the game we give 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.660
 to properties 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.570
 we select the compatibility tab 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.960
 and we mark execute this program in 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.800
 compatibility mode for windows 95 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.169
 windows 98 in this case windows 95 it 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.050
 we give to apply and in some cases 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.879
 when we execute it, it will give us an error 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.449
 that this game is not made for this 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:42.460
 operating system we give you to accept and 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:46.840
 the other way to run the game on 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.610
 other cases with this method would be worth 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.500
 access the page you indicated to 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.930
 continuation www.xbox.com 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.390
 we give to the download section 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.290
 and we select the tab that says 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.410
 windows 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.880
 once open we give you here or 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.520
 We wait for the time you indicate here 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.030
 below and once downloaded the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.740
 Program 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.690
 we execute it we give to next next of 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.770
 new we select the directory that 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.110
 we want to install what we are going to install 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.560
 we close 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.860
 and this program consists of an emulator 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.600
 of dmc 2 how it works well 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.130
 we close the window 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.770
 the game in question that I'm going to 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.360
 teach to execute is this from here 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.390
 the constructor is a game of 1997 and the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.430
 Game maker company closed 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 so it does not have any kind of 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.580
 support for other operating systems 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.380
 we select the game we copy it 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.970
 we select the directory where 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.970
 we want to copy it for example p 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.430
 and once here 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.120
 we open the program 2 box we write 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.240
 mount 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.240
 p 2 points space 2 points 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.120
 and we will have installed the program 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.920
 said disk is worth use p because as 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.230
 you can check here 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.770
 in the downloads partition is p two 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.750
 points if outside do we put mount of 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.750
 two spaces colon points 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.040
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.409
 confirm the sound we drag the set 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.460
 they are bad to the executable of the 2 box 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:45.250
 it will automatically open 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.590
 to configure it is very simple 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.250
 we give intro in the first option you 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.860
 we are going to detect 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.570
 okay 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.050
 and how can you check if we give 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.880
 test 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.930
 it will be heard we give it to ok 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.239
 although again ok 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.310
 and we have to configure the sound 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.290
 we give to exit 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.330
 and to execute the game we do what 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.890
 same as the sound we drag the 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:19.050
 executable to the 2-box direct access 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.050
 and automatically it will execute us 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.090
 we give intro 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.800
 to play 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.730
 and we have the game ready 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.150
 to be the games we will accept 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.150
 it works perfectly 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.540
 and nothing to leave 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.650
 we give to escape 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 we mark the tick 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.130
 exit the program the tic again and 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.140
 we write success 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.670
 and nothing that's all in today's tutorial 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.680
 I hope it has helped you and 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.710
 they can run windows 95 games 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.260
 windows 98 windows 7 if they have any 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.210
 doubt do not hesitate to ask me the and below 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.470
 the description I will leave the link for 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.870
 download this game 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.910

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.910
 type of rights or copyright
