00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.479 
imagine now 45 minutes has gone what's
the<00:02:26.769> next<00:02:26.920> step<00:02:27.280> well<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.810> don't<00:02:28.959> want<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> put

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
the next step well you don't want to put

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.339 
the next step well you don't want to put
aquarium<00:02:30.489> water<00:02:30.720> from<00:02:31.720> your<00:02:31.870> local<00:02:32.200> fish

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
aquarium water from your local fish

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.009 
aquarium water from your local fish
store<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.340> your<00:02:33.459> aquarium<00:02:33.700> because<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
store and it's your aquarium because you

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.539 
store and it's your aquarium because you
don't<00:02:35.200> know<00:02:35.260> what's<00:02:35.380> in<00:02:35.500> there<00:02:35.709> do<00:02:35.950> parasites

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
don't know what's in there do parasites

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.520 
don't know what's in there do parasites
could<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.599> bacteria<00:02:38.579> anything<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.750> why<00:02:41.319> do<00:02:41.380> we

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
could be bacteria anything so why do we

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.339 
could be bacteria anything so why do we
have<00:02:41.709> this<00:02:41.829> net<00:02:42.420> well<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.660> lot<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.959> people<00:02:44.230> won't

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
have this net well a lot of people won't

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.110 
have this net well a lot of people won't
tell<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.950> do<00:02:45.069> this<00:02:45.280> but<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
tell you to do this but it's the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.530 
tell you to do this but it's the
absolute<00:02:46.569> best<00:02:46.840> way<00:02:47.079> of<00:02:47.110> doing<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.760> put<00:02:48.760> your

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
absolute best way of doing it put your

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.690 
absolute best way of doing it put your
net<00:02:49.780> over<00:02:50.500> your<00:02:50.620> container<00:02:51.269> like<00:02:52.269> so<00:02:53.400> then<00:02:54.400> I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
net over your container like so then I

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.220 
net over your container like so then I
put<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:55.150> camera<00:02:55.390> down<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.840> show<00:02:55.989> this<00:02:56.079> next

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
put the camera down to show this next

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.039 
put the camera down to show this next
bit<00:02:56.610> what<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.760> want<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.000> do<00:03:00.569> go<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.870> think

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
bit what you want to do go I think

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:02.880 
bit what you want to do go I think
that's<00:03:02.290> perfect

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that's perfect

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.750 
that's perfect
is<00:03:04.739> get<00:03:05.739> out<00:03:05.829> your<00:03:06.010> fish<00:03:08.579> you're<00:03:09.579> going<00:03:09.700> to

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
is get out your fish you're going to

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.120 
is get out your fish you're going to
want<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:09.940> pour<00:03:10.180> them<00:03:10.590> make<00:03:11.590> sure<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.920> lids

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
want to pour them make sure the lids

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.080 
want to pour them make sure the lids
open<00:03:12.310> sometimes<00:03:13.090> we<00:03:13.150> can<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:13.359> flat

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
open sometimes we can get flat

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.379 
open sometimes we can get flat
pour<00:03:16.090> them<00:03:16.269> through<00:03:16.510> your<00:03:16.630> net<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:18.389> you're

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
pour them through your net and you're

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.240 
pour them through your net and you're
going<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.600> be<00:03:19.660> catching<00:03:19.900> them<00:03:22.170> in<00:03:23.170> there<00:03:23.859> give

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
going to be catching them in there give

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.000 
going to be catching them in there give
it<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.370> little<00:03:24.400> shake<00:03:24.760> sometimes<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.269> get<00:03:25.420> stuck

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
it a little shake sometimes I get stuck

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.400 
it a little shake sometimes I get stuck
so<00:03:27.010> obviously<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:28.630> being<00:03:28.840> fish<00:03:29.079> in<00:03:29.230> there

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
so obviously there being fish in there

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.120 
so obviously there being fish in there
you'd<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> bit<00:03:29.920> quicker<00:03:30.130> with<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.660> but

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
you'd be a bit quicker with this but

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.640 
you'd be a bit quicker with this but
I've<00:03:33.130> got<00:03:33.280> trying<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.609> spread<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:35.230> reason<00:03:35.560> you

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
I've got trying to spread the reason you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.710 
I've got trying to spread the reason you
want<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.829> pull<00:03:36.040> them<00:03:36.190> through<00:03:36.220> again<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:37.540> get

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
want to pull them through again just get

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.990 
want to pull them through again just get
rid<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.019> dirty<00:03:38.920> aquarium<00:03:39.519> water<00:03:39.609> from

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
rid of that dirty aquarium water from

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.840 
rid of that dirty aquarium water from
your<00:03:40.120> local<00:03:40.359> fish<00:03:40.660> shop<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:42.579> this<00:03:42.639> is<00:03:42.700> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
your local fish shop and this is the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.500 
your local fish shop and this is the
best<00:03:43.000> way<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.180> doing<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:45.239> once<00:03:46.239> you've<00:03:46.389> done

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
best way of doing it once you've done

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.309 
best way of doing it once you've done
that<00:03:46.569> you<00:03:47.170> can<00:03:47.319> lift<00:03:47.500> them<00:03:47.650> out<00:03:49.139> place<00:03:50.139> them

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
that you can lift them out place them

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.530 
that you can lift them out place them
into<00:03:50.500> your<00:03:50.709> aquarium<00:03:52.859> watch<00:03:53.859> them<00:03:54.540> swimming

look at them go
I<00:04:00.780> hope<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:01.959> your<00:04:02.459> fish<00:04:03.459> won't<00:04:03.639> just<00:04:03.880> seem<00:04:04.030> to

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
I hope for your fish won't just seem to

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.089 
I hope for your fish won't just seem to
train<00:04:04.299> for<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.510> bottom<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:05.829> think<00:04:06.010> that

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
train for the bottom so I think that

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.789 
train for the bottom so I think that
means<00:04:06.250> they'll<00:04:06.430> be<00:04:06.459> dead<00:04:07.139> anyway<00:04:08.139> thank<00:04:08.769> you

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
means they'll be dead anyway thank you
