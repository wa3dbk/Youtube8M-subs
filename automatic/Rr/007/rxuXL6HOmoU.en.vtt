to<00:00:02.820> make<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:03.000> video<00:00:03.090> about<00:00:03.360> state<00:00:03.750> of<00:00:03.870> decay<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to make a video about state of decay and

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.980 
to make a video about state of decay and
the<00:00:05.490> reason<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.330> because<00:00:06.359> I've<00:00:06.930> been

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
