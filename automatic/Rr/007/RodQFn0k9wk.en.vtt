00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.170 
welcome back today I'm going to show you

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.470 
welcome back today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:05.410> to<00:00:05.470> sync<00:00:05.980> sounds<00:00:06.700> with<00:00:06.910> animation<00:00:09.030> as<00:00:10.030> you

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
how to sync sounds with animation as you

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.940 
how to sync sounds with animation as you
can<00:00:10.630> see<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:12.370> basketball<00:00:13.150> has<00:00:13.420> a<00:00:13.450> a<00:00:13.950> motion

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
can see this basketball has a a motion

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.650 
can see this basketball has a a motion
tween<00:00:15.100> on<00:00:15.400> it<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.960> bounces

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
tween on it it bounces

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.770 
tween on it it bounces
and<00:00:19.780> then<00:00:20.320> returns<00:00:20.770> to<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:23.130> starting<00:00:24.130> point

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:24.780 
and then returns to the starting point

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.880 
and then returns to the starting point
what<00:00:25.780> we<00:00:25.960> want<00:00:26.140> to<00:00:26.230> do

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
what we want to do

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.380 
what we want to do
does<00:00:28.400> add<00:00:28.670> sound<00:00:29.060> effects<00:00:29.510> a<00:00:30.460> bounce<00:00:31.460> sound

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
does add sound effects a bounce sound

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.040 
does add sound effects a bounce sound
each<00:00:32.989> time<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.649> ball<00:00:33.829> bounces

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
each time the ball bounces

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.450 
each time the ball bounces
let<00:00:36.620> me<00:00:36.680> show<00:00:36.830> you<00:00:36.890> what<00:00:37.070> it's<00:00:37.190> going<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.370> look

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
let me show you what it's going to look

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.030 
let me show you what it's going to look
like<00:00:37.520> before<00:00:38.000> we<00:00:38.120> get<00:00:38.240> started

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.549 

Oh

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.229 

good<00:00:52.300> there<00:00:53.300> are<00:00:53.329> many<00:00:53.480> ways<00:00:53.780> to<00:00:53.840> sync<00:00:54.289> sounds

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
good there are many ways to sync sounds

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.110 
good there are many ways to sync sounds
with<00:00:56.239> animation<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.079> flash<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:58.519> more<00:00:58.730> common

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
with animation and flash the more common

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.090 
with animation and flash the more common
method<00:00:59.449> is<00:00:59.540> to<00:00:59.600> use<00:00:59.750> ActionScript<00:01:00.649> but<00:01:00.860> if

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
method is to use ActionScript but if

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.490 
method is to use ActionScript but if
you're<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.519> me<00:01:01.760> you<00:01:02.000> prefer<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.690> more<00:01:03.050> visual

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
you're like me you prefer a more visual

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.320 
you're like me you prefer a more visual
method

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
method

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.630 
method
believe<00:01:05.330> me<00:01:05.479> this<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.780> much<00:01:05.990> easier<00:01:06.440> than

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
believe me this is much easier than

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.600 
believe me this is much easier than
scripting<00:01:08.680> first<00:01:09.680> thing<00:01:09.860> I<00:01:09.950> want<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:10.220> do<00:01:10.399> is

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
scripting first thing I want to do is

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.670 
scripting first thing I want to do is
apply<00:01:10.759> an<00:01:11.119> ambient<00:01:11.600> sound<00:01:11.869> or<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.080> background

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
apply an ambient sound or a background

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.160 
apply an ambient sound or a background
to<00:01:13.460> my<00:01:13.640> entire<00:01:14.600> movie<00:01:15.080> which<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.799> fairly<00:01:16.190> easy

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
to my entire movie which is fairly easy

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.430 
to my entire movie which is fairly easy
here's<00:01:18.170> my<00:01:18.380> background<00:01:18.890> sound<00:01:19.190> layer<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.990> I

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
here's my background sound layer and I

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.520 
here's my background sound layer and I
just<00:01:21.680> want<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.509> sound<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:23.660> play<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.200> entire

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
just want the sound to play the entire

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.499 
just want the sound to play the entire
length<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:24.950> movie<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:25.670> there's<00:01:26.330> my

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
length of the movie so there's my

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.320 
length of the movie so there's my
ambient<00:01:27.050> Bax<00:01:27.289> basketball<00:01:28.039> sound<00:01:28.399> I'm<00:01:29.149> just

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
ambient Bax basketball sound I'm just

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330 
ambient Bax basketball sound I'm just
going<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.509> drag<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.080> onto<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.530> stage<00:01:30.950> and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
going to drag it onto the stage and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.060 
going to drag it onto the stage and
frame<00:01:31.909> one<00:01:32.179> of<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:32.509> layer<00:01:32.780> now<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:33.800> have<00:01:34.039> a

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
frame one of that layer now I have a

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.040 
frame one of that layer now I have a
sound<00:01:34.429> that<00:01:34.850> plays<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.570> length<00:01:35.810> of<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.560> movie

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
sound that plays the length of the movie

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.540 
sound that plays the length of the movie
but<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:39.259> a<00:01:39.380> little<00:01:39.619> more<00:01:39.770> difficult<00:01:39.920> to

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
but it's a little more difficult to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.510 
but it's a little more difficult to
delink<00:01:41.479> sounds<00:01:41.899> with<00:01:42.020> specific<00:01:42.560> events<00:01:43.340> in

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
delink sounds with specific events in

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.720 
delink sounds with specific events in
the<00:01:43.759> animation

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
the animation

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.980 
the animation
to<00:01:46.540> do<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:46.810> I've<00:01:47.050> created<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.710> bounce<00:01:48.310> sound

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to do that I've created a bounce sound

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.210 
to do that I've created a bounce sound
layer<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.940> then<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:52.830> determine<00:01:53.830> where<00:01:54.040> the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
layer and then I determine where the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.430 
layer and then I determine where the
ball<00:01:54.400> bounces<00:01:55.090> drag<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.260> playhead<00:01:56.890> over

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
ball bounces drag the playhead over

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.640 
ball bounces drag the playhead over
bounce<00:01:59.820> bounce<00:02:00.820> bounce

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.970 

notice<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.550> I've<00:02:04.700> inserted<00:02:05.000> keyframes<00:02:05.980> each

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
notice that I've inserted keyframes each

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.490 
notice that I've inserted keyframes each
place<00:02:07.370> the<00:02:07.610> ball<00:02:07.790> bounces<00:02:08.330> that's<00:02:09.229> where<00:02:09.470> I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
place the ball bounces that's where I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.570 
place the ball bounces that's where I
want<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.740> put<00:02:09.920> my<00:02:10.040> bounce<00:02:10.280> sound<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:13.340> do<00:02:13.460> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
want to put my bounce sound so to do the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.370 
want to put my bounce sound so to do the
first<00:02:13.820> bounce

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
first bounce

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.180 
first bounce
I<00:02:15.500> get<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:16.130> bounce<00:02:16.400> sound<00:02:17.740> place<00:02:18.740> it<00:02:18.890> in<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
I get my bounce sound place it in that

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.570 
I get my bounce sound place it in that
key<00:02:19.400> frame

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
key frame

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.210

we play the movie the ball will bounce

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.270 
we play the movie the ball will bounce
bounce<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.150> bounce<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:45.270> this
