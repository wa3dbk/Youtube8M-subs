feeling really off and then it really
hit<00:01:15.600> me<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.170> needed<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.290> source<00:01:19.530> of

inspiration<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> wanted<00:01:21.150> somebody<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.690> give

actually<00:01:26.430> revealed<00:01:27.120> itself<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.930> thought<00:01:28.830> about

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
actually revealed itself I thought about

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.570 
actually revealed itself I thought about
the<00:01:29.369> patients<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.030> spent<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.630> day<00:01:31.340> seeing<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
the patients I spent all day seeing and

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.440 
the patients I spent all day seeing and
I<00:01:33.360> thought<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.979> woman<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.520> came<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
I thought about the woman that came on a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.380 
I thought about the woman that came on a
stretcher<00:01:37.229> who<00:01:37.740> drove<00:01:37.950> from<00:01:38.250> five<00:01:38.610> hours<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
stretcher who drove from five hours to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.450 
stretcher who drove from five hours to
see<00:01:39.600> me<00:01:39.810> because<00:01:40.770> she<00:01:40.950> thought<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.190> could

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
see me because she thought I could

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.160 
see me because she thought I could
provide<00:01:41.760> something<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> no<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.720> else<00:01:42.900> could

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
provide something that no one else could

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
provide something that no one else could
I<00:01:43.500> thought<00:01:44.310> about<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.790> patient<00:01:45.240> who<00:01:45.420> used<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
I thought about the patient who used to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.800 
I thought about the patient who used to
go<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:45.930> party<00:01:46.619> cruises<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.580> a<00:01:47.610> model<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
go on party cruises and be a model and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.980 
go on party cruises and be a model and
now<00:01:49.020> OMS<00:01:49.619> has<00:01:49.890> taken<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> from<00:01:50.700> her<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.630> put

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
now OMS has taken that from her then put

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.469 
now OMS has taken that from her then put
her<00:01:52.080> in<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> wheelchair<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.090> thought<00:01:54.330> about

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
her in a wheelchair and I thought about

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.440 
her in a wheelchair and I thought about
the<00:01:54.900> chronic<00:01:55.140> pain<00:01:55.500> patient<00:01:56.130> who<00:01:56.970> had<00:01:57.180> very

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the chronic pain patient who had very

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
the chronic pain patient who had very
specific<00:01:57.750> demands<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:59.130> me<00:01:59.939> about<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.450> they

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
specific demands of me about what they

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.999 
specific demands of me about what they
needed<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.009> yet<00:02:02.280> who<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.610> clearly<00:02:03.090> suffering

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
needed and yet who was clearly suffering

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.710 
needed and yet who was clearly suffering
and<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.430> dawned<00:02:05.759> on<00:02:06.000> me<00:02:06.060> well<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.659> course

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
and then it dawned on me well of course

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.129 
and then it dawned on me well of course
I'm<00:02:07.290> feeling<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.129> frazzled<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:09.419> spent

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.850 
play out and it's sometimes when it's
not<00:06:34.949> going<00:06:35.400> as<00:06:35.719> effective<00:06:36.719> as<00:06:36.899> as<00:06:37.440> you'd<00:06:37.830> like

not going as effective as as you'd like
it<00:06:38.279> to<00:06:38.310> go<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:39.449> I<00:06:39.659> stop<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.199> and<00:06:40.380> I<00:06:40.440> say<00:06:40.649> to

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.250 
it to go and I stop it and I say to
clinician<00:06:41.430> tell<00:06:42.390> me<00:06:42.540> what<00:06:42.720> you're<00:06:42.870> hoping<00:06:43.050> to

clinician tell me what you're hoping to
do<00:06:43.530> here<00:06:43.560> what<00:06:44.400> is<00:06:44.520> your<00:06:44.550> intention<00:06:45.150> in<00:06:45.600> the

do here what is your intention in the
language<00:06:46.200> that<00:06:46.230> you're<00:06:46.560> using<00:06:47.600> invariably

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
language that you're using invariably

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.770 
language that you're using invariably
every<00:06:48.900> single<00:06:49.590> physician<00:06:50.040> says<00:06:50.310> well<00:06:51.150> I<00:06:51.450> was

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
every single physician says well I was

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.080 
every single physician says well I was
hoping<00:06:52.230> to<00:06:52.530> show<00:06:52.710> the<00:06:53.070> patient<00:06:53.250> how<00:06:53.700> much<00:06:53.910> I

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
hoping to show the patient how much I

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.780 
hoping to show the patient how much I
cared<00:06:54.420> it<00:06:55.140> is<00:06:55.320> an<00:06:55.470> exceptionally<00:06:56.280> pure

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
cared it is an exceptionally pure

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.940 
cared it is an exceptionally pure
intention<00:06:57.690> on<00:06:57.810> the<00:06:57.900> part<00:06:58.140> of<00:06:58.200> the<00:06:58.320> clinician

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
intention on the part of the clinician

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.850 
intention on the part of the clinician
and<00:06:59.160> so<00:06:59.970> again<00:07:00.330> my<00:07:00.690> goal<00:07:00.900> is<00:07:01.260> to<00:07:01.590> make<00:07:01.830> sure

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
and so again my goal is to make sure

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.790 
and so again my goal is to make sure
that<00:07:02.430> through<00:07:03.240> our<00:07:03.420> language<00:07:03.800> patients

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
that through our language patients

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.600 
that through our language patients
understand<00:07:05.550> and<00:07:06.320> hear<00:07:07.320> the<00:07:07.710> exceptional<00:07:08.310> care

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
understand and hear the exceptional care

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.410 
understand and hear the exceptional care
that<00:07:08.850> you<00:07:09.000> are<00:07:09.030> trying<00:07:09.510> to<00:07:09.690> provide<00:07:11.270> there<00:07:12.270> is

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
that you are trying to provide there is

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.410 
that you are trying to provide there is
no<00:07:12.660> good<00:07:12.930> or<00:07:13.110> bad<00:07:13.520> communicator<00:07:14.520> this<00:07:15.090> is<00:07:15.270> not

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
no good or bad communicator this is not

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.070 
no good or bad communicator this is not
a<00:07:15.450> punitive<00:07:15.930> punitive<00:07:16.800> path<00:07:17.250> is<00:07:17.610> not<00:07:17.930> the<00:07:18.930> way

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 
a punitive punitive path is not the way

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.340 
a punitive punitive path is not the way
to<00:07:19.110> go<00:07:19.590> here<00:07:19.950> I'm<00:07:20.760> here<00:07:21.090> the<00:07:21.480> course<00:07:21.780> again<00:07:22.140> is

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
to go here I'm here the course again is

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.810 
to go here I'm here the course again is
built<00:07:22.620> on<00:07:22.800> the<00:07:22.920> concept<00:07:23.070> that<00:07:23.430> you<00:07:23.670> are

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
built on the concept that you are

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.540 
built on the concept that you are
already<00:07:24.060> talented<00:07:24.750> there<00:07:25.500> are<00:07:25.680> things<00:07:25.950> I<00:07:26.130> can

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
already talented there are things I can

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:27.950 
already talented there are things I can
learn<00:07:26.700> from<00:07:26.760> you<00:07:27.060> there<00:07:27.510> are<00:07:27.630> things<00:07:27.870> that

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960 
learn from you there are things that

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.290 
learn from you there are things that
your<00:07:28.170> colleagues<00:07:28.710> can<00:07:28.800> learn<00:07:29.160> from<00:07:29.430> you<00:07:29.670> and

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:30.300 
your colleagues can learn from you and

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.620 
your colleagues can learn from you and
we<00:07:30.390> can<00:07:30.540> all<00:07:30.660> grow<00:07:30.930> in<00:07:31.140> that<00:07:31.320> together<00:07:32.330> and<00:07:33.330> so

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630 
we can all grow in that together and so

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.540 
we can all grow in that together and so
it's<00:07:33.900> about<00:07:34.050> choosing<00:07:34.500> words<00:07:34.860> that<00:07:35.190> are<00:07:35.280> more

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
it's about choosing words that are more

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.360 
it's about choosing words that are more
effective<00:07:35.850> at<00:07:36.810> communicating<00:07:37.530> to<00:07:37.830> patients

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.370 
effective at communicating to patients

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.100 
effective at communicating to patients
that<00:07:38.550> you<00:07:38.700> care<00:07:40.070> so<00:07:41.210> with<00:07:42.210> that<00:07:42.330> in<00:07:42.510> mind<00:07:42.540> back

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110
