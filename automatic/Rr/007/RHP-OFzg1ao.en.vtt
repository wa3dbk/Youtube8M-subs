 moving 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 I do not get that rock right 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:26.970
 So come on, you find yourself stirring to stay. 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 pretty cute when you look at you and 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:37.729
 it is well grossinha ae 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:48.630
 then you put to bake move the trash 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:51.330
 and even getting a little brazil and china 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.300
 the screen gets the right spot that you 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.810
 Wish we did not leave the drink any more 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.810
 right 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:09.630
 the music starts to get a little bit 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:21.090
 Brush setting plus a little looking spot 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:25.800
 It's making fun in this dark time . 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.230
 she looks like water pear paper 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.130
 Sorry folks was a deal here on 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.130
 my house and it's good that she's staying 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.040
 very nice 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.030
 Look, I want her to be fine thanks. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.030
 certain well cutie same trip 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.580
 al 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.680
 and more people, the notebook has more grace 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.160
 you can do to the right point you 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.160
 right 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.910
 even who wants it in this field 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.910
 I left it unsettled. 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:22.560
 however it is yellow 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.830
 Look, it's only yellow. 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.850
 then you will put the dye 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:35.400
 now it does it seem like you 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:40.790
 use a certain dye that is a 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.790
 sacrifice for that there left a little bit 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.790
 shake 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.769
 so you're putting the dye 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:56.239
 coradi to the right point you want 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.239
 and until now I put too much 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.340
 But it's going to make people even then. 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.340
 right 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.990
 do not worry if you put too much 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.799
 Anyway, you can still do it. 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:24.350
 dark but you think mine is dark 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:27.110
 but for me it was great touch of lemon 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:34.820
 the integration pape got quite thick 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:38.540
 even quite groff sure 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.660
 now we're going to make the net 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.680
 It sure will be here and I 'll be right back. 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.600
 good on the line so now I came to make the 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.850
 net copy right you will need 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:55.520
 water the way you are that 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:59.180
 which is the most is in wheat flour or 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.870
 place the water to the point where 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.240
 Do you want certain people like I do? 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:13.810
 It's big and few here. 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.810
 Nothing more to do a little bit 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:27.770
 It's true that I 'm serious here 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:30.860
 and now let's lay the heart now 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.819
 this time, links to you, put 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.819
 bit right 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:58.640
 a droplet is annoying we'll go 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.640
 stay there the liquid cup 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.790
 Let me put a cap on it. 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.790
 You can see better. 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:25.530
 Look how it got in liquid even 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:28.230
 look different is thick 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:31.580
 It's little fun, they 're very different. 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.580
 the thick little context is different 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:42.620
 now go through the liquid and certain of it 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.620
 color then until the seventh video bye
