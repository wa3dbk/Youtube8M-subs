00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.730
 Hello, how about friends of viva vÃ¡zquez? 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.230
 speaks his friend Rafael Sandoval ex 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.820
 professional player selected ex 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 national and now coach of 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.930
 basketball then I will give you some 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.930
 tips to improve your visible 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.119
 I'm going to talk to you a little bit about how 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.120
 we can teach the pot in basketball 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.980
 one of the most important fundamentals 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.530
 The first thing we should do is 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.900
 explain to children how 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.230
 we must vote as is how it should be 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.540
 voting there are simple and simple rules that 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.070
 they handle the boat one of the first 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.710
 rules is that the ball always has to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.809
 be below the under the hand of 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.839
 this way the hand has to be 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.239
 relaxed since tense would complicate us 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.460
 control of the ball the fingertips 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.339
 they have to have ample control over the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.699
 ball to be able to handle it from this 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.699
 way 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.500
 and the proximal part of the arm that 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.229
 it has to stay as close as 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.600
 of the body to have more control of the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.220
 ball 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 the body has to be in a 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.659
 comfortable and adequate position to have 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.219
 greater control of it in this way 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.770
 this is the way we should of 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.770
 explain to our guys how we should 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.899
 to vote and be correcting 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.359
 constantly and supervising the way 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.880
 of voting for young people this is one of 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.920
 the simplest exercises in the boat 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.229
 I recommend you do these 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.119
 exercises at least two or three times 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.340
 per week with the supervision of a 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.259
 coach remember that being 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.299
 correcting makes better and what 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.299
 perfection is the movement until soon
