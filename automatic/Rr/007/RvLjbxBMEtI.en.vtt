newer player if you can keep these three

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.880 
newer player if you can keep these three
things<00:00:53.749> in<00:00:53.960> mind<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.320> think<00:00:54.499> you're<00:00:54.620> gonna<00:00:54.710> be

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
things in mind I think you're gonna be

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.239 
things in mind I think you're gonna be
off<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.249> a<00:00:55.280> much<00:00:55.519> better<00:00:55.730> start<00:00:56.210> in<00:00:56.390> PvP<00:00:57.249> so

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
off to a much better start in PvP so

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:00.700 
off to a much better start in PvP so
what<00:00:58.519> I<00:00:58.550> mean<00:00:58.760> by<00:00:58.879> initiate<00:00:59.420> is<00:00:59.839> be<00:01:00.260> smart

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
what I mean by initiate is be smart

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.220 
what I mean by initiate is be smart
about<00:01:01.100> when<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:01.730> initiate<00:01:02.239> contact<00:01:02.839> with

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
about when you initiate contact with

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.980 
about when you initiate contact with
other<00:01:03.499> players<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:05.000> for<00:01:05.300> example<00:01:05.720> if<00:01:05.810> you're

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
other players so for example if you're

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.230 
other players so for example if you're
running<00:01:06.350> up<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.830> point<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.370> you<00:01:07.430> see<00:01:07.880> two

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
running up to a point and you see two

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.020 
running up to a point and you see two
enemy<00:01:08.720> players<00:01:09.020> sitting<00:01:09.410> on<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:09.830> point<00:01:10.100> do

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
enemy players sitting on that point do

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.200 
enemy players sitting on that point do
not<00:01:11.210> initiate<00:01:11.480> contact<00:01:12.080> get<00:01:12.920> out<00:01:13.070> of<00:01:13.250> there

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
not initiate contact get out of there

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.410 
not initiate contact get out of there
however<00:01:15.080> if<00:01:15.410> your<00:01:15.830> team<00:01:16.190> has<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.550> capture<00:01:17.120> point

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
however if your team has a capture point

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.750 
however if your team has a capture point
that<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:17.780> guys<00:01:17.960> own<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.620> you<00:01:18.890> see<00:01:19.100> one<00:01:19.430> player

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
that you guys own and you see one player

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.610 
that you guys own and you see one player
heading<00:01:20.150> toward<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.510> go<00:01:21.170> ahead<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.350> initiate

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
heading toward it go ahead and initiate

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.230 
heading toward it go ahead and initiate
contact<00:01:22.070> with<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.490> player<00:01:22.730> get<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.120> the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
contact with that player get on the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.180 
contact with that player get on the
point<00:01:23.480> and<00:01:23.690> try<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.020> fight<00:01:24.200> them<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.980> idea

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
point and try and fight them the idea

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.040 
point and try and fight them the idea
here<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.730> be<00:01:25.880> smart<00:01:26.300> about<00:01:26.540> when<00:01:26.810> you're

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
here is to be smart about when you're

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.710 
here is to be smart about when you're
fighting<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.680> when<00:01:27.800> you're<00:01:28.010> running<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.910> I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
fighting and when you're running and I

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.810 
fighting and when you're running and I
think<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.500> makes<00:01:30.710> sense<00:01:30.920> to<00:01:31.130> initiate<00:01:31.550> contact

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
think it makes sense to initiate contact

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.090 
think it makes sense to initiate contact
in<00:01:32.210> any<00:01:32.360> fight<00:01:32.720> that<00:01:32.930> you're<00:01:33.140> confident<00:01:33.800> you

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
in any fight that you're confident you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.670 
in any fight that you're confident you
will<00:01:34.310> win<00:01:34.580> in<00:01:34.790> that<00:01:35.480> case<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.230> know<00:01:36.350> go<00:01:36.560> ahead

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
will win in that case you know go ahead

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.190 
will win in that case you know go ahead
and<00:01:37.010> have<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.340> fight<00:01:37.580> but<00:01:38.540> also<00:01:38.810> keep<00:01:39.050> in

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
and have that fight but also keep in

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.870 
and have that fight but also keep in
mind<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.620> length<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.100> time<00:01:40.370> that<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.700> might

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
mind the length of time that it might

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.330 
mind the length of time that it might
take<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:41.900> if<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.350> see<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> point<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.160> maybe

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
take so if you see a point that maybe

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.490 
take so if you see a point that maybe
you<00:01:43.490> want<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.700> capture<00:01:43.910> and<00:01:44.360> there's<00:01:45.260> somebody

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
you want to capture and there's somebody

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.440 
you want to capture and there's somebody
really<00:01:45.890> tanky<00:01:46.280> on<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:47.090> know<00:01:47.240> it's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
really tanky on it and you know it's

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870 
really tanky on it and you know it's
gonna<00:01:47.570> take<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:48.230> know<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.620> minute<00:01:49.070> two<00:01:49.490> minutes

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
or some really long length of time to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.610 
or some really long length of time to
get<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.460> point<00:01:52.790> from<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.180> person<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:54.380> may

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
get that point from that person it may

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.070 
get that point from that person it may
not<00:01:54.770> be<00:01:55.010> worth<00:01:55.280> initiating<00:01:56.090> contact<00:01:56.300> whereas

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
not be worth initiating contact whereas

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.320 
not be worth initiating contact whereas
if<00:01:57.410> you<00:01:57.560> see<00:01:57.860> maybe<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.370> squishy<00:01:58.730> target<00:01:59.210> you

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
if you see maybe a squishy target you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330 
if you see maybe a squishy target you
know<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.510> can<00:01:59.780> kill<00:01:59.990> quickly<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.250> go

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
know you can kill quickly you can go

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.860 
know you can kill quickly you can go
ahead<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.580> jump<00:02:01.940> on<00:02:02.120> them<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.510> grab<00:02:02.660> that

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
ahead and jump on them and grab that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.160 
ahead and jump on them and grab that
point<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.670> initiate<00:02:05.210> part<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.930> three

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170
