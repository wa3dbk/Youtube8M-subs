there's<00:01:23.640> an<00:01:23.820> option<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.330> says<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
there's an option here that says use a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
there's an option here that says use a
device<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.710> would<00:01:25.860> think<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.250> that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
device and you would think that that

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.789 
device and you would think that that
would<00:01:26.729> sort<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.900> all<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> need<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.530> but

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
would sort of be all you need to do but

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.840 
would sort of be all you need to do but
if<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.950> try<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> boot<00:01:29.340> from<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.640> you're

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
if you try to boot from this you're

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.800 
if you try to boot from this you're
going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.030> get<00:01:30.119> an<00:01:30.210> error<00:01:30.329> message<00:01:30.600> saying

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
going to get an error message saying

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.060 
going to get an error message saying
that<00:01:31.200> there's<00:01:31.680> no<00:01:31.920> USB<00:01:32.790> boot<00:01:33.750> option<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
that there's no USB boot option and so I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
that there's no USB boot option and so I
initially<00:01:35.430> thought<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.150> was<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.930> end<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
initially thought that was the end of

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.050 
initially thought that was the end of

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
that and there was no way to boot but

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.530 
that and there was no way to boot but
you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.600> troubleshoot<00:01:41.540> Advanced

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.039 
you can go into troubleshoot Advanced

be okay here
with<00:02:29.270> UEFI<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.200> could<00:02:30.500> disable<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:31.010> but

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190

the<00:02:31.280> reason<00:02:31.490> you<00:02:31.550> don't<00:02:31.670> want<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.030> is<00:02:32.180> because

the reason you don't want to is because

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.730 
the reason you don't want to is because
then<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.780> won't<00:02:32.959> be<00:02:33.050> able<00:02:33.200> to<00:02:33.350> boot<00:02:33.500> windows

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.940 
then you won't be able to boot windows
so<00:02:34.700> if<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.540> want<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.720> dual<00:02:35.959> boot<00:02:36.050> system<00:02:36.350> or

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
so if you want to dual boot system or

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.410 
so if you want to dual boot system or
you<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:37.190> wanted<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.400> try<00:02:37.670> Linux<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.209> go<00:02:38.270> back

you just wanted to try Linux and go back

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.340 
you just wanted to try Linux and go back
to<00:02:38.510> Windows<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.230> need<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.650> re-enable<00:02:40.130> UEFI<00:02:41.350> so

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
to Windows you need to re-enable UEFI so

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.710 
to Windows you need to re-enable UEFI so
instead<00:02:42.620> let's<00:02:42.890> go<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.940> main<00:02:44.150> menu<00:02:44.390> and

instead let's go to the main menu and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.440 
instead let's go to the main menu and
there's<00:02:45.680> an<00:02:45.950> option<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.370> says<00:02:46.489> f12<00:02:47.090> boot

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
there's an option that says f12 boot

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.390 
there's an option that says f12 boot
menu<00:02:47.750> I'm<00:02:48.140> going<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.770> go<00:02:48.860> ahead<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:49.220> switch

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
menu I'm going to go ahead and switch

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.540

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
that from disabled to enabled now you

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.250 
that from disabled to enabled now you
could<00:02:52.760> also<00:02:52.880> go<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.810> change<00:02:53.989> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
could also go in here and change the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.380 
could also go in here and change the
priority<00:02:54.739> of<00:02:54.890> when<00:02:55.489> things<00:02:55.670> boot<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.209> say<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
priority of when things boot and say I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.880 
priority of when things boot and say I
want<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.660> boot<00:02:56.810> first<00:02:57.200> from<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.590> cd-rom

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
want to boot first from the cd-rom

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.860 
want to boot first from the cd-rom
instead<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.580> from<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> boot<00:02:59.030> manager<00:02:59.450> and<00:02:59.720> so

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
instead of from the boot manager and so

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.140 
instead of from the boot manager and so
forth<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.290> find<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.160> f12<00:03:01.459> boot<00:03:01.670> menu<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.120> a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
forth I find the f12 boot menu is a

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.930 
forth I find the f12 boot menu is a
little<00:03:02.390> bit<00:03:02.480> more<00:03:02.630> versatile<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.940> we're

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
little bit more versatile and so we're

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.640

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.759 
going to go ahead and exit saving
changes<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.420> now<00:03:08.420> while<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.470> machines
