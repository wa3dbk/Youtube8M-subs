are in in northern Vermont here this

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
are in in northern Vermont here this
time<00:01:59.409> of<00:01:59.560> year<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.830> know<00:01:59.920> they're<00:02:00.070> not<00:02:00.159> so

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
time of year you know they're not so

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.770 
time of year you know they're not so
great<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.000> just<00:02:01.180> makes<00:02:01.299> us<00:02:01.509> go<00:02:01.659> down

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
great so that just makes us go down

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.510 
great so that just makes us go down
along<00:02:02.290> with<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.680> suspension<00:02:03.070> dampening

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
along with the suspension dampening

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.070 
along with the suspension dampening
system<00:02:03.880> we've<00:02:04.000> got<00:02:04.119> on<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.330> axles<00:02:04.720> too<00:02:04.900> we

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
system we've got on the axles too we

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.630 
system we've got on the axles too we
also<00:02:05.229> have<00:02:05.439> a<00:02:05.470> trail<00:02:05.740> air<00:02:05.950> buffer<00:02:06.280> there<00:02:06.460> as

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
also have a trail air buffer there as

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.100 
also have a trail air buffer there as
well<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:07.540> makes<00:02:07.689> this<00:02:07.840> thing<00:02:07.990> go

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
well so that just makes this thing go

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.600 
well so that just makes this thing go
down<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.349> road<00:02:08.500> very<00:02:08.709> smoothly<00:02:09.009> for<00:02:09.250> us<00:02:09.310> where

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
some of the other stuff will mount out

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.390 
some of the other stuff will mount out
there<00:02:11.170> tell<00:02:11.409> us<00:02:11.439> aluminum<00:02:11.890> studding<00:02:12.040> for<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
there tell us aluminum studding for the

studs haphazardly and cut holes in these
are<00:02:20.680> all<00:02:20.710> frames<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.520> we<00:02:21.610> get<00:02:21.760> much<00:02:22.090> better

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
are all frames so we get much better

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.270 
are all frames so we get much better
seals<00:02:22.720> we're<00:02:23.320> not<00:02:23.470> gonna<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.740> any<00:02:23.770> movement

clean look we're seeing it more and more
often<00:05:26.919> in<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.189> industry<00:05:27.610> now<00:05:27.759> I<00:05:27.789> think<00:05:28.029> it's

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:28.329 
often in the industry now I think it's

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:29.879 
often in the industry now I think it's
probably<00:05:28.479> gonna<00:05:28.689> become<00:05:29.019> the<00:05:29.169> norm<00:05:29.439> in<00:05:29.589> a<00:05:29.679> few

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
probably gonna become the norm in a few

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.549 
probably gonna become the norm in a few
years<00:05:30.159> I<00:05:30.399> love<00:05:31.359> the<00:05:31.509> way<00:05:31.599> they<00:05:31.779> look<00:05:32.079> it's<00:05:32.319> an

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559 
years I love the way they look it's an
