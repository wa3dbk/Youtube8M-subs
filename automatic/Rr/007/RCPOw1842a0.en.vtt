00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.180 
together which was kind of new we have
never<00:01:32.270> really<00:01:32.600> done<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.810> before<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.650> then

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
never really done that before and then

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.650 
never really done that before and then
you<00:01:34.400> know<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.610> then<00:01:34.729> we<00:01:34.820> go<00:01:34.970> our<00:01:35.090> own<00:01:35.119> ways<00:01:35.420> and

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
you know and then we go our own ways and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.150 
you know and then we go our own ways and
come<00:01:35.780> up<00:01:35.869> with<00:01:35.990> our<00:01:36.110> own<00:01:36.170> scenes<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.830> stuff<00:01:37.010> so

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
I think there'll be a lot of

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.850 
I think there'll be a lot of
similarities<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.350> art<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.560> unique

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
similarities but the art of unique

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.229 
similarities but the art of unique
design<00:01:40.190> is<00:01:40.220> coastal<00:01:40.970> dunes<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.780> dead<00:01:41.990> now
