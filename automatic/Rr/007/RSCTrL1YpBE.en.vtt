00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
dump it there but for some reason they

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.390 
dump it there but for some reason they
did<00:04:14.810> not<00:04:14.900> let<00:04:15.109> me<00:04:15.200> dump<00:04:15.410> and<00:04:15.620> as<00:04:16.099> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.370> see

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
did not let me dump and as you can see

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.219 
did not let me dump and as you can see
