hi<00:00:00.359> it's<00:00:00.510> John<00:00:00.659> from<00:00:00.719> guitar<00:00:01.079> noise<00:00:01.260> common

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
hi it's John from guitar noise common

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.290 
hi it's John from guitar noise common
yesterday<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.159> decided<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.790> do<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:03.149> little

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
yesterday I decided to do a little

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.990 
yesterday I decided to do a little
impromptu<00:00:03.899> demo<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:04.830> zebra<00:00:05.549> Drive<00:00:05.759> and

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
impromptu demo of the zebra Drive and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.080 
impromptu demo of the zebra Drive and
Coco<00:00:06.390> boost<00:00:06.660> just<00:00:07.500> using<00:00:07.830> my<00:00:07.950> iPhone<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.610> didn't

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
Coco boost just using my iPhone I didn't

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.950 
Coco boost just using my iPhone I didn't
use<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.290> Audax<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.469> 5<00:00:10.860> mic<00:00:11.190> at<00:00:11.460> all

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
use my Audax I 5 mic at all

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.379 
use my Audax I 5 mic at all
so<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.259> quality<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.940> bit<00:00:15.059> different

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
so the quality is a little bit different

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.790 
so the quality is a little bit different
to<00:00:15.450> what<00:00:15.599> you're<00:00:15.839> probably<00:00:16.080> used<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.440> watching

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
to what you're probably used to watching

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.740 
to what you're probably used to watching
my<00:00:16.890> video<00:00:17.190> demos<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.359> think<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.660> an

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
my video demos but I think it's an

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.040 
my video demos but I think it's an
interesting<00:00:18.960> insight<00:00:19.590> into<00:00:19.970> the<00:00:20.970> room<00:00:21.449> sort

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
interesting insight into the room sort

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.099 
interesting insight into the room sort
of<00:00:22.109> microphone<00:00:22.619> sound<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.510> also<00:00:24.510> showing<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
of microphone sound and also showing you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.099 
of microphone sound and also showing you
how<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.890> Coco<00:00:26.460> boost<00:00:26.699> into<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> search<00:00:27.720> Shiba

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
how the Coco boost into the search Shiba

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.150 
how the Coco boost into the search Shiba
Drive<00:00:28.320> work<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.890> I've<00:00:29.429> demonstrated<00:00:29.760> both<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
Drive work so I've demonstrated both the

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160 
Drive work so I've demonstrated both the
Coco<00:00:32.160> boost<00:00:32.369> modes<00:00:33.059> which<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.809> boost<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
Coco boost modes which is the boost in

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.860 
Coco boost modes which is the boost in
the<00:00:34.260> mid<00:00:34.410> boost<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.800> I've<00:00:35.280> also<00:00:35.809> shown<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the mid boost and I've also shown you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.299 
the mid boost and I've also shown you
what<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> sounds<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.680> those<00:00:37.829> driving

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
what it sounds like with those driving

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.119 
what it sounds like with those driving
the<00:00:38.820> Sochi<00:00:39.030> drive<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> amplifier

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the Sochi drive as well so the amplifier

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.799 
the Sochi drive as well so the amplifier
I<00:00:41.309> used<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> demo<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.270> serotonin

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I used in the demo if the serotonin

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.600 
I used in the demo if the serotonin
chopper<00:00:42.989> Cobra<00:00:43.290> 50<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.040> background<00:00:44.430> there

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
chopper Cobra 50 in the background there

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.080 
chopper Cobra 50 in the background there
and<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.420> used<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.750> sir<00:00:45.989> modern<00:00:46.410> guitar<00:00:47.090> alright

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and I used my sir modern guitar alright

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
and I used my sir modern guitar alright
so<00:00:48.239> first<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.379> bypass

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so first of all here is the bypass

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
so first of all here is the bypass
signal<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.239> Strymon<00:00:51.690> el<00:00:52.110> capistan

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
signal with just the Strymon el capistan

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:17.440 
signal with just the Strymon el capistan
delay<00:00:53.219> on

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:34.990 

now<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.510> boost<00:01:18.840> side<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.409> cocoa<00:01:19.710> boost

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.190 

now<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.060> mid<00:01:36.300> boost<00:01:36.479> side<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> cocoa

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
now the mid boost side of the cocoa

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:54.440 
now the mid boost side of the cocoa
boost<00:01:52.280> now<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> boost<00:01:53.670> side<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> cocoa

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
boost now the boost side of the cocoa

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:09.550 
boost now the boost side of the cocoa
boost<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.080> sheet<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.350> drive<00:01:55.530> together

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.300 

now<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> Shiva<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.640> mid<00:02:12.120> boost
