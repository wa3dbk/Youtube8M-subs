00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:17.650
 hi voters of windows blog italia 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:20.990
 we have here in our asus vivo tab rt 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.410
 and we want to show you again 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.870
 more calmly how to perform a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:31.820
 transfer via bluetooth 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:35.560
 taking advantage of the nfc technology to do so 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:40.010
 we will send a photograph to our htc 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:44.120
 8x with windows phone 8 then first 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.920
 what we open an application that 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.480
 allows you to send photos but 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.420
 works with any other file type 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.650
 we open our day background e 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.670
 we decide we want to send this beauty 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.620
 I photograph of strange animals 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.650
 then how it works here we have the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.020
 our htc where among other things there is already the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.300
 photo precisely we choose another type 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:17.479
 let's change this and unlock the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.080
 phone and we put it 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:24.640
 now he puts it on everything for a moment 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.640
 just bring the two sensors closer together 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:36.290
 here is the htc neighboring lime already if they are 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.750
 there towards the touch devices track 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.909
 and sending the device on hold here is 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.640
 a request arrived so far can 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.920
 accept the content 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.460
 we accept and the file is 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.460
 arrived 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.040
 here it is 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.950
 how cool it is to tell the truth anyway 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.709
 these the same thing also works 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.399
 conversely it is obviously given that 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.069
 we meet 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.310
 reminds me a moment how it works 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.390
 sending via bluetooth 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.400
 so here we always have ours 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.750
 assassin tab returned desktop and let's say 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.330
 who want to send this photo 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.670
 to the son tab and let's say for example 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.230
 we don't have the nfc 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.100
 if we do not have nor nfc we must do 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.730
 this procedure you receive a file here 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.300
 bluetooth obviously this is the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:48.090
 screen we go to here save in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:51.670
 phone save a moment let's go into 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.519
 let's live it another image 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.019
 even more beautiful 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:03.489
 for example we send these beautiful ones 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:04.780
 scarpetta do not know if you can 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.810
 to see 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:14.489
 here now you share everything with him 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.900
 wrong i got the wrong device 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.380
 share bluetooth 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:26.920
 android is the file is coming is 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:33.269
 arrived here we decide to save on 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.269
 desktop also fine here it is 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.200
