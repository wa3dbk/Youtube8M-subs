00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
my primary hackintosh if you'll notice

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.640 
my primary hackintosh if you'll notice
this<00:00:26.939> motherboard<00:00:27.269> has<00:00:27.480> no<00:00:27.840> display<00:00:28.289> outputs

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
this motherboard has no display outputs

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.830 
this motherboard has no display outputs
it<00:00:28.740> doesn't<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.039> DVI<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.580> HDMI<00:00:30.359> or<00:00:30.539> anything

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it doesn't have DVI or HDMI or anything

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.930 
it doesn't have DVI or HDMI or anything
like<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.590> video<00:00:31.920> socket<00:00:32.369> 1155

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
like that that all video socket 1155

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
like that that all video socket 1155
boards<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.600> that's<00:00:34.170> because<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> socket

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
boards have that's because the socket

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.740 
boards have that's because the socket
2011<00:00:35.460> CPUs<00:00:35.850> don't<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.390> no<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.600> video

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
2011 CPUs don't have they no on video

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
2011 CPUs don't have they no on video
controller<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.440> them<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.610> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.270> fur

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
controller in them so it kind of fur

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.479 
controller in them so it kind of fur
goes<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.110> video<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> just

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
goes the video but really this is just

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.190 
goes the video but really this is just
meant<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.000> straight<00:00:42.329> performance<00:00:42.989> that's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
meant for straight performance that's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.139 
meant for straight performance that's
kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.649> 1366<00:00:44.640> socket<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.059> all

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
kind of what the 1366 socket is all

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.639 
kind of what the 1366 socket is all
about<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.719> performance<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
about just your performance you have to

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.279 
about just your performance you have to
get<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.829> own<00:00:46.980> GPU<00:00:47.430> etc<00:00:48.300> etc<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.020> board

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
get your own GPU etc etc so this board

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.350 
get your own GPU etc etc so this board
basically<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.070> meant<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.059> pack<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
basically is meant to really pack a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.729 
basically is meant to really pack a
punch<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.899> we're<00:00:52.020> gonna<00:00:52.110> be<00:00:52.199> throwing<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> six

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
punch and we're gonna be throwing a six

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
punch and we're gonna be throwing a six
core<00:00:52.949> processor<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.579> here<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.570> punch

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
core processor in here so that punch

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.810 
core processor in here so that punch
will<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.770> packed<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.399> guess<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
will be you know packed I guess you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
will be you know packed I guess you

don't know something there it could work
easy<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.670> flexible<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.689> their<00:01:40.229> UEFI<00:01:40.860> BIOS

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
easy and flexible to use their UEFI BIOS

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.490 
easy and flexible to use their UEFI BIOS
always<00:01:41.700> nice<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.180> bluetooth<00:01:43.079> enjoyment

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
always nice to have bluetooth enjoyment

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
always nice to have bluetooth enjoyment
so<00:01:43.799> i<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.490> actually<00:01:44.640> might<00:01:44.909> have

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
so i think this actually might have

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.429 
so i think this actually might have
bluetooth<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.540> board<00:01:45.840> actually<00:01:46.079> didn't<00:01:46.380> know

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
bluetooth on board actually didn't know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
bluetooth on board actually didn't know
that<00:01:46.590> until<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.950> now<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.549> we'll<00:01:47.970> experiment

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that until right now so we'll experiment

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
that until right now so we'll experiment
with<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.689> quad<00:01:49.380> channel<00:01:49.619> ddr3<00:01:50.250> memory<00:01:50.729> which

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
with that quad channel ddr3 memory which

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.880 
with that quad channel ddr3 memory which
is<00:01:51.149> always<00:01:51.360> awesome<00:01:51.630> there's<00:01:51.990> eight<00:01:52.170> dims<00:01:52.560> for

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
is always awesome there's eight dims for

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.069 
is always awesome there's eight dims for
like<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.070> said<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> maximum<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.880> 64<00:01:54.540> gigabytes<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
like I said a maximum of 64 gigabytes of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.469 
like I said a maximum of 64 gigabytes of
RAM<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.219> awesome<00:01:56.610> windows<00:01:57.329> 8

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
ready no comment SLI right they're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.510 
ready no comment SLI right they're
awesome<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.409> crossfire<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.430> have

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
awesome and crossfire so if you have

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.179 
awesome and crossfire so if you have
dual<00:02:02.729> card<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.750> good<00:02:03.899> option<00:02:04.170> for<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.439> LGA

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
dual card really good option for you LGA

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.190 
dual card really good option for you LGA
2011<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.360> once<00:02:06.540> again<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:06.990> really

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
2011 so when once again it's that really

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.229 
2011 so when once again it's that really
high-performance<00:02:07.530> socket<00:02:08.340> supports<00:02:09.030> intel

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
to get like three 6 80's or six 70s that

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.750 
to get like three 6 80's or six 70s that
would<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.380> insane<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:08.160> I'm<00:03:08.370> sure<00:03:08.550> people

would just be insane but I'm sure people
are<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.180> do<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:09.960> you<00:03:10.050> have<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> 2-way

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
are going to do it here you have a 2-way

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.810 
are going to do it here you have a 2-way
SLI<00:03:11.340> bridge<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.210> go<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:13.830> whopping<00:03:14.070> six

if<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.470> still<00:03:19.740> use<00:03:19.770> them<00:03:20.190> optical<00:03:20.910> drives

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
if you still use them optical drives

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.610 
if you still use them optical drives
that<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.420> want<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.630> connect<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.110> things<00:03:22.530> like

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that you want to connect so things like

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.280 
that you want to connect so things like
that<00:03:22.970> here<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.300> rear<00:03:24.540> io<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:25.170> this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
that here we have the rear io for this

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.640 
that here we have the rear io for this
motherboard<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:26.640> know<00:03:26.730> cutouts<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.360> USB<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
motherboard you know cutouts for USB and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.980 
motherboard you know cutouts for USB and
you<00:03:28.740> know<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.010> audio<00:03:29.400> down<00:03:29.610> here<00:03:29.940> so<00:03:30.210> nothing

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
you know the audio down here so nothing

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.500 
you know the audio down here so nothing
too<00:03:31.110> crazy<00:03:31.290> there<00:03:32.000> these<00:03:33.000> look<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.450> be<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:35.510> think

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
too crazy there these look to be I think

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.500 
too crazy there these look to be I think
maybe<00:03:36.810> USB<00:03:37.500> 3<00:03:37.890> i'm<00:03:38.430> actually<00:03:38.610> not<00:03:39.030> quite<00:03:39.390> sure

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
maybe USB 3 i'm actually not quite sure

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.010 
maybe USB 3 i'm actually not quite sure
and<00:03:40.290> also<00:03:40.440> speaker<00:03:41.070> ground<00:03:41.550> power<00:03:42.209> LED<00:03:42.720> so

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
and also speaker ground power LED so

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.770 
and also speaker ground power LED so
there's<00:03:43.230> some<00:03:43.580> if<00:03:44.580> for<00:03:44.970> all<00:03:45.090> your<00:03:45.240> front<00:03:45.480> panel

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
there's some if for all your front panel

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.240 
there's some if for all your front panel
switches<00:03:45.959> there<00:03:46.350> we<00:03:46.440> go<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.830> that's<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.100> word

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
switches there we go so that's the word

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.340 
switches there we go so that's the word
I<00:03:47.340> was<00:03:47.370> looking<00:03:47.459> for<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.060> you<00:03:48.870> know<00:03:48.959> power

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
I was looking for and you know power

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.250 
I was looking for and you know power
ground<00:03:49.709> stuff<00:03:50.100> for<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.580> USB<00:03:51.240> header<00:03:51.420> moving

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
ground stuff for a USB header moving

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.420 
ground stuff for a USB header moving
that<00:03:52.410> off<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.950> side<00:03:54.290> cpu<00:03:55.290> installation<00:03:56.010> if

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that off to the side cpu installation if

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.860 
that off to the side cpu installation if
you<00:03:56.550> don't<00:03:56.730> know<00:03:56.850> this<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.150> going<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.450> be<00:03:57.570> you

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
you pretty cool they include it in the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.010 
you pretty cool they include it in the
box<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:02.060> surprisingly<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.570> decent

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
box and surprisingly you know a decent

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.440 
box and surprisingly you know a decent
amount<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.250> know<00:04:05.340> paper<00:04:05.610> material<00:04:06.209> here

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.900 
maybe bios versions and things like that
but<00:04:15.650> not<00:04:16.650> too<00:04:16.920> much<00:04:16.950> else<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.520> box<00:04:17.700> so

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
but not too much else to the box so

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.039 
but not too much else to the box so
let's<00:04:18.060> go<00:04:18.180> ahead<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.390> we'll<00:04:18.630> take<00:04:18.780> out<00:04:18.930> the

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
let's go ahead and we'll take out the

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.840 
let's go ahead and we'll take out the
actual<00:04:19.320> board<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:20.160> here's<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.489> motherboard

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
actual board so here's the motherboard

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.890 
actual board so here's the motherboard
itself

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
itself

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.960 
itself
go<00:04:22.590> ahead<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.889> touch<00:04:23.100> something<00:04:23.490> metal<00:04:23.520> real

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
go ahead and touch something metal real

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.129 
go ahead and touch something metal real
quick<00:04:24.180> because<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.509> don't<00:04:24.660> wanna<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:24.870> people

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.300 
to freak out on me if I don't at least
try<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:27.300> no<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.259> charge<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.710> electricity

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
try to no just charge on the electricity

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.810 
try to no just charge on the electricity
and<00:04:29.550> off<00:04:30.270> comes<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.280> plastic<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:32.520> put<00:04:32.729> the

and off comes the plastic so put the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.969 
and off comes the plastic so put the
plastic<00:04:33.000> off<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.600> side<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.860> know

plastic off to the side and you know

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.920 
plastic off to the side and you know
rather<00:04:35.220> than<00:04:35.370> try<00:04:35.820> to<00:04:35.850> juggle<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.539> board<00:04:36.840> it

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
rather than try to juggle this board it

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.850 
rather than try to juggle this board it
was<00:04:37.020> going<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.229> go<00:04:37.320> ahead<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.620> hand<00:04:37.740> them<00:04:37.800> down

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
if that displays real time temperatures

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.430 
if that displays real time temperatures
of<00:06:38.280> the<00:06:38.370> CPU<00:06:38.820> or<00:06:39.030> whether<00:06:39.810> that<00:06:39.870> gives<00:06:40.199> error

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
of the CPU or whether that gives error

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.290 
of the CPU or whether that gives error
messages<00:06:41.010> or<00:06:41.250> just<00:06:41.460> boot<00:06:41.639> up<00:06:41.790> codes<00:06:42.030> things

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
messages or just boot up codes things

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.689 
messages or just boot up codes things
like<00:06:42.419> that<00:06:42.570> but<00:06:43.320> there<00:06:44.040> you<00:06:44.100> guys<00:06:44.220> go<00:06:44.280> that's

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:44.699 
like that but there you guys go that's

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:45.620 
like that but there you guys go that's
pretty<00:06:44.910> much<00:06:45.000> everything<00:06:45.150> I<00:06:45.389> wanted<00:06:45.570> to

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
pretty much everything I wanted to

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.780 
pretty much everything I wanted to
discuss<00:06:45.750> with<00:06:46.110> the<00:06:46.229> board<00:06:46.470> know<00:06:47.340> in<00:06:47.430> terms<00:06:47.580> of

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
discuss with the board know in terms of

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.820 
discuss with the board know in terms of
on<00:06:48.030> the<00:06:48.180> front<00:06:48.479> another<00:06:49.050> fan<00:06:49.350> header<00:06:49.560> there

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
on the front another fan header there

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.000 
on the front another fan header there
and<00:06:50.040> so<00:06:50.699> now<00:06:50.850> we'll<00:06:51.090> go<00:06:51.240> on<00:06:51.449> the<00:06:51.570> back<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:52.830> the

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
and so now we'll go on the back to the

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.780 
and so now we'll go on the back to the
rear<00:06:53.460> I<00:06:53.490> oh<00:06:53.750> so<00:06:54.750> top<00:06:55.080> we<00:06:55.229> have<00:06:55.350> four<00:06:55.740> USB<00:06:56.430> 2.0

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
rear I oh so top we have four USB 2.0

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.840 
rear I oh so top we have four USB 2.0
ports<00:06:57.360> down<00:06:58.139> their<00:06:58.350> BIOS<00:06:58.889> assume<00:06:59.610> that's<00:06:59.760> like

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
ports down their BIOS assume that's like

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.300 
ports down their BIOS assume that's like
a<00:06:59.910> CMOS<00:07:00.330> reset<00:07:00.360> switch<00:07:01.100> there<00:07:02.100> we<00:07:02.280> have

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
a CMOS reset switch there we have

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.270 
a CMOS reset switch there we have
standard<00:07:02.850> rj45<00:07:03.690> Ethernet<00:07:04.260> you<00:07:04.889> know<00:07:04.979> port

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
standard rj45 Ethernet you know port

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.150 
standard rj45 Ethernet you know port
right<00:07:05.400> there<00:07:05.460> below<00:07:06.240> that<00:07:06.449> two<00:07:06.720> USB<00:07:07.080> 3.0<00:07:08.660> audio

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
right there below that two USB 3.0 audio

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.770 
right there below that two USB 3.0 audio
2e<00:07:11.160> SATA<00:07:11.699> ports<00:07:12.289> two<00:07:13.289> more<00:07:13.500> USB<00:07:13.680> 3.0<00:07:14.340> ports<00:07:14.780> not

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 
2e SATA ports two more USB 3.0 ports not

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.629 
2e SATA ports two more USB 3.0 ports not
quite<00:07:16.080> sure<00:07:16.110> what<00:07:16.470> that<00:07:16.500> is<00:07:16.860> that<00:07:17.310> little<00:07:17.520> guy

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 
quite sure what that is that little guy

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.469 
quite sure what that is that little guy
out<00:07:17.729> there<00:07:17.850> maybe<00:07:18.000> that's<00:07:18.210> the<00:07:18.330> little

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
out there maybe that's the little

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.950 
out there maybe that's the little
bluetooth<00:07:19.139> they<00:07:19.470> were<00:07:19.530> talking<00:07:19.979> about

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 
bluetooth they were talking about

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.879 
bluetooth they were talking about
honestly<00:07:21.960> I'm<00:07:22.110> really<00:07:22.380> not<00:07:22.500> sure<00:07:22.560> what<00:07:22.830> that

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:22.889 
honestly I'm really not sure what that

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.159 
honestly I'm really not sure what that
is<00:07:23.039> also<00:07:23.340> look<00:07:23.490> into<00:07:23.669> that<00:07:23.820> but<00:07:24.389> two<00:07:24.870> more<00:07:24.990> USB

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169 
is also look into that but two more USB

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:27.320 
is also look into that but two more USB
2.0<00:07:25.500> ports<00:07:26.039> and<00:07:26.520> of<00:07:26.639> course<00:07:26.850> you<00:07:26.970> know<00:07:27.030> the

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.330 
2.0 ports and of course you know the

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.750 
2.0 ports and of course you know the
standard<00:07:27.600> audio<00:07:27.960> out<00:07:28.380> I'm<00:07:28.710> not<00:07:29.250> sure<00:07:29.310> at<00:07:29.669> the

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
standard audio out I'm not sure at the

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.400 
standard audio out I'm not sure at the
top<00:07:29.940> of<00:07:29.970> my<00:07:30.150> head<00:07:30.300> but<00:07:30.360> I<00:07:30.539> think<00:07:30.960> this<00:07:31.139> board

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
top of my head but I think this board

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.870 
top of my head but I think this board
uses<00:07:31.740> alc<00:07:32.280> 892<00:07:33.080> for<00:07:34.080> the<00:07:34.199> audio<00:07:35.100> codecs<00:07:35.639> so

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 
uses alc 892 for the audio codecs so

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.580 
uses alc 892 for the audio codecs so
that's<00:07:36.060> sorry<00:07:36.720> the<00:07:36.810> audio<00:07:36.870> chip<00:07:37.199> set<00:07:37.410> rather

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.590 
that's sorry the audio chip set rather

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.320 
that's sorry the audio chip set rather
so<00:07:38.160> that<00:07:38.370> should<00:07:38.520> be<00:07:38.550> pretty<00:07:38.639> nice<00:07:39.030> for<00:07:39.270> the

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
so that should be pretty nice for the

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.210 
so that should be pretty nice for the
hackintosh<00:07:39.630> world<00:07:40.020> but<00:07:40.530> that's<00:07:40.710> pretty<00:07:41.039> much

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
hackintosh world but that's pretty much

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.560 
hackintosh world but that's pretty much
all<00:07:41.400> i<00:07:41.490> want<00:07:41.700> to<00:07:41.729> show<00:07:41.880> you<00:07:41.910> guys<00:07:42.030> in<00:07:42.270> terms<00:07:42.450> of
