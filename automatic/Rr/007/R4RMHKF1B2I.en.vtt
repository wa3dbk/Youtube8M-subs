00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.450
 very good to all friends of pesos rooms 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.010
 and welcome at last to the letter j notice 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.040
 that for the next letter for the ca 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.119
 It's not going to be that long since I'm going to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.040
 fix it I will do it as soon as 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.540
 finish this letter so that we are going to 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.550
 return to this section to be very active 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.619
 in the channel already warned that in the next 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.680
 Step videos rum will be on expedia not 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:30.250
 very well the letter j we do not have big 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.349
 hidden gems or games too rare 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.020
 many of them will sound will not be a 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.239
 point where there is plenty to choose from the 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.100
 things like they are but in the end they are games 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.690
 that I think you may like and in 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.790
 concrete there is one of them that I what 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.890
 I consider one of the great jewels of his 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.720
 allowing but that is also not very appointment 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.720
 often or we go there 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.250
 very well, first of all a 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.720
 representative of what he could do 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.870
 super nintendo in the plane of action 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.180
 or that has gone unnoticed with the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.530
 time and it's already forgotten 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.380
 we are talking about 'jurassic park' 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.930
 bartz and that you continue the chaos 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.670
 continues is the second part of the game 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.080
 of jurassic so that it appeared super 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.580
 nintendo this has nothing to do 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.940
 with that first part that looked at 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.550
 look for overhead this is already a sei type of 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.410
 scroll is to say a collateral is a run 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.810
 and gun a game of shooting and 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.240
 jumping that has its similar 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.070
 obviously with others as against or 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.800
 terry can but this one has nothing to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.000
 see with those shares gender only 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.860
 it has a component also of survival 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.510
 very interesting we have ammunition is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.180
 say we have to pick up ammo 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.610
 by the levels it is spent and a 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.020
 a lot of dinosaurs and me and 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 also humans not only have to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.290
 kill in euros a game that will 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.030
 we can play with a friend and it's going to 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.510
 do triple the fun we 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.510
 recommend 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 second one of the most games 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.710
 originals and strangers of super nintendo 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.090
 in this case super famicom since not 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.130
 he left japan 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.130
 we are talking about jackie crash the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.260
 third of the trilogy appeared in mega 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.360
 drive and turbografx we are talking about 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.190
 someone with clear ideas is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.280
 third part jackie crush has a 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.470
 kind of Japanese theme not very 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.709
 Japanese we have to fight against 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.120
 demons and other mythological beings of 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.650
 the Japanese not the ones they 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.260
 imagine we already know these demons with 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.600
 horns so strange and another series of 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.010
 ghosts and spirits is a very game 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.930
 interesting the ball has very good 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.660
 physics is a very fast game with a 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.980
 excellent music and very very addictive already 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.770
 from the first game we will remain 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.600
 hooked and has several boards 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.820
 minigames we even have to fight 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.709
 against bosses and other creatures the others 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.480
 bugs is very interesting os 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.230
 we recommend this great jack and crush and 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 very unknown 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.750
 the third game is a super classic 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.000
 nintendo very very good and very funny 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.950
 we talk about joe and mack dost lost in 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.470
 the tropics in a second part a lot 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.069
 more agile than the first with many 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.930
 graphics new big bosses a 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.209
 very peculiar variety of situations and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.250
 what makes it very attractive is a way 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.290
 of two players that is very good and 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.849
 I consider that the adventure is going to be done 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.459
 much more fun with a friend next door 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.540
 is a data list game that has a 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.610
 very peculiar theme 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.890
 we are cavemen that we are going 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.140
 living adventures for a kind of 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.780
 prehistoric world with many tones 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.579
 cartoons and so on and so on and it's a 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.190
 game that I think defends very well 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.359
 to the super nintendo in its scope in the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.010
 platforms 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.049
 remember that super nintendo was one of 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.430
 the best consoles for this genre and 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.430
 this game I think it shows 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.850
 for the first time in pieces rooms os 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.920
 let's bring a game that only came out in 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.320
 europe we are talking about 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.480
 misunderstood gym power the dimension 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.150
 inter and the king power dimension period 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.010
 between this is a game that comes from another 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.380
 friendly commodore system here in 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.200
 europe is a computer that had a great 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.090
 success and we the users of that 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.530
 computer will remember someone power of 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.950
 spare for win as they come super nintendo 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.600
 we had a delivery that differs somewhat from 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.120
 those others but good at the bottom it 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.160
 look like game power the dimensions a 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.770
 game that looks a lot like your rican 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.670
 it seems a lot to cons and also 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.550
 It has phases 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.530
 that look like other games but in 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.660
 summary is a very difficult single game 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.980
 that maybe it can dizzy a little 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.410
 because it uses a technology that 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.540
 try to simulate a 3d without glasses or 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.040
 that the game has a few backgrounds too 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.600
 and dynamic too dynamic that 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.130
 they can get to distract in some 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.690
 cases to bother but do not stop 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.340
 try it because it's a great proposal for 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.340
 action and exclusive here in europe 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.000
 and lastly we leave today's jewel 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.240
 and it is none other than 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.669
 I would know but God a very big his tenacious 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.050
 of super famicom did not leave there 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.300
 game that had all the ballots for 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.039
 leave without a doubt one of the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.349
 best get horizontal which has 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.409
 this console has digitized voices 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.229
 more than 15 characters and a lot of 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.750
 graphic effects a music of 10 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.580
 done the note we are going to give the music 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.870
 it's a resounding 10 because it's one of the 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.300
 best soundtracks he went through 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.370
 super nintendo and a game that competed 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.629
 perfectly with others in 32 bits of 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.090
 done this game was cut to 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:22.029
 playstation and asad that is a game 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.129
 impressive long difficult and with a 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.979
 deep seal with amia to all good 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:29.770
 lover of degrees 3 to all lover of his 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.169
 classic theme and Japanese humor 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.150
 extravagant here has this piece of 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.189
 know and stop one of the best 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.849
 the whole saga and according to many people the 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.849
 best parody 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.240
 Very good friends, I hope you have 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.700
 enjoyed this list games 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.160
 varied action some of them very 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.360
 difficult others more affordable some 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.210
 of them that we can enjoy in 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.950
 company thing that is appreciated and about 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.750
 all are very good games of all 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.510
 they have something that makes them unique and 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.820
 That's why they deserve to be here, well, nothing 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.080
 we would see ourselves in the letter k that has 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.010
 some good examples also of 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.250
 games and forgive also for not having 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.320
 taken a chapter in time it has been 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.450
 past has really happened to me because 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.610
 mine for the next chapter is not going to 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.380
 spend so much time and I promise and 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.390

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.730
 waiting with desire and a strong hug 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.730
 friends
