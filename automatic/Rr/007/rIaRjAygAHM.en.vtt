 in this wave of bodybuilding 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.219
 because well, well, if we do not abuse 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.219
 but yes 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:08.509
 Normally, we eat or drink 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.740
 a little more than ordinary people do not 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.520
 then you have to foresee 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520
 any this 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:21.090
 or close to any this disease 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.290
 we can not be playing with health the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.630
 health is the most important 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.340
 we have to take good care of ourselves and well 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.170
 analysis I do them twice a year each 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.220
 six months 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.220
 and this 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 Y 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.600
 is that I was going to win the place 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.600
 this 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.049
 and well, you have to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.850
 There is this to another 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:04.130
 right now they will see there 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.989
 I'm really afraid of syringes 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.450
 but we put is part of so 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:13.069
 take care of yourselves health is first not 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.410
 nothing else because the instructor tells them or 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.440
 because it is in the gym tomato 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.239
 this because this is so much of these there 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.180
 to be investigated must learn 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.260
 you have to read you have to know why 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.290
 are the minimum maximum doses then and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.230
 already depending on your level if it is that 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.260
 you want to compete if you want 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:39.580
 dedicate stop because it is a risk that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.890
 the people who are dedicated to this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.830
 we can take if as well as someone who 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.709
 He runs cars and can hit a bullfighter and 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.620
 you can cut it out 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.810
 it has its risks and good is what you take or 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.810
 you leave it so I encourage
