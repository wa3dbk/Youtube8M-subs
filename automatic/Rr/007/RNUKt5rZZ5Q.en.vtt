00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
video i just posted here recently on the

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.610 
video i just posted here recently on the
light<00:00:06.600> kit<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:06.990> i<00:00:07.020> added<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.500> my<00:00:07.620> skysurfer

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
light kit that i added to my skysurfer

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.320 
light kit that i added to my skysurfer
got<00:00:10.620> some<00:00:10.860> feedback<00:00:11.280> from<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.880> first<00:00:12.150> video

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
got some feedback from the first video

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.959 
got some feedback from the first video
on<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.080> couple<00:00:13.590> things<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.920> could<00:00:14.639> help

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
on a couple things that could help

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.230 
on a couple things that could help
improve<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.830> way<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.340> system<00:00:17.699> works<00:00:17.850> as

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
improve the way that the system works as

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.929 
improve the way that the system works as
far<00:00:18.449> as<00:00:18.570> placement<00:00:18.840> lights<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.680> as<00:00:20.580> far<00:00:20.760> as

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
far as placement lights and as far as

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.750 
far as placement lights and as far as
adding<00:00:21.270> tubes<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.830> make<00:00:23.430> some<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
adding tubes to to make some of the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.480 
adding tubes to to make some of the
lights<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.090> little<00:00:24.119> more<00:00:24.390> visible<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.039> i<00:00:26.039> did

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
lights a little more visible and i did

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
lights a little more visible and i did
actually<00:00:26.820> have<00:00:27.599> old<00:00:27.810> timed<00:00:28.500> out<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.980> read<00:00:29.510> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
actually have old timed out to read the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.179 
actually have old timed out to read the
instructions<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.199> come<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
instructions that come with the the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
instructions that come with the the
lighting<00:00:32.520> kit<00:00:32.730> found<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.989> can

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
lighting kit found out that you can

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.840 
lighting kit found out that you can
actually<00:00:34.700> tune<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> lights<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:37.850> actually

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
actually tune the lights to actually

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
actually tune the lights to actually
work<00:00:39.120> off<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> auxiliary<00:00:40.680> ports

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
work off of one of the auxiliary ports

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.610 
work off of one of the auxiliary ports
to<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.489> turn<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> off<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:43.469> way

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
to actually turn on and off and that way

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
to actually turn on and off and that way
you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.860> actually<00:00:44.010> control<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you can actually control the the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.799 
you can actually control the the
blinking<00:00:45.629> lights<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> sub<00:00:46.649> trim<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.809> my

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
blinking lights with the sub trim so my

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.040 
blinking lights with the sub trim so my
bar<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.170> plugged<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.020> see

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
bar got plugged in so and as you can see

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.350 
bar got plugged in so and as you can see
i'm<00:00:52.680> using<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.600> dx6i<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.980> them

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
i'm using a dx6i here with one of them

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.650 
i'm using a dx6i here with one of them
6-channel<00:00:57.360> receivers<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:59.210> i've<00:01:00.210> already<00:01:00.420> got

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
6-channel receivers so i've already got

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.139 
6-channel receivers so i've already got
the<00:01:00.870> battery<00:01:01.079> plugged<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.059> got

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the battery plugged in and all you got

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.770 
the battery plugged in and all you got
to<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:04.580> flip<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.700> switch<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.270> they<00:01:06.540> turn

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
to do now is flip a switch and they turn

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
to do now is flip a switch and they turn
on<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:08.510> one<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.630> changes<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.110> made<00:01:10.280> from<00:01:11.280> one

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
on so one of the changes I made from one

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.600 
on so one of the changes I made from one
of<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> suggestions<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:13.100> actually<00:01:14.100> flip<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
of the suggestions was actually flip the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.310 
of the suggestions was actually flip the
light<00:01:14.790> over<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.150> top<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.170> actually

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
light over on top now so it actually

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.940 
light over on top now so it actually
points<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.250> towards<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.270> fuselage<00:01:18.950> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
points back towards the fuselage this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310 
points back towards the fuselage this
helps<00:01:20.220> light<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> wing<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.750> fuselage

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
helps light up the wing and the fuselage

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.490 
helps light up the wing and the fuselage
makes<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.979> much<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.369> visible<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:25.380> other

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
makes it much more visible the other

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.730 
makes it much more visible the other
thing<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.860> i<00:01:26.009> added<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> straw<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.560> back

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
thing is i added a straw on the back

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.240 
thing is i added a straw on the back
light<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.549> acts<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.420> light<00:01:30.659> tube<00:01:31.250> that

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
light here and acts as a light tube that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.490 
light here and acts as a light tube that
was<00:01:32.369> from<00:01:32.670> another<00:01:32.790> comment<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.200> someone

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
was from another comment that someone

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.469 
was from another comment that someone
made<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:36.229> here<00:01:37.229> i'll<00:01:37.530> shut<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> light<00:01:37.979> off

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
made so here i'll shut the light off

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:47.920 
made so here i'll shut the light off
we'll<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:39.720> what<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> difference<00:01:40.380> is

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.060 

as<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.080> see<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> wings<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
as you can see you can see the wings a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.780 
as you can see you can see the wings a
lot<00:01:50.250> better<00:01:50.490> now<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.510> that<00:01:52.080> tail<00:01:52.369> makes<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.549> big

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
lot better now and that tail makes a big

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.080 
lot better now and that tail makes a big
difference<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.340> other<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.729> noticed

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
difference and the other thing I noticed

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.080 
difference and the other thing I noticed
is<00:01:57.300> the<00:01:57.600> wings<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.800> thin<00:01:59.009> enough<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.670> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
is the wings are thin enough here that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.240 
is the wings are thin enough here that
you<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.270> actually<00:02:00.479> underneath<00:02:01.159> you<00:02:02.159> can

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
you can actually underneath you can

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.710 
you can actually underneath you can
actually<00:02:02.369> see<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.790> light<00:02:02.970> bleed<00:02:03.360> through<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
actually see the light bleed through the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.680 
actually see the light bleed through the
wings<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.830> tips<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:06.270> even<00:02:06.479> though<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
wings on the tips so even though the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.300 
wings on the tips so even though the
lights<00:02:06.899> are<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.229> top<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.830> wings<00:02:08.039> even

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
lights are on top of the wings even

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.140 
lights are on top of the wings even
though<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:10.380> flame<00:02:10.649> might<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.069> way<00:02:11.819> up<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
though the flame might be way up in the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.850 
though the flame might be way up in the
sky<00:02:12.180> you'll<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.900> able<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.080> still<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.739> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
sky you'll be able to still see the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.710 
sky you'll be able to still see the
light<00:02:14.069> from<00:02:14.310> underneath<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:17.239> we<00:02:18.239> can<00:02:18.420> turn
