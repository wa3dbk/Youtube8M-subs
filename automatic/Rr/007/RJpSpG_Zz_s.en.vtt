continued<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.170> really<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:07.710> designed<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
continued it's really well designed that

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.510 
continued it's really well designed that
was<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.330> my<00:01:09.420> point<00:01:09.600> physical<00:01:10.280> it's<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
was that was my point physical it's a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.240 
was that was my point physical it's a
FireWire<00:01:12.060> webcam<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.590> makes<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> different

programs like that I mean that's a good
point<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> make<00:02:08.850> right<00:02:09.060> there

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
point to make right there

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.420 
point to make right there
I<00:02:11.170> mean<00:02:12.170> I've<00:02:12.320> used<00:02:12.350> this<00:02:12.710> camera<00:02:12.920> before<00:02:13.310> this
