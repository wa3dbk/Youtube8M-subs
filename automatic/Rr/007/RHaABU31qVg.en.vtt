by exam feel calm no more fear from exam

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.780 
by exam feel calm no more fear from exam
yes<00:00:11.660> okay<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.349> was<00:00:13.620> about<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> different

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
yes okay so this was about a different

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.670 
yes okay so this was about a different
layers<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.210> selves<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.839> now<00:00:16.109> we<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.500> talked

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
layers of selves on now we we talked

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.380 
layers of selves on now we we talked
about<00:00:16.890> another<00:00:18.199> important<00:00:19.670> you<00:00:20.670> can<00:00:20.880> say<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
about another important you can say a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.540 
about another important you can say a
part<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.050> cell<00:00:22.439> wall<00:00:22.680> which<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.220> one

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
part of cell wall which is one

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.640 
part of cell wall which is one
plasmodesmata<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.170> are<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
plasmodesmata so now we are going to

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.490 
plasmodesmata so now we are going to
talk<00:00:28.859> about<00:00:28.939> plasmodesmata<00:00:30.050> so<00:00:31.050> let<00:00:31.199> us<00:00:31.230> see

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
talk about plasmodesmata so let us see

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100 
talk about plasmodesmata so let us see
what<00:00:31.740> they<00:00:31.920> are<00:00:32.180> they<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.210> tiny<00:00:33.630> holes

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
what they are they are tiny holes

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.310 
what they are they are tiny holes
through<00:00:34.530> cell<00:00:34.800> wall<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.430> middle<00:00:36.180> lamina<00:00:36.750> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
through cell wall and middle lamina so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
through cell wall and middle lamina so
here<00:00:37.620> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.370> picture<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.120> can

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
here if you see in this picture you can

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.200 
here if you see in this picture you can
see<00:00:39.629> some<00:00:40.140> tiny<00:00:40.530> holes<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.670> these<00:00:41.879> are

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
see some tiny holes here so these are

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.950 
see some tiny holes here so these are
nothing<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.190> plasma<00:00:44.190> dess<00:00:44.820> matter<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.690> why<00:00:45.899> do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
nothing but plasma dess matter so why do

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830 
nothing but plasma dess matter so why do
we<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.500> these<00:00:46.739> goals<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.570> said

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
we have these goals here now and I said

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.350 
we have these goals here now and I said
middle<00:00:49.379> lamella<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> connect<00:00:50.879> or

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
middle lamella is going to connect or

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.779 
middle lamella is going to connect or
they<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.620> join<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.340> adjacent

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
they are going to join two adjacent

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.410 
they are going to join two adjacent
cells

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
cells

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
cells
now<00:00:54.840> those<00:00:55.170> two<00:00:55.199> cells<00:00:55.800> if<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.190> want<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now those two cells if they want to

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.910 
now those two cells if they want to
communicate<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.660> each<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:57.960> there<00:00:58.590> has<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
communicate with each other there has to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
communicate with each other there has to
be<00:00:59.129> some<00:00:59.370> parts<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> communicate<00:01:00.510> communicate

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
be some parts to communicate communicate

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.689 
be some parts to communicate communicate
in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> sense<00:01:01.770> obviously<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.280> cells<00:01:02.489> will

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
in the sense obviously the cells will

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.850 
in the sense obviously the cells will
not<00:01:02.730> talk<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:03.870> least<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.379> should<00:01:04.680> be

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
not talk but at least they should be

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
not talk but at least they should be
able<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.280> exchange<00:01:05.640> materials<00:01:06.540> amongst<00:01:07.409> each

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
able to exchange materials amongst each

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.160 
able to exchange materials amongst each
other<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:08.310> do<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
other so how do they do that so for that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.039 
other so how do they do that so for that
purpose<00:01:10.590> they<00:01:11.340> are<00:01:11.460> are<00:01:11.729> tiny<00:01:12.119> holes<00:01:12.600> through

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
purpose they are are tiny holes through

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.080 
purpose they are are tiny holes through
the<00:01:13.200> cell<00:01:13.470> wall<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> lamina

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the cell wall and with the lamina

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.870 
the cell wall and with the lamina
through<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:15.780> their<00:01:16.290> cytoplasm<00:01:16.850> scanncut

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
through which their cytoplasm scanncut

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.410 
through which their cytoplasm scanncut
connected<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.130> connects<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.759> cytoplasm

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
connected so it connects the cytoplasm

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.210 
connected so it connects the cytoplasm
of<00:01:21.780> adjacent<00:01:22.140> cells<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.040> your

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of adjacent cells so this is your

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520 
of adjacent cells so this is your
cytoplasm<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.000> through<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.479> hole<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.080> will

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
cytoplasm so through this hole it will

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
cytoplasm so through this hole it will
get<00:01:25.740> corrected<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.299> side<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
get corrected on this side with the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.890 
get corrected on this side with the
adjacent<00:01:28.799> cell<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.210> they<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> exchange

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
adjacent cell so they can exchange

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.899 
adjacent cell so they can exchange
materials<00:01:31.680> through<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.159> tiny<00:01:32.490> holes<00:01:34.909> okay

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
materials through these tiny holes okay

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700 
materials through these tiny holes okay
now<00:01:36.060> let<00:01:36.270> us<00:01:36.299> look<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> function<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.439> cell

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
now let us look at the function of cell

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
now let us look at the function of cell
one<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.189> saw<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> structure<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.210> cell<00:01:39.479> one

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
one so we saw the structure of cell one

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.719 
one so we saw the structure of cell one
the<00:01:40.020> different<00:01:40.380> layers<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.040> cell<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.520> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the different layers in the cell one and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.580 
the different layers in the cell one and
now<00:01:42.420> I'm<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
now I'm going to see what are the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380 
now I'm going to see what are the
functions<00:01:44.040> why<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
functions why do we have what is the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.200 
functions why do we have what is the
significance<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:46.200> cell<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:46.820> they<00:01:47.820> provide

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
significance of cell one they provide

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
significance of cell one they provide
structural<00:01:48.810> strength<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.439> glands<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.100> said

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
structural strength to glands as I said

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.310 
structural strength to glands as I said
this<00:01:50.640> since<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.149> very<00:01:51.360> rigid<00:01:51.630> tough<00:01:52.049> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
this since they are very rigid tough and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.929 
this since they are very rigid tough and
hard<00:01:52.530> due<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> presence<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.430> cellulose

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
hard due to the presence of cellulose

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
hard due to the presence of cellulose
they<00:01:54.509> provide<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.200> lot<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.500> mechanical<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
they provide a lot of mechanical and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.719 
they provide a lot of mechanical and
structural<00:01:56.700> support<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.780> Lance<00:01:58.729> Revenge

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
structural support to Lance Revenge

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.850 
structural support to Lance Revenge
bursting<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.450> cells<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.020> hypertonic<00:02:01.860> solution

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
bursting of cells in hypertonic solution

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.679 
bursting of cells in hypertonic solution
so<00:02:04.860> what<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.159> hypotonic<00:02:05.820> solution<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.630> solution

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
so what is hypotonic solution a solution

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.919 
so what is hypotonic solution a solution
where<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.099> concentration<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> concentration

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
where the concentration is concentration

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.320 
where the concentration is concentration
of<00:02:10.170> water<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.860> more

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
of water is more

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.170 
of water is more
than<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:11.720> inside<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.590> cell<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.150> a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
than that inside the cell so this is a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.390 
than that inside the cell so this is a
hypotonic<00:02:14.660> solution<00:02:15.410> now<00:02:15.530> generally<00:02:16.220> what

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
hypotonic solution now generally what

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.520 
hypotonic solution now generally what
happens<00:02:16.820> when<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.090> put<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.510> cell<00:02:17.780> inside<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
happens when you put a cell inside a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.210 
happens when you put a cell inside a
hypertonic<00:02:19.460> solution<00:02:20.470> water<00:02:21.470> will<00:02:21.860> start

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
hypertonic solution water will start

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.890 
hypertonic solution water will start
getting<00:02:22.460> inside<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.330> cell<00:02:23.540> because<00:02:23.870> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
getting inside the cell because the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.650 
getting inside the cell because the
concentration<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.860> water<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.610> higher<00:02:26.090> in<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
concentration of water is higher in the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.960 
concentration of water is higher in the
solution<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:27.650> water<00:02:27.890> will<00:02:28.130> start<00:02:28.430> moving<00:02:28.670> into

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
solution so water will start moving into

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.000 
solution so water will start moving into
the<00:02:29.210> cell<00:02:29.420> now<00:02:29.840> has<00:02:30.020> more<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.530> more<00:02:30.590> water

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the cell now has more and more water

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.340 
the cell now has more and more water
start<00:02:31.820> entering<00:02:32.390> into<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.780> cell<00:02:33.020> what

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
start entering into the cell what

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.830 
start entering into the cell what
happens<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:34.190> cell<00:02:34.430> starts<00:02:34.820> swelling<00:02:35.300> up

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
happens the cell starts swelling up

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.400 
happens the cell starts swelling up
now<00:02:36.530> if<00:02:36.770> too<00:02:37.070> much<00:02:37.280> water<00:02:37.600> comes<00:02:38.600> inside<00:02:39.050> the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
now if too much water comes inside the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.950 
now if too much water comes inside the
cell<00:02:39.650> then<00:02:40.490> will<00:02:40.670> exert<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.090> lot<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.660> pressure

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
cell then will exert a lot of pressure

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.580 
cell then will exert a lot of pressure
on<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.380> cell<00:02:42.950> walls<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.360> cell<00:02:45.170> might

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
on the cell walls and the cell might

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.270 
on the cell walls and the cell might
burst<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.200> order<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.620> prevent<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.100> you

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
burst so in order to prevent that you

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.730 
burst so in order to prevent that you
have<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.000> cell<00:02:50.300> wall<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:50.900> cell<00:02:51.110> wall<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.530> like

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
have the cell wall so cell wall is like

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.980 
have the cell wall so cell wall is like
an<00:02:51.890> additional<00:02:52.550> support<00:02:52.940> because<00:02:53.210> plasma

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
an additional support because plasma

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.170 
an additional support because plasma
membrane<00:02:54.380> will<00:02:54.800> allow<00:02:55.370> water<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.880> pass

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
membrane will allow water to pass

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360 
membrane will allow water to pass
through<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.630> and<00:02:56.810> finally<00:02:57.350> if<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:57.920> too<00:02:58.190> much

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
through it and finally if it is too much

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.070 
through it and finally if it is too much
it<00:02:58.550> might<00:02:58.700> burst<00:02:59.000> so<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.570> have<00:02:59.930> this

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
it might burst so you have this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.460 
it might burst so you have this
additional<00:03:00.620> cell<00:03:00.890> wall<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.460> that<00:03:02.470> whenever

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
additional cell wall so that whenever

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.190 
additional cell wall so that whenever
too<00:03:04.220> much<00:03:04.400> of<00:03:04.580> water<00:03:04.850> starts<00:03:05.390> entering<00:03:05.930> inside

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
too much of water starts entering inside

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.340 
too much of water starts entering inside
the<00:03:06.800> cell<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.430> will<00:03:07.640> exert<00:03:08.240> some<00:03:08.660> pressure<00:03:08.690> on

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
the cell it will exert some pressure on

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.040 
the cell it will exert some pressure on
the<00:03:09.620> cell<00:03:09.890> walls<00:03:10.250> so<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.300> water<00:03:11.570> which<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
the cell walls so this water which is

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.900 
the cell walls so this water which is
entering<00:03:12.230> will<00:03:12.650> exert<00:03:13.010> some<00:03:13.280> pressure<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.670> the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
entering will exert some pressure on the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.240 
entering will exert some pressure on the
cell<00:03:14.150> wall<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.630> cell<00:03:15.050> one<00:03:15.650> will<00:03:15.890> also

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
cell wall and the cell one will also

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.100 
cell wall and the cell one will also
exert<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.940> counter<00:03:17.510> pressure<00:03:19.420> therefore<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
exert a counter pressure therefore the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.930 
exert a counter pressure therefore the
plant<00:03:21.410> cell<00:03:21.800> will<00:03:22.040> be<00:03:22.190> able<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.730> withstand

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
plant cell will be able to withstand

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.040 
plant cell will be able to withstand
greater<00:03:23.750> changes<00:03:24.410> in<00:03:24.680> surroundings<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:26.050> due

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
greater changes in surroundings and due

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.080 
greater changes in surroundings and due
to<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.320> presence<00:03:27.709> of<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:27.950> cell<00:03:28.190> wall<00:03:28.400> Lance's

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
to the presence of the cell wall Lance's

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.690 
to the presence of the cell wall Lance's
and<00:03:29.680> withstand<00:03:30.680> greater<00:03:30.980> changes<00:03:31.520> in

neighboring cells as I said by the
presence<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.680> tiny<00:03:54.950> holes<00:03:55.340> called

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
presence of tiny holes called

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.199 
presence of tiny holes called
plasmodesmata<00:03:57.430> provides<00:03:58.430> protection

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
plasmodesmata provides protection

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.229 
plasmodesmata provides protection
against<00:03:59.840> injury<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.709> invasion<00:04:01.400> so<00:04:01.850> since<00:04:02.090> it

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
against injury and invasion so since it

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:10.120 
against injury and invasion so since it
is<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:06.970> rigid<00:04:07.970> tough<00:04:08.450> layer<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.350> also<00:04:09.620> acts

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
is a rigid tough layer so it also acts

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.770 
is a rigid tough layer so it also acts
as<00:04:10.310> an<00:04:10.459> additional<00:04:11.060> protection<00:04:13.420> so<00:04:14.420> with<00:04:14.600> this

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
as an additional protection so with this

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.920 
as an additional protection so with this
we<00:04:15.080> ended<00:04:15.890> our<00:04:15.980> discussion<00:04:16.580> on<00:04:16.640> cell<00:04:16.940> wall<00:04:17.299> now

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
we ended our discussion on cell wall now

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.200 
we ended our discussion on cell wall now
let<00:04:18.140> us<00:04:18.169> quickly<00:04:18.440> have<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.190> comparison<00:04:20.090> between

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
let us quickly have a comparison between

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.879 
let us quickly have a comparison between
cell<00:04:20.750> wall<00:04:21.080> and<00:04:21.289> cell

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
cell wall and cell

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.350 
cell wall and cell
membrane<00:04:22.280> what<00:04:22.580> are<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:22.789> differences

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
membrane what are the differences

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.920 
membrane what are the differences
between<00:04:23.539> the<00:04:23.900> two<00:04:24.759> so<00:04:25.759> as<00:04:25.969> I<00:04:25.999> said<00:04:26.360> cell<00:04:26.689> wall

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
between the two so as I said cell wall

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.749 
between the two so as I said cell wall
is<00:04:27.110> present<00:04:27.530> only<00:04:27.710> in<00:04:27.860> plant<00:04:28.159> cells<00:04:28.520> where

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
is present only in plant cells where

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.790 
is present only in plant cells where
cell<00:04:29.060> membrane<00:04:29.449> is<00:04:29.599> present<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.169> both<00:04:30.349> plant

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
cell membrane is present in both plant

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.689 
cell membrane is present in both plant
and<00:04:30.949> animal<00:04:31.819> cells<00:04:32.319> cell<00:04:33.319> wall<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.949> non<00:04:34.219> leapin

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
and animal cells cell wall is non leapin

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.679 
and animal cells cell wall is non leapin
whereas<00:04:35.509> cell<00:04:35.779> membrane<00:04:36.259> is<00:04:36.469> living<00:04:37.689> cell

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:38.689 
whereas cell membrane is living cell

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.230 
whereas cell membrane is living cell
wall<00:04:39.050> is<00:04:39.289> permeable<00:04:40.099> that<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.580> allow<00:04:40.909> all

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
wall is permeable that is it allow all

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.480 
wall is permeable that is it allow all
the<00:04:41.419> particles<00:04:41.749> to<00:04:42.110> pass<00:04:42.289> through<00:04:42.620> it<00:04:42.740> whereas

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
the particles to pass through it whereas

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.339 
the particles to pass through it whereas
cell<00:04:43.849> membrane<00:04:44.270> is<00:04:44.449> selectively<00:04:45.050> permeable

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:45.349 
cell membrane is selectively permeable

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.999 
cell membrane is selectively permeable
it<00:04:45.740> allows<00:04:46.129> only<00:04:46.370> selected<00:04:47.029> particles<00:04:48.009> cell

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
it allows only selected particles cell

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.179 
it allows only selected particles cell
wall<00:04:49.310> is<00:04:49.520> hard<00:04:50.060> rigid<00:04:50.509> where<00:04:51.349> a<00:04:51.379> cell<00:04:51.770> membrane

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
wall is hard rigid where a cell membrane

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.040 
wall is hard rigid where a cell membrane
is<00:04:52.340> thin<00:04:52.729> delicate<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.719> flexible<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.960> these

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
is thin delicate and flexible so these

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.990 
is thin delicate and flexible so these
are<00:04:57.319> some<00:04:57.529> of<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.860> differences<00:04:58.250> between<00:04:58.460> cell

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
are some of the differences between cell

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.879 
are some of the differences between cell
wall<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.270> cell<00:04:59.629> membrane<00:05:00.020> now<00:05:00.529> let<00:05:00.740> us

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
wall and cell membrane now let us

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.439 
wall and cell membrane now let us
quickly<00:05:01.099> look<00:05:01.279> at<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.759> differences<00:05:02.389> between

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
quickly look at the differences between

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.110 
quickly look at the differences between
the<00:05:02.930> primary<00:05:03.199> and<00:05:03.469> secondary<00:05:03.710> cell<00:05:04.669> wall<00:05:04.699> just

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
the primary and secondary cell wall just

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.450 
the primary and secondary cell wall just
now<00:05:05.240> we<00:05:05.419> spoke<00:05:05.659> about<00:05:05.689> them<00:05:06.199> right<00:05:06.439> so<00:05:07.009> primary

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
now we spoke about them right so primary

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.100 
now we spoke about them right so primary
cell<00:05:07.729> wall<00:05:07.759> is<00:05:08.029> something<00:05:08.180> which<00:05:08.539> is<00:05:08.569> present

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
cell wall is something which is present

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.769 
cell wall is something which is present
in<00:05:09.199> the<00:05:09.319> young<00:05:09.979> cells<00:05:10.370> so<00:05:11.029> young<00:05:11.240> cells<00:05:11.539> will

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:11.779 
in the young cells so young cells will

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.689 
in the young cells so young cells will
not<00:05:11.810> have<00:05:12.229> secondary<00:05:12.800> cell<00:05:13.009> wall<00:05:13.039> so

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
not have secondary cell wall so

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.790 
not have secondary cell wall so
secondary<00:05:14.330> cell<00:05:14.629> wall<00:05:14.659> will<00:05:15.050> be<00:05:15.080> present<00:05:15.589> only

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
secondary cell wall will be present only

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.610 
secondary cell wall will be present only
in<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.099> matured<00:05:16.639> cells<00:05:17.319> primary<00:05:18.319> cell<00:05:18.589> wall

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
in the matured cells primary cell wall

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.489 
in the matured cells primary cell wall
it<00:05:18.919> is<00:05:19.069> located<00:05:19.580> between<00:05:19.819> middle<00:05:20.779> lamella<00:05:20.960> and

00:05:21.489 --> 00:05:21.499 
it is located between middle lamella and

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:26.200 
it is located between middle lamella and
the<00:05:23.529> secondary<00:05:24.529> cell<00:05:24.889> wall<00:05:24.919> as<00:05:25.310> I<00:05:25.580> said<00:05:25.849> this

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
the secondary cell wall as I said this

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.019 
the secondary cell wall as I said this
is<00:05:26.419> your<00:05:26.500> plasma<00:05:27.500> membrane<00:05:27.889> this<00:05:28.460> is<00:05:28.520> your

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
is your plasma membrane this is your

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.510 
is your plasma membrane this is your
secondary<00:05:29.900> cell<00:05:30.259> wall<00:05:30.289> this<00:05:30.740> is<00:05:30.919> your<00:05:31.159> primary

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
secondary cell wall this is your primary

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.390 
secondary cell wall this is your primary
cell<00:05:32.029> wall<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.479> this<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.289> log<00:05:33.740> middle<00:05:34.189> lamella

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
cell wall and this is log middle lamella

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.230 
cell wall and this is log middle lamella
so<00:05:35.389> basically<00:05:35.900> this<00:05:36.050> is<00:05:36.259> your<00:05:36.289> middle<00:05:36.949> lamella

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
so basically this is your middle lamella

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.409 
so basically this is your middle lamella
the<00:05:38.240> outermost<00:05:38.750> one<00:05:39.460> inside<00:05:40.460> that<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:41.180> have

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
the outermost one inside that you have

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.309 
the outermost one inside that you have
your<00:05:41.719> primary<00:05:42.319> cell<00:05:42.649> wall<00:05:43.629> inside<00:05:44.629> that<00:05:45.020> you

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
your primary cell wall inside that you

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.659 
your primary cell wall inside that you
have<00:05:45.560> your<00:05:45.919> secondary<00:05:46.520> cell<00:05:46.909> wall<00:05:47.210> and<00:05:48.669> inside

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
have your secondary cell wall and inside

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.300 
have your secondary cell wall and inside
that<00:05:49.699> you<00:05:50.270> have<00:05:50.539> your<00:05:50.870> plasma<00:05:51.770> membrane<00:05:52.279> or

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
that you have your plasma membrane or

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.219 
that you have your plasma membrane or
cell<00:05:52.759> membrane<00:05:53.210> whatever<00:05:53.659> you<00:05:53.810> call<00:05:54.050> it

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
cell membrane whatever you call it

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.800 
cell membrane whatever you call it
so<00:05:55.039> when<00:05:55.339> you<00:05:55.460> talk<00:05:55.639> about<00:05:55.939> primary<00:05:56.300> cell<00:05:56.779> wall

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
so when you talk about primary cell wall

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.110 
so when you talk about primary cell wall
it<00:05:57.259> is<00:05:57.409> located<00:05:57.710> between<00:05:57.949> middle<00:05:58.610> lamella<00:05:58.789> and

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
it is located between middle lamella and

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.389 
it is located between middle lamella and
secondary<00:05:59.870> cell<00:06:00.080> wall<00:06:00.110> but<00:06:00.919> when<00:06:01.069> you<00:06:01.189> talk

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:01.399 
secondary cell wall but when you talk

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.189 
secondary cell wall but when you talk
about<00:06:01.669> secondary<00:06:02.120> cell<00:06:02.419> wall<00:06:02.629> it<00:06:02.810> is<00:06:02.839> located

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
about secondary cell wall it is located

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.230 
about secondary cell wall it is located
between<00:06:03.379> primary<00:06:03.979> cell<00:06:04.460> wall<00:06:04.669> and<00:06:04.699> cell

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
between primary cell wall and cell

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.129 
between primary cell wall and cell
membrane<00:06:06.550> primary<00:06:07.550> cell<00:06:07.849> one<00:06:08.180> is<00:06:08.449> single

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
membrane primary cell one is single

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.589 
membrane primary cell one is single
layered<00:06:09.379> whereas<00:06:10.279> secondary<00:06:10.550> cell<00:06:11.180> wall<00:06:11.210> is

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
layered whereas secondary cell wall is

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.420 
layered whereas secondary cell wall is
multi-layered<00:06:12.020> so<00:06:12.409> this<00:06:12.649> secondary<00:06:13.129> cell

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
multi-layered so this secondary cell

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.790 
multi-layered so this secondary cell
wall<00:06:13.460> which<00:06:13.879> is<00:06:13.909> formed<00:06:14.479> with<00:06:14.960> majority<00:06:15.680> of

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:15.800 
wall which is formed with majority of

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.969 
wall which is formed with majority of
the<00:06:15.949> plant<00:06:16.189> they<00:06:16.669> again<00:06:17.000> have<00:06:17.300> sub<00:06:17.599> layers<00:06:17.979> so

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
the plant they again have sub layers so

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.860 
the plant they again have sub layers so
there<00:06:19.159> are<00:06:19.310> multiple<00:06:19.490> layers<00:06:20.060> of<00:06:20.569> this

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
there are multiple layers of this

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.200 
there are multiple layers of this
secondary<00:06:21.349> cell<00:06:21.740> wall<00:06:21.770> but<00:06:22.490> primary<00:06:22.909> cell

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
secondary cell wall but primary cell

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.869 
secondary cell wall but primary cell
wall<00:06:23.419> is<00:06:23.569> just<00:06:23.839> one<00:06:24.080> layer<00:06:24.610> primary<00:06:25.610> cell<00:06:25.849> wall

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:25.879 
wall is just one layer primary cell wall
