00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 very good to all of you today I am going to bring you a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.690
 very important tutorial that is going to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.540
 serve a lot of help we are going to create a network 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.490
 cable connection in our house 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.950
 because as you know our 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.770
 playstation 4 can be connected or 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.840
 by wifi or by lan cable then 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.270
 many times in homes are very 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.250
 away from where the router is at 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.199
 console and the signal does not come very well 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 so what do we have to do or 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.640
 well pull a cable does not do once 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 established us that if we want that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.200
 the network cable is hidden or 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.740
 using these cheap this uses the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.050
 electrical wiring to make the network 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.180
 and it goes really well it comes to these are 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.980
 up to 200 mb 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.330
 there is also more of less but 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.680
 I recommend this with the connection 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:52.470
 now or it gives us 200 I do not think we 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.480
 do not need more than 100 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.920
 Well maybe if you have other 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.190
 companies in three points increase more with 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 200 goes well over the price of this round 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.470
 approximately 30 euros you can 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.950
 get over it come 30-40 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.630
 always in a pack of two vouchers and with their 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 wired and how we have to mount 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.580
 well, very easy 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.100
 we take our router this for example 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.330
 with his here we have here the exit and what 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.360
 we would connect here the ass of the apparatus 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.940
 ok we'll connect it here 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.290
 and such that 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.120
 this is advanced and this would go to a 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.220
 current plug although we 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.540
 we want where obviously this 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.550
 would be in the computer for this about 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.680
 from the computer the little button you see here 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.190
 this is to synchronize if any 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.990
 Once synchronized, we click on it 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.540
 synchronize but by default they come 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.250
 synchronized these two vale 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.020
 above all, it's because maybe if 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.930
 we want to put for example three 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.930
 we buy good to put four then 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.570
 so then we need the 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.210
 synchronization and this second device is going 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:05.680
 to our play and we will give internet 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.800
 by cable that gives the maximum speed that 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.619
 gives more speed for wifi and goes a lot 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.230
 best 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.840
 the good connection and the other one because we take 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.360
 our playstation here the output of 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.510
 network as you can see and plug it in 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.209
 also to the ass of this and now we're going to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.250
 see the console and how to configure it for 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.349
 that works is the thing that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.379
 you just have to create a network 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.989
 cable and this is also plugged in and it's 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.819
 totally separate in being a 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.040
 remote room about 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.400
 10 15 meters go see now how 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.010
 works perfectly let's go to lyon 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.590
 we no longer have connected this would be the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 device where goes to the computer is worth the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.939
 computer path and let's see where 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.390
 we have the song then we have this 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:57.189
 it's in the living room we go to the bedroom 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.829
 past we passed the hall and here 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:03.250
 we have the play sees the other device that 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.040
 is connected to the play 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.159
 is connected to the play has the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.250
 witnesses and it will look good to see now is 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.959
 that we have a window then the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.329
 witnesses the three lights it means 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.940
 everything is perfect arrives perfectly 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.989
 the internet and now as you can see 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.239
 happened here sees the online mode that already 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.579
 everything is on perfectly 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.190
 it works king and now let's see how 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.290
 we would connect the vale once 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.150
 Well we are already in the play 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.310
 three apart they are small hospitalized but 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.530
 well , nothing happens we will go as 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.960
 we will configure right now not for 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.380
 treat him in this way then we would go 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.380
 to network 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.700
 Internet connection configuration 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.540
 use lan cable we have to catch this 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.390
 option because we are not using a 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.480
 demonstration 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.480
 Easy verified network environment 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.350
 will be updated that offering of 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.310
 internet we can try the connection 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.310
 we tested it 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.980
 It's that easy, you do not have to do anything 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.840
 and they are going much better than by 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.209
 wifi and if they are far away and there 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.699
 interference many times wifi 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.699
 pillar the thing puts does not go very well is not going 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.009
 completely fine and you can see how old 17 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.570
 with 64 cons of his life this is not 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.289
 real are approximations 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.210
 we have contracted or 100 megabytes 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.770
 here you should be able to give 100 megs and here 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.979
 I would give 10 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.199
 as they are approximations we can not 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.360
 assess if it reaches one hundred percent but 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.669
 well this is all kids we see the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.310
 next video I hope I hope there 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.550
 liked like and subscribe to the 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.550
