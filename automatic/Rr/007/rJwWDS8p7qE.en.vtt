here you're able to see the digital TV
converter<00:00:44.190> box<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> found<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
converter box that I found to be the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.279 
converter box that I found to be the
best<00:00:46.079> which<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.680> made<00:00:46.980> by<00:00:47.010> Zen<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.289> just

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the parts you get with a digital antenna

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.399 
the parts you get with a digital antenna
and<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.100> see<00:01:08.159> here<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.600> part<00:01:09.960> goes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and as you can see here this part goes

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.000 
and as you can see here this part goes
into<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.960> antenna<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.770> here

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
into your antenna which is right here

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.510 
into your antenna which is right here
and<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.509> part<00:01:15.930> goes<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.369> your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and this part goes out to your

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
and this part goes out to your
television<00:01:17.810> which<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> can<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.290> over<00:01:19.619> there

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
television which you can see over there

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.429 
television which you can see over there
then<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.030> top<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.450> there<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> plug

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
then on top of that there is a plug

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.760 
then on top of that there is a plug
attached<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.640> needs<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.299> into<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:25.229> outlet

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
attached that needs to go into an outlet

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090 
attached that needs to go into an outlet
and<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:27.360> basically<00:01:27.750> all<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.650> takes<00:01:28.860> to

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
and that is basically all it takes to

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.390 
and that is basically all it takes to
hook<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.430> an<00:01:29.640> antenna<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:31.020> your<00:01:31.320> digital<00:01:31.470> TV<00:01:31.680> so

plug everything into the television take

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.280 
plug everything into the television take
you<00:02:57.920> maybe<00:02:58.190> a<00:02:58.610> minute<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.300> two<00:02:59.480> minutes<00:02:59.510> if<00:03:00.080> you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
you maybe a minute to two minutes if you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.340 
you maybe a minute to two minutes if you
have<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> regular<00:03:01.130> analog<00:03:01.760> television<00:03:02.570> you

have a regular analog television you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.290 
have a regular analog television you
would<00:03:03.560> need<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.040> digital<00:03:04.550> converter<00:03:05.000> box

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
would need the digital converter box

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.759 
would need the digital converter box
which<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.690> see<00:03:05.870> here<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.560> back<00:03:06.739> of

which you see here this is the back of
it<00:03:07.060> right<00:03:08.060> here<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.650> where<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.830> would<00:03:09.980> plug<00:03:10.310> in

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
it right here is where you would plug in

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.870 
it right here is where you would plug in
for<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.630> antenna<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.920> instead<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.519> having<00:03:13.700> the

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
for the antenna so instead of having the

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.360 
for the antenna so instead of having the
antenna<00:03:14.180> go<00:03:14.390> into<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.110> television<00:03:15.530> the

here's<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.380> power<00:03:24.650> adapter<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.370> needs<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.820> go

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
here's a power adapter which needs to go

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.920 
here's a power adapter which needs to go
into<00:03:26.239> an<00:03:26.540> outlet<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.310> here<00:03:28.310> is<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:29.690> box

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
into an outlet and here is the box

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.740 
into an outlet and here is the box
itself<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:31.400> change<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.820> channels<00:03:32.209> this<00:03:32.540> way

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
itself can change the channels this way

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.900 
itself can change the channels this way
but<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.500> also<00:03:33.680> comes<00:03:34.190> with<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.489> remote<00:03:34.850> control

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
but it also comes with a remote control

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.270 
but it also comes with a remote control
this<00:03:35.720> is<00:03:35.989> what<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> remote<00:03:36.530> control<00:03:36.890> looks

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
this is what the remote control looks

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.130 
this is what the remote control looks
like<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.790> comes<00:03:38.000> with<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.209> Zen<00:03:38.510> well<00:03:38.720> unit

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
like that comes with a Zen well unit

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.560 
like that comes with a Zen well unit
this<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.010> major<00:03:40.190> negative<00:03:40.610> with<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.360> Zen

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
this is the major negative with the Zen

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.180 
this is the major negative with the Zen
well<00:03:41.720> unit<00:03:42.049> people<00:03:42.230> don't<00:03:42.530> like<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.070> I
