00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.490 

I<00:00:06.720> chose<00:00:07.720> to<00:00:07.900> live<00:00:07.990> in<00:00:08.050> a<00:00:08.170> whole<00:00:08.320> residence

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
I chose to live in a whole residence

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.560 
I chose to live in a whole residence
because<00:00:09.040> firstly<00:00:09.760> I'm<00:00:09.850> from<00:00:10.000> Hamilton<00:00:10.120> son

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
because firstly I'm from Hamilton son

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.420 
because firstly I'm from Hamilton son
not<00:00:11.050> from<00:00:11.230> Auckland<00:00:11.559> so<00:00:11.680> I<00:00:11.740> don't<00:00:11.920> have<00:00:12.010> family

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430

living<00:00:13.270> here<00:00:13.510> and<00:00:13.840> I<00:00:13.960> thought<00:00:14.139> it'd<00:00:14.230> be<00:00:14.350> a<00:00:14.380> lot

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
living here and I thought it'd be a lot

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.410 
living here and I thought it'd be a lot
easier<00:00:14.770> to<00:00:15.010> transition<00:00:15.490> from<00:00:15.520> living<00:00:15.820> at<00:00:16.180> home

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
easier to transition from living at home

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.929 
easier to transition from living at home
to<00:00:17.170> flatting<00:00:17.770> by<00:00:18.130> going<00:00:18.430> to<00:00:18.670> all<00:00:18.760> the

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
to flatting by going to all the

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.970 
to flatting by going to all the
residents<00:00:19.060> first<00:00:19.510> so<00:00:20.110> that<00:00:20.290> I<00:00:20.320> could<00:00:20.619> get<00:00:20.920> to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
residents first so that I could get to

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.339 
residents first so that I could get to
know<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.250> city<00:00:21.430> a<00:00:21.520> bit<00:00:21.670> more<00:00:22.029> before<00:00:22.180> I<00:00:22.689> went

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.580
