00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
time when I had this here so that's what

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.730 
time when I had this here so that's what
i'll<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.549> finishing<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.180> hair<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
i'll be finishing this hair with at the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
i'll be finishing this hair with at the
top<00:02:01.979> i<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.020> longer<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:05.369> hair<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
top i think the longer the hair is the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.419 
top i think the longer the hair is the
more<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.110> tangles<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.280> i<00:02:08.369> think

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
more it tangles that's what i think

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.639 
more it tangles that's what i think
