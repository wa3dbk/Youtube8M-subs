00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
see here kind of once the wires are

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.889 
see here kind of once the wires are
undone<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.579> slip<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> casing<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:45.689> off

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
undone you can slip the casing right off

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.039 
undone you can slip the casing right off
and<00:01:46.909> do<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.939> same<00:01:48.179> thing<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.719> other<00:01:48.780> one

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and do the same thing to the other one

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.039 
and do the same thing to the other one
and<00:01:49.229> it'll<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.469> like<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.969> now<00:01:50.969> if<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.659> look

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and it'll look like this now if you look

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.050 
and it'll look like this now if you look
closely<00:01:52.289> you'll<00:01:52.590> see<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> each<00:01:53.340> lead<00:01:53.789> has

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
closely you'll see that each lead has

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
closely you'll see that each lead has
one<00:01:54.450> copper<00:01:54.840> wire<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.319> then<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.890> other<00:01:55.920> wire

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
one copper wire and then the other wire

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
one copper wire and then the other wire
is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> green<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:56.939> red<00:01:56.969> depending<00:01:57.390> off<00:01:57.689> you're

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
is a green or red depending off you're

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.419 
is a green or red depending off you're
looking<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> left<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.859> right<00:01:59.039> channel

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
looking at the left of the right channel

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.910 
looking at the left of the right channel
of<00:01:59.549> headphones<00:02:00.179> keep<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.409> mind<00:02:01.439> as<00:02:01.799> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
of headphones keep this in mind as you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.889 
of headphones keep this in mind as you
take<00:02:02.069> apart<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.640> new<00:02:03.119> headphones<00:02:03.569> as<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
take apart your new headphones as you

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.010 
take apart your new headphones as you
can<00:02:04.020> see<00:02:04.140> here<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.189> chose<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.020> JVC

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
can see here now I chose the JVC

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.870 
can see here now I chose the JVC
marshmallow<00:02:07.619> headphones<00:02:08.100> for<00:02:08.520> two<00:02:08.670> reasons

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
marshmallow headphones for two reasons

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.150 
marshmallow headphones for two reasons
one<00:02:09.240> they're<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:10.170> simple<00:02:10.710> looking<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> get

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
one they're pretty simple looking to get

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.070 
one they're pretty simple looking to get
apart<00:02:11.520> as<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.710> kinda<00:02:13.710> see<00:02:14.900> there<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.020> go

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
apart as you can kinda see there you go

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.800 
apart as you can kinda see there you go
and<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.670> get<00:02:17.790> access<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.240> wires<00:02:18.390> fairly

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
and you get access to the wires fairly

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.119 
and you get access to the wires fairly
easily<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.410> second<00:02:19.709> reason<00:02:19.769> is<00:02:19.980> they

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
easily and the second reason is they

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.199 
easily and the second reason is they
sound<00:02:20.340> pretty<00:02:20.459> good<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:20.879> come<00:02:21.060> with

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
sound pretty good and they come with

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.400 
sound pretty good and they come with
them<00:02:21.450> sound<00:02:21.810> isolating<00:02:22.640> marshmallow<00:02:23.640> things

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
them sound isolating marshmallow things

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.000 
them sound isolating marshmallow things
that<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.830> could<00:02:24.950> snap<00:02:25.370> onto<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.790> end<00:02:27.010> the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
that you could snap onto the end the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.710 
that you could snap onto the end the
process<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.670> same<00:02:28.700> as<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.150> was<00:02:29.300> for<00:02:29.600> the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
process is the same as it was for the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.750 
process is the same as it was for the
Apple<00:02:30.080> iPhones<00:02:30.440> just<00:02:30.860> decider<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> wires

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
Apple iPhones just decider the wires

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.080 
Apple iPhones just decider the wires
there<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.660> go<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.310> sure<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.550> keep<00:02:34.670> in<00:02:34.850> mind

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
there you go now be sure to keep in mind

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.570 
there you go now be sure to keep in mind
which<00:02:35.450> terminal<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.620> common<00:02:37.010> wire<00:02:37.190> went<00:02:37.430> to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
which terminal the common wire went to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.430 
which terminal the common wire went to
and<00:02:37.820> which<00:02:37.970> terminal<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.960> left<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.380> right

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and which terminal the left and right

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.490 
and which terminal the left and right
wires<00:02:40.100> went<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:41.390> should<00:02:41.780> look<00:02:42.050> similar<00:02:42.260> to

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
wires went to it should look similar to

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.800 
wires went to it should look similar to
the<00:02:42.710> Apple<00:02:43.010> once<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:44.030> next<00:02:44.270> step<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.780> take

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
the Apple once the next step is to take

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.320 
the Apple once the next step is to take
the<00:02:45.140> iphone<00:02:45.950> headphone<00:02:46.580> wires<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.060> run<00:02:47.210> them

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
the iphone headphone wires and run them

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.760 
the iphone headphone wires and run them
through<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.630> new<00:02:47.810> headphones<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.590> have

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
and tie a little knot just like there

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.010 
and tie a little knot just like there
was<00:02:51.350> before<00:02:52.300> next<00:02:53.300> you'll<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.690> solder

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
was before next you'll have to solder

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
worked ok and if it did apply a little

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.750 
worked ok and if it did apply a little
hot<00:03:12.230> glue<00:03:12.260> or<00:03:12.860> someone<00:03:13.160> who<00:03:13.250> sort<00:03:13.460> of<00:03:13.550> leader

hot glue or someone who sort of leader

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.030 
hot glue or someone who sort of leader
just<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> make<00:03:14.210> sure<00:03:14.240> things<00:03:14.990> don't<00:03:15.260> move

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
just to make sure things don't move

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.210 
just to make sure things don't move
around<00:03:16.160> too<00:03:16.400> much<00:03:16.520> in<00:03:16.850> there

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
around too much in there

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.880 
around too much in there
after<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.400> just<00:03:19.670> close<00:03:19.970> everything<00:03:20.150> up<00:03:20.569> and

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
after that just close everything up and

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.990 
after that just close everything up and
give<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:21.980> another<00:03:22.130> quick<00:03:22.400> test<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.760> make<00:03:22.940> sure

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
give it another quick test to make sure

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.630 
give it another quick test to make sure
it<00:03:23.270> sounds<00:03:23.480> okay<00:03:24.160> put<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.250> all<00:03:25.340> back<00:03:25.490> together

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
it sounds okay put it all back together

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.500 
it sounds okay put it all back together
and<00:03:26.560> there<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.650> go<00:03:27.970> new<00:03:28.970> iphone<00:03:29.300> headphones

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
and there you go new iphone headphones
