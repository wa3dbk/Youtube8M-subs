00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.720
 hello yourself dessay and this is the first 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.960
 release mechanisms for minecraft 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.900
 1.5.1 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.640
 and in this series I'll show you a prototype on 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.599
 helicopter maynkavt yes you heard right 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:23.140
 a little crafting them let's show you here 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:26.619
 scheme is very simple sergey g a couple more 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.810
 take them and so let's turn on itself 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:35.230
 circuit here nothing happens like 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:40.020
 see with all that but worth taking in 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:45.210
 hands my helmet starting to rise up 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.090
 raise your hands bow we go to the side and 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.960
 then we take the thread we go 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.520
 other side well let's show how 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 it works when we activate the lever 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.080
 short impulses stop responding 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.000
 but as soon as we think short mc5 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.149
 served from this part of the circuit is understandable and 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.189
 now let's get to the mechanism itself 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:14.439
 command blocks and so here is the command 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.210
 teleport run players on one 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:21.369
 block well this x this y this z and here 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.069
 the value of y we have this day let us be 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.270
 climb one block up here 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.149
 also weakness x 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.799
 here and here the same thing with this 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:37.810
 figured out now about the most important thing 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.909
 that's about it as you can see these blocks that 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.579
 axes are ported all the time by this 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.109
 my comparator and so when serving 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.819
 short pulses nothing happens 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:53.109
 but what is hidden in these blocks 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:56.950
 open the enchant of about 50 that is, if 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:00.179
 the player will be the subject where 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.799
 enchantment 5 is scuba breathing 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.799
 enchanted level 0 then 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.760
 so this comparator we will show 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.690
 as soon as we give impulse here 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.930
 give you show 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.380
 picked up and this show like this 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.570
 Everything works here is the same with only 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.340
 bow 51 then infinity only on the bow 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:35.390
 can be imposed so about her and that i 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:40.230
 did the same thing here just with the ball 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.760
 21 I think this is looting 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.620
 in general, a simple scheme okay with you 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.210
 there was a forest and subscribe put huskies 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.210
 bye everyone
