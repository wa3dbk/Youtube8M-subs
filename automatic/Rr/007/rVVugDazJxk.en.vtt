00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
first group is 8 to 12 second group is

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.470 
first group is 8 to 12 second group is
12<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.640> 16<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:35.110> overlap<00:02:35.650> years<00:02:35.920> would<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.480> 15

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
12 to 16 the overlap years would be 15

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.339 
12 to 16 the overlap years would be 15
to<00:02:37.629> 16<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.379> 11<00:02:39.069> to<00:02:39.459> 12<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.510> 15<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.110> up<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
to 16 and 11 to 12 so 15 and up the

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.470 
to 16 and 11 to 12 so 15 and up the
senior<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:41.890> then<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.640> last<00:02:42.910> group<00:02:43.180> would<00:02:43.450> be

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
