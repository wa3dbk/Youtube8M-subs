00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.309
 speech that speaks is unique and in the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.130
 video of today we will go again as catch 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.210
 the phoenix than at tas in the case the ashes 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 of allah 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 yes I already showed this in the previous video 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.650
 and I take the sun again for the simple 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.500
 fact that that video is very 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.720
 exceeded in impractical and further by 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.130
 There is no way out of the room anymore. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.450
 what the hell 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.790
 You can not go out the door anymore. 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 As I taught, I was working a lot. 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.450
 it's worth doing that way then 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.329
 this video will be much faster and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
 You do not know which mount is this or not? 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 Do you know how to get there? 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.969
 see this video is on the nook tac 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.829
 it's the old video 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.210
 I teach how to get here when 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.190
 you come to the explanation part of the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.719
 fight you back to this beauty video and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.520
 If you're here just because you want to know 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.020
 what's the fight with then is still there 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.660
 when we arrive in the cell than at the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.340
 We'll attack him and run to the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 room background soon he will send 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.659
 those minions its a neat we killed 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.880
 the first two here in the background and so 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.770
 We killed the second we go. 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 run toward what is tas and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.119
 killed love now you can run here 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.729
 to the corner and we're going to kill the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.920
 last this little corner here will not do 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.299
 So much difference so team will only 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.130
 hide those who are there from the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.930
 background but anyway I like 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 kill him here then some of him here 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.670
 done, we have entered the phase of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.619
 Kill all weapons and if you play with a 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.710
 class that allows for the staff 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.560
 you can choose and use it or not 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.479
 you choose to use it team opens the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.369
 equipment window click on the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.630
 right on the staff and you go 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.119
 receive a new booth 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 it lasts 15 minutes and leaves you immune 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.619
 stunning silence them guiding in the 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.270
 previous video a person asked me 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.310
 in the comments why I did not 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.290
 I used the staff and I said it was to no 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.990
 pps lose but after this comment 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.149
 I thought maybe I thought maybe 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.860
 I was right and I decided to test it, huh? 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.659
 I'm going to give less than a year to 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.670
 each attack is an equipment with 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.950
 the inter took much smaller but like me 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.050
 I stayed very much these three things I finish 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.750
 getting beat much more often 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.640
 so in the end the staff can be better 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.560
 if you can use the staff I recommend 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.510
 done after a while all the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.770
 places will come together you can kill 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.380
 them in the sequence you think best 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.470
 but analyzing the video there using the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.780
 I see that I should have given 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.160
 preference in the blood when 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.290
 get closer because he lets you 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.330
 frightened of it and we do not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.860
 we are immune to the offer after you 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.200
 kill the four wait another good one 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.900
 time and what you 're going to get attacked 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.880
 At this time you can attack the pot. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.980
 you can change weapons or weapons if you 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.630
 can change in combat no problem 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.060
 so you choose whether to go back to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.800
 your weapon that deals a lot of damage or goes 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.690
 staying in the cajá cajá can still be 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.070
 helpful I stayed at the end until the staff 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.610
 easier to go the way you think 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.410
 best 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.110
 take the test and see how it looks best for 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.390
 you just have to remember throughout 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.160
 fight that is repeated in the case of months 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.470
 run out clone nor any thing 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.110
 of this kind is you avoid being controlled 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.900
 so the tas has perhaps the blizzard 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.820
 Changed that and begged for help. 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.040
 leaves more controlled does not contain a 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.080
 another player but I prefer not to 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.459
 to risk one more message taking advantage of 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.010
 that I'm talking about videos that I've already 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.780
 I did it for those who do not know the title Jacques 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.370
 can not be picked up the next time 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.320
 expansion so take advantage while still 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.150
 we are walking and picking up the title he 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.799
 It's quite simple to pick up if you have not yet 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.080
 You have a title that fell to you in this video. 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.459
 the corner where I explain how to pick it up 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.290
 this title I hope this 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.940
 video update has been more 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.040
 useful for the river that also tietê 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.110
 strategy is not very obvious is a touch of 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.090
 make a third video of it but then 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.519
 that's it people take the time to evaluate the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.739
 video if you liked what you saw and still 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.090
 not registered, type write 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.130
 also enjoy to enjoy our 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.850
 Facebook page to follow the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.980
 news 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.700

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.700
 to the next
