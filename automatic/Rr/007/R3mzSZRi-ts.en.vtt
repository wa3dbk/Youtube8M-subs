00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.060
 Hello 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.940
 We continue to test our oil lamp 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.000
 hot smoked 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.860
 Today I want to buy someone mackerel 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.360
 and day under 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:27.230
 inside the insides salted day on 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.829
 kilogram I took 80 grams of salt I her 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.829
 knit 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:35.059
 before smoking so that she 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:38.239
 the temperature did not fall apart now 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.960
 begin to smoke in general sawdust 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.920
 we poured one pinch 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:50.630
 that's enough go on take try either 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.090
 put up on top shelf quality 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.360
 heating up below i will use 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.950
 electric furnace 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:04.159
 ordinary inexpensive electric furnace to 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:07.390
 one and a half kilowatt will be it 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.390
 we will heat our sawdust 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:24.080
 we cover everything we will wait 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.610
 and notice the time smoked 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:35.440
 25 minutes is enough our stove heats 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.440
 little by little houses already gone 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:48.080
 flour do not detect half an hour see what 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.580
 get here a tautology us 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.110
 between times hot smoked trouble 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.970
 will pass 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.970
 the situation will be the computer becomes 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.330
 here the process continues 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.990
 20 minutes have passed I have not opened to him 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.990

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.819
 normal heat well, still let stand 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.849
