00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.750
 of cinema director of the cinema portal in 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.189
 scene and fund room videocast 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.540
 river festival day 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.780
 I was supposed to watch four more movies 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.299
 today but unfortunately it is the realm of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.730
 problems in projection on the river season one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.720
 in two consecutive sessions of the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.630
 one way is that the polish but was corrected and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 smell the second session timbuktu and if 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.510
 I really was already so tired 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.640
 so angry even with the mistakes 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.559
 sequential production would be neither 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.469
 fair with the film in that state of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.620
 spirit I stay so I left 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.660
 so watch only three kids today and I will 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 start talking about the worst of them that is the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 asian asia movie in understood 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 What is a movie that I changed? 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.719
 absolutely testable in all 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.390
 feel a thread in the film deeply 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.690
 hated is a movie about characters 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.520
 detestable in still unstable situations 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.160
 with a detestable narrative approach 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.339
 with song music and testable a 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.900
 end of testá veil is a movie that I 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.290
 I was so good I was delighted with 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.850
 It's hard and this is not to like 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.100
 a movie is common 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 now you feel the rage of the movie you want 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.810
 that the film could become a 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 person so you can punch him in the face 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.280
 This is rarer and I had this 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.799
 will understood 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.659
 is a film that under the excuse of plotting 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.900
 a study of characters about a 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.799
 girl who is misunderstood 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.620
 is the film simply creates a family 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.170
 absolutely monstrous eee 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.160
 and places the girl and the young actress in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.170
 situations that are situations 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.750
 absolutely despicable 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.480
 the movie is a movie without and without 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.980
 sorry for existing is a movie that has 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.840
 even an interesting photo but 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.600
 it is also a photograph that neither 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.250
 complements narrative 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.030
 ironic through your most 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.760
 strong and almost fabulesco is as I said 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.110
 a movie that the eighth and 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.530
 irritants 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.480
 the songs are deeply itans and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.030
 really a point where even when 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.890
 I was trying to make fun I have already 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.210
 although it had to one or two times 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.610
 in the first minutes 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.710
 I have felt unable to continue 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.080
 laugh at the movie because I hate the 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.700
 people click die all inclusive 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.190
 the young problems 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.650
 It's a movie really and what I 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.590
 I began to despise deeply not only 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.360
 was the going is the Polish movie I remember 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.500
 to see the candidate from Poland the oscar 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.770
 2014 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.970
 it's a film shot in black and white 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.680
 with an aspect ratio of 11 and 37 with 1 04 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.550
 billion almost square format more 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.230
 traditional almost stand-out gym and that is 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.970
 a very interesting film that takes place 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.850
 in the 60's that accompanies a girl 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.760
 who is about to take the votes of 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.250
 celibacy for becoming a nun and 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.570
 but before that the mother of the convent asks 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 that she visits the only relative still 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.640
 live and this girl then discovers that it is 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.459
 Jews that her parents died during the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.459
 the war is and she is your aunt 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.100
 they leave in search of where the parents 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.100
 this girl then sang buried in a 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.290
 oppressive film and this presence of young 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.050
 it must be guided not only by the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.940
 black and white photography and at 37 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.459
 by one that creates a much more 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.140
 with Formica but also a decision to 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.850
 Very interesting composition wants 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.220
 He said he respected fully respect 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.620
 the rule of texts is to keep 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.570
 always look at the initial text of the frame and 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.460
 unlike this area of ​​this convention 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.980
 the characters are always located 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.990
 below the plane then this causes 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.020
 they stay is is small incomplete and and 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.640
 and how to carry them on their 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:01.280
 back the weight of that european history 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.040
 war and the weight of the tragedy of their 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.050
 ancestors is a film really is that 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.350
 it was not nice of course but the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.150
 purpose is just a movie 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.930
 which has an interpretation of the 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.890
 young actress is that it is even a 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.850
 very good interpretation but I do not know 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.220
 to what extent can the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.550
 interpretation is good or construction 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.710
 around apple and up to 3 in a college 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:34.280
 neighbor of the college effect of it 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:37.490
 makes a storm feel like 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.650
 movie is the garbage boy 's suit is a 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.070
 movie that turned 12 years old I 'm not mistaken 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.980
 with a little boy until that boy and 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.960
 become a young adult and every year he 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.640
 filming a little bit and telling the 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.550
 story of this boy over the years 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.580
 and a child, if that's all it would be 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.540
 only this kimik in this strategy to roll 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.390
 the film 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.580
 this would not necessarily generate a good 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.160
 movie is a michael winterbottom movie 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.690
 that I enter beckham at the age of 23 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.260
 did this on a smaller scale will 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.490
 follow the characters 45 years and 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.660
 people see these children growing up 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:18.500
 little has the anp series 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.310
 then it is not particularly 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.200
 Original is original in the sense that 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.240
 as a whole and uploads a movie only 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.430
 a series of films with the children of 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.530
 michael apted 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.150
 but for example the dress movie and 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.460
 cleiton is much better than the sound of 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.919
 inter account and this is due to the fact 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.270
 that there is a story behind a 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.190
 narrative construction that is very 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.820
 delicate not only the company 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.780
 yemeni year 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.780

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:57.710
 I had I was watching a road movie in 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:59.750
 the road was the time and from time to 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.490
 Times we stopped as a whole come 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.180
 know some characters some 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.530
 situations and move on 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.470
 This is very beautiful, you watch 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.150

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.660
 it becomes universal you become 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.720

 things happen is the movie is a 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:51.410
