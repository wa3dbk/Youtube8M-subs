but I like the paint scheme because it's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.780 
but I like the paint scheme because it's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
not like crazy the main colors like a

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.630 
not like crazy the main colors like a
Walker's<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.869> say<00:01:28.049> are<00:01:28.640> blue

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
Walker's when you would say are blue

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.319 
Walker's when you would say are blue
white<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> red<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> those<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> main

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
white and red so those are the main

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.539 
white and red so those are the main
colors<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.470> other<00:01:34.770> colors<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.369> here

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549

colors there's other colors on here
green<00:01:36.420> yellow<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.600> think<00:01:39.600> there's<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> little

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
green yellow and think there's a little

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.109 
green yellow and think there's a little
bit<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.079> black<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> that's<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
bit of black so that's pretty much it

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.039 
bit of black so that's pretty much it
