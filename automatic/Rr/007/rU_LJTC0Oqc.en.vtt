explaining<00:00:45.149> how<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.420> works<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.399> firstly

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
explaining how this works so firstly

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.080 
explaining how this works so firstly
this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.770> fishing<00:00:50.219> rod<00:00:50.370> renamed<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

this is just a fishing rod renamed a
grappling<00:00:51.390> hook<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> texture

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
grappling hook and this is a texture

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.099 
grappling hook and this is a texture
pack<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:55.170> brother's<00:00:55.920> been<00:00:56.190> working<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
pack that my brother's been working on

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
pack that my brother's been working on
so<00:00:58.109> he<00:00:58.440> has<00:00:58.680> retextured<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> bunch<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> things

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so he has retextured a bunch of things

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
so he has retextured a bunch of things
and<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> items<00:01:02.809> now<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.229> way

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
and that is one of the items now the way

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410 
and that is one of the items now the way
this<00:01:04.470> works<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:05.250> interesting<00:01:05.729> uses<00:01:06.390> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
is at the the fishing rod bobber

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.850 
is at the the fishing rod bobber
whatever<00:02:38.740> it<00:02:38.860> finds<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:40.000> will<00:02:40.300> clone<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.350> into

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
whatever it finds it will clone it into

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.330 
whatever it finds it will clone it into
a<00:02:41.890> specified<00:02:42.730> region<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.390> into<00:02:43.810> this<00:02:44.340> block

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
a specified region so into this block

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.910 
a specified region so into this block
right<00:02:45.370> here<00:02:46.050> so<00:02:47.050> clones<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.440> right<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.740> there

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
right here so clones it right to there

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.460 
right here so clones it right to there
and<00:02:48.100> then<00:02:48.270> what<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.360> does<00:02:49.510> after<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.380> be

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
and then what it does after that to be

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.520 
and then what it does after that to be
able<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.710> detect<00:02:51.160> which<00:02:51.640> block<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.420> if<00:02:52.720> it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
able to detect which block it is if it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.900 
able to detect which block it is if it
is<00:02:53.560> either<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.400> ladder<00:02:54.760> or<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.090> vine<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.560> will<00:02:57.130> use

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
is either a ladder or a vine it will use

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.680 
is either a ladder or a vine it will use
a<00:02:57.940> fill<00:02:58.600> command<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.410> replace<00:02:59.890> only<00:03:00.880> vines<00:03:01.390> and

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
a fill command to replace only vines and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.290 
a fill command to replace only vines and
ladders<00:03:02.350> directly<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.640> spot<00:03:03.940> with<00:03:04.270> a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
ladders directly in the spot with a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.420 
ladders directly in the spot with a
redstone<00:03:04.840> block<00:03:05.170> causing<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:05.980> activate

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
redstone block causing it to activate

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.930 
redstone block causing it to activate
the<00:03:06.610> rest<00:03:06.790> of<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> what<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:08.920> does<00:03:09.190> this

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the rest of the so what this does this

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.050 
the rest of the so what this does this
one<00:03:10.120> just<00:03:10.450> automatically<00:03:11.200> clears<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.910> that

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
one just automatically clears it so that

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.220 
one just automatically clears it so that
there's<00:03:13.240> no<00:03:13.300> more<00:03:13.480> redstone<00:03:13.630> block<00:03:13.990> there

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
there's no more redstone block there

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.670 
there's no more redstone block there
then<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.280> one<00:03:15.490> gets<00:03:15.700> activated<00:03:16.090> next<00:03:16.930> which

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
then this one gets activated next which

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620 
then this one gets activated next which
teleports<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.370> player<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.030> grappling

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
teleports the player to the grappling

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.050 
teleports the player to the grappling
hook<00:03:19.840> or<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:21.240> fishing<00:03:22.240> rod<00:03:22.270> bobber<00:03:24.060> nextly

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
hook or to the fishing rod bobber nextly

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.130 
hook or to the fishing rod bobber nextly
what<00:03:25.540> it<00:03:25.630> does<00:03:25.750> after<00:03:25.960> that<00:03:26.290> is<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:27.760> actually

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
what it does after that is it actually

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.520 
what it does after that is it actually
kills<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:30.100> fishing<00:03:30.550> rod<00:03:30.610> bobber<00:03:30.970> with<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.230> ID

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
kills the fishing rod bobber with the ID

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.270 
kills the fishing rod bobber with the ID
of<00:03:32.680> one<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:34.410> that's<00:03:35.410> pretty<00:03:35.620> much<00:03:35.740> how<00:03:36.010> that

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
of one and that's pretty much how that

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.700 
of one and that's pretty much how that
works<00:03:36.550> so<00:03:37.420> I'll<00:03:37.540> show<00:03:37.630> with<00:03:38.050> ladders<00:03:38.380> as<00:03:38.530> well

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
works so I'll show with ladders as well

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.670 
works so I'll show with ladders as well
and<00:03:39.570> this<00:03:40.570> will<00:03:40.720> work<00:03:40.870> anywhere<00:03:41.080> in<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.560> world

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
and this will work anywhere in the world

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.130 
and this will work anywhere in the world
as<00:03:41.920> long<00:03:42.070> as<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.490> in<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.730> spawn<00:03:42.970> chunks

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
as long as this is in the spawn chunks

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.630 
as long as this is in the spawn chunks
now<00:03:44.140> what<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.440> also<00:03:44.590> does<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.190> works<00:03:45.400> for

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
now what it also does is it works for

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.820 
now what it also does is it works for
items<00:03:46.060> too<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.690> if<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:46.870> have<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.110> bunch<00:03:47.530> of<00:03:47.650> items

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
items too so if I have a bunch of items

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.860 
items too so if I have a bunch of items
on<00:03:48.100> the<00:03:48.190> ground<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.880> will<00:03:49.060> also<00:03:49.270> grab<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
on the ground you will also grab the

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.070 
on the ground you will also grab the
item<00:03:50.670> using<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.910> same<00:03:52.090> basic<00:03:52.450> system<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:52.990> you

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
item using the same basic system so you

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.980 
item using the same basic system so you
can<00:03:53.260> see<00:03:53.410> here<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.830> get<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.820> item<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.780> reels

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
can see here I get the item and it reels

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.360 
can see here I get the item and it reels
it<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.470> works<00:03:59.709> basically<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.250> same

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
it in so this works basically the same

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.510 
it in so this works basically the same
way<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.610> or<00:04:01.000> kind<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.980> the<00:04:03.100> first<00:04:03.310> thing<00:04:03.370> it

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520 
way to or kind of so the first thing it

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.730 
way to or kind of so the first thing it
does<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.820> it<00:04:04.270> does<00:04:04.600> an<00:04:04.780> execute<00:04:05.200> command<00:04:05.560> at

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
does is it does an execute command at

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.949 
does is it does an execute command at
the<00:04:06.750> fishing<00:04:07.750> rod<00:04:07.900> bobber<00:04:09.330> then<00:04:10.330> what<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.840> does

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
the fishing rod bobber then what it does

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.740 
the fishing rod bobber then what it does
right<00:04:11.200> after<00:04:11.500> that<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:12.700> does<00:04:12.850> another<00:04:13.270> execute

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
right after that it does another execute

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.260 
right after that it does another execute
command<00:04:14.050> at<00:04:14.200> a<00:04:14.560> item<00:04:14.890> within<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.550> radius<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:16.000> 0

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
command at a item within a radius of 0

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:22.080 
command at a item within a radius of 0
and<00:04:18.299> then<00:04:19.299> it<00:04:19.510> does<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:20.520> set<00:04:21.520> block<00:04:21.760> command

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
and then it does a set block command

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.340 
and then it does a set block command
from<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.690> item<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:24.070> set<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.880> redstone<00:04:25.330> block

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
from that item to set a redstone block

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.090 
from that item to set a redstone block
actly<00:04:26.500> above<00:04:27.220> this<00:04:27.460> one<00:04:27.700> here<00:04:28.770> then<00:04:29.770> right

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
actly above this one here then right

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.300 
actly above this one here then right
after<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.730> activates<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.600> one<00:04:32.310> which

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
after that it activates this one which

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.400 
after that it activates this one which
will<00:04:33.550> teleport<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.270> item<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.960> the<00:04:34.990> player

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
will teleport the item to the player

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.820 
will teleport the item to the player
from<00:04:35.800> there<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:37.450> if<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.720> execute<00:04:38.020> commands<00:04:38.560> to

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
from there so if you execute commands to

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.670 
from there so if you execute commands to
be<00:04:38.950> able<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.190> do<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.780> because<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.380> set

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
be able to do it and because the set

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.920 
be able to do it and because the set
block<00:04:41.890> command<00:04:42.220> takes<00:04:42.490> one<00:04:43.270> game<00:04:43.600> tick<00:04:43.780> of

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
block command takes one game tick of

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.600 
block command takes one game tick of
delay<00:04:44.140> whereas<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.590> teleport<00:04:45.040> is<00:04:45.160> instant

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
delay whereas the teleport is instant

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.470 
delay whereas the teleport is instant
even<00:04:46.330> though<00:04:46.420> this<00:04:46.600> one<00:04:46.810> activates<00:04:47.380> first

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
even though this one activates first

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.410 
even though this one activates first
this<00:04:49.480> one<00:04:49.780> will<00:04:50.080> get<00:04:50.520> will<00:04:51.520> actually<00:04:51.940> teleport

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
this one will get will actually teleport
