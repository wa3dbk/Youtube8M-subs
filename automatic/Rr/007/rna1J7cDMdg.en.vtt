00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.500
 I bring a new one a new review of 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.500
 a map that a subscriber has passed me 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.969
 and good has made me use that text 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.969
 for that of art exhibit and 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.750
 and we are not going to use well, this is the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.820
 home I'm using sanders but good that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.700
 does not have that this mom created by 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.950
 mysterious to use if possible and text 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.670
 a pack of that artest for me good 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.309
 these texts added me because the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.830
 little boy had they had 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.940
 forgotten to put them but good the salts 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.940
 with this armor 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.610
 yes 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.500
 you are with being more doubt and good we go 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.600
 to look at the house I liked the 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.330
 admittedly small but cozy as yet 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.810
 it is not small it is spacious and cozy 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.810
 the truth 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.760
 here would be the room of the chests by 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.920
 say it somehow 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.479
 here you have this 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.479
 here you have this 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.860
 good and look at the buy you 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.400
 is that if you are not going to give me a lot of smell 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 ah 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.870
 well let's go here we have 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.990
 we had the 2002 trapdoor and 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.930
 we have a mine that is to the bottom 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.300
 of the map and good the truth and researched 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.230
 and it's pretty well made it has 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.660
 distributed everything very well 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.670
 let's go around here and there's like a 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.710
 kind of fountain or waterfall 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.490
 produce it some way there is everything 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.490
 water and this water here and all that 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.490
 highlight 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.820
 and we have like these 200 that I like the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.820
 true this is your link this decoration 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.530
 now thinking a little bit of the 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:21.290
 well we went out here 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.290
 the time what the fuck 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.420
 I am, I am fighting, we have 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.640
 the 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.880
 how to say the farm good but of 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.880
 some way 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.010
 we do those if we enter and have here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.480
 the farm with everything 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.730
 and one thing that I have seen that is missing is that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.730
 no crops is one thing that 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.360
 before I say it before half opening a mouth 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.590
 Well I can say that this map has made 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.410
 the least I've done everything 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.360
 creative or be creative forgiveness that I have not 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.530
 done nothing creative about everything has been 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.210
 of survival and good but the last 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.340
 retouching such as putting the 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.320
 animals that has made him creative and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.450
 when you get into the seed is in 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.970
 creative but only for that subject as well 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.510
 everything is normal 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.850
