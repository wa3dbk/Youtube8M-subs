to<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.550> box<00:00:20.910> top<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.480> check<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> fold<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
to a box top you can check the fold of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.779 
to a box top you can check the fold of
the<00:00:22.230> week<00:00:22.350> archive<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.980> check<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> box<00:00:23.519> top

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the week archive to check out a box top

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.130 
the week archive to check out a box top
but<00:00:24.710> basically<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.890> way<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:26.250> work<00:00:26.310> is

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
but basically the way that these work is

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
but basically the way that these work is
the<00:00:28.140> panels<00:00:28.470> all<00:00:28.619> fold<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.070> from<00:00:29.609> each<00:00:29.760> side

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
the panels all fold in from each side

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.959 
the panels all fold in from each side
but<00:00:30.539> they're<00:00:30.720> short<00:00:31.399> so<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.759> Iron

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
but they're short so I'm like an Iron

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.190 
but they're short so I'm like an Iron
Cross<00:00:33.180> where<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> panels<00:00:33.930> would<00:00:34.050> be

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
Cross where the panels would be

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.670 
Cross where the panels would be
full-length<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:36.210> backstop<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.410> petal

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
full-length the backstop and the petal

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.340 
full-length the backstop and the petal
fold<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> short<00:00:38.989> panel<00:00:39.989> this

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
fold I actually have a short panel this

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.690 
fold I actually have a short panel this
one<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.040> tab<00:00:41.219> I'm<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> take

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
one is a little tab I'm going to take

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.119 
one is a little tab I'm going to take
that<00:00:41.820> off<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.739> characteristic<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> box

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that off but the characteristic of a box

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
that off but the characteristic of a box
top<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.210> panel's<00:00:45.570> fold<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
top is that the panel's fold in and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.510 
top is that the panel's fold in and
overlap<00:00:46.469> each<00:00:46.680> other<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> last

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
overlap each other and then that last

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840 
overlap each other and then that last
panel<00:00:48.090> tucks<00:00:48.390> under<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.920> first<00:00:50.190> panel<00:00:50.610> kind

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
panel tucks under the first panel kind

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.340 
panel tucks under the first panel kind
of<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.329> fold<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> top<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of like you would fold the top of a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920 
of like you would fold the top of a
cardboard<00:00:52.620> box<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.309> close<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.690> reason

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
cardboard box to close it so the reason

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.290 
cardboard box to close it so the reason
this<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.079> called<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.440> petal<00:00:55.620> fold<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this is called a petal fold is that the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
this is called a petal fold is that the
panels<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.750> rounded<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
panels are rounded and so it's kind of a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.880 
panels are rounded and so it's kind of a
flower<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.670> appearance<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.660> its<00:01:00.930> opening<00:01:01.500> on
