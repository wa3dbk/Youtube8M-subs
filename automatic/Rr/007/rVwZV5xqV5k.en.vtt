this<00:00:02.399> is<00:00:02.610> just<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:02.970> beginning<00:00:04.700> of<00:00:05.700> what

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.379 

infestation<00:00:10.200> by<00:00:10.469> small<00:00:11.460> hive<00:00:11.700> beetle<00:00:11.730> larvae

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
infestation by small hive beetle larvae

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.570 
infestation by small hive beetle larvae
looks<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:13.370> comb<00:00:14.370> gets<00:00:14.670> kind<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.299> slimy<00:00:16.580> slick

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
looks like comb gets kind of slimy slick

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.220 
looks like comb gets kind of slimy slick
looking<00:00:17.970> shiny

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.450 

and<00:00:26.230> then<00:00:26.470> there'll<00:00:26.710> be<00:00:26.740> this

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.750 

but<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.789> allowed<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> carry<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:37.760> these

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
but this is allowed to carry on these

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.139 
but this is allowed to carry on these
larvae<00:00:39.239> will<00:00:39.420> spread<00:00:39.780> over<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:42.480> whole<00:00:42.510> comb

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
larvae will spread over the whole comb

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.930 
larvae will spread over the whole comb
and<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:46.530> whole<00:00:46.710> comb<00:00:47.010> will<00:00:47.159> look<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.489> slimy

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
and the whole comb will look all slimy

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.840 
and the whole comb will look all slimy
and<00:00:48.149> gooey<00:00:49.100> they're<00:00:50.100> starting<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.519> spread

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and gooey they're starting to spread

and gooey they're starting to spread
here<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.269> this<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.979> this<00:00:52.979> is<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.159> honey<00:00:54.030> super

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
here on this one this is a honey super

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.180 
here on this one this is a honey super
they're<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.250> starting<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.030> into<00:00:57.390> I

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
they're just starting to get into I

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.009 
they're just starting to get into I
found<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> couple<00:00:59.549> of<00:00:59.789> actual<00:01:00.449> small<00:01:00.750> high

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
found a couple of actual small high

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.979 
found a couple of actual small high
beetles<00:01:01.940> crawling<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.089> a<00:01:03.119> comb<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.750> box

not quite enough bees to protect it but

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.090 
not quite enough bees to protect it but

any usable honey they eat into the comb

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
any usable honey they eat into the comb

concentrated infestation of these will

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.170 
concentrated infestation of these will
actually<00:02:03.440> just<00:02:03.950> chase<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.430> bees<00:02:04.640> from<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
actually just chase the bees from the

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.030 
actually just chase the bees from the
hive<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:09.110> course<00:02:09.380> normally<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:12.470> has<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.890> be<00:02:13.010> a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
hive of course normally it has to be a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:27.320 
hive of course normally it has to be a
weak-eyed<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.790> begin<00:02:14.090> with

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.140 

notice<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.230> B<00:02:28.470> isn't<00:02:28.950> chewing<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.700> those

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:48.830 

it's<00:02:33.150> actually<00:02:33.450> cleaning

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.820 

I've<00:02:49.770> seen<00:02:50.099> these<00:02:50.750> also<00:02:51.750> crawling<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
I've seen these also crawling to the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.589 
I've seen these also crawling to the
bottom<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.370> hatch<00:02:53.550> out<00:02:53.819> from<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.120> bottom<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
bottom or hatch out from the bottom of

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.940 
bottom or hatch out from the bottom of
cells<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.340> brood<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:57.290> weak<00:02:58.290> hives<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.770> I've

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
cells of brood and weak hives that I've

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
cells of brood and weak hives that I've
cut<00:02:59.220> out<00:02:59.390> because<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.599> larvae<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> pupae

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
cut out because the larvae the pupae

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.290 
cut out because the larvae the pupae
seems<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> protein<00:03:02.730> source<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.180> that's

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
seems to be a protein source and that's

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.240 
seems to be a protein source and that's
all<00:03:03.540> they<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:03.900> it's<00:03:04.170> not<00:03:04.319> necessarily<00:03:05.040> just

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
all they need it's not necessarily just

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.610 
all they need it's not necessarily just
honey<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.660> high<00:03:06.780> beetles<00:03:07.260> will<00:03:07.440> hatch

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
honey that the high beetles will hatch

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.100 
honey that the high beetles will hatch
their<00:03:07.920> eggs<00:03:07.950> out<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:09.450> larvae<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:09.840> grow

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
their eggs out in the larvae can grow

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.930 
their eggs out in the larvae can grow
from<00:03:10.349> they<00:03:10.590> lay<00:03:10.769> their<00:03:10.950> eggs<00:03:11.130> any<00:03:11.430> place<00:03:11.730> could

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
from they lay their eggs any place could

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.640 
from they lay their eggs any place could
can<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.239> protein<00:03:12.660> source<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.319> larvae

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
can be a protein source so the larvae

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:22.710 
can be a protein source so the larvae
can<00:03:13.680> grow<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.220> survive

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.020 

in<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.710> odd<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.220> would<00:03:24.340> think<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.910> would

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
in it odd you would think that it would

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.990 
in it odd you would think that it would
be<00:03:25.740> doing<00:03:26.740> something<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.310> larva<00:03:27.850> other

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
be doing something to that larva other

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.899 
be doing something to that larva other
than<00:03:28.210> just<00:03:28.360> licking<00:03:28.570> honey<00:03:28.840> off<00:03:29.050> of<00:03:29.260> it

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:55.550 

I<00:03:37.939> think<00:03:38.420> they'd<00:03:38.599> be<00:03:38.750> attacking<00:03:39.290> them

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.270 

there<00:03:56.130> they<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:57.770> soon<00:03:58.770> I<00:03:58.920> cover<00:03:59.190> that

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
there they have it soon I cover that

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.820 
there they have it soon I cover that
whole<00:03:59.550> comb
