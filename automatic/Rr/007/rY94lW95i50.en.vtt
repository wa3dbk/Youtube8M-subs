00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.629 
this year's e3 well I've been at work I
pondered<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.610> pondered<00:00:09.059> about<00:00:09.150> III<00:00:09.750> I

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
pondered and I pondered about III I

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.009 
pondered and I pondered about III I
listened<00:00:11.639> again<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.269> can't<00:00:12.480> really<00:00:12.630> watch<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
listened again I can't really watch the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.749 
listened again I can't really watch the
river<00:00:13.170> by<00:00:13.440> listening<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> conferences

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
river by listening to the conferences

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.910 
river by listening to the conferences
and<00:00:15.120> listened<00:00:15.839> everything<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.320> said

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.759 

and<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.010> gotta<00:00:20.220> say<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.689> this<00:00:22.109> III<00:00:22.740> just

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
and I gotta say I think this III just

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.849 
and I gotta say I think this III just
shows<00:00:23.310> how<00:00:26.210> safe<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.720> three<00:00:28.080> companies<00:00:28.380> are

right now for a lot of developers it's

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.920 
right now for a lot of developers it's
still<00:05:02.130> just<00:05:02.370> a<00:05:02.520> better<00:05:02.760> option<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.510> develop

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
still just a better option to develop

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.500 
still just a better option to develop
for<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.380> last<00:05:04.590> gen<00:05:04.830> consoles<00:05:05.310> xbox<00:05:05.490> 360<00:05:06.330> and

there in the market if you are developer
what<00:05:16.590> would<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:16.770> develop<00:05:17.039> for<00:05:17.220> a<00:05:17.520> platform

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
what would you develop for a platform

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.690 
what would you develop for a platform
that<00:05:18.300> already<00:05:18.780> has<00:05:18.990> over<00:05:19.260> 60<00:05:20.160> million<00:05:20.430> out

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
develop for both platforms at the same

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.640 
develop for both platforms at the same
time<00:05:31.919> but<00:05:32.220> in<00:05:33.000> today's<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:34.169> know<00:05:34.289> gaming

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
market a lot of people can't afford to

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.040 
market a lot of people can't afford to
develop<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.590> more<00:05:37.800> than<00:05:37.979> one<00:05:38.190> platform<00:05:39.050> two

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
develop a more than one platform two

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.930 
develop a more than one platform two
platforms<00:05:40.349> are<00:05:40.710> the<00:05:40.770> same<00:05:40.950> generation<00:05:41.370> yeah

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
platforms are the same generation yeah

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.219 
platforms are the same generation yeah
yeah<00:05:42.900> they<00:05:43.110> can<00:05:43.260> do<00:05:43.380> that<00:05:43.590> but<00:05:43.830> as<00:05:43.950> far<00:05:44.039> as<00:05:45.229> you

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
yeah they can do that but as far as you

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.469 
yeah they can do that but as far as you
know<00:05:46.349> three<00:05:46.740> or<00:05:46.770> four<00:05:47.130> that's<00:05:47.520> for<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.060> lot<00:05:48.360> of

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
know three or four that's for a lot of

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.269 
know three or four that's for a lot of
developers<00:05:48.900> that's<00:05:49.139> just<00:05:49.349> out

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279

anyway guys that's my final thoughts on
this<00:05:54.740> year's<00:05:55.009> e3<00:05:56.319> just<00:05:57.319> a<00:05:58.330> see<00:05:59.330> all<00:05:59.689> across<00:06:00.229> the

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:00.439 
this year's e3 just a see all across the

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.730 
this year's e3 just a see all across the
board<00:06:00.819> now<00:06:01.819> I<00:06:01.849> know<00:06:01.999> before<00:06:02.300> I<00:06:02.509> did<00:06:02.930> say<00:06:03.199> that<00:06:03.469> I

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
board now I know before I did say that I

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.309 
board now I know before I did say that I
think<00:06:04.309> maybe<00:06:04.400> soda<00:06:04.819> got<00:06:05.029> a<00:06:05.059> C+<00:06:05.689> and<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.169> other

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
think maybe soda got a C+ and the other

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.339 
think maybe soda got a C+ and the other
two<00:06:06.559> got<00:06:06.800> maybe<00:06:07.039> a<00:06:07.159> C<00:06:07.490> or<00:06:07.520> C<00:06:07.879> minus<00:06:08.150> but<00:06:08.900> as<00:06:09.110> I

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
two got maybe a C or C minus but as I

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.200 
two got maybe a C or C minus but as I
you<00:06:09.650> know<00:06:09.770> listen<00:06:10.279> to<00:06:10.309> everything<00:06:10.550> once<00:06:10.849> again

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
you know listen to everything once again

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.769 
you know listen to everything once again
I<00:06:11.680> say<00:06:12.680> they<00:06:12.919> all<00:06:13.129> did<00:06:13.610> about<00:06:13.999> the<00:06:14.029> same<00:06:14.240> in

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
I say they all did about the same in

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.950 
I say they all did about the same in
different<00:06:14.839> categories<00:06:16.180> but<00:06:17.180> as<00:06:17.509> far<00:06:17.900> as

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
different categories but as far as

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.719 
different categories but as far as
scoring<00:06:18.469> wise<00:06:18.559> they'll<00:06:18.979> come<00:06:19.219> out<00:06:19.370> to<00:06:19.580> just

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
scoring wise they'll come out to just

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.610 
scoring wise they'll come out to just
the<00:06:19.909> see<00:06:20.150> an<00:06:20.499> average<00:06:21.499> an<00:06:21.830> average<00:06:21.949> score<00:06:22.490> in<00:06:23.620> a

C<00:06:24.919> in<00:06:25.189> a<00:06:25.639> place<00:06:25.879> like<00:06:25.999> Texas<00:06:26.800> isn't<00:06:27.800> that<00:06:27.830> great

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
C in a place like Texas isn't that great

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:30.969 
C in a place like Texas isn't that great
a<00:06:28.460> see<00:06:28.789> is<00:06:29.029> just<00:06:29.270> barely<00:06:29.539> passing<00:06:30.139> because<00:06:30.830> out

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
a see is just barely passing because out

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.379 
a see is just barely passing because out
here<00:06:31.059> addy<00:06:32.059> is<00:06:32.389> failing<00:06:33.879> so<00:06:34.879> all<00:06:35.149> the

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
here addy is failing so all the

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
companies are very close to failure this

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.899 
companies are very close to failure this
year<00:06:37.819> hopefully<00:06:38.809> next<00:06:39.409> year<00:06:39.699> after<00:06:40.699> all<00:06:40.819> the

mainstream stuff is out of the way we

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.799
