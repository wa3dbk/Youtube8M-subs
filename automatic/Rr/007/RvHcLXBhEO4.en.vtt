this<00:00:43.050> Metrodome<00:00:43.440> works<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.239> it's<00:00:45.239> got<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this Metrodome works is it's got the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.819 
this Metrodome works is it's got the
power<00:00:45.989> switch<00:00:46.289> right<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.710> turn<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
power switch right here you just turn it

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
power switch right here you just turn it
on<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.250> now<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> metronome<00:00:51.600> setting

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
on and now I'm on the metronome setting

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.099 
on and now I'm on the metronome setting
this<00:00:53.070> also<00:00:53.579> has<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.440> volume<00:00:55.440> control<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
this also has a volume control and you

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.539 
this also has a volume control and you
just<00:01:01.649> simply<00:01:01.920> change<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.760> speed<00:01:04.100> by<00:01:05.100> turning

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
just simply change the speed by turning

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:14.179 
just simply change the speed by turning
the<00:01:05.670> dial<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:13.530> what<00:01:13.770> another

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the dial like so then what another

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
the dial like so then what another
really<00:01:14.610> nifty<00:01:14.790> feature<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.689> metronome

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
really nifty feature of this metronome

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.060 
really nifty feature of this metronome
is<00:01:17.330> that<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.509> got<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.020> beat<00:01:19.320> feature<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
is that it's got the beat feature and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.719 
is that it's got the beat feature and
what<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.970> does<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.810> gives<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.380> a

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
what that does is that gives you a

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
what that does is that gives you a
emphasis<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> downbeat<00:01:24.740> depending<00:01:25.740> on

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
emphasis for the downbeat depending on

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
emphasis for the downbeat depending on
the<00:01:25.950> meter<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.549> piece<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:27.720> has<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the meter of your piece this has got a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.170 
the meter of your piece this has got a
zero<00:01:28.619> setting<00:01:29.130> which<00:01:29.340> means<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:29.970> off

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
zero setting which means that it's off

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.980 
zero setting which means that it's off
and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.259> goes<00:01:31.470> from<00:01:31.799> 2<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.759> 6<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.960> let's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and then it goes from 2 up to 6 so let's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.340 
and then it goes from 2 up to 6 so let's
see<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:34.500> playing<00:01:34.799> something<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.400> 3/4<00:01:35.939> time

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
see you're playing something in 3/4 time

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.350 
see you're playing something in 3/4 time
you<00:01:37.350> would<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:37.950> set<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> 3<00:01:39.869> and

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
you would just set this on the 3 and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.300 
you would just set this on the 3 and
we'll<00:01:42.360> turn<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.259> hear<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:47.840> and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
we'll turn it up so you can hear it and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
we'll turn it up so you can hear it and
as<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.640> hear<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.329> gives<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.720> different

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
as you can hear it gives a different

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.830 
as you can hear it gives a different
pitch<00:01:52.549> for<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> downbeat<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> each<00:01:54.420> measure

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
pitch for the downbeat of each measure

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.370 
pitch for the downbeat of each measure
so<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.950> use<00:01:56.100> this<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.520> many<00:01:56.670> meters<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:58.110> 4

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
so you can use this in many meters to 4

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.480 
so you can use this in many meters to 4
times<00:01:58.649> 3/4<00:01:59.899> 4/4<00:02:00.899> time<00:02:01.070> even<00:02:02.070> something<00:02:02.340> like

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
times 3/4 4/4 time even something like

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
times 3/4 4/4 time even something like
6/8<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.509> would<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.469> 6<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.140 

let's<00:02:16.510> shut<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.020> off<00:02:17.080> for<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.250> then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
let's shut that off for now and then

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.080 
let's shut that off for now and then
this<00:02:19.540> metronome<00:02:20.170> has<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.070> built<00:02:21.520> in<00:02:21.760> a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
this metronome has a built in a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
this metronome has a built in a
chromatic<00:02:22.930> pitch<00:02:23.860> generator<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:25.570> we<00:02:25.930> just

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
chromatic pitch generator so we just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.059 
chromatic pitch generator so we just
turn<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.500> sound<00:02:26.980> here<00:02:27.490> turn<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> volume<00:02:28.600> up

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.420 

and<00:02:31.189> here<00:02:31.909> we<00:02:32.060> have<00:02:32.239> an<00:02:32.359> a<00:02:32.599> 440<00:02:33.409> now<00:02:34.159> you<00:02:34.219> can

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
and here we have an a 440 now you can

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.699 
and here we have an a 440 now you can
adjust<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.139> playing

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
adjust that so that it's playing

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.449 
adjust that so that it's playing
anywhere<00:02:37.099> from<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.430> 440<00:02:38.150> up<00:02:38.359> to<00:02:38.629> a<00:02:38.859> 445<00:02:39.859> some

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
anywhere from a 440 up to a 445 some

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.759 
anywhere from a 440 up to a 445 some
people<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:40.969> to<00:02:40.999> tune<00:02:41.329> a<00:02:41.359> little<00:02:41.689> sharp<00:02:42.019> and

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
people like to tune a little sharp and

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.069 
people like to tune a little sharp and
you<00:02:42.920> just<00:02:43.129> simply<00:02:43.370> move<00:02:43.849> this<00:02:44.090> switch<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:47.079> it

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
you just simply move this switch and it

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.289 
you just simply move this switch and it
will<00:02:48.200> change<00:02:48.469> it<00:02:48.680> from<00:02:48.859> 440<00:02:49.670> all<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:50.090> way<00:02:50.209> up

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
will change it from 440 all the way up

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:56.099 
will change it from 440 all the way up
to<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> 445<00:02:51.469> and<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.900> back<00:02:54.170> down<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.439> a<00:02:54.680> 440

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
to a 445 and then back down to a 440

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.809 
to a 445 and then back down to a 440
this<00:02:57.109> one<00:02:57.349> also<00:02:57.650> look<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:59.090> just<00:03:00.700> turn<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
this one also look you just turn the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.570 
this one also look you just turn the
volume<00:03:01.969> up<00:03:02.329> here

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
volume up here

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.720 
volume up here
move<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.390> dial<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.870> change<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.380> pitch

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730
