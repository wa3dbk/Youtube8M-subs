me something else yeah that's a cheat

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.530 
me something else yeah that's a cheat
code<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.979> order<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.400> change<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.880> music<00:01:42.000> we're

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
code in order to change the music we're

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.940 
code in order to change the music we're
gonna<00:01:42.659> take<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.259> track<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.710> only

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
gonna take this one track if only

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950 
gonna take this one track if only
because<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.520> haven't<00:01:44.670> heard<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.689> long

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
because we haven't heard it in a long

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.749 
because we haven't heard it in a long
time<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> finally<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.950> think<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.310> fitting

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
time and finally I think it's fitting

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
time and finally I think it's fitting
for<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.299> level<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> let's<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
for this one level so let's do it

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
for this one level so let's do it
this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.329> final<00:01:51.840> level<00:01:52.049> into<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> game<00:01:52.860> in

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159

this is the final level into the game in
the<00:01:53.939> darkness<00:01:55.070> probably<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> most

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the darkness probably the most

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.550 
the darkness probably the most
straightforward<00:01:56.909> level<00:01:57.780> into<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> whole

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
straightforward level into the whole

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
straightforward level into the whole
game<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.670> straightforward<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.540> yet

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
