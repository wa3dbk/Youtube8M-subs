00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi girls, i hope you meet 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.820
 well let's make a country of cold lemon 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 with cookies marÃ­as 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.520
 let's use a milk can 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.230
 carnation a dairy we are going to need 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.230
 from 8 to 10 lemons 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.050
 We're going to need three little packets of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.240
 mary cookies and they will be a good 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.710
 amount in my case is a refractory 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.869
 great like the one we 're seeing 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.210
 we are also going to use cream that 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.769
 be your preference or brand of 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.600
 preference a whole cream of agreement 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.390
 now let's empty all that are 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.809
 the milk carnation we are going to empty the 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.150
 milking the juice of the lemons and for 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:52.080
 last the cream 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.080
 how can you see everything we 're going to mix 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:02.700
 here are the games the game of 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.700
 lemons rather well squeezed 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 and finally the cream as I said 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.799
 it is a cream fourth will 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.799
 use all 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.390
 and when 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.790
 and let's start to accommodate what they are 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.229
 the cookies in the refractory making 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.229
 a bed of them 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.260
 in this way and they can do it with their 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.240
 children are going to see that they will love 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.190
 my son who is helping me likes it 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 much to be with me in the kitchen well 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.650
 Once the bed is already there, we are going to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.950
 start to empty the mixture we made 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.020
 in the blender distributing the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.659
 best way over the entire bed of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.350
 cookies 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.450
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.430
 and we 're going to help with a teaspoon 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.160
 to distribute it well 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.340
 once it is already distributed we are going to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.650
 redo the same procedure 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.690
 putting another cookie bed myself 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.570
 I'm just going to put two beds 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.300
 cookies so that it is not so much besides 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.250
 that you look bacterium is bigger and for 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.220
 that the mixture of the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.640
 blender 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.290
 Do it with your children you will love it 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.590
 once the other bed is already 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.530
 second we are going to pour the content of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.290
 the blender or what's left of what 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.910
 we had mixed 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 in everything all everything 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.980
 the place that can be covered 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.510
 spaces that can be 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.760
 so that it is super rich 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 besides that they are all covered 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.650
 nation 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:53.860
 well now help yourself with a teaspoon 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.300
 distribute it all over fractalia and 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.110
 so all the cookies are left 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.110
 covers 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.310
 in this way 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.460
 and so that it is a little more uniform 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.340
 A) Yes 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.480
 and good the last thing that is going to be what 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.930
 can decorate as you want as 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.700
 You can see them put a few slices of lemon 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.680
 some cherries can also 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.510
