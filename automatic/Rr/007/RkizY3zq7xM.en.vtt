anyway I'm back here again there's four

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.200 
anyway I'm back here again there's four
receivers<00:00:04.980> I<00:00:05.310> have<00:00:05.400> five<00:00:05.670> point<00:00:06.000> eight<00:00:06.150> one

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
receivers I have five point eight one

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.940 
receivers I have five point eight one
point<00:00:06.660> two<00:00:06.870> nine<00:00:06.899> hundred<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.940> 2.4<00:00:08.940> gigahertz

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
point two nine hundred and 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.150 
point two nine hundred and 2.4 gigahertz
so<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.340> playing<00:00:11.849> with<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:13.160> different

so I'm playing with all of the different
settings<00:00:15.230> now<00:00:16.230> this<00:00:16.470> thing<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> work

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
settings now this thing is going to work

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.660 
settings now this thing is going to work
good<00:00:17.310> out<00:00:17.490> here<00:00:17.520> because<00:00:19.279> it's<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.430> real

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
good out here because it's a real

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
good out here because it's a real
sensitive<00:00:21.210> camera<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.189> right

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
sensitive camera and you can see right

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.349 
sensitive camera and you can see right
here<00:00:26.699> i<00:00:27.800> have<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.010> telemetry<00:00:29.310> there's<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
here i have the telemetry there's the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.569 
here i have the telemetry there's the
antenna<00:00:30.720> for<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.099> i<00:00:32.160> had<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> two-point

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
antenna for it and i had a two-point

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.130 
antenna for it and i had a two-point
omega<00:00:33.120> board<00:00:33.450> here's<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.070> battery<00:00:35.070> checker<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
omega board here's a battery checker and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.510 
omega board here's a battery checker and
then<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.040> orange

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
then over here I have the orange

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.229 
then over here I have the orange
receiver<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.250> camera<00:00:44.250> goes<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.610> top<00:00:44.850> here

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
receiver and the camera goes on top here

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.510 
receiver and the camera goes on top here
or<00:00:45.420> around<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.200> somewhere<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:49.520> these

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
or around here somewhere so these

receiver<00:00:53.070> tree<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:55.920> be<00:00:56.039> doing<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
receiver tree and I will be doing the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.250 
receiver tree and I will be doing the
hanging<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:58.280> we'll<00:00:59.280> be<00:00:59.309> hanging<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.180> other

down<00:01:20.930> here's<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.290> setup<00:01:22.619> piggyback

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
down here's my little setup piggyback

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.090 
down here's my little setup piggyback
camera<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.150> shoots<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.200 

thing<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.430> 1.2<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.990> Katniss<00:01:32.030> set<00:01:33.030> up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
thing is a 1.2 for this Katniss set up

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.310 
thing is a 1.2 for this Katniss set up
here<00:01:35.509> anywhere<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.540> nine<00:01:36.840> hundred<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.170> one

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
here anywhere from nine hundred and one

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.460 
here anywhere from nine hundred and one
point<00:01:37.619> two<00:01:38.060> gigahertz<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.600> likes<00:01:39.810> 8<00:01:40.020> volts

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
point two gigahertz and it likes 8 volts

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
point two gigahertz and it likes 8 volts
this<00:01:40.710> battery<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.000> easier<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.570> lighter

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this battery so it's easier it's lighter

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520 
this battery so it's easier it's lighter
on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.600> quad<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:45.990> any<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.320> aircraft

on the on the quad or any other aircraft
that<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.920> flied<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:48.920> these<00:01:49.920> foam<00:01:50.640> noodle<00:01:51.180> tubes

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that I flied out these foam noodle tubes

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.090 
that I flied out these foam noodle tubes
from<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.020> swimming<00:01:52.380> pools<00:01:52.619> worked<00:01:52.860> pretty

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
from the swimming pools worked pretty

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.690 
from the swimming pools worked pretty
good<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> shock<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:55.130> already<00:01:56.130> had<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> fall

it bounce fell over I lost one of the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.600 
it bounce fell over I lost one of the
legs<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.180> glued<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> back<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:04.610> it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
legs I just glued it back on but it

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.640

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.110 

there's<00:02:12.650> another<00:02:12.950> extension<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.760> goes<00:02:13.940> on

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
there's another extension that goes on

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.300 
there's another extension that goes on
here<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.750> another<00:02:15.080> aluminum<00:02:15.560> extension<00:02:16.160> I

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
here at another aluminum extension I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.130 
here at another aluminum extension I
will<00:02:16.760> be<00:02:16.910> putting<00:02:17.150> up<00:02:17.330> me<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.570> go<00:02:17.690> up<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:17.930> about

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
will be putting up me to go up at about

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
will be putting up me to go up at about
20<00:02:19.720> 10<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> 12<00:02:21.110> feet<00:02:21.170> up<00:02:21.820> that's<00:02:22.820> good<00:02:23.060> enough

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
20 10 to 12 feet up that's good enough

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.960 
20 10 to 12 feet up that's good enough
don't<00:02:25.160> have<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.430> be<00:02:25.550> real<00:02:25.730> high<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.980> that's<00:02:28.700> it

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
don't have to be real high so that's it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.520 
don't have to be real high so that's it
I'm<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.390> be<00:02:29.480> shutting<00:02:29.990> down<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.440> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
I'm going to be shutting down here if I

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.890 
I'm going to be shutting down here if I
know<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.770> got<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> little<00:02:31.160> bit<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.570> color<00:02:32.570> lines

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
know it got a little bit of color lines
