now although it works you might want to

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.870 
now although it works you might want to
find<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:37.080> kind<00:03:38.080> of<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.260> smaller<00:03:38.740> top<00:03:39.130> you<00:03:39.640> want<00:03:39.820> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
be able to regulate your a little bit

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.060 
be able to regulate your a little bit
even<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.490> regulator<00:03:42.880> would<00:03:43.060> be<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.209> good<00:03:43.300> idea<00:03:43.390> to

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
even a regulator would be a good idea to

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.280 
even a regulator would be a good idea to

works fine if you're doing the furthest
you<00:04:13.930> might<00:04:14.140> want<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.500> plumb<00:04:15.070> in<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.250> bigger<00:04:15.430> tank

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
you might want to plumb in a bigger tank

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.670 
you might want to plumb in a bigger tank
that's<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.109> is<00:04:17.520> on<00:04:18.520> and<00:04:18.790> off<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.390> the<00:04:19.510> oil<00:04:19.680> on

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
that's it is on and off on the oil on

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.680 
that's it is on and off on the oil on
and<00:04:20.980> off<00:04:21.070> on<00:04:21.280> there<00:04:21.459> on<00:04:22.150> there<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:24.660> let<00:04:25.660> it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
and off on there on there and let it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.230 
and off on there on there and let it
through<00:04:25.960> one<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.110> these<00:04:26.260> holes<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.850> drilled<00:04:27.850> my

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
through one of these holes I drilled my

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.120 
through one of these holes I drilled my
burner<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.840> pull<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> holes<00:04:29.350> it<00:04:29.800> seems<00:04:30.040> to

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
burner to pull the holes it seems to

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.840 
burner to pull the holes it seems to
need<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.370> lot<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.580> air<00:04:30.990> right<00:04:31.990> where<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.820> oil

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
need a lot of air right where the oil

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.320 
need a lot of air right where the oil
drops<00:04:34.300> on<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.510> ball<00:04:34.780> close<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:37.000> seems

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
drops on the ball close to it it seems

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.940 
drops on the ball close to it it seems
to<00:04:37.480> the<00:04:37.960> combustion<00:04:38.290> air<00:04:38.470> seems<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.830> work

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
to the combustion air seems to work

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.250 
to the combustion air seems to work
confessed<00:04:39.340> right<00:04:39.580> there<00:04:39.930> your<00:04:40.930> atomization

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
confessed right there your atomization

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.570 
confessed right there your atomization
air<00:04:41.850> through<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.880> two<00:04:43.360> three<00:04:43.630> nozzles<00:04:44.580> fair

whacka<00:04:45.850> there

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
whacka there

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.370 
whacka there
so<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.100> can<00:04:48.520> regulate<00:04:49.419> it<00:04:49.660> with<00:04:49.960> a<00:04:49.990> tap<00:04:50.350> a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
so you can regulate it with a tap a

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.409 
so you can regulate it with a tap a
little<00:04:50.770> bit<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:53.550> this<00:04:54.550> one<00:04:54.820> burns<00:04:55.090> pretty

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
little bit and this one burns pretty

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.770 
little bit and this one burns pretty

in<00:04:58.870> about<00:04:59.169> 20<00:04:59.470> minutes<00:04:59.620> from<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.919> cold<00:05:00.130> start<00:05:00.810> so

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
in about 20 minutes from a cold start so

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.090 
in about 20 minutes from a cold start so
I<00:05:01.840> don't<00:05:01.960> think<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.229> can<00:05:02.320> go<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.500> Rome<00:05:02.830> that's

pretty simple drill press some top and

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.040 
pretty simple drill press some top and
die<00:05:07.330> sets<00:05:07.660> a<00:05:08.310> couple<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.370> pipe<00:05:09.669> fittings<00:05:10.090> and
