00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.710
 hello friends and friends now we are going to 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.930
 Learn how to make these beautiful 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.990
 stars that can serve us as 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.719
 I said to make some pendants in the 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.389
 good house many ornaments the truth 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.060
 they are precious to me I love them in 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.780
 this case I'm going to take care of said either 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.760
 to occupy it with this side 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:27.289
 on this side or this side 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.119
 the truth is that they are very very parents 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.800
 what are we going to need good 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.870
 we're going to need a bottle of 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.850
 Pet refreshment does not matter the color 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.160
 because we are going to paint it on 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.390
 joke is that you have the bottom part no 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.600
 is what I ask is that I have the 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.149
 bottom part like with these balls 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.519
 with these mountains and it does not matter now 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.290
 so mark or size obviously 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.470
 The bigger the bottle, the more 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.720
 great you will be your star 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.930
 we are going to need acuaridas to decorate 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.239
 a candle to make the perforations 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.570
 we are going to need these pins 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.479
 link because I had an outside that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.610
 surely you only know where it was 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.610
 but good are this one 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.210
 but you're not bringing a little bit before 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.490
 that highly social do this two 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.850
 pendants we're going to need either varnish 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.600
 nails or spray paint our 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.940
 our scissors in this case I'm going to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 occupy these clamps to trim the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.630
 crimping pin to remember that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.369
 this is a thin wire also if you 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.619
 you do not have these tweezers can be with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.680
 the scissors and our tweezers for 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.780
 jewelry I also remind you that if not 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.369
 you have these tweezers I have already 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.110
 taught in other videos how to do it 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.750
 with the tweezers that you use 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.670
 the eyebrows can also be with those and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.730
 something to drill with in this case 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.510
 I have this capotera needle 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.610
 ideal to drill well the first thing that 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.140
 let's do the first thing we're going to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.180
 to do please is that with something sharp 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.540
 pointy for either the edge of your 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.340
 scissors or a cutter you're going to make a 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.140
 pierce very carefully please 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.200
 not to hurt your little bottle and there 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.540
 you're going to cut everything down so that you 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.490
 something like that 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.520
 good what we are going to do for the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.340
 star is that we 're going to go 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.530
 little bit further down is to say that the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.550
 full ball and a little bit higher 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.550
 about half a centimeter 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.709
 The good thing about this, for example, is that 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:43.220
 brings there the division exactly the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.430
 part that we need then this one is 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.319
 father no and that's the way it goes please 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.620
 that there are not reb habitas nothing those 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.569
 things that can hurt you and now what 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 what are we going to do is we are going to cut 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.430
 right in the middle of 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.400
 of the divisions of the balls of the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.530
 there we are going to cut well 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.720
 well well back 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.870
 I say you do not need to do much obviously 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 the part here the bottom of your bottle 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.240
 it 's pretty hard then there is 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.240
 divide it nothing more and here for here 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.740
 you gave him 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.780
 already having the and is super easy and I say 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.950
 what we are going to do is that you are going to fold 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.950
 into 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.950
 the tip one side and the other of what 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.950
 you just cut out 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.930
 ok we do it again to do 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.630
 inside you trim it in all the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.850
 low divisions that have these like 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.980
 montaÃ±itas and what you do is that 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.380
 obviously I have left as petals 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.410
 well call them then you grab a 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.060
 what side do you put in, worth the redundancy- 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.880
 into 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.890
 athletes well well well and on the other side 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.140
 It is exactly what it is 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.140
 that's what you're going to do with all sides 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:24.030
 and ready and we 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.700
 our star 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.800
 the truth is very good they are also 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.440
 I'm going to show you how to occupy the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.600
 flower because the truth also lends itself 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.310
 very cool now I the only thing I did 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.590
 to do it in the ig 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.110
 was to paint it with the paint in 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.120
 spray on both sides 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.820
 you already choose which side you 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.689
 like more to work you hit in the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.299
 center with hot silicone 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.249
 the watercolor here I have the watercolors that 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:57.909
 I already told you and in the part of 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:05:01.929
 up simply with heat with the 

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:05.829
 hot fire my needle and I made a 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:09.670
 Pinhole and ready and hence was ready 

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:11.740
 to hang my star 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.930
 the truth is very father to me 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.280
 loved I hope that you too and 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:22.150
 now I have you as a gift 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.140
 extra this beautiful little flower there is work 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.600
 that also remains but very good to little 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.280
 there is no insistence on throwing it that good 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.290
 It is recycled 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.020
 so to break is plastic ok and to 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.830
 little is not left I insist 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.460
 indonesia we apologize pisco the bread is 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.840
 that this good afternoon these always happen 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.840
 things to the picture already seen 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:55.770
 look what father is this is exactly 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:59.080
 do the same for the trimmed boat 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:02.380
 you're going to cut the boat here the only 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.960
 difference is that instead of cutting a 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.560
 little bit outward like in this case 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.380
 you made him leave this margin 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.950
 let's cut exactly flush 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.950
 the little balls 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:22.980
 it is better to go to cut just flush with 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:25.770
 the balls aha and since you have it like this or 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.940
 be obviously flush here and here 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.330
 because then the balls 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:33.090
 ok just flush here from the little balls in 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.670
 the outline already having it like this and what 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.270
 you're going to do is just cut like 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.270
 the piquito 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.700
 to finish shaping the 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:48.600
 flower all the piquitos of the lateral ones 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.390
 cut them out and then you have 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:56.320
 also from the bottom of a bottle is 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.480
 beautiful flower then how do you see you can 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.260
 do with the bottom of your bottle either 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.780
 a flower or a star and they are left 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.460
 very goddamned right now, as I say 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.740
 decorate with watercolors soon here 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.110
 you could put a flower that you 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.870
 teach how to make spangles could you 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.960
 occupy china paper which is left 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:20.750
 corrugated or just leave it like that 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.840
 and you could also there is also the 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.789
 you could do two fronts would be one and 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.060
 this would be another and for example in each 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:33.220
 one of the remaining holes 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.220
 gave a mini to 40 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.059
 of these that are girlies 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:49.600
 and like that and it would also be great 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:52.480
 well we already know that here the limit is 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.330
 our imagination I hope that I have 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.200
 liked if you liked them please these 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:02.080
