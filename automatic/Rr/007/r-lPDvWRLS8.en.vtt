00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:09.269
 This video shows what it looks like. 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 car rick jow alex this car 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:16.039
 designed to perform 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 several grinding operations at once 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:25.670
 polishing and caring for concrete floors when 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.500
 grinding used diamond elements 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.230
 embedded 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:39.270
 grinding head from a coarser 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:41.629
 Grain to finer going on himself 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.840
 grinding process 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 for example start grains 50 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:55.050
 successively turning to grain 100 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:59.090
 volume 200 then 4 st then 800 then 1500 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.890
 3000 and 8500 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.970
 This video shows how it works. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.340
 this machine grinding is necessary 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.400
 performed only on wet 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.119
 grounds you see on the typewriter on top 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.119
 special water tank 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 here he can see the only inconvenience is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.390
 the fact that you can collect dirty water but 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.210
 but there are also advantages 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:38.670
 lower consumption of diamond elements on 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:41.100
 unit area in the video is shown as 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.479
 grinding process itself 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.810
 In principle, a fairly simple job and 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.310
 teach her to do any 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.219
 the practical person here is already more 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.170
 late stage of grinding and each 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.219
 grinding is perpendicular 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.280
 Relative to each other if grain 52 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.280
 walk along the playground 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.280
 then the grain that you go across the court 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.970
 but for polishing there are of course several 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.870
 options 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.620
 version of the swing see a man performs 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 swing option that is in this way 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.489
 polishing is also provided enough 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.680
 quality 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.950
 This video shows how we perform. 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.930
 polishing an existing old 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.739
 concrete floor with reinforced top 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.080
 layer which eventually began to cut 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.500
 here on video two cars one big 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.780
 other smaller both perform these 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.360
 onyx reggie features 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.280
 the best polishing and grinding machine 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.280
 concrete floor maintenance
