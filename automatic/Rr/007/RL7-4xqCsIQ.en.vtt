00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
sure where the series then I mean you've

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.830 
sure where the series then I mean you've
made<00:01:05.610> some<00:01:05.760> changes<00:01:05.970> i<00:01:06.240> mean<00:01:06.420> people

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
made some changes i mean people

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.630 
made some changes i mean people

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
regulations last year but the point

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
regulations last year but the point
system<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
system what can we see is going to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
system what can we see is going to
change<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.320> 2014<00:01:14.280> yeah<00:01:14.640> i<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.939> point

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
change for 2014 yeah i think the point

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.830 
change for 2014 yeah i think the point
systems<00:01:15.450> play<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> biggest<00:01:15.990> actually<00:01:17.840> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
systems play the biggest actually you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
systems play the biggest actually you
know<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.009> completely<00:01:20.400> blind<00:01:20.670> year

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
know going into a completely blind year

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
know going into a completely blind year
last<00:01:21.060> year<00:01:21.180> no<00:01:21.450> one<00:01:21.540> had<00:01:21.659> ever<00:01:21.750> organized<00:01:22.259> an

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
last year no one had ever organized an

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.460 
last year no one had ever organized an
international<00:01:22.950> enduro<00:01:24.290> personally<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
international enduro personally I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.920 
international enduro personally I
thought<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.009> would<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.700> winners<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
thought we would see more winners and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
thought we would see more winners and
yeah<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.290> was<00:01:28.350> worth<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.159> mean<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.460> weren't

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
yeah it was worth it i mean they weren't

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.550 
yeah it was worth it i mean they weren't
almost<00:01:29.939> half<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> stage<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> drugs<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.200> mean

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
almost half the stage of drugs I mean

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.340 
almost half the stage of drugs I mean
the<00:01:31.740> dominance<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.549> seen<00:01:33.049> women<00:01:34.049> done

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the dominance we have seen women done

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.310 
the dominance we have seen women done
men's<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.509> we'd<00:01:36.509> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.840> set<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> point

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
men's and we'd kind of set the point

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
men's and we'd kind of set the point
scale<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.860> kind<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.189> almost<00:01:38.850> allow<00:01:39.210> people<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
scale to kind of almost allow people to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899 
scale to kind of almost allow people to
have<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> dropout<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.979> drop<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> round<00:01:41.579> but

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
have a dropout not drop it round but

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.429 
have a dropout not drop it round but
certainly<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.689> up<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.290> down

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
certainly have that up and down

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.249 
certainly have that up and down
mechanical<00:01:44.130> failure<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.570> blow<00:01:46.049> out

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
mechanical failure you know blow out

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
mechanical failure you know blow out
whatever<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.009> still<00:01:47.310> come<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
whatever and still come back and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.240 
whatever and still come back and
challenge<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.390> win<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:49.470> dominance<00:01:49.890> we<00:01:50.040> saw

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
terrain I think we might may actually

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.620 
terrain I think we might may actually
have<00:02:54.750> some<00:02:54.900> cold<00:02:55.140> weather<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:56.270> being<00:02:57.270> up<00:02:57.420> high

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
have some cold weather and being up high

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.410 
have some cold weather and being up high
yeah<00:02:58.170> definitely<00:02:59.130> maybe<00:02:59.489> maybe<00:02:59.970> we'll<00:03:00.270> have

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
yeah definitely maybe maybe we'll have

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.920 
yeah definitely maybe maybe we'll have
maybe<00:03:00.810> we'll<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.709> I<00:03:02.040> mean<00:03:02.310> but<00:03:02.489> if

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
maybe we'll have to do it I mean but if

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.840 
maybe we'll have to do it I mean but if
storms<00:03:03.930> come<00:03:04.230> into<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.500> picture<00:03:04.680> yeah<00:03:05.670> we're

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
storms come into the picture yeah we're

affects the way they're going to have it
if<00:06:07.000> it<00:06:07.210> goes<00:06:07.420> it<00:06:07.600> down<00:06:07.720> there<00:06:07.780> well<00:06:08.560> if<00:06:09.040> he's

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
if it goes it down there well if he's

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.180 
if it goes it down there well if he's
get<00:06:09.670> that<00:06:10.120> he<00:06:10.840> would<00:06:11.020> be<00:06:11.140> good<00:06:11.350> for<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.860> riders
