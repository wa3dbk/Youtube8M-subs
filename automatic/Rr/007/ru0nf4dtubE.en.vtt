and I think people have an issue with
dressing<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.549> fashionable<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> Muslim

dressing like fashionable as a Muslim

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.679 
dressing like fashionable as a Muslim
woman<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.409> because<00:01:20.090> being<00:01:21.090> fashionable<00:01:21.600> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
woman just because being fashionable is

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
woman just because being fashionable is
associated<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.259> being<00:01:22.530> sexy<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.250> what

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
associated with being sexy that's what

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.660 
associated with being sexy that's what
it<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.109 
it is
and<00:01:24.350> whereas<00:01:25.350> we're<00:01:25.770> redefining<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.850> as
