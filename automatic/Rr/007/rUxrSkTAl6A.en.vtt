00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
I think these guys have developed a

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.310 
I think these guys have developed a
really<00:00:20.320> cool<00:00:20.710> aesthetic<00:00:20.950> I<00:00:21.490> think<00:00:21.790> that<00:00:22.000> that

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
really cool aesthetic I think that that

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.380 
really cool aesthetic I think that that
they<00:00:23.320> are<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.800> company<00:00:24.280> is<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.730> clothes<00:00:25.030> are

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
they are the company is the clothes are

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.480 
they are the company is the clothes are
the<00:00:25.750> brand<00:00:26.080> you're<00:00:26.650> one<00:00:26.830> of<00:00:26.920> the<00:00:26.980> few<00:00:27.100> people

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
the brand you're one of the few people

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.890 
the brand you're one of the few people
that<00:00:27.520> are<00:00:27.700> still<00:00:27.940> on<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.240> street<00:00:28.570> you<00:00:28.810> know

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
that are still on the street you know

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900 
that are still on the street you know
walking<00:00:29.320> somewhere<00:00:29.740> so<00:00:30.400> they're<00:00:30.580> getting<00:00:30.820> a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
walking somewhere so they're getting a

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.430 
walking somewhere so they're getting a
viewpoint<00:00:31.450> of<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.750> that's<00:00:31.990> what<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.200> think<00:00:32.380> is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
viewpoint of that that's what I think is

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:46.240 
viewpoint of that that's what I think is
exciting<00:00:32.710> about<00:00:32.950> them

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.300 

it's<00:00:46.880> kind<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.360> androgynous<00:00:48.310> really

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
quite specific and it's you know it's

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.440 
quite specific and it's you know it's

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.809 
and I think we see our collections built
around<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:05.229> idea<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.530> pushing<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.220> ideal

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
around the idea of pushing that ideal

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.020 
around the idea of pushing that ideal
and<00:02:07.530> seeing<00:02:08.530> how<00:02:08.740> where<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.459> go<00:02:09.640> with<00:02:09.670> it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and seeing how where we can go with it

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.420 
and seeing how where we can go with it
but<00:02:10.509> just<00:02:10.630> making<00:02:11.050> sure<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.290> each<00:02:11.620> look<00:02:11.980> in

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.640 
menswear and sort of inspired looks
using<00:04:19.880> menswear<00:04:20.450> shirting<00:04:20.989> some<00:04:21.200> very<00:04:21.380> clean

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
using menswear shirting some very clean

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.890 
using menswear shirting some very clean
white<00:04:21.979> looks<00:04:22.250> I<00:04:22.550> didn't<00:04:23.240> at<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:23.570> end<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
white looks I didn't at the end of the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.510 
white looks I didn't at the end of the
day<00:04:24.110> it's<00:04:24.350> about<00:04:24.440> fusing<00:04:24.919> all<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.400> those

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
day it's about fusing all of those

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.210 
day it's about fusing all of those
influences<00:04:26.210> together<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.650> think<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:28.070> the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
influences together and I think that the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.190 
influences together and I think that the
balance<00:04:28.550> of<00:04:28.639> contrast<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.630> what<00:04:29.780> we're<00:04:29.930> trying

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
balance of contrast is what we're trying

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.879 
balance of contrast is what we're trying
to<00:04:30.380> achieve<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.669> not<00:04:32.030> having<00:04:32.240> a<00:04:32.630> literal<00:04:33.530> biker

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
to achieve so not having a literal biker

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.620 
to achieve so not having a literal biker
there's<00:04:34.340> no<00:04:34.460> one<00:04:34.610> dresses<00:04:34.850> like<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.180> it's

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
there's no one dresses like that it's

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.140 
there's no one dresses like that it's
about<00:04:35.780> having<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.740> harder<00:04:37.160> piece<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.760> softer

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
about having a harder piece and a softer

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.360 
about having a harder piece and a softer
piece<00:04:38.330> mixed<00:04:38.750> together<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.470> same<00:04:39.650> look<00:04:40.010> so

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
piece mixed together in the same look so

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.730 
piece mixed together in the same look so
