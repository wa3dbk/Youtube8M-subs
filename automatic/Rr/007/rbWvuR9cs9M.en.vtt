high quality headphones they're also

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.269 
high quality headphones they're also
about<00:00:30.660> half<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> prices<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> Bowers<00:00:32.130> &amp;

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
about half the prices the Bowers &amp;

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.790 
about half the prices the Bowers &amp;
Wilkins<00:00:32.310> c5<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.840> pretty<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
Wilkins c5 and they pretty much have the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.580 
Wilkins c5 and they pretty much have the
same<00:00:35.700> performance<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.660> better<00:00:36.870> than<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
same performance if not better than the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.070 
same performance if not better than the
c5<00:00:38.010> s<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.400> also<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> construction<00:00:39.990> on

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
c5 s I also think the construction on

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.570 
c5 s I also think the construction on
these<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.440> probably<00:00:40.740> even<00:00:40.920> better<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.400> well

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
these is probably even better as well

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.300 
these is probably even better as well
