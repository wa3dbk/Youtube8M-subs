solar system thingy our orbiting planets

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.190 
solar system thingy our orbiting planets
don't<00:00:47.610> line<00:00:47.789> up<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> binary

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
don't line up like that this is a binary

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.920 
don't line up like that this is a binary
clock<00:00:49.649> that's<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.489> clock<00:00:50.700> yeah<00:00:51.149> for<00:00:51.629> science

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
clock that's a clock yeah for science

clock that's a clock yeah for science
geeks<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.230> Kim<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.710> count<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> amount<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
geeks like Kim you count the amount of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.500 
geeks like Kim you count the amount of
planets<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.670> each<00:00:53.760> quadrant<00:00:54.000> tells<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
planets in each quadrant tells you the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
planets in each quadrant tells you the
time<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> case<00:00:56.149> 732<00:00:57.500> that's<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.800> half<00:00:59.070> hour

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
time in this case 732 that's a half hour

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.880 
time in this case 732 that's a half hour
before<00:00:59.969> our<00:01:00.000> 9-1-1<00:01:00.570> call<00:01:00.750> that's<00:01:01.500> because<00:01:01.739> the
