00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
with the telling of the story is that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.219 
with the telling of the story is that
the<00:01:48.109> in-game<00:01:48.380> sequence<00:01:48.890> is<00:01:49.659> well<00:01:50.689> the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
the in-game sequence is well the

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.039 
the in-game sequence is well the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.349 
just badly written there's also a little
bit<00:01:57.229> of<00:01:57.380> disconnect<00:01:57.679> with<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.520> in-game

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the people are done talking so it's kind

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.650

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
in light of the entire game it's really

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.430 
in light of the entire game it's really
not<00:02:20.000> too<00:02:20.360> great<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.870> deal<00:02:21.050> but<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.410> is
