00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.059
 I remind everyone that the ultra thriller market 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.330
 and I Dmitri ruin present to you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.330
 regular review our regular review 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.550
 charming guest as always we what 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.670
 I like Redmond Multivark 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.430
 on the box or on the multicooker 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.640
 there is maximum information that she 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.590
 able to do and the most important thing is that 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 information is communicated lucidly that is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.879
 Here it is written 1 Redmond 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:42.110
 hot carcasses and creates bakes in general 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.370
 does absolutely everything than this multicooker 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.920
 originally in appearance 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.190
 different from everyone else and how is it 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.660
 interested me for example but how 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.940
 at least that's such an interesting thing 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.340
 Look usually multicooker if worth 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.660
 on the table that she is worth this can 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 move here and so she goes with us 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 conveniently on the table and all because of 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.049
 that here there are two rezinochki which 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.210
 she is being held 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.510
 and 2 rezinochek this is just the same for 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.430
 so that it is convenient to move under 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 the right angle if you are uncomfortable like this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.439
 let 's go to sleep that they moved here 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.680
 so fall asleep like this and like this in 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.470
 bundled is required for Redmond 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.720
 100 recipes 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.640
 they are straight hundred and they are really all 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.970
 delicious really all healthy 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.880
 so pay attention to it 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.290
 use them in the end 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.070
 instruction manual 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.580
 but by the way there are also rezinochki 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.680
 here for these two legs 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.330
 which move that is if all the same 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.720
 it annoys you that they are like this 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.670
 go then you can cover well and addresses 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.900
 service centers I can say that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.820
 belarus times two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.160
 service centers throughout the country 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.690
 the whole country so you can not worry 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.690
 your slow cooker always 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.720
 if suddenly something happens to her 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.870
 alright let's look a little bit at 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.000
 appearance and so this faucet like 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.160
 just to get porn 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.190
 have three position closed closed closed 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.230
 besides that here pay attention 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.760
 why are these 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.010
 position closed open 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.780
 if it is closed then this is high pressure 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.420
 inside the slow cooker if open 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.540
 normal and the pressure can 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.570
 change right while cooking 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.430
 touchpad here it looks 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.170
 something so natural this sticker 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.750
 we will take off when we start using 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.720
 multicooker but if the buttons 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.260
 I want to remind again once again 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.330
 all the mistresses who but let's say not 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.440
 not too young generation this 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.630
 Touchpad 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.870
 we just need to touch it 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.700
 need to poke hard to try 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.010
 there are no buttons here but they react 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.940
 simple all simple and easy on your finger 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.610
 ok start menu select pressure 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:14.140
 change various choice categories 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.450
 product customization and most importantly 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.220
 cancellation or warming up here in function and 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.410
 choose any function ie it 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.200
 maybe I'm the pressure lines soup 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.970
 stewing tank baking hot steam where 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.750
 heart bread deep fat and so on all 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.860
 15 programs in this multicooker and 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.670
 they all automatically work prepare 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.950
 tasty healthy food 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.810
 what else surprises in this multicooker 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.690
 let's show you right away 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.640
 so I honestly say I probably saw everything 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 Multivarki not only the company rhythm end 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.570
 but basically no one other on 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.320
 the cover was not like these two buttons 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.720
 open and close and i'm like a man 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.540
 modern i like when a lot of buttons 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.450
 when they work here let's click 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:07.000
 open open lid is removed 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.290
 I put the wish to close the lid 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.910
 closed is not removed cool I would right 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.410
 you can not even be prepared to just play 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.090
 with this really button well yes 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.419
 okay let's open let's see what u 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 us inside the more company rapmon as 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.790
 always worried about not being 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.190
 large boxes so that everything is comfortable 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.550
 therefore, in principle, all additional 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.640
 the details are inside the multicooker 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.370
 uncomfortably complex now we get them and 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.130
 we will unpack obligatory measured spoons 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.960
 measuring cup all this is traditional for 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.669
 multicook rap rap power cord for 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.650
 so that it works from something 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.650
 fed a variety of coasters for frying 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.430
 here, in principle, by picking, I can 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.740
 say that so far nothing surprised me 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.650
 not hooked because it's all standard 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.979
 you don't need a stove or a microwave 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.350
 nothing the multicooker warms up and and 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.350
 soars and steamer unnecessary pressure cooker not 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.810
 you need it all here 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.590
 in this unit but let's still 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.650
 a little bit more bowl maximum 3 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.300
 liter capacity therefore more than three liters 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.370
 please do not load principle like 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.750
 there is always a delayed start function 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.460
 which works up to 24 hours that is 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.500
 abandoned in the evening they set food 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.240
 debugged starts and closer to the morning when 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.520
 you plan woke up you already have everything 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.440
 will be ready the eggs are cooked and so on 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.390
 in addition, the maintenance function 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.670
 temperatures of ready meals 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.850
 that is, when you cooked over 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:51.060
 12 hours it can warm them and 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.030
 keep in the right mood fresh 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.710
 hearty your meals and you will then 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.170
 enjoy them just the same at the very 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:01.170
 right moment besides this here are some 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.330
 features of this multicooker 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.060
 cooking temperature changes then 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.680
 there is now a change function 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.570
 cooking temperatures can be 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.630
 adjust automatic programs 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.950
 and prepare meals to your own taste 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.810
 This feature allows you to change 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.730
 cooking temperature in the process 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.350
 work even programs like hot 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:21.660
 deep-frying and baking 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.590
 but that is, everyone pressed one button and everything 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.820
 you are well suited to your individual 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.520
 preferences well and most importantly 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.380
 the change in pressure level is this 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.450
 an innovative feature that allows 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.240
 choose the level you want 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:39.480
 pressure before running steam soup programs 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.920
 extinguishing cooking languor without changing time 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.920
 cooking with increasing levels 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.540
 pressure occurs simultaneously 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.460
 increase in temperature due to which 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.640
 the shortest possible time 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.650
 make a tender dish even out of hard 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.760
 meat or game 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.340
