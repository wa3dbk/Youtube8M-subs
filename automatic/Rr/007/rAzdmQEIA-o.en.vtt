00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.030 

okay<00:00:49.880> so<00:00:49.940> let's<00:00:50.270> talk<00:00:50.450> about<00:00:50.650> the<00:00:51.650> different

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
okay so let's talk about the different

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.830 
okay so let's talk about the different
stroke<00:00:52.430> types<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:52.940> we<00:00:53.060> have<00:00:53.090> with<00:00:53.330> brushes

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
stroke types that we have with brushes

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.520 
stroke types that we have with brushes
so<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.950> first<00:00:55.190> obvious<00:00:55.520> one<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:56.410> just<00:00:57.410> a

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
so the first obvious one is just a

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.740 
so the first obvious one is just a
vertical<00:00:57.770> just<00:00:58.730> like<00:00:58.880> you<00:00:59.030> would<00:00:59.180> with<00:00:59.210> sticks

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
vertical just like you would with sticks

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.980 
vertical just like you would with sticks
and<00:01:00.200> I<00:01:00.830> like<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:01.160> turn<00:01:01.340> these<00:01:01.550> taps<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:02.870> we're

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
and I like to turn these taps so we're

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.210 
and I like to turn these taps so we're
just<00:01:03.020> straight<00:01:03.440> up<00:01:03.560> and<00:01:03.740> down<00:01:05.980> just<00:01:06.980> playing

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
just straight up and down just playing

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.010 
just straight up and down just playing
like<00:01:07.400> you<00:01:07.520> would<00:01:07.670> with<00:01:07.820> sticks<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:08.930> a

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
like you would with sticks and it's a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.750 
like you would with sticks and it's a
little<00:01:09.170> different<00:01:09.470> it's<00:01:10.100> something<00:01:10.370> to<00:01:10.640> get

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
little different it's something to get

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.070 
little different it's something to get
used<00:01:10.970> to<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.300> might<00:01:11.450> try<00:01:11.630> playing<00:01:11.900> your

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
used to you might try playing your

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.430 
used to you might try playing your
rudiments<00:01:13.030> with<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:14.150> brushes<00:01:14.570> there<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.410> a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
rudiments with the brushes there is a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.240 
rudiments with the brushes there is a
little<00:01:15.890> bit<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.100> rebound<00:01:16.460> too<00:01:17.830> but<00:01:18.830> not<00:01:19.010> much

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
little bit of rebound too but not much

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.040 
little bit of rebound too but not much
so<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:19.640> something<00:01:19.820> to<00:01:20.000> get<00:01:20.119> used<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.570> just<00:01:20.930> do

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
so it's something to get used to just do

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.890 
so it's something to get used to just do
the<00:01:21.110> feel<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.650> brushes<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:23.090> can<00:01:23.720> just

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
the feel of the brushes you can just

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.390 
the feel of the brushes you can just
simply<00:01:24.670> straight<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:25.940> down<00:01:26.350> strokes<00:01:27.400> you

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
simply straight up and down strokes you

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.550 
simply straight up and down strokes you
can<00:01:28.430> kind<00:01:28.760> of<00:01:28.880> whip<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.840> brush<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> little<00:01:30.290> bit

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
can kind of whip the brush a little bit

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.670 
can kind of whip the brush a little bit
to<00:01:30.830> give<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.100> an<00:01:31.220> accent<00:01:31.700> so<00:01:32.440> I'm<00:01:33.440> kind<00:01:33.619> of

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
to give it an accent so I'm kind of

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.130 
to give it an accent so I'm kind of
using<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.160> whip<00:01:34.790> motion<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:35.479> stopping<00:01:35.810> just

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
using a whip motion and stopping just

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.990 
using a whip motion and stopping just
before<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.590> head<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.520> brush<00:01:37.760> just

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
before the head and the brush just

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.210 
before the head and the brush just
carries<00:01:38.330> through<00:01:38.690> smacks<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.830> head<00:01:40.010> nice

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
carries through smacks the head nice

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.940 
carries through smacks the head nice
little<00:01:40.520> accent<00:01:43.270> maybe<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:44.600> hear<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
little accent maybe you can hear the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.820 
little accent maybe you can hear the
brush<00:01:45.950> whip<00:01:46.220> sound<00:01:47.229> so<00:01:48.229> we<00:01:48.380> would<00:01:48.500> call<00:01:48.680> these

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
brush whip sound so we would call these

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.430 
brush whip sound so we would call these
taps<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.570> next<00:01:50.780> one<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.050> this<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.200> where

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
taps then the next one and this is where

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.330 
taps then the next one and this is where
it<00:01:51.530> gets<00:01:51.620> interesting<00:01:51.830> with<00:01:52.310> brushes<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:53.000> a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
it gets interesting with brushes is a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.740 
it gets interesting with brushes is a
horizontal<00:01:55.340> motion<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> little

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
horizontal motion so this is a little

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.390 
horizontal motion so this is a little
different<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.320> this<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.130> part<00:01:58.370> that

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
different and this is the part that

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.350 
different and this is the part that
you're<00:01:58.610> going<00:01:58.730> to<00:01:58.760> have<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> spend<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.240> little

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
you're going to have to spend a little

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.870 
you're going to have to spend a little
bit<00:01:59.570> more<00:01:59.720> time<00:01:59.960> on<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.620> it's<00:02:00.740> also<00:02:00.920> where<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
bit more time on but it's also where the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.240 
bit more time on but it's also where the
real<00:02:02.090> beautiful<00:02:03.020> sounds<00:02:03.620> of<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.830> brushes

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
real beautiful sounds of the brushes

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.590 
real beautiful sounds of the brushes
come<00:02:04.280> through<00:02:04.930> so<00:02:05.930> by<00:02:06.830> going<00:02:07.100> vertically<00:02:07.880> what

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
come through so by going vertically what

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.960 
come through so by going vertically what
we're<00:02:08.750> doing<00:02:09.110> is<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.130> surface<00:02:10.550> area<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
we're doing is the surface area of the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.050 
we're doing is the surface area of the
brush<00:02:11.239> with<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.810> textured<00:02:12.320> head<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.670> going

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
brush with the textured head it's going

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.280 
brush with the textured head it's going
to<00:02:14.209> give<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.250> legato<00:02:17.000> long<00:02:17.840> sound

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
to give you that that legato long sound

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.810 
to give you that that legato long sound
so<00:02:21.290> just<00:02:21.500> back<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.860> forth<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.250> obviously<00:02:22.700> this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
so just back and forth so obviously this

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.540 
so just back and forth so obviously this
is<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:22.970> textured<00:02:23.570> head<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.019> not<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:25.070> clear<00:02:25.400> head

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
is a textured head and not a clear head

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.949 
is a textured head and not a clear head
so<00:02:25.820> it's<00:02:25.970> not<00:02:26.060> really<00:02:26.330> going<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.510> work<00:02:26.690> on<00:02:26.870> your

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
so it's not really going to work on your

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.750 
so it's not really going to work on your
clear<00:02:27.230> plastic<00:02:27.739> heads<00:02:27.920> but<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.130> textured<00:02:28.610> head

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
clear plastic heads but a textured head

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.030 
clear plastic heads but a textured head
that's<00:02:29.090> what<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.390> want<00:02:29.600> with<00:02:29.720> brushes<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.739> we

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
that's what we want with brushes so we

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.120 
that's what we want with brushes so we
have<00:02:31.190> our<00:02:31.340> vertical<00:02:31.959> motion<00:02:32.959> taps<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.590> then

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
have our vertical motion taps and then

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.490 
have our vertical motion taps and then
this<00:02:34.250> will<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.549> horizontal<00:02:35.019> back<00:02:36.019> and<00:02:36.260> forth

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
this will be horizontal back and forth

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.630 
this will be horizontal back and forth
and<00:02:36.739> we'd<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.070> call<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.459> sweeps

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.310 

so<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.270> would<00:02:41.390> be<00:02:41.510> something<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.960> get<00:02:42.080> used

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
so that would be something to get used

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.020 
so that would be something to get used
to<00:02:42.470> maybe<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:42.860> both<00:02:43.100> hands<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.700> could<00:02:43.820> just

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to maybe with both hands you could just

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:57.450 
to maybe with both hands you could just
play<00:02:44.180> eighth<00:02:44.420> notes<00:02:44.450> back<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.110> forth<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.620 

it's<00:02:58.460> just<00:02:58.670> something<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.940> get<00:02:59.090> used<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.420> it's

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
it's just something to get used to it's

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.000 
it's just something to get used to it's
a<00:02:59.720> little<00:02:59.870> different<00:03:00.230> rather<00:03:00.560> than<00:03:00.770> up<00:03:00.890> and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
a little different rather than up and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.100 
a little different rather than up and
down<00:03:01.100> like<00:03:01.400> we're<00:03:01.520> used<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.820> with<00:03:01.970> sticks<00:03:02.330> we

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
down like we're used to with sticks we

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.040 
down like we're used to with sticks we
have<00:03:03.320> this<00:03:03.850> horizontal<00:03:04.960> sweeping<00:03:05.960> sound<00:03:06.640> so

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
have this horizontal sweeping sound so

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.070 
have this horizontal sweeping sound so
as<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:10.160> begin<00:03:10.490> with<00:03:10.700> these<00:03:10.880> sweeps<00:03:11.300> what<00:03:11.930> we

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
as we begin with these sweeps what we

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.720 
as we begin with these sweeps what we
can<00:03:12.260> do<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.650> we're<00:03:12.830> going<00:03:12.980> back<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.430> forth

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
can do is we're going back and forth

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.900 
can do is we're going back and forth
because<00:03:14.240> we<00:03:14.510> can<00:03:14.660> begin<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.020> get<00:03:15.350> into<00:03:16.220> an<00:03:16.340> oval

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
because we can begin to get into an oval

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.550 
because we can begin to get into an oval
pattern<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.910> becomes<00:03:20.300> more<00:03:21.080> of<00:03:21.320> whole

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
pattern and it becomes more of whole

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.070 
pattern and it becomes more of whole
notes<00:03:21.860> or<00:03:22.250> longer<00:03:22.910> tones<00:03:23.209> where<00:03:23.780> you're<00:03:23.900> just

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
notes or longer tones where you're just

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.910 
notes or longer tones where you're just
gettin<00:03:25.120> getting<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.380> sweeping<00:03:27.380> sound<00:03:27.680> through

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
gettin getting a sweeping sound through

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.949 
gettin getting a sweeping sound through
the<00:03:27.980> whole<00:03:28.130> thing<00:03:31.090> what<00:03:32.090> we<00:03:32.239> can<00:03:32.420> begin<00:03:32.660> to<00:03:32.810> do

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the whole thing what we can begin to do

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.960 
the whole thing what we can begin to do
is<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.350> count<00:03:33.620> each<00:03:34.250> oval<00:03:35.239> or<00:03:35.510> each<00:03:35.780> circle<00:03:36.970> so

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
is to count each oval or each circle so

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.360 
is to count each oval or each circle so
you<00:03:38.030> could<00:03:38.180> get<00:03:38.300> one<00:03:38.540> to<00:03:41.080> four<00:03:42.080> so<00:03:43.010> I'm<00:03:43.100> kind<00:03:43.310> of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
you could get one to four so I'm kind of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.750 
you could get one to four so I'm kind of
counting<00:03:44.680> every<00:03:45.680> time<00:03:45.890> it<00:03:46.040> hits<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:46.459> spot

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
counting every time it hits this spot

00:03:46.760 --> 00:04:05.680 
counting every time it hits this spot
every<00:03:47.030> time<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.299> gets<00:03:47.390> close<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.690> me<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:05.570> can

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
every time it gets close to me you can

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.479 
every time it gets close to me you can
begin<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:06.080> speed<00:04:06.410> up<00:04:06.590> your<00:04:06.769> counting<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.250> little

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
begin to speed up your counting a little

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.820 
begin to speed up your counting a little
bit<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.760> could<00:04:07.910> do<00:04:08.030> each<00:04:08.299> side<00:04:08.720> of<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.590> drum

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
bit you could do each side of the drum

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:26.469 
bit you could do each side of the drum
would<00:04:10.070> be<00:04:10.220> its<00:04:10.340> own<00:04:10.489> count

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.420 

awesome<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:27.900> those<00:04:28.110> are<00:04:28.290> just<00:04:28.380> some<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.860> the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
awesome so those are just some of the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.189 
awesome so those are just some of the
real<00:04:29.610> basic<00:04:29.790> strokes<00:04:30.389> to<00:04:30.540> get<00:04:30.660> used<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
real basic strokes to get used to the

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.260 
real basic strokes to get used to the
first<00:04:31.440> one<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.800> obvious<00:04:32.370> one<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.120> your

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
first one the obvious one is just your

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.850 
first one the obvious one is just your
vertical<00:04:33.780> your<00:04:33.960> taps<00:04:34.229> like<00:04:34.560> you<00:04:34.680> would

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
vertical your taps like you would

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.860 
vertical your taps like you would
drumsticks<00:04:35.430> but<00:04:36.000> then<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.300> real<00:04:36.479> beauty

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
drumsticks but then the real beauty

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.600 
drumsticks but then the real beauty
comes<00:04:37.050> in<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.320> legato<00:04:37.800> strokes<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.460> that's

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
comes in the legato strokes and that's

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.860 
comes in the legato strokes and that's
what<00:04:38.760> makes<00:04:38.940> brushes<00:04:39.419> a<00:04:39.449> little<00:04:39.750> bit

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
what makes brushes a little bit

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.110 
what makes brushes a little bit
different<00:04:40.290> so<00:04:40.710> spend<00:04:41.370> some<00:04:41.550> time<00:04:41.760> with<00:04:41.940> that

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
different so spend some time with that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.659 
different so spend some time with that
back<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.570> forth<00:04:42.660> maybe<00:04:43.560> some<00:04:43.800> circles<00:04:44.340> a

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
back and forth maybe some circles a

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.020 
back and forth maybe some circles a
little<00:04:45.210> bit<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.389> oval<00:04:45.780> get<00:04:46.320> used<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:47.030> the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
little bit of oval get used to the

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:58.340 
little bit of oval get used to the
horizontal<00:04:49.020> motion<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.130> brushes

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.410 

you
