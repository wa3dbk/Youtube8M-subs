00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
you go over you start you windmill from

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.639 
you go over you start you windmill from
the<00:01:44.909> freeze<00:01:45.119> position<00:01:45.600> right<00:01:45.780> from<00:01:46.470> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the freeze position right from this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
the freeze position right from this
position<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.280> know<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.180> easier

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
position you know and it's easier

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.450 
position you know and it's easier
actually<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.909> here<00:01:51.890> from<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.310> your

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
actually go to here from here to your

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.179 
actually go to here from here to your
back<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.570> difficult<00:01:54.829> go<00:01:55.829> from

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
back but it's more difficult go from

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.149 
back but it's more difficult go from
your<00:01:56.369> back<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.329> your<00:01:57.570> freeze<00:01:57.990> it's

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
your back to your freeze it's

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.919 
your back to your freeze it's
even<00:01:59.399> more<00:01:59.579> difficult<00:01:59.789> because<00:02:00.179> it<00:02:00.479> requires

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
even more difficult because it requires

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.630 
even more difficult because it requires
more<00:02:02.179> than<00:02:03.229> when<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.259> go<00:02:04.499> from<00:02:04.740> your<00:02:05.009> fries<00:02:05.280> to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
