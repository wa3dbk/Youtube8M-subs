00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
so today we're going to be doing the

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.780 
so today we're going to be doing the
exhaust<00:00:03.090> gas<00:00:03.600> pressure<00:00:03.959> sensor<00:00:04.890> on<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.549> last

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
exhaust gas pressure sensor on the last

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.669 
exhaust gas pressure sensor on the last
one<00:00:06.060> we<00:00:06.240> got<00:00:06.270> this<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.560> blue<00:00:08.570> 350<00:00:09.570> all<00:00:10.410> of

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
one we got this is the blue 350 all of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.999 
one we got this is the blue 350 all of
our<00:00:10.830> vehicles<00:00:10.980> got<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.519> beautiful<00:00:11.880> 7.3<00:00:13.009> but

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
our vehicles got the beautiful 7.3 but

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.369 
our vehicles got the beautiful 7.3 but
what<00:00:14.309> we're<00:00:14.460> gonna<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.730> doing<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.900> sensor

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
what we're gonna be doing is this sensor

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.990 
what we're gonna be doing is this sensor
over<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:18.020> get<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.109> focus<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.000> well

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
over here I get to focus on it well

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.269 
over here I get to focus on it well
that's<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> top<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.810> sensor<00:00:22.170> we're<00:00:23.160> going

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
that's the top of the sensor we're going

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.429 
that's the top of the sensor we're going
to<00:00:23.340> take<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.820> off<00:00:24.000> clean<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.630> sensor<00:00:24.840> clean

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to take it off clean the sensor clean

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.759 
to take it off clean the sensor clean
the<00:00:25.590> lint<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.980> housing<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.769> hopefully

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the lint a housing for it and hopefully

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.769 
the lint a housing for it and hopefully
make<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> better<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.939> sleeping<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.660> my

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
make it better but sleeping with my

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.810 
make it better but sleeping with my
finger<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> there

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
finger in there

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
finger in there
it's<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.180> sensor<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:35.309> was

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's that sensor right there and I was

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
it's that sensor right there and I was
amazed<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.930> weird<00:00:37.200> my<00:00:37.320> f-550<00:00:38.190> there

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
amazed like it's weird my f-550 there

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.600 
amazed like it's weird my f-550 there
orange<00:00:38.550> one<00:00:38.899> it<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.020> perfect<00:00:40.469> clean<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
orange one it was perfect clean as it

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
orange one it was perfect clean as it
could<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.879> somebody<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.600> changed<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
could be somebody had to have changed it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.340 
could be somebody had to have changed it
but<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> white<00:00:44.640> guy<00:00:44.879> over<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.870> who<00:00:46.140> was

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but on the white guy over here who was

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.310 
but on the white guy over here who was
completely<00:00:47.250> clogged<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.809> much<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.020> it

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
completely clogged up so much that it

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.860 
completely clogged up so much that it
made<00:00:49.530> hole<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.910> had<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> buy<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> new<00:00:51.360> tube

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
made hole and I had to buy a new tube

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.209 
made hole and I had to buy a new tube
which<00:00:52.140> I'm<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> pick<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.710> from<00:00:52.800> autozone

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
which I'm going to pick up from autozone

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.049 
which I'm going to pick up from autozone
pretty<00:00:53.520> soon<00:00:53.730> but<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.079> bhakti<00:00:55.410> minute<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:57.000> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty soon but the bhakti minute so you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.610 
pretty soon but the bhakti minute so you
really<00:00:57.449> don't<00:00:57.539> have<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.170> many<00:00:58.289> tools

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
really don't have to have too many tools

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.399 
really don't have to have too many tools
for<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.070> a<00:01:00.030> 26<00:01:00.870> metric<00:01:02.270> pretty<00:01:03.270> long<00:01:03.510> drive

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
for this a 26 metric pretty long drive

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.030 
for this a 26 metric pretty long drive
to<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:06.260> 9/16<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> 5/8

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to get down to it a 9/16 and a 5/8

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.960 
to get down to it a 9/16 and a 5/8
wrench<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.320> into<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> sensors<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
wrench to get into the sensors and the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.350 
wrench to get into the sensors and the
drill<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.750> some<00:01:13.080> speedometer<00:01:13.710> cable<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> all

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
drill and some speedometer cable but all

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.179 
drill and some speedometer cable but all
the<00:01:15.479> reviews<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.960> read<00:01:16.080> online<00:01:16.259> people<00:01:17.130> were

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the reviews I read online people were

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.520 
the reviews I read online people were
just<00:01:17.400> talking<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:17.970> how<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.170> better

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
just talking about how much better

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.940 
just talking about how much better
mileage<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.400> got<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.110> it's<00:01:22.110> pretty<00:01:22.290> crazy<00:01:22.590> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
mileage they got and it's pretty crazy I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
mileage they got and it's pretty crazy I
think<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.060> actually<00:01:24.210> helped<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.869> my

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
think it's actually helped out in my

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.649 
think it's actually helped out in my
boost<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> lot<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> power<00:01:26.340> too<00:01:26.790> so

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
boost and a lot of power too so

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810 
boost and a lot of power too so
important<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> little<00:01:28.259> sensor<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.610> hoping

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
important a little sensor I'm hoping

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.280 
important a little sensor I'm hoping
it'll<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> same<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> International

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it'll be the same on the International

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.730 
it'll be the same on the International
engine<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:33.990> I've<00:01:34.170> seen<00:01:34.380> has<00:01:34.560> been<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
engine so the way I've seen has been a

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.260 
engine so the way I've seen has been a
little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.009> easier<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.460> put<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.000> pad

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
little bit easier is put a little pad

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.080 
little bit easier is put a little pad
down<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:36.990> knee<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.259> top<00:01:37.290> where<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.090> jack

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
down put your knee on top where the jack

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.870 
down put your knee on top where the jack
parts<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:41.070> makes<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.340> little<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.610> easier

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
parts are it makes a little bit easier

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.480 
parts are it makes a little bit easier
to<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> but

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
to get to it but

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.780 
to get to it but
the<00:01:45.030> nut<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> socket<00:01:46.950> itself<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.610> going

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the nut for the socket itself is going

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.820 
the nut for the socket itself is going
to<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.940> on<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> top<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:49.050> wrenches<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.620> go

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
to go on the top your wrenches will go

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.670 
to go on the top your wrenches will go
on<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.240> bigger<00:01:51.720> nut<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.260> there's<00:01:52.410> a<00:01:52.470> small

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
on the bigger nut and there's a small

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.890 
on the bigger nut and there's a small
knot<00:01:52.950> under<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> we'll<00:01:54.150> see<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.720> shot

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
knot under it we'll see if we get a shot

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.920 
knot under it we'll see if we get a shot
of<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.670> found<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.940> lot<00:01:57.150> easier<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:57.780> go

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
of it I found it a lot easier if you go

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.550 
of it I found it a lot easier if you go
ahead<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:58.590> your<00:01:58.620> smaller<00:02:00.470> socket<00:02:01.470> on

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
ahead and put your smaller socket on

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.670 
ahead and put your smaller socket on

last put the larger wrench on the bottom
and<00:02:06.110> then<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.320> you'll<00:02:07.470> do<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:07.740> undone

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
and then what you'll do is undone

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.460 
and then what you'll do is undone

if I get my finger into here on this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
if I get my finger into here on this
camera<00:02:13.050> but<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.310> market<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.959> black<00:02:16.440> part

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
camera but the market is the black part

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.860 
camera but the market is the black part
right<00:02:16.950> here<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:17.400> actually<00:02:18.180> stays<00:02:18.570> on<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
right here that actually stays on the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.540 
right here that actually stays on the
trunk<00:02:19.170> there's<00:02:19.530> your<00:02:19.709> sensor<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.430> then

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
trunk there's your sensor and then

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.030 
trunk there's your sensor and then
there's<00:02:20.730> two<00:02:21.030> months<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.590> just<00:02:22.680> break<00:02:22.860> it

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
there's two months and you just break it

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.460 
there's two months and you just break it
loose<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.459> where<00:02:23.580> it'll<00:02:23.670> come<00:02:23.850> out<00:02:24.110> but<00:02:25.110> found

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
loose to where it'll come out but found

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.570 
loose to where it'll come out but found
it<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.680> lot<00:02:25.800> easier<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.580> make<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.630> camera<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:28.110> here

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
it a lot easier I make a camera out here

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.910 
it a lot easier I make a camera out here
if<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:30.030> put<00:02:30.180> your<00:02:30.330> knee<00:02:30.510> down<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:31.350> top<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
if you can put your knee down on top of

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.520 
if you can put your knee down on top of
your<00:02:32.430> jack<00:02:33.209> stands<00:02:33.570> makes<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.959> lot<00:02:34.140> easier<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
your jack stands makes a lot easier to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.170 
your jack stands makes a lot easier to
get<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.680> good<00:02:34.860> stance<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.459> it<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.850> then<00:02:36.060> we're

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
get a good stance on it and then we're

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.540 
get a good stance on it and then we're
going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.330> turn<00:02:36.540> break<00:02:36.870> it<00:02:36.989> loose<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:38.190> then

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
going to turn break it loose and then

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.699 
going to turn break it loose and then
pull<00:02:38.850> your<00:02:39.090> connector<00:02:39.720> off<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.050> top<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.560> just

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
pull your connector off the top it just

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.590 
pull your connector off the top it just
has<00:02:40.860> a<00:02:40.890> little<00:02:41.070> clip<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.360> pull

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
has a little clip that you pull

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.780 
has a little clip that you pull
backwards<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.680> little<00:02:43.950> bit<00:02:44.100> it'll<00:02:44.489> pull

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
backwards just a little bit it'll pull

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.630 
backwards just a little bit it'll pull
right<00:02:44.940> out<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.950> can<00:02:47.070> see<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.310> got<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
right out and as you can see I got the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.180 
right out and as you can see I got the
O's<00:02:50.640> loose<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:52.290> end<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.890> get<00:02:53.070> it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
O's loose the end of it have to get it

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.370 
O's loose the end of it have to get it
out<00:02:53.340> now<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.150> next<00:02:54.450> part<00:02:54.600> you<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.900> do<00:02:55.019> is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
out now the next part you have to do is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.680 
out now the next part you have to do is
underneath<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.489> inch<00:02:59.209> so<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.269> give<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.630> an

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
underneath the inch so to give you an

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.620 
underneath the inch so to give you an
idea<00:03:00.780> where<00:03:01.260> it's<00:03:01.410> at<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.760> bottom<00:03:03.420> of

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
idea where it's at this is the bottom of

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.710 
idea where it's at this is the bottom of
looks<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.650> be<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:05.070> condenser<00:03:06.030> maybe<00:03:06.450> for

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
looks to be the condenser maybe for

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.140 
looks to be the condenser maybe for
their<00:03:06.810> conditioner<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.350> radiator<00:03:08.030> but<00:03:09.030> you

their conditioner the radiator but you
go<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.450> up<00:03:09.660> permit<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:11.010> can<00:03:11.190> follow<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:12.090> big

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
go on up permit it can follow the big

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.199 
go on up permit it can follow the big
hose<00:03:12.660> from<00:03:13.049> your<00:03:13.260> radiator<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> what<00:03:15.060> you're

it<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.209> top<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.720> sensor<00:03:59.109> and<00:03:59.319> take<00:03:59.530> up<00:03:59.709> the

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
it on top of the sensor and take up the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.880 
it on top of the sensor and take up the
sensor<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:01.569> once<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.989> get<00:04:02.140> your<00:04:02.319> sensor<00:04:02.709> out

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
sensor and once you get your sensor out

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.910 
sensor and once you get your sensor out
you'll<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.400> same<00:04:03.430> thing<00:04:03.940> inspect<00:04:04.480> it

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
you'll do the same thing inspect it

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.860 
you'll do the same thing inspect it
let's<00:04:05.920> get<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.099> little<00:04:06.220> bit<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.489> gook<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:06.849> it<00:04:07.000> but

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
let's get a little bit of gook in it but

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.020 
let's get a little bit of gook in it but
nothing<00:04:08.410> compared<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.129> that<00:04:09.280> white<00:04:09.640> one<00:04:09.879> I

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
nothing compared to that white one I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.460 
nothing compared to that white one I
just<00:04:10.120> couldn't<00:04:10.569> get<00:04:10.629> over<00:04:10.690> it's<00:04:11.019> completely

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
just couldn't get over it's completely

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.170 
just couldn't get over it's completely
clogged<00:04:11.799> up<00:04:11.950> we're<00:04:12.670> going<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.849> take<00:04:13.000> some

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
clogged up we're going to take some

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.110 
clogged up we're going to take some
speedometer<00:04:13.810> cable<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.709> we'll<00:04:15.670> clean<00:04:15.879> these

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
speedometer cable and we'll clean these

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.289 
speedometer cable and we'll clean these
things<00:04:16.359> up<00:04:17.340> sorry<00:04:18.340> about<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.669> extreme<00:04:19.030> wind

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
things up sorry about the extreme wind

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.240 
things up sorry about the extreme wind
again<00:04:19.660> but<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.199> take

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
again but just take

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:45.700 
again but just take

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
I try to feed it through the and I ended

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.650 
I try to feed it through the and I ended
up<00:04:45.800> having<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.160> cut<00:04:46.640> small<00:04:47.060> parts<00:04:47.480> of<00:04:47.570> the

speedometer cables and more tea break
later

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
later

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
there goes lessons instead she got this

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.530 
there goes lessons instead she got this
thing<00:04:59.360> bed<00:04:59.660> 3<00:04:59.990> action<00:05:00.560> she's<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:00.920> drills

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:20.820 

around<00:05:05.540> the<00:05:06.080> grill<00:05:13.930> let<00:05:14.930> speedometer<00:05:15.590> day

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:30.509 

he's<00:05:21.830> working<00:05:22.040> around<00:05:22.340> for<00:05:22.790> a<00:05:22.820> while

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:30.519 

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:44.290 

let's<00:05:31.519> pray<00:05:31.879> a<00:05:31.909> little<00:05:32.029> bit<00:05:32.239> more

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.360 

and<00:05:44.390> while<00:05:44.900> you're<00:05:45.140> turning

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
and while you're turning

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:54.070 
and while you're turning
it<00:05:46.820> out<00:05:52.060> spray<00:05:53.060> some<00:05:53.330> more<00:05:53.480> brake<00:05:53.750> cleaner

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
it out spray some more brake cleaner

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:03.780 
it out spray some more brake cleaner
through<00:06:01.180> just<00:06:02.180> looking<00:06:02.419> a<00:06:02.510> lot<00:06:02.660> better

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
through just looking a lot better

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
through just looking a lot better
the<00:06:04.790> ends<00:06:05.180> are<00:06:05.240> looking<00:06:05.600> good<00:06:07.690> I'm<00:06:08.690> pretty

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
the ends are looking good I'm pretty

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.480 
the ends are looking good I'm pretty
good<00:06:09.050> now<00:06:09.260> your<00:06:09.440> sensor<00:06:09.830> on<00:06:09.979> the<00:06:10.100> other<00:06:10.250> hand

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
good now your sensor on the other hand

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.230 
good now your sensor on the other hand
you<00:06:10.669> have<00:06:10.790> a<00:06:10.910> lot<00:06:11.150> more<00:06:11.389> delicate<00:06:12.520> the<00:06:13.520> sensors

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
you have a lot more delicate the sensors

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.939 
you have a lot more delicate the sensors
I<00:06:14.479> think<00:06:14.780> you<00:06:14.840> like<00:06:15.050> 80<00:06:15.229> bucks<00:06:15.320> are<00:06:15.770> pretty

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
I think you like 80 bucks are pretty

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.219 
I think you like 80 bucks are pretty
expensive<00:06:16.280> so<00:06:16.639> I<00:06:16.669> usually<00:06:16.850> take<00:06:17.210> a<00:06:17.270> star<00:06:17.960> bit

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
expensive so I usually take a star bit

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.909 
expensive so I usually take a star bit
and<00:06:18.560> this<00:06:19.430> one<00:06:20.139> I'm<00:06:21.139> just<00:06:21.169> gonna<00:06:21.350> size<00:06:21.650> for<00:06:21.860> a

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
and this one I'm just gonna size for a

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.500 
and this one I'm just gonna size for a
mine<00:06:22.070> or<00:06:22.100> not

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.270 

but<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.320> works<00:06:25.470> out<00:06:25.650> pretty<00:06:25.800> good<00:06:25.950> because

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
but it works out pretty good because

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.220 
but it works out pretty good because
it's<00:06:26.490> coarse<00:06:26.910> and<00:06:27.510> you<00:06:27.660> can<00:06:27.810> just<00:06:27.960> kind<00:06:28.140> of

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
it's coarse and you can just kind of

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.420 
it's coarse and you can just kind of
work<00:06:28.350> it<00:06:28.560> around<00:06:28.590> but<00:06:29.070> he's<00:06:29.160> got<00:06:29.310> the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
work it around but he's got the

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:36.620 
work it around but he's got the
diaphragm<00:06:29.910> in<00:06:30.120> it<00:06:34.910> so<00:06:35.910> usually<00:06:36.240> just<00:06:36.360> kind<00:06:36.480> of

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
diaphragm in it so usually just kind of

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.830 
diaphragm in it so usually just kind of
work<00:06:36.810> real<00:06:37.080> slow<00:06:37.380> with<00:06:37.620> it<00:06:37.800> barely<00:06:38.730> shoot<00:06:39.390> this

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
work real slow with it barely shoot this

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.250 
work real slow with it barely shoot this
at<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.200> low<00:06:40.440> volume<00:06:41.300> and<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:42.570> it<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:42.900> let<00:06:43.020> it<00:06:43.140> come

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
at a low volume and to it to let it come

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.040 
at a low volume and to it to let it come
back<00:06:43.470> out

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
back out

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.070 
back out
just<00:06:46.050> keep<00:06:46.260> working<00:06:46.440> around<00:06:46.740> with<00:06:47.130> it<00:06:48.080> just

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
just keep working around with it just

00:06:49.080 --> 00:07:23.049 
just keep working around with it just
keep<00:06:49.200> it<00:06:49.470> in<00:06:49.560> mind<00:06:49.770> not<00:06:50.040> to<00:06:50.220> go

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:23.059 

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:25.760 

so<00:07:24.059> now<00:07:24.300> that<00:07:24.360> you<00:07:24.569> get<00:07:24.749> it<00:07:24.870> cleaned<00:07:25.169> out<00:07:25.379> on

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
so now that you get it cleaned out on

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.649 
so now that you get it cleaned out on
the<00:07:26.370> sensor<00:07:26.729> in<00:07:26.819> the<00:07:26.909> tube<00:07:27.089> you<00:07:27.330> need<00:07:27.479> to<00:07:27.569> go

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:27.659 
the sensor in the tube you need to go

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:30.260 
the sensor in the tube you need to go
back<00:07:27.870> over<00:07:27.900> the<00:07:28.199> truck<00:07:28.559> and<00:07:29.520> you'll<00:07:30.029> need<00:07:30.210> to

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270 
back over the truck and you'll need to

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.200 
back over the truck and you'll need to
get<00:07:30.809> the<00:07:31.169> bracket<00:07:31.740> itself<00:07:32.069> clean<00:07:32.490> because<00:07:32.939> on

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:33.210 
get the bracket itself clean because on

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.029 
get the bracket itself clean because on
that<00:07:33.360> white<00:07:33.539> truck<00:07:33.779> that<00:07:33.990> we<00:07:34.080> just<00:07:34.259> did<00:07:34.469> it<00:07:34.860> was

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 
that white truck that we just did it was

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:37.939 
that white truck that we just did it was
he<00:07:35.189> completely<00:07:35.879> clogged<00:07:36.360> up<00:07:36.509> there<00:07:36.770> but<00:07:37.770> after

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:37.949 
he completely clogged up there but after

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:40.909 
he completely clogged up there but after
you<00:07:38.189> do<00:07:38.309> that<00:07:38.520> pop<00:07:38.819> your<00:07:39.059> tube<00:07:39.629> back<00:07:39.870> on<00:07:40.139> it's

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
you do that pop your tube back on it's

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:42.679 
you do that pop your tube back on it's
easier<00:07:41.159> to<00:07:41.309> start<00:07:41.520> the<00:07:41.759> tube<00:07:41.999> from<00:07:42.270> the<00:07:42.449> top

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:42.689 
easier to start the tube from the top

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:44.779 
easier to start the tube from the top
and<00:07:42.960> then<00:07:43.319> go<00:07:43.499> down<00:07:43.680> to<00:07:43.740> the<00:07:43.979> manifold<00:07:44.580> and

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:44.789 
and then go down to the manifold and

go<00:07:52.949> back<00:07:53.159> put<00:07:53.430> your<00:07:53.460> sensor<00:07:53.849> back<00:07:53.969> on<00:07:54.210> make

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:54.509 
go back put your sensor back on make

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:56.209 
go back put your sensor back on make
sure<00:07:54.689> to<00:07:54.809> reconnect<00:07:54.960> the<00:07:55.319> sensor<00:07:55.740> and<00:07:56.069> that's

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:56.219 
sure to reconnect the sensor and that's

00:07:56.219 --> 00:07:56.719 
sure to reconnect the sensor and that's
about<00:07:56.370> it

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:56.729 
about it

00:07:56.729 --> 00:07:59.450 
about it
but<00:07:57.419> it<00:07:58.050> made<00:07:58.499> a<00:07:58.529> big<00:07:58.740> difference<00:07:58.800> on<00:07:59.309> the
