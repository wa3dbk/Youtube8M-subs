00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
Here I am having fun in my garage

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.220 
Here I am having fun in my garage
showing<00:00:16.090> all<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.359> different<00:00:16.390> brake<00:00:16.869> bleeders

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
showing all the different brake bleeders

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.490 
showing all the different brake bleeders
that<00:00:17.410> we<00:00:17.529> got<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.630> first<00:00:19.869> one<00:00:20.020> I<00:00:20.050> wanted<00:00:20.439> to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
that we got the first one I wanted to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.010 
that we got the first one I wanted to
show<00:00:20.770> you<00:00:20.829> is<00:00:21.400> this<00:00:21.730> one<00:00:21.789> I'm<00:00:22.300> not<00:00:22.570> gonna<00:00:22.689> name

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.020 
show you is this one I'm not gonna name

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.350 
show you is this one I'm not gonna name
the<00:00:23.230> manufacturer<00:00:23.919> but<00:00:24.640> it's<00:00:24.820> a<00:00:24.880> very<00:00:25.060> simple

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
the manufacturer but it's a very simple

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.650 
the manufacturer but it's a very simple
design<00:00:25.860> you<00:00:26.860> just<00:00:26.890> basically<00:00:27.279> put<00:00:27.669> on<00:00:28.180> any<00:00:28.449> of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
design you just basically put on any of

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.400 
design you just basically put on any of
these<00:00:28.779> different<00:00:29.289> adapters<00:00:29.800> and<00:00:31.110> you<00:00:32.110> just

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
these different adapters and you just

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.950 
these different adapters and you just
pump<00:00:33.160> the<00:00:33.220> brakes<00:00:33.519> put<00:00:34.210> it<00:00:34.330> right<00:00:34.449> here<00:00:34.510> on<00:00:34.720> the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
pump the brakes put it right here on the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.360 
pump the brakes put it right here on the
brake<00:00:35.140> bleeder<00:00:35.410> is<00:00:35.800> in<00:00:36.339> that<00:00:36.460> set<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:37.540> then

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
brake bleeder is in that set and then

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.710 
brake bleeder is in that set and then
then<00:00:39.370> I'm<00:00:39.519> sure<00:00:39.699> everybody<00:00:40.120> has<00:00:40.300> seen<00:00:40.480> this

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
then I'm sure everybody has seen this

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.310 
then I'm sure everybody has seen this
one<00:00:40.930> this<00:00:41.710> one<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.040> the<00:00:43.000> actual<00:00:43.150> pump<00:00:43.629> pumping

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
one this one is the actual pump pumping

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.149 
one this one is the actual pump pumping
mechanism<00:00:45.239> seems<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.479> same<00:00:46.659> concept<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.379> put

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
mechanism seems the same concept you put

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.609 
mechanism seems the same concept you put
the<00:00:48.309> holes<00:00:48.519> right<00:00:48.699> here<00:00:48.879> and<00:00:49.390> then<00:00:50.350> you<00:00:50.470> attach

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619 
the holes right here and then you attach

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:55.320 
the holes right here and then you attach
it<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:52.059> is<00:00:52.269> actually<00:00:52.449> four<00:00:52.989> ounces<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:55.150> then

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
it this is actually four ounces and then

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.289 
it this is actually four ounces and then
here's<00:00:55.629> another<00:00:55.869> one<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.260> I<00:00:56.320> made<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:58.180> like

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
here's another one that I made just like

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.259 
here's another one that I made just like
my<00:00:58.449> pictures<00:00:58.839> Illustrated<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.640> actually<00:01:01.089> has

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
my pictures Illustrated it actually has

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.730 
my pictures Illustrated it actually has
a<00:01:02.309> valve<00:01:03.309> at<00:01:03.549> the<00:01:03.580> end<00:01:03.879> of<00:01:04.059> it<00:01:04.180> as<00:01:05.049> everybody

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
a valve at the end of it as everybody

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.899 
a valve at the end of it as everybody
can<00:01:05.920> see<00:01:06.130> and<00:01:06.810> very<00:01:07.810> simple<00:01:08.140> design<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.760> I

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
can see and very simple design like I

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.730 
can see and very simple design like I
said<00:01:10.180> I<00:01:10.420> went<00:01:10.570> to<00:01:10.659> Home<00:01:11.080> Depot<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.530> bought

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
said I went to Home Depot and bought

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.240 
said I went to Home Depot and bought
these<00:01:11.920> parts<00:01:12.340> it<00:01:13.150> has<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.330> glass<00:01:13.720> jar<00:01:14.200> I<00:01:14.439> think

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
these parts it has a glass jar I think

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.630 
these parts it has a glass jar I think
this<00:01:15.430> thing<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.670> like<00:01:16.980> 60<00:01:17.980> ounces<00:01:18.160> or

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
this thing is like 60 ounces or

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.220 
this thing is like 60 ounces or
something<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.120> mean<00:01:19.270> it's<00:01:19.450> humongous<00:01:20.080> in

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
something I mean it's humongous in

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.720 
something I mean it's humongous in
comparison<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.980> ones<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.220> they<00:01:21.520> make

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
comparison to the ones that they make

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.270 
comparison to the ones that they make
and<00:01:22.600> then<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.840> just<00:01:23.140> basically<00:01:23.290> seal<00:01:23.860> it<00:01:24.070> like

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
and then you just basically seal it like

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.530 
and then you just basically seal it like
this<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.750> you<00:01:25.870> attach<00:01:26.200> this<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:27.460> here<00:01:27.790> and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
this then you attach this to here and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.390 
this then you attach this to here and
then<00:01:28.720> you<00:01:28.870> just<00:01:28.900> pump<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.380> brakes<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.010> end

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
then you just pump the brakes in the end

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.790 
then you just pump the brakes in the end
of<00:01:30.610> fluid<00:01:31.060> will<00:01:31.240> never<00:01:31.420> come<00:01:31.659> back<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:32.020> and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
of fluid will never come back in and

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.280 
of fluid will never come back in and
very<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.460> know<00:01:33.520> very<00:01:33.610> simple<00:01:34.150> design<00:01:34.420> again

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
very you know very simple design again

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.870 
very you know very simple design again
I'm<00:01:35.500> not<00:01:35.650> too<00:01:35.860> sure<00:01:36.040> if<00:01:36.159> I'm<00:01:36.280> gonna<00:01:36.490> be<00:01:36.640> selling

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
I'm not too sure if I'm gonna be selling

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.770 
I'm not too sure if I'm gonna be selling
these<00:01:37.150> in<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.420> future

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
these in the future

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.860 
these in the future
but<00:01:38.620> you<00:01:39.310> can<00:01:39.430> make<00:01:39.580> one<00:01:39.790> yourself<00:01:39.970> if<00:01:40.720> you

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
but you can make one yourself if you

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.649 
but you can make one yourself if you
really<00:01:41.170> want<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.470> to<00:01:41.550> so<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.770> course<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
really want it to so then of course the

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.860 
really want it to so then of course the
one<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.020> I'm<00:01:47.170> selling<00:01:47.620> is<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:49.090> actually<00:01:49.479> this

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
one that I'm selling is is actually this

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.870 
one that I'm selling is is actually this
one<00:01:50.400> very<00:01:51.400> very<00:01:51.729> simple<00:01:52.150> design<00:01:53.880> basically

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
one very very simple design basically

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.240 
one very very simple design basically
how<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.270> works<00:01:55.299> is<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:56.229> just<00:01:57.159> take<00:01:57.580> out<00:01:59.250> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
how it works is you just take out the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.469 
how it works is you just take out the
cap<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.870> attach<00:02:05.860> this<00:02:06.479> ten

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
cap and then you attach this ten

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.660 
cap and then you attach this ten
millimeter<00:02:07.960> wrench<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.869> put<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.670> this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
millimeter wrench you put this on this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.820 
millimeter wrench you put this on this
thing<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:14.379> bleeder<00:02:14.799> screw<00:02:15.540> has<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:17.530> very

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
thing on the bleeder screw has a very

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.790 
thing on the bleeder screw has a very
tight<00:02:18.099> squeeze<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:19.629> then<00:02:19.959> you<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.290> pump<00:02:20.499> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
tight squeeze and then you just pump it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.570 
tight squeeze and then you just pump it
pump<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.930> nothing<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.080> it<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:28.160> then<00:02:28.400> this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
pump it nothing to it and then this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.260 
pump it nothing to it and then this
force<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.210> fluid<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.630> go<00:02:29.810> in<00:02:30.970> into<00:02:31.970> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
force of the fluid to go in into the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.580 
force of the fluid to go in into the
actual<00:02:32.630> caliper<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:34.310> any<00:02:34.490> dirt<00:02:35.240> or<00:02:35.590> bubbles

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
actual caliper then any dirt or bubbles

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.330 
actual caliper then any dirt or bubbles
will<00:02:36.800> go<00:02:36.950> up<00:02:37.130> up<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.850> line<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:40.280> know

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
will go up up the line and you know

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.520 
will go up up the line and you know
that's<00:02:40.520> basically<00:02:40.700> yet<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.540> mean<00:02:42.320> there's

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
that's basically yet I mean there's

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.500 
that's basically yet I mean there's
really<00:02:42.680> nothing<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.150> then<00:02:44.270> once<00:02:44.420> you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
really nothing to it and then once you

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.630 
really nothing to it and then once you
finish<00:02:44.660> pumping<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.680> close<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.160> back<00:02:46.310> up<00:02:46.340> and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
finish pumping you close it back up and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.390 
finish pumping you close it back up and
then<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.170> unattach<00:02:49.100> this<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:52.010> he<00:02:52.100> has<00:02:52.190> such<00:02:52.370> a

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
then you unattach this and he has such a

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880 
then you unattach this and he has such a
tight<00:02:52.670> fit<00:02:53.540> it's<00:02:54.080> hard<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.350> take<00:02:54.500> off<00:02:54.650> the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
tight fit it's hard to take off the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.880 
tight fit it's hard to take off the
bleeder<00:02:55.160> screw<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.540> then<00:02:56.690> that's<00:02:56.900> it<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.440> put

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
bleeder screw and then that's it you put

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.490 
bleeder screw and then that's it you put
your<00:02:58.070> cap<00:02:58.370> back<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.410> that's<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:02.500> also

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
your cap back on and that's it and also

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.170 
your cap back on and that's it and also
I<00:03:03.710> wanted<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.100> tell<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.400> back<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:04.940> one

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
like that because actually the fact that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.130 
like that because actually the fact that
it's<00:03:46.130> made<00:03:46.310> out<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.520> glass<00:03:46.730> and<00:03:46.940> stuff<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.989> got

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
to find something that's adaptable for

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.750 
to find something that's adaptable for
this<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:51.260> then<00:03:51.410> these<00:03:51.620> two<00:03:51.950> these<00:03:51.980> two<00:03:52.340> little

this and then these two these two little
screws<00:03:52.940> in<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.480> hoses<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:54.080> stuff<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.160> the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
screws in the hoses and stuff it in the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.940 
screws in the hoses and stuff it in the
valve<00:03:55.520> I<00:03:56.420> mean<00:03:57.200> one<00:03:57.350> that<00:03:57.500> once<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.739> start

valve I mean one that once you start

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.740 
valve I mean one that once you start
calculating<00:03:58.130> everything<00:03:58.820> out<00:03:59.120> how<00:03:59.450> much<00:03:59.600> it

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
calculating everything out how much it

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.229 
calculating everything out how much it
will<00:03:59.840> cost<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:01.580> might<00:04:01.760> as<00:04:01.820> well<00:04:01.850> just<00:04:02.090> buy

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
will cost you you might as well just buy

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.380 
will cost you you might as well just buy
