the<00:00:58.030> truck<00:00:58.270> is<00:00:58.450> by<00:00:58.989> choosing<00:00:59.350> it<00:00:59.649> you<00:01:00.309> can<00:01:00.489> see

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
the truck is by choosing it you can see

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.760 
the truck is by choosing it you can see
the<00:01:00.790> part<00:01:01.030> number<00:01:01.329> you<00:01:01.360> can<00:01:01.600> see<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.899> MSRP<00:01:02.350> and

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
molded running boards to the truck okay

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.779 
molded running boards to the truck okay
the<00:01:08.590> other<00:01:08.619> way<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.219> can<00:01:09.369> do<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:09.609> is<00:01:09.759> to

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
the other way that you can do it is to

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.179 
the other way that you can do it is to
simply<00:01:10.240> drag<00:01:10.509> and<00:01:10.659> drop<00:01:10.719> so<00:01:11.530> now<00:01:11.740> we're<00:01:11.979> seeing

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
simply drag and drop so now we're seeing

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.429 
simply drag and drop so now we're seeing
how<00:01:12.549> these<00:01:12.819> three<00:01:13.179> accessory<00:01:13.749> combinations

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
how these three accessory combinations

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.800 
how these three accessory combinations
look<00:01:14.679> together<00:01:15.039> you<00:01:15.340> can<00:01:15.520> see<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.880> wheel<00:01:16.090> with

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
look together you can see the wheel with

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.919 
look together you can see the wheel with
the<00:01:17.049> side<00:01:17.799> you<00:01:18.310> know<00:01:18.429> step<00:01:18.759> here<00:01:19.090> as<00:01:19.209> well<00:01:19.749> as

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
the side you know step here as well as

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:22.080 
the side you know step here as well as
that<00:01:20.109> wheel<00:01:20.319> guard<00:01:20.649> so<00:01:21.429> maybe<00:01:21.639> we<00:01:21.819> want<00:01:21.939> to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
that wheel guard so maybe we want to

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.779 
that wheel guard so maybe we want to
look<00:01:22.209> at<00:01:22.359> a<00:01:22.389> tonneau<00:01:22.719> cover<00:01:23.049> and<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:24.549> want<00:01:24.729> to

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
look at a tonneau cover and we want to

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.099 
look at a tonneau cover and we want to
see<00:01:24.909> what<00:01:25.060> that<00:01:25.149> might<00:01:25.329> look<00:01:25.389> like<00:01:25.600> on<00:01:25.990> the

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:26.109 
see what that might look like on the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.260 
see what that might look like on the
vehicle<00:01:26.139> you<00:01:27.069> know<00:01:27.189> that<00:01:27.459> is<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.729> same<00:01:27.939> color

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
vehicle you know that is the same color

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.539 
vehicle you know that is the same color
as<00:01:28.569> the<00:01:28.869> vehicle<00:01:28.899> we<00:01:29.619> have<00:01:29.799> alternative

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
as the vehicle we have alternative

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.539 
as the vehicle we have alternative
options<00:01:31.149> here's<00:01:31.779> a<00:01:31.869> black<00:01:32.200> fold<00:01:32.619> up<00:01:32.829> so<00:01:33.069> we'll

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
options here's a black fold up so we'll

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.279 
options here's a black fold up so we'll
look<00:01:33.639> at<00:01:33.759> that<00:01:33.939> instead<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:34.810> get<00:01:34.959> a<00:01:34.990> sense

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
look at that instead so you get a sense

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:36.839 
look at that instead so you get a sense
of<00:01:35.469> do<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.679> need<00:01:35.920> want<00:01:36.219> the<00:01:36.369> silver<00:01:36.729> that

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:36.849 
of do I need want the silver that

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:39.199 
of do I need want the silver that
matches<00:01:37.270> my<00:01:37.299> car<00:01:37.689> do<00:01:38.020> I<00:01:38.079> like<00:01:38.319> the<00:01:38.499> black

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
matches my car do I like the black

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.089 
matches my car do I like the black
suppose<00:01:40.209> it<00:01:40.359> depends<00:01:40.659> on<00:01:40.810> what<00:01:41.109> other<00:01:41.259> accents

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
suppose it depends on what other accents
