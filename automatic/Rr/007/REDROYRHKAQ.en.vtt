family and when I started thinking about

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.060 
family and when I started thinking about
all<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.850> design<00:00:42.180> challenges<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.860> in

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
all the design challenges that I have in

all the design challenges that I have in
this<00:00:44.250> space<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:45.000> realized<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> lot<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.840> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a little bare right now because after I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.560 
a little bare right now because after I
took<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> Christmas<00:01:39.540> decorations

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
took down all the Christmas decorations

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.399 
took down all the Christmas decorations
I<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:41.250> wanted<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> nice<00:01:42.000> blank<00:01:42.899> slate

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
I just wanted to have a nice blank slate

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460 
I just wanted to have a nice blank slate
to<00:01:43.649> start<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:44.630> these<00:01:45.630> rooms<00:01:45.960> are<00:01:46.110> connected

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
to start with these rooms are connected

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.520 
to start with these rooms are connected
which<00:01:46.950> gives<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.700> nice<00:01:47.909> open<00:01:48.450> feeling<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.290> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
which gives a nice open feeling but it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.060 
which gives a nice open feeling but it
also<00:01:49.710> creates<00:01:50.189> some<00:01:50.490> design<00:01:50.939> challenges<00:01:51.540> too

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
also creates some design challenges too

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.069 
also creates some design challenges too
one<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> main<00:01:53.579> problems<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.420> have<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.720> our

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
one of the main problems I have with our

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.800 
one of the main problems I have with our
dining<00:01:55.530> room<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> also<00:01:56.549> serves<00:01:57.299> as

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
dining room is that it also serves as

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.819 
dining room is that it also serves as
the<00:01:58.200> entryway<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> our<00:01:59.100> home<00:01:59.990> no<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.170> uses<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the entryway to our home no one uses the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.340 
the entryway to our home no one uses the
