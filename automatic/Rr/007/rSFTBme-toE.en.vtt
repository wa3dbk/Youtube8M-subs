00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
beginning of the series I remember

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.149 
beginning of the series I remember
episode<00:01:53.970> 1<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.750> he<00:01:55.049> had<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.380> silent<00:01:55.890> look

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159
