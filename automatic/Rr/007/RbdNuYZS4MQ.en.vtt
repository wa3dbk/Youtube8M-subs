this<00:00:07.189> sparkplug<00:00:07.809> we<00:00:08.809> have<00:00:08.960> our<00:00:09.139> coil<00:00:09.500> here<00:00:09.860> and

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
this sparkplug we have our coil here and

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.919 
this sparkplug we have our coil here and
we've<00:00:10.370> already<00:00:10.519> mentioned<00:00:10.790> that<00:00:11.240> 12<00:00:11.540> volts

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
we've already mentioned that 12 volts

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.680 
we've already mentioned that 12 volts
and<00:00:12.019> about<00:00:12.230> 5<00:00:12.440> amps<00:00:12.799> enters<00:00:13.070> into<00:00:13.219> the<00:00:13.400> coil

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:13.690 
and about 5 amps enters into the coil

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.540 
and about 5 amps enters into the coil
and<00:00:14.690> what<00:00:15.320> happens<00:00:15.620> which<00:00:15.769> is<00:00:15.889> fascinating<00:00:16.129> is

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
and what happens which is fascinating is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.700 
and what happens which is fascinating is
that<00:00:16.580> there's<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:16.910> winding<00:00:17.660> inside<00:00:18.110> this<00:00:18.350> coil

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
that there's a winding inside this coil

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.010

it stays within the watts that it has to
work<00:01:01.100> with<00:01:01.159> so<00:01:02.059> that<00:01:02.179> means<00:01:02.389> that<00:01:02.510> what's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
work with so that means that what's

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.759 
work with so that means that what's
going<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:02.899> happen<00:01:03.170> is<00:01:03.289> she's<00:01:03.440> going<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.679> be

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.290 
the quality of the wire itself all
contribute<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.770> how<00:04:58.069> well<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.610> coil<00:04:58.879> handles

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
contribute to how well the coil handles

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.420 
contribute to how well the coil handles
heat<00:04:59.479> how<00:05:00.199> much<00:05:00.379> voltage<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.860> can<00:05:00.889> produce<00:05:01.099> and

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
heat how much voltage it can produce and

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.589 
heat how much voltage it can produce and
how<00:05:01.909> fast<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.479> can<00:05:02.599> refresh<00:05:03.169> after<00:05:04.009> its<00:05:04.129> fired

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599

so<00:05:05.599> what<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:05.810> we<00:05:05.840> learn<00:05:05.960> today<00:05:06.310> we've<00:05:07.310> learned

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
so what do we learn today we've learned

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.860 
so what do we learn today we've learned
that<00:05:07.669> our<00:05:07.699> ignition<00:05:08.180> coil<00:05:08.389> is<00:05:08.569> really<00:05:08.840> a

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
that our ignition coil is really a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.809 
that our ignition coil is really a
transformer<00:05:09.710> that<00:05:09.860> takes<00:05:10.190> voltage<00:05:10.639> and

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
transformer that takes voltage and

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.700 
transformer that takes voltage and
amperage<00:05:11.060> as<00:05:11.300> it's<00:05:11.539> available<00:05:11.659> and<00:05:12.199> converts

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
amperage as it's available and converts

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.469 
amperage as it's available and converts
them<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:12.919> a<00:05:13.009> voltage<00:05:13.490> that's<00:05:13.669> enough<00:05:13.940> to<00:05:14.240> jump

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
them to a voltage that's enough to jump

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.659 
them to a voltage that's enough to jump
