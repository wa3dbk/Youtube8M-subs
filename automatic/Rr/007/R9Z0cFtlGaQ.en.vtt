00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
using to that's still attached to the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.990 
using to that's still attached to the
headphones<00:00:23.460> rap<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.140> head<00:00:25.350> thing<00:00:26.000> I'm

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
headphones rap like the head thing I'm

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
headphones rap like the head thing I'm
going<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> take<00:00:27.539> both<00:00:28.380> sides<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> string<00:00:29.310> them

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
going to take both sides and string them

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.310 
going to take both sides and string them
through<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.000> opposite<00:00:30.599> ways<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.439> stream<00:00:33.320> 11

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
through the opposite ways so I stream 11

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.580 
through the opposite ways so I stream 11
way<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.360> string<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> other<00:00:36.840> side<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
way and string the other side of the

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.240 
way and string the other side of the
stream<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:39.059> makes<00:00:39.270> any<00:00:39.450> sense<00:00:40.250> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
stream the up that makes any sense so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.600 
stream the up that makes any sense so
it'll<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:43.290> need<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> string<00:00:44.460> too

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it'll look like I need the string too

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.200 
it'll look like I need the string too
long<00:00:46.489> it'll<00:00:47.489> look<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:54.059> see

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
long it'll look like this you can see

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
long it'll look like this you can see
that<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.600> then<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.289> pull<00:00:55.710> them

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that and then you just pull them

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.930 
that and then you just pull them
crisscross<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.670> then

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
crisscross so it's like that and then

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.320 
crisscross so it's like that and then
you<00:01:03.390> tie<00:01:03.690> tight<00:01:04.250> so<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.309> many<00:01:05.760> times<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
you tie tight so as many times as you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450 
you tie tight so as many times as you
want<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.260> better<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.220> my

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
want but more on them better I in my

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.320 
want but more on them better I in my
opinion<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.140> then<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:11.010> extra<00:01:11.760> support<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
opinion and then for extra support you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.280 
opinion and then for extra support you
could<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.200> clear<00:01:13.530> nail<00:01:13.710> polish<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290
