flavor and richness to the chakra fungal
and<00:00:58.620> let's<00:00:58.920> go<00:00:59.489> into<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> venture<00:01:00.649> first<00:01:01.649> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and let's go into the venture first of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.539 
and let's go into the venture first of
all<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.760> measuring<00:01:03.660> rice<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.890> daal

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
all will be measuring rice and daal

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
all will be measuring rice and daal
together<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:07.280> cook<00:01:08.280> both<00:01:08.880> together<00:01:10.369> with<00:01:15.770> 4

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
together and cook both together with 4

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.370 
together and cook both together with 4
to<00:01:16.979> 5<00:01:17.009> cups<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.549> water

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.940 

so<00:01:22.380> both<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:22.979> go<00:01:23.159> together<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:25.530> will

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so both will go together and that will

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.210 
so both will go together and that will
be<00:01:27.080> washed<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:31.520> four<00:01:32.520> cups<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> water<00:01:33.509> for

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
be washed and four cups of water for

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.109 
be washed and four cups of water for
this<00:01:35.220> measurement<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.540> cup<00:01:37.909> one<00:01:38.909> had<00:01:39.060> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
this measurement of one cup one had a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.770 
this measurement of one cup one had a
quarter<00:01:39.390> cup<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.720> rice<00:01:40.440> and<00:01:40.770> dal<00:01:41.100> mixture<00:01:41.780> and

quarter cup of rice and dal mixture and

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.109 
quarter cup of rice and dal mixture and
that<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.380> measurement<00:01:43.740> will<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.490> this

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.230 

wash<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> rice<00:01:55.069> slightly<00:01:56.069> just<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.909> time

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
wash the rice slightly just one time

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:06.830 
wash the rice slightly just one time
washing<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.979> more<00:01:59.250> than<00:01:59.429> enough<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:05.569> 4<00:02:06.569> cups

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
of now this will go straight into the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.960 
of now this will go straight into the
rice<00:02:12.840> cooker<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:16.799> ensure<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.430> everything

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
rice cooker just ensure that everything

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.610 
rice cooker just ensure that everything
is<00:02:18.209> pushed<00:02:18.480> into<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.049> water<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:21.410> cook<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
is pushed into the water and cook the

is pushed into the water and cook the
rice<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.549> with<00:02:24.420> water<00:02:24.690> now<00:02:25.560> after<00:02:26.489> cooking

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
rice the with water now after cooking

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.350 
rice the with water now after cooking
the<00:02:27.120> rice<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.049> daal<00:02:28.470> together<00:02:28.920> keep<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.030> aside

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the rice and daal together keep it aside

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.330 
the rice and daal together keep it aside
and<00:02:31.910> now<00:02:32.910> we'll<00:02:33.630> be<00:02:33.780> doing<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.230> mixing<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
and now we'll be doing the mixing of the

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.750 
and now we'll be doing the mixing of the
jaggery<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:38.400> mix<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.700> jaggery<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:41.459> have<00:02:41.640> to

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
jaggery to mix the jaggery you have to

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.470 
jaggery to mix the jaggery you have to
add<00:02:42.290> about<00:02:43.760> 3/4<00:02:44.760> cup<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> water<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:47.120> as<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.269> told

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
add about 3/4 cup of water and as I told

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.170 
add about 3/4 cup of water and as I told
you<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.470> measure<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.910> jaggery

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
you you have to measure the jaggery

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.720 
you you have to measure the jaggery
powder<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.620> will<00:02:52.799> be<00:02:52.920> 1<00:02:53.670> cup<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.260> jaggery

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
powder and that will be 1 cup of jaggery

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.290 
powder and that will be 1 cup of jaggery
switch<00:02:56.730> on<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> stove

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.320 

now<00:03:02.800> if<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:04.010> if<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.700> had<00:03:04.790> powdered<00:03:05.000> the

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
now if you if you had powdered the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.199 
now if you if you had powdered the
jaggery<00:03:05.599> then<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.409> is<00:03:06.530> easier<00:03:06.860> for<00:03:06.920> us<00:03:07.190> to<00:03:07.220> cook

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
jaggery then it is easier for us to cook

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.300 
jaggery then it is easier for us to cook
the<00:03:09.010> jaggery<00:03:10.010> faster<00:03:11.470> once<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.799> jaggery<00:03:13.069> is

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
the jaggery faster once the jaggery is

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.500 
the jaggery faster once the jaggery is
dissolved<00:03:13.819> I'd<00:03:14.780> listen<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.190> jaggery<00:03:17.150> when

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
dissolved I'd listen to the jaggery when

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.009 
dissolved I'd listen to the jaggery when
it<00:03:17.629> is<00:03:17.750> getting<00:03:18.140> cooked<00:03:18.319> -<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:20.030> once<00:03:20.360> like

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
it is getting cooked - and once like

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.199 
it is getting cooked - and once like
this<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:23.060> salt<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.680> starts<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:26.000> water

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
this the salt and starts the water

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.289 
this the salt and starts the water
starts<00:03:26.599> bubbling<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:28.040> can<00:03:28.220> add<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:29.799> rice<00:03:30.799> dal

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
starts bubbling you can add the rice dal

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.680 
starts bubbling you can add the rice dal
mixture<00:03:33.670> now<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.989> jaggery<00:03:36.260> is<00:03:37.540> water<00:03:38.540> is

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
mixture now the jaggery is water is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.770 
mixture now the jaggery is water is
bubbling<00:03:38.930> it's<00:03:39.590> a<00:03:39.680> great<00:03:39.890> mixture<00:03:40.540> at<00:03:41.540> this

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
bubbling it's a great mixture at this
