00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.510 
so eggs from I put some golf balls in
there<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.280> heard<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:37.500> had<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> our

the<00:02:34.350> birds<00:02:34.530> are<00:02:34.650> coming<00:02:34.770> there<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.460> just

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the birds are coming there so I just

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.590 
the birds are coming there so I just
throw<00:02:36.270> over<00:02:36.300> tarp<00:02:38.030> wired<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.210> down<00:02:39.390> other

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
throw over tarp wired it down other

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.980 
throw over tarp wired it down other
corners<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.350> left<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:41.250> enough<00:02:41.610> space<00:02:41.960> about<00:02:42.960> a

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
corners I left just enough space about a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.530 
corners I left just enough space about a
12<00:02:43.830> by<00:02:44.040> 12<00:02:44.280> inch<00:02:44.460> area<00:02:44.760> for<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> birds<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.420> get

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
12 by 12 inch area for the birds to get

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.830 
12 by 12 inch area for the birds to get
in<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.870> out<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:48.150> done<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.600> trick

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
in and out of and that's done the trick

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.950 
in and out of and that's done the trick
so<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.980> haven't<00:02:50.550> seen<00:02:50.730> any<00:02:50.850> birds<00:02:51.090> they've<00:02:51.840> been
