00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that has formed and a very high chance

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.190 
that has formed and a very high chance
of<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.829> impacting<00:01:59.490> Mindanao<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.270> southern

of this impacting Mindanao and southern
visayas<00:02:01.680> going<00:02:02.369> through<00:02:02.700> midweek<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.810> would

visayas going through midweek that would

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.410 
visayas going through midweek that would
be<00:02:04.590> catastrophic<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.700> doesn't<00:02:06.240> look<00:02:06.270> like

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
be catastrophic it doesn't look like

it's<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.560> according<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.580> model

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it's going to be and according to model

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.460 
it's going to be and according to model
out<00:02:09.060> looks<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:09.569> time<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.080> area<00:02:10.440> does

out looks at this time this area does
not<00:02:10.800> look<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> should<00:02:11.580> be<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.970> typhoon

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
not look like it should be a typhoon

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.440 
not look like it should be a typhoon
when

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450

when
towards<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.050> Philippines<00:02:14.500> but<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.890> is

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
towards the Philippines but it is

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.610 
towards the Philippines but it is
possible<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:16.150> even<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:16.930> does<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.379> make

possible and even if it does not make

possible and even if it does not make
typhoon<00:02:18.190> intensity<00:02:18.670> which<00:02:18.879> if<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> does<00:02:19.390> it

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
typhoon intensity which if it does it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.890 
typhoon intensity which if it does it
would<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:19.989> low-end<00:02:20.500> typhoon<00:02:20.980> arm<00:02:21.900> it's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
would be a low-end typhoon arm it's

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.869 
would be a low-end typhoon arm it's
totally<00:02:23.379> packing<00:02:23.800> some<00:02:23.980> damaging<00:02:24.459> winds<00:02:24.700> and

one model this is gfs model outlook for
wednesday<00:02:57.519> but<00:02:58.150> let's<00:02:58.329> go<00:02:58.510> compare<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.049> up

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
wednesday but let's go compare this up

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.920 
wednesday but let's go compare this up
with<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.519> ecmwf<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:00.790> shows<00:03:01.239> it<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.510> little<00:03:01.720> bit

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
with the ecmwf it shows it a little bit

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.390 
with the ecmwf it shows it a little bit
weaker<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.440> farther<00:03:02.769> there<00:03:02.980> towards<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
weaker and farther there towards the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.920 
weaker and farther there towards the
west<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.790> actually<00:03:04.120> expects<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.660> move

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
west and actually expects it to move

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.250 
west and actually expects it to move
onshore<00:03:05.170> by<00:03:05.799> tuesday<00:03:06.489> evening<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:07.840> take<00:03:08.230> a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
onshore by tuesday evening but take a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.319 
onshore by tuesday evening but take a
look<00:03:08.440> at<00:03:08.530> this<00:03:08.590> precipitation<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.489> msl<00:03:09.970> look

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
look at this precipitation the msl look

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.410 
look at this precipitation the msl look
it<00:03:10.660> has<00:03:11.230> widespread<00:03:11.739> rainfall<00:03:12.430> all<00:03:12.910> across

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
it has widespread rainfall all across

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.410 
it has widespread rainfall all across
visayas<00:03:13.989> so<00:03:14.410> even<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:15.610> does<00:03:15.849> not<00:03:16.120> become

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
visayas so even if this does not become

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.990 
visayas so even if this does not become
a<00:03:16.810> stronger<00:03:17.739> system<00:03:18.069> like<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.459> GFS<00:03:18.850> is

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
a stronger system like the GFS is

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.940 
a stronger system like the GFS is
showing<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.420> gfs<00:03:19.810> has<00:03:19.989> been<00:03:20.139> accurate<00:03:20.769> at

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
showing and gfs has been accurate at

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.490 
showing and gfs has been accurate at
genesis<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:21.880> these<00:03:22.239> tropical<00:03:22.510> systems<00:03:23.139> so<00:03:23.290> far

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
genesis of these tropical systems so far

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.770 
genesis of these tropical systems so far
this<00:03:23.590> year<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.980> i<00:03:24.010> really<00:03:24.370> do<00:03:24.489> trust<00:03:24.760> it<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.209> the

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
this year so i really do trust it in the

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.190 
this year so i really do trust it in the
forming<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.380> this<00:03:26.709> tropical<00:03:27.310> system<00:03:27.819> um<00:03:28.200> this

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
forming of this tropical system um this

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.030 
forming of this tropical system um this
is<00:03:29.410> just<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.799> bring<00:03:29.980> some<00:03:30.459> damage<00:03:30.910> and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
is just going to bring some damage and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.140 
is just going to bring some damage and
there's<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.280> many<00:03:33.400> people<00:03:33.609> out<00:03:33.850> here<00:03:34.090> are

there's so many people out here are

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.910 
there's so many people out here are
homeless<00:03:34.660> sleeping<00:03:35.079> out<00:03:35.380> on<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.620> streets

homeless sleeping out on the streets
among<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.760> rubble<00:03:37.139> it<00:03:38.139> really<00:03:38.889> is<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.160> very

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
among the rubble it really is a very

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.099 
among the rubble it really is a very
dangerous<00:03:39.579> scenario<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:40.600> what<00:03:40.720> often

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
dangerous scenario and what often

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.789 
happens and we do see this from time to
time<00:03:42.940> last<00:03:43.359> year<00:03:43.480> actually<00:03:43.690> with<00:03:44.019> bopha<00:03:44.620> when

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
time last year actually with bopha when

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.050 
time last year actually with bopha when
that<00:03:44.920> came<00:03:45.100> through<00:03:45.370> a<00:03:45.400> tropical<00:03:46.000> storm

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
that came through a tropical storm

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.090 
that came through a tropical storm
formed<00:03:46.540> up<00:03:46.690> right<00:03:46.870> behind<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.350> was<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> weekend

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
formed up right behind it was a weekend

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.069 
formed up right behind it was a weekend
but<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.609> formed<00:03:49.000> up<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:49.329> we<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:50.049> that

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
but it formed up and we see that

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.199 
but it formed up and we see that
sometimes<00:03:50.739> we<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.160> our<00:03:51.310> tropical<00:03:51.549> systems

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
sometimes we see our tropical systems

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.910 
sometimes we see our tropical systems
move<00:03:52.389> through<00:03:52.569> here<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.810> strong<00:03:53.109> ones<00:03:53.380> in<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
move through here the strong ones in the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.680 
move through here the strong ones in the
wake<00:03:54.069> of<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.340> some<00:03:54.549> moisture<00:03:54.970> gets<00:03:55.090> left<00:03:55.359> over

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
wake of it some moisture gets left over

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.539 
wake of it some moisture gets left over
and<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:55.959> ends<00:03:56.290> up<00:03:56.349> developing<00:03:56.560> as<00:03:57.010> well<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
and that ends up developing as well the

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.300 
and that ends up developing as well the
key<00:03:57.730> thing<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.030> that<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.829> dynamics<00:03:59.829> in<00:04:00.010> the

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
key thing is that the dynamics in the

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.309 
key thing is that the dynamics in the
atmosphere<00:04:00.880> out<00:04:01.000> here<00:04:01.030> are<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.540> same<00:04:01.900> as<00:04:02.109> when

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
atmosphere out here are the same as when

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.319 
atmosphere out here are the same as when
when<00:04:02.590> high<00:04:02.889> end<00:04:03.130> went<00:04:03.340> through<00:04:03.609> so<00:04:03.940> we're

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
when high end went through so we're

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.479 
when high end went through so we're
going<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.510> expect<00:04:04.810> some<00:04:04.989> intensification<00:04:05.489> but

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
going to expect some intensification but

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.819 
going to expect some intensification but
also<00:04:06.790> we're<00:04:07.269> expecting<00:04:07.810> at<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.989> foul<00:04:08.290> rate

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
also we're expecting at the foul rate

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.289 
also we're expecting at the foul rate
along<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.220> same<00:04:09.430> track<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.880> high-pressure

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
along the same track the high-pressure

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.300 
along the same track the high-pressure
Ridge<00:04:10.480> off<00:04:10.840> there<00:04:11.049> towards<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.410> north<00:04:11.709> this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
Ridge off there towards the north this

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.550 
Ridge off there towards the north this
is<00:04:12.609> very<00:04:13.000> strong<00:04:13.480> low<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:14.109> pushed<00:04:14.319> through

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
is very strong low just pushed through

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.349 
is very strong low just pushed through
so<00:04:14.769> we<00:04:14.889> know<00:04:15.099> there's<00:04:15.400> lower<00:04:15.609> pressure<00:04:16.060> right

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
so we know there's lower pressure right

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.210 
so we know there's lower pressure right
here<00:04:16.570> it's<00:04:16.989> going<00:04:17.169> to<00:04:17.260> flow<00:04:17.590> right<00:04:17.889> behind

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
here it's going to flow right behind

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.029 
here it's going to flow right behind
that<00:04:18.459> flowing<00:04:18.940> downhill<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.630> likely<00:04:20.560> move

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
that flowing downhill and likely move

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.230 
that flowing downhill and likely move
right<00:04:21.609> along<00:04:21.820> a<00:04:22.270> similar<00:04:22.659> track<00:04:23.169> behind<00:04:24.240> high

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
right along a similar track behind high

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.820 
right along a similar track behind high
in<00:04:25.419> here<00:04:25.690> going<00:04:25.960> through<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.470> next

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
in here going through the next

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.059 
in here going through the next
well<00:04:27.250> i<00:04:27.520> would<00:04:28.210> say<00:04:28.240> about<00:04:28.449> 72<00:04:29.020> hours<00:04:29.439> it

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
well i would say about 72 hours it

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.129 
well i would say about 72 hours it
really<00:04:30.460> could<00:04:30.970> be<00:04:31.000> a<00:04:31.120> very<00:04:31.360> dangerous<00:04:31.569> storm

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
really could be a very dangerous storm

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.540 
really could be a very dangerous storm
system<00:04:32.560> so<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:32.710> want<00:04:33.009> to<00:04:33.039> watch<00:04:33.159> that<00:04:33.220> very

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
system so we want to watch that very

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.040 
system so we want to watch that very
closely<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.270> spent<00:04:34.569> the<00:04:34.629> first<00:04:34.750> half<00:04:34.900> of

when we've been talking about here the
other<00:05:04.419> good<00:05:04.629> news<00:05:04.690> is<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.080> going<00:05:05.409> through

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
other good news is that going through

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.670 
other good news is that going through
all<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.610> next<00:05:06.940> several<00:05:07.479> hours<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:08.530> is

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
all the next several hours this is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.350 
all the next several hours this is
expected<00:05:09.159> to<00:05:09.219> decrease<00:05:09.550> intensity<00:05:10.240> and

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
expected to decrease intensity and

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.209 
expected to decrease intensity and
actually<00:05:10.690> as<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:11.020> makes<00:05:11.169> landfall<00:05:11.590> there<00:05:12.009> I'm

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
actually as it makes landfall there I'm

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.850 
actually as it makes landfall there I'm
very<00:05:12.300> well<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.479> going<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:13.810> be<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.930> tropical

we're going to be seeing some rough

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.680 
we're going to be seeing some rough
weather<00:05:21.129> out<00:05:21.400> of<00:05:21.550> here<00:05:21.669> but<00:05:21.879> once<00:05:22.389> again<00:05:22.539> I

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
weather out of here but once again I

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.420 
weather out of here but once again I
think<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:23.020> main<00:05:23.349> threat<00:05:23.800> will<00:05:24.159> be<00:05:24.279> the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
think the main threat will be the

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.610 
think the main threat will be the
rainfall<00:05:24.879> out<00:05:25.090> there<00:05:25.270> across<00:05:25.539> Vietnam<00:05:26.080> looks

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
rainfall out there across Vietnam looks

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.379 
rainfall out there across Vietnam looks
like<00:05:26.770> Laos<00:05:26.979> is<00:05:27.009> actually<00:05:27.639> kind<00:05:27.849> of<00:05:27.879> dodging<00:05:28.300> a

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
like Laos is actually kind of dodging a

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.730 
like Laos is actually kind of dodging a
bullet<00:05:28.419> here<00:05:28.960> what<00:05:29.110> it's<00:05:29.259> staying<00:05:29.529> a<00:05:29.620> little

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
bullet here what it's staying a little

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.809 
bullet here what it's staying a little
bit<00:05:29.919> farther<00:05:30.159> there<00:05:30.430> towards<00:05:30.729> the<00:05:30.759> east

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
bit farther there towards the east

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.909 
bit farther there towards the east
southern<00:05:31.330> China<00:05:31.629> also<00:05:32.379> looking<00:05:32.680> at<00:05:32.740> some

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
southern China also looking at some

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.619 
southern China also looking at some
pretty<00:05:33.129> heavy<00:05:33.430> rain<00:05:33.669> showers<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.419> risk

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
pretty heavy rain showers and the risk

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:36.269 
pretty heavy rain showers and the risk
of<00:05:34.840> flooding<00:05:35.169> as<00:05:35.349> well<00:05:35.529> and<00:05:35.710> also<00:05:35.830> you<00:05:36.009> can<00:05:36.159> see

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:36.279 
of flooding as well and also you can see

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.129 
of flooding as well and also you can see
here<00:05:36.550> on<00:05:36.729> this<00:05:36.909> accumulation<00:05:37.330> outlook<00:05:37.930> for

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
here on this accumulation outlook for

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.950 
here on this accumulation outlook for
the<00:05:38.259> next<00:05:38.650> 72<00:05:39.219> hours<00:05:39.449> you<00:05:40.449> have<00:05:40.599> our<00:05:40.629> area

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
the next 72 hours you have our area

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.390 
the next 72 hours you have our area
developing<00:05:41.409> here<00:05:41.620> tracking<00:05:41.949> off<00:05:42.219> there

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
developing here tracking off there

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.469 
developing here tracking off there
towards<00:05:42.639> the<00:05:42.669> northwest<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.210> think<00:05:43.389> this

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
towards the northwest and I think this

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.390 
towards the northwest and I think this
puts<00:05:43.750> it<00:05:43.870> really<00:05:44.139> in<00:05:44.259> perspective<00:05:44.800> at<00:05:45.219> the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
puts it really in perspective at the

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.980 
puts it really in perspective at the
amount<00:05:45.639> of<00:05:45.819> rain<00:05:46.029> showers<00:05:46.479> that<00:05:46.599> are<00:05:46.659> going<00:05:46.900> to

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
amount of rain showers that are going to

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.689 
amount of rain showers that are going to
be<00:05:47.139> occurring<00:05:47.500> here<00:05:47.680> just<00:05:47.979> for<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.219> next<00:05:48.400> 72

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
be occurring here just for the next 72

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.399 
be occurring here just for the next 72
hours<00:05:48.759> remember<00:05:49.389> beyond<00:05:49.810> that<00:05:49.960> this<00:05:50.199> still

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409
