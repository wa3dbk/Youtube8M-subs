00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.770
 disco because amateurs there are those who have it 

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:06.720
 yesterday in the record there are those who do not have it 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.830
 and instead among the professionals there 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530
 are the disc brakes 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 Maurizio tells us we are giving 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.299
 clearly of racing bicycle 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.040
 visiting the race to beautiful amateurs 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.940
 because if they buy the bicycle in 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.100
 one buys that sea ​​amateurs don't miss 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.750
 like the money they buy what is worth 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.780
 to the professionals because they pass it e 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.300
 still they do n't pass and why 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.050
 They pass guarantee mister you know 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.879
 the few because we were heading if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.249
 should all agree 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.989
 teams that is all the teams putting themselves 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.230
 agree to provide death a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.359
 all the runners the bicycle with the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.879
 disc brakes there must be no one 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.159
 ccleaner disco and those who do not have it for 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 Why motivation is because 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.870
 they calculated that in case of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.760
 emergency a group with Tunisian hands 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.319
 but me but with my hands a group of yes with 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.600
 hands if they have to restrain everyone 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:05.489
 the group must slow down to the same 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.100
 speed ie if there is a cyclist who 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.640
 falls there is a sudden braking of the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.320
 Normal brake takes six seconds a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 then slow down the whole group 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.220
 slows down in 6 seconds if instead of half 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 there is someone there is the disc brake does 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 four second slow down 3 second 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 work according to accidents still 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.170
 they risk a step back from them 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.390
 why then or with disc brakes o 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.300
 all slow down in 4 seconds with trains 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.610
 normal in seven points all group 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 how many brake not in the same way and you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.510
 maybe you find yourself in front of one 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.220
 that they discuss it you put the six 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.870
 points to slow it down three fronts 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.990
 go on still Mauritian musicologist 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.820
 morelli is watching with a cell phone 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.810
 in the comments write it the e mauri dare 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.810
 the last push 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.640
 it will be because then thumb up why not 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.710
 I said you maurice succeeds had at least 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.230
 50 inches right you buy it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.300
 anbar mobile 400 euros and said that 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.200
 he wants to spend then one comes out 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.450
 beautiful stuff 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.220
 if the motivation is well understood 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.320
 secret the group must slow it down 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.240
 same Romans we found to oust 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.300
 polisucco very well and it's one thing 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.860
 Interesting 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.140
 and an interesting thing even when 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.210
 go with the friend your ride was 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.160
 tail brakes and suddenly opens us 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.900
 then there is no disc display case on the disc 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.690
 he comes at him that he does the maximum that 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.420
 can then pure and your maximum of course 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.420
 the brake disc faster then 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.040
 all of them slow down in three seconds or 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.720
 everyone must slow down in 6 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.910
 seconds and a half does not grant towards 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.810
 unequal braking otherwise on 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.330
 accidents thanks 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.200
 just at least 50 inches on expenses 400 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.200
 euros and kids
