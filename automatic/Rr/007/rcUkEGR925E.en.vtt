going to take a look at the H&amp;K
conspiracy<00:00:06.990> folder<00:00:07.740> today<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:09.000> one<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.360> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
conspiracy folder today this one is the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.030 
conspiracy folder today this one is the
black<00:00:09.750> blade<00:00:10.050> with<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.679> partial

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
black blade with the the partial

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.150 
black blade with the the partial
serrations<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.790> before<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.210> get<00:00:12.330> into<00:00:12.389> that

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
serrations but before we get into that

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.289 
serrations but before we get into that
slick<00:00:14.160> on<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.280> outside<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.120> is<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
slick on the outside here so this is a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.460 
slick on the outside here so this is a
g10<00:00:15.980> look<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.090> grip<00:00:18.470> provides

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
g10 look at that just that grip provides

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.730 
g10 look at that just that grip provides
a<00:00:19.619> secure<00:00:20.039> grip<00:00:21.020> but<00:00:22.020> it's<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.320> over

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
a secure grip but it's not over

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.099 
a secure grip but it's not over
overzealous<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:24.029> some<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.480> other<00:00:24.630> g10

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
overzealous like some of the other g10

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.019 
overzealous like some of the other g10
scales<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.490> see<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.000> other

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
scales that you see out there on other

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
scales that you see out there on other
knives<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.570> then<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.260> side<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
knives and then this side is the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.229 
knives and then this side is the
titanium<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.480> frame<00:00:30.689> lock<00:00:30.900> has<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> clip

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
titanium it's a frame lock has the clip

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
titanium it's a frame lock has the clip
non-reversible<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
non-reversible it's just there so it's I

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.130 
non-reversible it's just there so it's I
guess<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.420> could<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> off<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
guess you could take it off if you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.740 
guess you could take it off if you
wanted<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:38.460> has<00:00:38.969> dual<00:00:39.210> thumb<00:00:39.450> studs

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
wanted to but they has dual thumb studs

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
wanted to but they has dual thumb studs
as<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:41.030> just<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.239> solid<00:00:43.760> knife<00:00:44.760> on

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
as you can see just a solid knife on

as you can see just a solid knife on
this<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.289> has<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> lanyard<00:00:46.950> hole

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
this here and it has the lanyard hole

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
giant fat blade here so the blade length

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
giant fat blade here so the blade length
on<00:00:57.210> its<00:00:57.390> three<00:00:57.690> point<00:00:57.899> six<00:00:58.079> inches<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
on its three point six inches this is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
on its three point six inches this is
the<00:00:59.340> serration<00:00:59.940> model<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.960> just

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the serration model as you can see just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.520 
the serration model as you can see just
the<00:01:01.680> classic<00:01:01.949> H&amp;K<00:01:02.550> serrations<00:01:03.270> their<00:01:03.530> frame

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the classic H&amp;K serrations their frame

lock has nice nice lock up on it the
detent<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.920> these<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.880> little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
detent on these can be a little

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.679 
detent on these can be a little
difficult<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:10.880> there<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
difficult we there they are just a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.840 
difficult we there they are just a
little<00:01:12.869> stiff<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.320> wear<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.710> overtime<00:01:14.549> but

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
little stiff they wear in overtime but

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
little stiff they wear in overtime but
just<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.810> heads<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.799> if<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
just a heads up for you if you have a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.560 
just a heads up for you if you have a
brand<00:01:17.490> new<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.060> find<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.360> it's

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
brand new one and you find that it's

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.440 
brand new one and you find that it's
pretty<00:01:18.750> stiff<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.280> loosen<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> was

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
pretty stiff it will loosen up so I was

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
pretty stiff it will loosen up so I was
jumping<00:01:21.810> on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
jumping on the back here and on the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
jumping on the back here and on the
scale<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.270> provides<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.930> solid<00:01:25.520> secure<00:01:26.520> grip

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
scale so it provides a solid secure grip

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.080 
scale so it provides a solid secure grip
for<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.119> thumb<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.040> then<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.369> cut

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
for your thumb and then you can cut

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899 
for your thumb and then you can cut
whatever<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.900> need<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.490> overall

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
whatever you need to do so the overall

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
whatever you need to do so the overall
length<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:33.990> 7.5<00:01:34.439> 5<00:01:35.070> inches

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
length on it is going to be 7.5 5 inches

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.660 
length on it is going to be 7.5 5 inches
and<00:01:36.829> blade<00:01:37.829> thickness<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.640> 0

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and blade thickness is going to be 0

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.140 
and blade thickness is going to be 0
point<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.299> eight<00:01:40.520> point<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.579> eighth<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> an

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
point one eight point one eighth of an

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.050 
point one eight point one eighth of an
inch<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.100> blade<00:01:44.310> material<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
inch on it so the the blade material is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.539 
inch on it so the the blade material is
the<00:01:45.420> 9<00:01:45.630> CR<00:01:46.049> 13<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.710> stainless<00:01:46.920> steel<00:01:47.310> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the 9 CR 13 it's stainless steel and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.870 
the 9 CR 13 it's stainless steel and
then<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.079> 58<00:01:49.640> 60<00:01:51.350> hrc<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> hardness

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
then it's the 58 60 hrc for the hardness

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.399 
then it's the 58 60 hrc for the hardness
so<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.600> great<00:01:54.810> overall<00:01:55.079> knife

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
so just a just a great overall knife

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.800 
so just a just a great overall knife
wait<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.549> six<00:01:57.060> point<00:01:57.750> three

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
wait on it's going to be six point three

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.639 
wait on it's going to be six point three
five<00:01:57.990> ounces<00:01:59.060> but<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> conspiracy
