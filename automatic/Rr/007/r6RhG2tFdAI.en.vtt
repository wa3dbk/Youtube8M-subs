00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends of is advances that 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.350
 As you are, I promised you that I was going to 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.559
 bring a tutorial so you knew and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.120
 Rutera is your motor or motorbike 2014 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.400
 although good for the previous version 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 It also obviously serves for any 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 version this does not matter if it's 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.060
 Latin America if it is from Spain if it is 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.430
 of europe because good so what are we going 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 to do is to root it and for this it gives 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.949
 same as the firmware you are using if 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.840
 is from one continent or from another 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.669
 promised that if I was going to bring you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 this tutorial and well then very simple 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.649
 It will not last, I do not think five minutes 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.030
 because as you are going to see is super simple 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.250
 and also good in a way 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.440
 pretty stable we have here the engine or 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.700
 the bike g of 2014 we will pay 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.989
 do it 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 I have previously saved what is the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.940
 images and such that I have on the pc but 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.420
 especially in case something will happen that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.260
 Well, I do not think it will happen, but 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 seen what seen 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.780
 I prefer to prevent that then try 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.489
 cure that good in the case this goes 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.159
 to be almost impossible to cure because a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.829
 Once you lose 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.010
 photos as there is nothing to do I will 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.680
 catch it I'm going to turn it on mode 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.890
 fast boot giving it by clicking on the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.690
 power button and volume down this 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.630
 for four seconds I had it 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.940
 too much time and good so here we go 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.360
 to plug in the cable because if we have 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.830
 installed android lollipop is not going to 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.690
 work the previous recovery or 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.790
 good if they will not be restored as well 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.770
 say the previous recovery that 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.960
 we had therefore we are going to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.230
 need to put a new one as we are going 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.580
 to do so very easy we are going to this 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.470
 folder that we have here 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:51.120
 previously we will copy 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 the east that is the recovery that we are going to 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.750
 use to install in the super beta 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.580
 sub a beta but how good is it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 stable that by the way I forgot 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.190
 decÃ­roslo you will have to store it in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.310
 the micro sd that you have, you can say 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.750
 without decompressing it or anything and you pass it 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.679
 directly to the micro sd these four 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.329
 good files he 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.099
 the recovery that I have already got into the 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.469
 folder our four files what 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.420
 I'll leave in the same mega folder for 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:19.409
 do not have any complications and 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.000
 well then we leave it here step followed 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.670
 we're going to have to hit the button 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.930
 secondary to the right button of the mouse and 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.049
 at the same time 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.879
 to the key that is below block marius and 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.180
 we give to open command window 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.090
 here right after we will have to catch 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.620
 this file is called script and it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:46.019
 let's give the order to execute this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.019
 we copy paste and we give to enter 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 and right now what you 're doing is 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.330
 flash 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.240
 and we see how here in the commands 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.820
 it appears that it is already flashed what is 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.790
 that recovery that's good, that's what 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.660
 we will use to install it we remove the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.110
 USB Cable 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.870
 we are moving forward forever with the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.270
 button down the volume down because 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.850
 if we use the one above as you will know 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.250
 will be the selection we give to recovery 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.260
 good and now what will open to us is the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.170
 recovery that this we just 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.520
 flashing on our device in this 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.430
 case as we see files of field touch 6 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.920
 well this now we are going to be able to 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.360
 catch and move with these little arrows to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.960
 see how I do it so you can see it well 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 and move with these little arrows or 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.470
 directly giving him but how are they 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.220
 Very small spaces I recommend you 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.100
 that you give directly to here to these 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.600
 well arrows we give here to the button 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.850
 enter and we give to south-south zip from 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:57.750
 this car 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:01.460
 what would it be to forgiveness to external sd 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.710
 here we see already how beta appears super if 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.850
 we give it and now automatically it 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.740
 will install us is the beta 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.950
 right and now what are you telling us 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.990
 already installing the root that's good 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.840
 to last a little and we see how it looks here 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.510
 what is the whole process that the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:24.080
 device you put such francesc indicate 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.800
 complete pressen and key ford with king for 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.580
 continuous 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.580
 I give back 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.009
 an 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.979
 debut 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.949
 what the good go back is going to give to 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.830
 power to turn it off and now it's good 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.110
 we already turn it on as good 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.659
 usually we turn it on we leave 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.289
 pressed without hitting the button that 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:54.240
 We were giving earlier and good 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.660
 well 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.849
 you should already appear rooted 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.669
 the device should appear what 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:08.610
 is the super zoom and from there on 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:12.530
 and start enjoying all the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.530
 advantages of being root that yes 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.660
 you have to keep in mind that all of them 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.570
 the advantages so to speak we are not going to 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:25.080
 to be able to enjoy them because there is good 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.630
 because it still seems that many what they are 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.720
 the equipment modules still do not 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:36.400
 let's use it completely let's say what 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.800
 that being a still new version between 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.250
 quotes the root developers 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.140
 because they are still in process we see how 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.240
 Well, what has been removed is the 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.920
 wallpaper that I do not know very well to 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.770
 why the background has been removed 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.910
 of the screen that I had previously 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.370
 Market Stall 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:55.720
 let's put any one is that I do not 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.090
 agreement in equal had if I tell you the 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.650
 good fortune we will establish 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.260
 well, it has already been put only today 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.340
 missing it takes a little bit slower 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.340
 I'm going to put the pin 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.710
 and good for here should receive the 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:18.210
 super his over here 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.550
 as we see here is and well then 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.350
 as you see here is installed and good 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.740
 Well, we could start 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.530
 to the 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.500
 Well, as I told you to enjoy all 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:32.240
 the contents that root offers us to be 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.190
 rudy and all the possibilities that we 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.690
 offers to be root and good because it's a 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.220
 quite simple way as you have 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.810
 seen without any complication 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.729
 as always if you have any questions 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.050
 problem that I guess not because I think 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.550
 that if you do everything right you have already 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.380
 seen is that in a minute you can do 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.759
 I always get longer doing the 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.930
 tutorials but is that in two minutes 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:53.870
 we can have the device rooted 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.130
 without any complication so 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.449
 so much nothing to give I like if it has 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.190
 liked the anna video I do not like it that way 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.050
 unfortunately we did not like it if 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.090
 you want some kind of tutorial on Monday 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.580
 next I'm going to bring you a tutorial 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.289
 for how to remove those images in comfortable 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.530
 image that many people can not stand 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.819
 because we have our device 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.440
 unlocked the bootloader therefore 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:13.759
 well I think it's going to be a video 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.970
 interesting that much more are you 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.440
 asking if you have any other kind of 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.020
 suggestion for tutorials whatever it is me 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.310
 leave it in the comments too 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.400
 subscribe and are not yet subscribed 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:28.069
 because I promise you that you are not going to 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.870
 regret having done a greeting and 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:32.229
 see you in the next video of that 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.229
 band
