completely untouchable so any movement

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.279 
completely untouchable so any movement
towards<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.670> does<00:00:54.059> cause<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.840> panic

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.919 
just shake that up and you can see the
see<00:01:41.770> very<00:01:42.399> clearly<00:01:42.700> knows<00:01:42.940> that<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.270> touching

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
see very clearly knows that it touching

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:45.779 
see very clearly knows that it touching
the<00:01:44.049> target<00:01:44.500> so<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.009> is<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.220> first<00:01:45.490> time

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
the target so this is the first time

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.370 
the target so this is the first time
that<00:01:45.819> Z<00:01:46.179> will<00:01:46.420> have<00:01:46.539> touched<00:01:46.750> it<00:01:46.959> on<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.170> side

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
that Z will have touched it on the side

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.090 
that Z will have touched it on the side
away<00:01:47.530> from<00:01:47.679> me<00:01:48.179> it's<00:01:49.179> always<00:01:49.360> been<00:01:50.100> over

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
away from me it's always been over

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.899 
away from me it's always been over
towards<00:01:51.549> me<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.100> big<00:02:00.310> step<00:02:00.580> forward

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
towards me that's a big step forward

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.570 
towards me that's a big step forward
today<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.619> see<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.890> reason<00:02:03.069> I'm<00:02:03.340> doing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
today if you see the reason I'm doing

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.550 
today if you see the reason I'm doing
the<00:02:03.819> targeting<00:02:04.360> is<00:02:04.569> obviously<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.140> teach<00:02:05.319> them

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
the targeting is obviously to teach them

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.130 
the targeting is obviously to teach them
about<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:06.130> clicker<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.240> so<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> they

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
about the clicker and so that they

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.320 
about the clicker and so that they
understand<00:02:08.619> their<00:02:09.160> action<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:10.119> course

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
understand their action of course

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.080 
understand their action of course
mutagen<00:02:10.859> and<00:02:11.859> that's<00:02:12.130> such<00:02:12.459> an<00:02:12.640> important

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
mutagen and that's such an important

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.819 
mutagen and that's such an important
part<00:02:13.239> of<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.630> because<00:02:13.840> until<00:02:14.049> they<00:02:14.380> understand

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
part of it because until they understand

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.400 
part of it because until they understand
that<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.579> can't<00:02:15.850> really<00:02:16.060> teach<00:02:16.510> them<00:02:16.810> teach

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
that you can't really teach them teach

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.229 
that you can't really teach them teach
them<00:02:17.440> anything<00:02:17.680> else<00:02:18.070> I'll<00:02:18.640> start<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.060> go<00:02:19.209> to

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
them anything else I'll start to go to

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.620 
them anything else I'll start to go to
the<00:02:19.390> duration<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.260> them<00:02:20.769> hoping<00:02:21.040> they<00:02:21.280> know

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
the duration of of them hoping they know

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
the duration of of them hoping they know
in<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.990> vicinity<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.710> target<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.580> I'll

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
in the vicinity of the target and I'll

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.570 
in the vicinity of the target and I'll
use<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.510> replace<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.500> place<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.950> tying<00:02:26.190> up

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
use that in replace in place of tying up

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.330 
use that in replace in place of tying up
so<00:02:27.170> obviously<00:02:28.170> tying<00:02:28.440> up<00:02:28.560> South<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.920> question

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
so obviously tying up South the question

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.860 
so obviously tying up South the question
for<00:02:29.550> getting<00:02:29.760> them<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.480> go<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.690> the

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
for getting them to to go to the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
for getting them to to go to the
specific<00:02:31.350> place<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.560> standstill<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.550> really

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
specific place in standstill it really

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.470 
specific place in standstill it really
helpful<00:02:33.000> behaviors<00:02:33.240> or<00:02:33.750> SATs<00:02:33.990> for<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.150> I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
helpful behaviors or SATs for that and I

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.810 
helpful behaviors or SATs for that and I
can<00:02:36.660> also<00:02:36.780> use<00:02:37.200> targeting<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.280> start<00:02:38.550> teaching

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
can also use targeting to start teaching

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.060 
can also use targeting to start teaching
and<00:02:39.060> leading<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.720> well<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and leading as well you can see that the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.980 
and leading as well you can see that the
orange<00:02:41.310> target<00:02:41.670> bears<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.330> stick<00:02:42.600> inside

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
orange target bears on the stick inside

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.710 
orange target bears on the stick inside
the<00:02:43.200> cone<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:45.890> so<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.550> can<00:02:47.880> take<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.060> out<00:02:48.360> and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the cone and so I can take that out and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
the cone and so I can take that out and
start<00:02:48.930> getting<00:02:49.350> them<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.470> follow<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.130> move

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
start getting them to follow it and move

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.790 
start getting them to follow it and move
around<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:52.020> was<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> really<00:02:52.470> great

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
around and that was a really great

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.430 
around and that was a really great
introduction<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.610> leading<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:55.140> of

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
introduction the leading for out of

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.500 
introduction the leading for out of
these<00:02:55.620> guys<00:02:55.860> but<00:02:56.250> also<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.820> use<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.150> lot<00:02:57.180> with

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
these guys but also I use it a lot with

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.680 
these guys but also I use it a lot with
horses<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.080> have<00:02:58.260> any<00:02:59.250> issues<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.060> anxiety

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
horses that have any issues or anxiety

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.080 
horses that have any issues or anxiety
around<00:03:00.960> leading<00:03:01.500> whether<00:03:01.740> that's<00:03:02.040> active<00:03:02.790> you

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
around leading whether that's active you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.280 
around leading whether that's active you
know<00:03:03.210> whether<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:03.510> worried<00:03:03.840> behavior

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
know whether that's worried behavior

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.960 
know whether that's worried behavior
whether<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.800> pushiness<00:03:05.220> it's<00:03:05.460> great<00:03:05.790> to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
whether it's a pushiness it's great to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.310
