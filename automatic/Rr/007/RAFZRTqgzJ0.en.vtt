okay and then this is just the box toxic

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.590 
okay and then this is just the box toxic
socketing<00:00:16.990> them<00:00:17.170> over<00:00:17.470> here<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.940> shows<00:00:19.150> you<00:00:19.330> a

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
start these are not something because

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.639 
start these are not something because
they<00:00:35.739> do<00:00:35.800> not<00:00:35.980> have<00:00:36.159> a<00:00:36.659> pink<00:00:37.659> on<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:37.929> rappers

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
they do not have a pink on the rappers

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.219 
they do not have a pink on the rappers
if<00:00:38.859> they<00:00:39.190> resented<00:00:39.729> they<00:00:39.999> would<00:00:40.210> have<00:00:40.359> pink<00:00:41.079> on

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
if they resented they would have pink on

if they resented they would have pink on
the<00:00:41.260> rappers<00:00:41.679> and<00:00:42.010> they<00:00:42.159> look<00:00:42.429> like<00:00:42.550> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.910
