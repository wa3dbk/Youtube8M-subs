00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 such another episode of tech world 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
 right next to me jan moon stolle 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.629
 counter strike profi since one 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 decades almost for that was very very long 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.690
 and also in the spot for a very long time already 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.920
 already on the way that you still have time 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 you have taken after the game 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.460
 night game and yes I have one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.940
 Double interview on you two things 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.470
 stand at 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 on the one hand, of course first for the 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.269
 starcraft 2 fans because I'm just 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.400
 a little bit about counter strike the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.440
 It's been a discipline for years 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.630
 called dsl and if you look at the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.430
 Last events have watched and the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 compared to fans then there are many 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.640
 stars two windows and in comparison too 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.700
 today although it is the top match against 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.800
 mousesports few windows have 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.450
 you feel that's just counter 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.490
 strike something offline 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.550
 acted and also the spectators 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.820
 place replaces so I think the main reason 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.899
 it's because starcraft 2 it's new game 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.920
 That's why everyone pays off 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.700
 times chances out just once 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 to be able to play 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 and just the esl is bigger the two 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.740
 cups that offer just the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.020
 possibility even against a top 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.340
 man to play maybe already in 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.920
 Round one or so everyone can join 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.020
 and that's one of the main reasons 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.400
 why starcraft 2 is booming right now 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.280
 Counter Strike is not like that 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.210
 there you really have to be from mr 12 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.229
 somehow upplay by all 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.780
 he can do it until you actually 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.210
 my eps is and in starcraft 2 it is 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 as I said just not so you can already hear 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.329
 you know a little bit helped out 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.890
 starcraft 2 are you playing your flats? 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.380
 but you are very fast as 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.470
 it will surely attack as well as sun 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 has and how much ash has played that 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.899
 I such a play as I only 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.700
 emptied or custom games 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.110
 and maybe 300 in total 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 games or something indeed already one 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.579
 amount but a raid 1 raid or in 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.160
 which league plays the investors 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.140
 actually diamond league still yes 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.160
 So quite crass sounds like 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.600
 as if I already know a bit 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.769
 and you also have its ambassador what 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.630
 not too bad either and you have 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.340
 sometimes casted wc3 I made 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.070
 yes, as you might like her 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.070
 imagine also times to relocate 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.780
 someday no longer yes that 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.910
 prizes and also these these events 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.140
 definitely offers that 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.670
 Moderate itself has a lot 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.199
 fun is done in starcraft 2 as well 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.329
 fun making so look me very 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.610
 Many words are very many games 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.910
 we of course 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.170
 and yes I could imagine 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.610
 I mean that has counter strike 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.380
 it was a team game 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.730
 is what Counter strike is all about 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.550
 still it is that is a team game 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.760
 But I say the base goes like this 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.500
 slowly lost because people just 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.700
 Say you played the game too long 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.320
 I just do not stop the possibility 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.090
 have to play against good teams though 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.770
 We, for example, on our side 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.790
 somehow make a date with place 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.530
 so are the young players 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.940
 I love it and then I can 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.600
 Imagine that you have a long time left 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.610
 will continue to play 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.320
 but in general most have 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.459
 Of course not people and in 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.500
 sacristy there is as I said this 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.620
 possibility and I think that that 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.489
 what is so fascinating you expect 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.560
 we should assume that you are 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.239
 Also try active in ten hours 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.160
 or eight hours a day mostly at the beginning 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.450
 I could tear myself in some rows 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.430
 Imagine that you really want to top 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.350
 So could be you this bouquet 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.270
 Strategic know about what is the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.920
 counter strike yes often does not say 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.780
 besides you are already solid though 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.450
 many are not yes so I can 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.510
 not tell if I'm talented rts 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.070
 games but I just notice when I am 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.900
 I play that a lot, too 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.340
 always steadily improving knows where 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.440
 my mistakes are what I'm better 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.260
 As I said, I can always do that 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.220
 while replays watch bots to look 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.030
 and it also improves me again 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.010
 further and possibility is there 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.360
 On the other hand, someday soon sometime 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.410
 the working life and if I then 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.630
 still have so much time eight to ten 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.450
 he will play hours a day 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.590
 something will do in the future and how 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.760
 you can still go with a yes now 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.700
 Stolle in the counter strike scene 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
 honestly, I still have to calculate 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.100
 I do not have any thoughts . I have that 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.269
 really as often asked as long 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.160
 I'm still playing and I always said 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.550
 At the moment I do not think of it 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.900
 stop 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.200
 if I stop sometime then it is 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.580
 it very spontaneous and either because 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.990
 work or maybe because it is me 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.419
 no fun anymore but at the moment 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.930
 I do not think it and has very 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.919
 good at 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.900
 yes thank you in advance for the short interview 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.320
 and yes I would say we do think 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.320
 1 more
