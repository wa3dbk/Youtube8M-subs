1/7<00:01:43.049> what<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.740> means<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.340> twist<00:01:44.670> rate<00:01:44.970> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
1/7 what that means is the twist rate so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.179 
1/7 what that means is the twist rate so
we<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.600> rifling<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> barrel<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
we have rifling in a barrel when the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
we have rifling in a barrel when the
bullet<00:01:47.460> goes<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.210> barrel<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.930> rifling

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
bullet goes down the barrel the rifling

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.899 
bullet goes down the barrel the rifling
turns<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.009> bullet<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.460> think<00:01:50.670> about<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
turns the bullet so think about a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.789 
turns the bullet so think about a
quarterback<00:01:51.509> throwing<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.990> spiral<00:01:52.290> football

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
quarterback throwing a spiral football

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
quarterback throwing a spiral football
that's<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.280> have<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:54.299> tighter<00:01:54.689> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
that's what we have the tighter the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
that's what we have the tighter the
twist<00:01:55.579> generally<00:01:56.579> speaking<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> more

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
twist generally speaking the more

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.300 
twist generally speaking the more
accurate<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> bullet<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> 1<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> 7<00:01:59.040> twist

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
accurate the bullet so a 1 to 7 twist

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.389 
accurate the bullet so a 1 to 7 twist
every<00:01:59.700> 7<00:02:00.119> inches<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.450> barrel<00:02:01.130> equals<00:02:02.130> one

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
every 7 inches of barrel equals one

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.359 
every 7 inches of barrel equals one
revolution<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> bullet<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.659> 1<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> 7<00:02:05.070> twist

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
revolution of the bullet a 1 to 7 twist

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.169 
revolution of the bullet a 1 to 7 twist
barrel<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.079> 556<00:02:07.079> will<00:02:07.680> stabilize<00:02:08.220> everything

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
barrel in 556 will stabilize everything

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.740 
barrel in 556 will stabilize everything
from<00:02:09.890> 55<00:02:10.890> grain<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.580> way<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.000> your<00:02:12.060> 87

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
from 55 grain all the way up to your 87

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.809 
from 55 grain all the way up to your 87
grain<00:02:12.989> or<00:02:13.230> so

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
grain or so

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.429 
grain or so
it's<00:02:13.969> now<00:02:14.749> if<00:02:14.900> you're<00:02:15.049> going<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> shoot

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
it's now if you're going to shoot

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.619 
it's now if you're going to shoot
something<00:02:15.829> below<00:02:16.069> 55<00:02:16.489> grain<00:02:16.939> like<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.329> France

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
something below 55 grain like the France

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.839 
something below 55 grain like the France
stuff<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.379> 40<00:02:18.739> grain<00:02:19.010> area<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
stuff that's in the 40 grain area you

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.220 
stuff that's in the 40 grain area you
might<00:02:20.060> want<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.299> consider<00:02:20.599> going<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:20.989> one

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
might want to consider going to one

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.020 
might want to consider going to one
denied<00:02:21.499> but<00:02:21.859> what<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.010> see<00:02:22.310> nowadays<00:02:22.760> most

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
denied but what I see nowadays most

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.509 
denied but what I see nowadays most
people<00:02:23.090> are<00:02:23.389> going<00:02:23.510> with<00:02:23.719> 55<00:02:24.319> as<00:02:24.620> their<00:02:25.129> lowest

people are going with 55 as their lowest

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.670 
people are going with 55 as their lowest
in<00:02:25.670> so<00:02:26.150> choose<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> 1<00:02:26.719> to<00:02:26.840> 7<00:02:27.170> it'll<00:02:27.530> shoot

the barrel the C on this particular one

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.399 
the barrel the C on this particular one
is<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:40.129> Colt<00:02:40.459> barrel<00:02:40.939> some<00:02:41.480> manufacturers<00:02:42.169> will

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
is a Colt barrel some manufacturers will

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.309 
is a Colt barrel some manufacturers will
stamp<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.799> C<00:02:43.099> or<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> CH<00:02:44.090> on<00:02:44.359> the<00:02:44.659> barrel<00:02:44.959> meaning

stamp a C or a CH on the barrel meaning

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.530 
stamp a C or a CH on the barrel meaning
that<00:02:45.409> it<00:02:45.590> is<00:02:45.709> chrome-lined<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.030> my<00:02:47.239> total

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
that it is chrome-lined so my total

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.069 
that it is chrome-lined so my total
recommendation<00:02:48.530> for<00:02:48.769> barrels<00:02:49.189> is<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:50.209> 16<00:02:50.870> inch

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
recommendation for barrels is a 16 inch

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.949 
recommendation for barrels is a 16 inch
version<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:52.159> because<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.669> ease<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.299> legality

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
version just because of ease of legality

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.740 
version just because of ease of legality
I<00:02:54.109> like<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.769> chambered<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.159> 5.56<00:02:56.090> millimeter<00:02:56.180> a

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
I like it chambered in 5.56 millimeter a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.899 
I like it chambered in 5.56 millimeter a
one<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:57.199> seven<00:02:57.530> twist<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:58.159> it's<00:02:58.549> a<00:02:58.639> cold

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
one to seven twist and it's a cold

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.789 
one to seven twist and it's a cold
hammer-forged<00:02:59.540> barrel<00:03:00.049> which<00:03:00.379> is<00:03:00.409> how<00:03:00.620> they

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
hammer-forged barrel which is how they

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:01.240 
hammer-forged barrel which is how they
make<00:03:01.040> it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
make it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.849 
make it
and<00:03:01.370> it's<00:03:02.180> chrome<00:03:02.419> lined<00:03:02.750> that's<00:03:03.680> my

hiders you got a couple of different

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.330 
hiders you got a couple of different

hold a suppressor you've got one over

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.860 
hold a suppressor you've got one over
here<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.739> would<00:03:19.009> be<00:03:19.129> considered<00:03:19.579> a<00:03:19.729> comp<00:03:20.569> or

here that would be considered a comp or

and in some cases a break a break is a
little<00:03:23.419> bit<00:03:23.509> different<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.139> what<00:03:24.319> this<00:03:24.470> does

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
little bit different but what this does

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.280 
little bit different but what this does
is<00:03:24.919> expel<00:03:25.340> gas<00:03:25.370> out<00:03:26.000> make<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.750> recoil<00:03:27.169> a

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
is expel gas out make the recoil a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.809 
is expel gas out make the recoil a
little<00:03:27.500> bit<00:03:27.620> lighter<00:03:27.799> on<00:03:27.979> the<00:03:28.099> shooter<00:03:28.430> keep

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
little bit lighter on the shooter keep

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.249 
little bit lighter on the shooter keep
in<00:03:29.000> mind<00:03:29.209> when<00:03:29.359> you<00:03:29.449> do<00:03:29.629> this<00:03:29.840> though<00:03:30.049> you're

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:30.259 
in mind when you do this though you're

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:31.929 
in mind when you do this though you're
going<00:03:30.349> to<00:03:30.439> have<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.739> little<00:03:31.099> bit<00:03:31.340> more<00:03:31.579> of<00:03:31.790> a

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
going to have a little bit more of a

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.610 
going to have a little bit more of a
flame<00:03:32.389> coming<00:03:32.720> out<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.989> gun<00:03:33.169> if<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.409> low

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
flame coming out the gun if it's low

flame coming out the gun if it's low
light<00:03:33.889> as<00:03:34.099> we<00:03:34.790> work<00:03:35.000> our<00:03:35.180> way<00:03:35.209> back<00:03:35.629> on<00:03:35.870> the

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.159 
light as we work our way back on the
guns<00:03:36.229> we<00:03:36.470> look<00:03:36.650> at<00:03:36.769> rail<00:03:37.040> systems<00:03:37.609> I

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
guns we look at rail systems I

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.170 
guns we look at rail systems I
particularly<00:03:39.169> like<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> 12<00:03:39.979> inch<00:03:40.189> rail<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:40.729> like

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
particularly like a 12 inch rail I like

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.939 
particularly like a 12 inch rail I like
to<00:03:41.299> get<00:03:41.389> my<00:03:41.540> hand<00:03:41.780> out<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:41.959> little<00:03:42.139> further<00:03:42.439> when

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
to get my hand out a little further when

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.289 
to get my hand out a little further when
we're<00:03:43.069> shooting<00:03:43.459> more<00:03:43.669> on<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.120> later

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
we're shooting more on that in later

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.899 
we're shooting more on that in later
segments<00:03:44.900> but<00:03:45.349> it<00:03:45.470> also<00:03:45.620> adds<00:03:46.009> I<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:46.729> put<00:03:46.879> a

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
segments but it also adds I can put a

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.039 
segments but it also adds I can put a
light<00:03:47.120> on<00:03:47.269> there<00:03:47.449> I<00:03:47.479> don't<00:03:47.540> get<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> lot<00:03:47.989> of

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
light on there I don't get a lot of

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.140 
light on there I don't get a lot of
feedback<00:03:48.590> on<00:03:49.009> my<00:03:49.129> barrel<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.609> light<00:03:49.790> gets<00:03:49.970> out

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
feedback on my barrel the light gets out

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.909 
feedback on my barrel the light gets out
there<00:03:50.299> a<00:03:50.329> little<00:03:50.569> further<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.079> can<00:03:51.259> rest<00:03:51.650> on

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:51.919 
there a little further I can rest on

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.129 
there a little further I can rest on
cover<00:03:52.849> a<00:03:52.970> little<00:03:53.150> bit<00:03:53.269> easier<00:03:53.720> when<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.930> have<00:03:54.109> a

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
cover a little bit easier when I have a

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.039

long barrel or a long rail and it just

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.020 
long barrel or a long rail and it just
makes<00:03:57.199> things<00:03:57.469> life<00:03:57.859> a<00:03:57.979> lot<00:03:58.099> easier<00:03:58.159> we<00:03:58.879> look

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
makes things life a lot easier we look

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.179 
makes things life a lot easier we look
at<00:03:59.150> iron<00:03:59.419> sights<00:03:59.780> you<00:04:00.049> need<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.439> have<00:04:00.650> some<00:04:00.979> on
