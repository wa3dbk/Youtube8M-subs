00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the best thing is you can take this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.699 
the best thing is you can take this
tripod<00:02:32.530> head<00:02:32.680> off<00:02:32.830> now<00:02:33.549> we<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.819> pop<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.269> to

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
tripod head off now we can pop it on to

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.979 
tripod head off now we can pop it on to
an<00:02:35.709> extra<00:02:36.069> tripod<00:02:36.580> or<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.450> can<00:02:37.569> put<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.900> all

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
an extra tripod or you can put it all

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.650 
an extra tripod or you can put it all
into<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.530> slider<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.640> have<00:02:39.819> many<00:02:39.970> many<00:02:40.330> uses

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
into a slider so you have many many uses

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.440 
into a slider so you have many many uses
for<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.580> pack<00:02:42.819> at<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.180> same

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
for this and it can pack at the same

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.900 
for this and it can pack at the same
time<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:44.079> metro<00:02:44.440> tow<00:02:44.500> version<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.459> can't<00:02:45.730> do

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
time the metro tow version you can't do

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.819 
time the metro tow version you can't do
that<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.900> three<00:02:47.110> hundred<00:02:47.380> and<00:02:47.500> fifty

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
that so the three hundred and fifty

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.160 
that so the three hundred and fifty
dollar<00:02:48.040> price<00:02:48.370> range<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:49.349> think<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.799> is

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
dollar price range I think that is

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.340 
dollar price range I think that is
something<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.010> it's<00:02:54.310> not<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:55.350> well

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
something that you know it's not as well

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.890 
something that you know it's not as well
considered<00:02:56.980> as<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:58.120> manual<00:02:58.600> version<00:03:00.900> there

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
considered as the manual version there

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.440 
considered as the manual version there
are<00:03:01.930> some<00:03:02.170> complaints<00:03:02.650> about<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.700> being<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450
