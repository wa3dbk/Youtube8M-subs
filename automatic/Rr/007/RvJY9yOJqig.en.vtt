bigger<00:02:16.830> competitors<00:02:17.830> now<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:19.090> has<00:02:19.300> to<00:02:19.330> be

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
bigger competitors now this has to be

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.410 
bigger competitors now this has to be
done<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.930> way<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:21.070> proper<00:02:21.489> you're<00:02:22.239> not
