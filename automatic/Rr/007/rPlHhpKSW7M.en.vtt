especially for a figure of such a small
magnitude<00:02:15.600> this<00:02:16.260> guy<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.500> only<00:02:17.660> 3.75<00:02:18.660> inches

they<00:02:54.550> did<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> skull<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:56.020> they<00:02:56.710> made<00:02:56.920> his

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
they did with the skull is they made his

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.000 
they did with the skull is they made his
arm<00:02:57.510> not<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> joint<00:02:59.080> at<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.350> elbow<00:02:59.740> so

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
arm not have a joint at the elbow so

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.730 
arm not have a joint at the elbow so
that<00:03:00.040> made<00:03:00.340> Sonic's<00:03:01.330> arm<00:03:01.510> look<00:03:01.750> less<00:03:02.200> bulky

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
that made Sonic's arm look less bulky

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.410 
that made Sonic's arm look less bulky
like<00:03:02.890> he's<00:03:03.070> been<00:03:03.220> lifting<00:03:03.550> wobbly<00:03:03.940> weights

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
like he's been lifting wobbly weights

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.050 
like he's been lifting wobbly weights
and<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:05.680> just<00:03:05.920> like<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.340> his<00:03:06.400> arms<00:03:06.700> look<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.910> lot

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
and I just like that his arms look a lot

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.580 
and I just like that his arms look a lot
skinnier<00:03:07.450> because<00:03:07.600> that's<00:03:08.290> how<00:03:08.440> they<00:03:08.560> were

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
skinnier because that's how they were

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.280 
skinnier because that's how they were
any<00:03:09.010> class<00:03:09.250> at<00:03:09.430> games<00:03:09.690> got<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.840> nice<00:03:11.080> big

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
angle this smiles to the lens so

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.050 
angle this smiles to the lens so
everything<00:03:25.600> looks<00:03:25.720> good<00:03:26.020> on<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.890> guy<00:03:27.100> now

I'm<00:03:28.120> going<00:03:28.240> to<00:03:28.300> show<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.570> little<00:03:28.810> bit<00:03:28.990> about

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
I'm going to show you a little bit about

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.860 
I'm going to show you a little bit about
motor<00:03:29.680> bug<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.700> as<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.000> can<00:03:31.090> see<00:03:31.150> it<00:03:31.420> has<00:03:31.660> that

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
motor bug and as you can see it has that

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.290 
motor bug and as you can see it has that
ladybug<00:03:32.290> look<00:03:32.710> I<00:03:32.980> do<00:03:33.310> believe<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
ladybug look I do believe this is the

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.650 
ladybug look I do believe this is the
modern<00:03:34.600> Moto<00:03:35.020> bug<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.060> big<00:03:37.270> deal

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
modern Moto bug so it's not a big deal

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.180 
modern Moto bug so it's not a big deal
I've<00:03:37.780> still<00:03:38.020> got<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.200> moto<00:03:38.440> bug<00:03:38.680> either<00:03:38.950> way

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
I've still got a moto bug either way

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.030 
I've still got a moto bug either way
however<00:03:39.850> this<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:40.840> supposed<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.290> from<00:03:41.440> 1991

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
however this is supposed to be from 1991

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.970 
however this is supposed to be from 1991
so<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> little<00:03:42.940> bit<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.210> discrepancy

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
so that is a little bit of a discrepancy

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.970 
so that is a little bit of a discrepancy
but<00:03:44.980> moto<00:03:45.370> bug<00:03:45.610> sculpt<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.240> very<00:03:46.990> very<00:03:47.290> nice<00:03:47.500> it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
but moto bug sculpt is very very nice it

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.520 
but moto bug sculpt is very very nice it
has<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.190> lot<00:03:48.550> of<00:03:48.580> detail<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.060> it<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:50.050> wheel<00:03:50.230> does

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
has a lot of detail to it the wheel does

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.699 
has a lot of detail to it the wheel does
not<00:03:50.770> move<00:03:51.040> which<00:03:51.520> I<00:03:51.700> had<00:03:52.450> some<00:03:52.750> preconceptions

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
not move which I had some preconceptions

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.550 
not move which I had some preconceptions
about<00:03:54.010> but<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.670> does<00:03:55.150> not<00:03:55.360> move<00:03:55.660> so<00:03:55.990> that's<00:03:56.440> a

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
about but it does not move so that's a

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.780 
about but it does not move so that's a
little<00:03:56.680> bit<00:03:56.860> disappointing<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.640> it's

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
little bit disappointing so it's

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.460 
little bit disappointing so it's
actually<00:03:57.970> not<00:03:58.300> as<00:03:58.450> mobile<00:03:58.870> as<00:03:59.050> the<00:03:59.290> name

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
actually not as mobile as the name

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.470 
actually not as mobile as the name
suggests<00:03:59.860> but<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.850> does<00:04:01.030> have<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.240> lot<00:04:01.450> of

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
suggests but it does have a lot of

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.800 
suggests but it does have a lot of
details<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.080> what<00:04:02.350> makes<00:04:02.590> up<00:04:02.800> for<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:04.510> lack<00:04:04.540> of

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
details so what makes up for the lack of

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.170 
details so what makes up for the lack of
movement<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.500> does<00:04:05.770> make<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.190> for<00:04:06.459> in<00:04:06.700> detail

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
movement it does make up for in detail

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.140 
movement it does make up for in detail
so<00:04:07.660> moto<00:04:08.350> bug<00:04:08.650> has<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.400> lot<00:04:09.670> of<00:04:09.700> nice<00:04:09.940> features

forward and backwards joints a little

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.680 
forward and backwards joints a little
bit<00:04:45.160> stiff<00:04:45.430> which<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:45.820> do<00:04:45.880> appreciate
