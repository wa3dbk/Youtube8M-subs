this<00:01:54.470> is<00:01:54.620> great<00:01:54.830> because<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.460> know<00:01:55.880> we've<00:01:56.360> all

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
this is great because you know we've all

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.300 
this is great because you know we've all
got<00:01:56.720> bags<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.230> have<00:01:57.290> got<00:01:57.530> these<00:01:57.650> these

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
got bags that have got these these

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.000 
got bags that have got these these
velcro<00:01:58.640> bits<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.450> the<00:02:00.020> mini<00:02:00.200> you've<00:02:00.350> got<00:02:00.500> gear

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
velcro bits and the mini you've got gear

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.950 
velcro bits and the mini you've got gear
in<00:02:01.130> there<00:02:01.340> moving<00:02:02.120> those<00:02:02.390> around<00:02:02.660> is<00:02:02.930> a

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
in there moving those around is a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.710 
in there moving those around is a
complete<00:02:03.380> pain<00:02:03.619> I<00:02:03.860> mean<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.160> really<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:05.270> we

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
complete pain I mean it really is and we

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.050 
complete pain I mean it really is and we
just<00:02:06.440> looked<00:02:06.740> at<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.130> pain<00:02:07.310> points<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.820> our

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
just looked at the pain points of our

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.719 
just looked at the pain points of our
consumers<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.350> photographer's<00:02:10.040> how<00:02:10.459> can

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
consumers of the photographer's how can

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.310 
consumers of the photographer's how can
we<00:02:10.910> either<00:02:11.090> reduce<00:02:11.600> them<00:02:11.840> or<00:02:11.990> at<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.200> minimum

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
we either reduce them or at a minimum

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.650 
we either reduce them or at a minimum
like<00:02:13.100> or<00:02:13.250> reduce<00:02:13.760> them<00:02:14.000> or<00:02:14.180> eliminate

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
like or reduce them or eliminate

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.320 
like or reduce them or eliminate
eliminate<00:02:15.320> them<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:16.190> it<00:02:16.670> was<00:02:16.820> just<00:02:16.970> a<00:02:17.120> great

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
eliminate them so it was just a great

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.940 
eliminate them so it was just a great
way<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> work<00:02:17.780> with<00:02:17.930> our<00:02:18.080> designers<00:02:18.590> trying<00:02:18.830> to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
way to work with our designers trying to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.250 
way to work with our designers trying to
find<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.250> solution<00:02:19.430> yeah<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:20.959> think

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
find a solution yeah this is it I think

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.750 
find a solution yeah this is it I think
this<00:02:21.320> is<00:02:21.380> properly<00:02:21.890> innovative<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.490> think<00:02:22.670> this

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
this is properly innovative I think this

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.610 
this is properly innovative I think this
is<00:02:22.880> really<00:02:23.180> interesting<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:23.870> love<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.410> way

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
is really interesting I love the way

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.870 
is really interesting I love the way
that<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.160> mean<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.370> could<00:02:25.610> put<00:02:25.760> your

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
that you can I mean you could put your

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.980 
that you can I mean you could put your
lens<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.180> there<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.570> sort<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.720> pull<00:02:26.870> it

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
lens in there and just sort of pull it

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.780 
lens in there and just sort of pull it
tight<00:02:27.200> correct<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:27.950> now<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:28.280> all<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:28.700> all

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
tight correct and now it's all it's all

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.630 
tight correct and now it's all it's all
tightly<00:02:29.060> held<00:02:29.300> in<00:02:29.510> place<00:02:29.630> and<00:02:30.100> just<00:02:31.100> as<00:02:31.310> simple

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
tightly held in place and just as simple

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.900 
tightly held in place and just as simple
you<00:02:31.910> change<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:32.390> back<00:02:33.250> that's<00:02:34.250> fabulous<00:02:34.520> so

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
you change it back that's fabulous so

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.090 
you change it back that's fabulous so
this<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.269> a<00:02:35.300> case<00:02:35.570> logic<00:02:35.900> luminosity<00:02:36.890> did<00:02:37.010> you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
this is a case logic luminosity did you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.710 
this is a case logic luminosity did you
say<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.550> is<00:02:37.700> correct<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.209> where<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.630> people

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
say that is correct and where can people

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.810 
say that is correct and where can people
find<00:02:38.959> these<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.920> would<00:02:40.070> be<00:02:40.280> able<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.610> find
