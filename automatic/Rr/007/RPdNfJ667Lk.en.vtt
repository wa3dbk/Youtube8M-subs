00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.840 
it goes over my head that could fit a
fairly<00:03:38.080> large<00:03:38.200> head<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:39.370> only<00:03:39.459> goes<00:03:39.670> like

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
fairly large head and it only goes like

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.600 
fairly large head and it only goes like
that<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.380> when<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.920> looks<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.250> little<00:03:42.340> big<00:03:42.580> for

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
that so when it looks a little big for

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.220 
that so when it looks a little big for
smaller<00:03:43.060> heads<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.570> don't<00:03:43.750> think<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.050> one

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
smaller heads I don't think this one

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.449 
smaller heads I don't think this one
might<00:03:44.350> be<00:03:44.410> too<00:03:44.620> big<00:03:44.800> for<00:03:44.920> my<00:03:45.010> ear<00:03:45.220> olds<00:03:45.370> head

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
might be too big for my ear olds head

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.060 
might be too big for my ear olds head
I'll<00:03:45.700> find<00:03:46.060> out<00:03:46.180> later<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:47.650> can<00:03:47.769> see<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:47.980> has

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
know the left is where the cord comes

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.009 
know the left is where the cord comes
from<00:03:53.790> fits<00:03:54.790> over<00:03:55.060> my<00:03:55.239> head<00:03:55.450> with<00:03:55.630> my<00:03:55.810> hat<00:03:55.989> on

retracts<00:04:00.670> up<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.150> down<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.810> can't<00:04:02.050> do<00:04:02.230> little

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
retracts up and down you can't do little

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.000 
retracts up and down you can't do little
clicks<00:04:02.830> as<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.160> slides<00:04:03.340> up<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.640> down<00:04:03.760> it's<00:04:04.420> not

clicks as it slides up and down it's not

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.530 
clicks as it slides up and down it's not
flexible<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.370> just<00:04:06.549> saves<00:04:06.670> one<00:04:06.790> place<00:04:07.000> that's

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
flexible it just saves one place that's

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.170 
flexible it just saves one place that's
fairly<00:04:07.930> close<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.739> the<00:04:08.769> mouth<00:04:09.190> what<00:04:09.910> I'm<00:04:10.000> going

glow<00:04:57.319> around<00:04:57.500> at<00:04:58.069> night<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.430> imagine<00:04:58.969> it<00:04:59.090> gives

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
glow around at night I imagine it gives

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.559 
glow around at night I imagine it gives
a<00:04:59.419> little<00:04:59.539> bit<00:04:59.629> of<00:04:59.719> an<00:04:59.870> ambient<00:05:00.289> blue<00:05:00.500> glow<00:05:01.569> so

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
a little bit of an ambient blue glow so

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.119 
a little bit of an ambient blue glow so
I<00:05:02.810> didn't<00:05:03.020> know<00:05:03.110> is<00:05:03.349> that<00:05:03.379> I<00:05:03.560> first<00:05:03.889> went<00:05:04.099> to

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
I didn't know is that I first went to

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.709 
I didn't know is that I first went to
plug<00:05:04.310> them<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.639> until<00:05:04.849> I<00:05:05.000> took<00:05:05.270> them<00:05:05.419> off<00:05:05.539> and

00:05:05.709 --> 00:05:05.719 
plug them in until I took them off and
