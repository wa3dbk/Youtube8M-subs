00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.199
 i 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.460
 Only then let's go 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.030
 the production will be like this with the sun, right? 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:33.320
 you will use the be that would be the cherry of the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:36.229
 sun or even its intention would be a minor 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.610
 is a genius one 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.549
 only this is the only male who forgives him 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.720
 just be not enough just do not know if the bass 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.970
 under the sun 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.520
 so come on, in fact, already done here 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.520
 oh 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.610
 the Lord 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.600
 the smaller 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.600
 it's bigger 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.119
 ae 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.190
 O 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.500
 ok it has an introduction in the middle that is the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.970
 solo of the two sacs we can follow 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.190
 on the keyboard, right? 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.190
 It's more like a hair 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.300
 it's very easy 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.300
 then it was his biggest 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.590
 went there 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.600
 my sun is more or less like that 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:16.500
 to remember about the make who 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.500

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.600
 is 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 OK 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:54.760
 ok, ok if you want to be doing it right? 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.010
 It's not our obligation, it's the artists of the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.660
 another only if you are prospecting may 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.380
 stop doing this solo represents in the 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.480
 sax is it here the world is doing alone 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.900
 a delivery just to remember the melody 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.450
 but even 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.450
 the defendant himself in the selection 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.569
 Sun 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.320
 good again 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.880
 I think watching your biggest is 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.760
 It's spoken like a goal. 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.260
 I use the bustling 7 to actually stay with 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.560
 your knives and commented not only have 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.560

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.270

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.350
 best 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.800
 Beauty, only God bless you in name. 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.800
