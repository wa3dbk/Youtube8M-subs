00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
this Western art he has been

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.649 
this Western art he has been
rediscovering<00:02:06.250> his<00:02:06.640> own<00:02:06.820> culture<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
rediscovering his own culture and

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.280 
rediscovering his own culture and
China's<00:02:08.200> art<00:02:08.409> so<00:02:09.009> he<00:02:09.729> is<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.849> link<00:02:10.239> between<00:02:10.599> our

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
China's art so he is a link between our

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.030 
China's art so he is a link between our
two<00:02:11.590> cultures<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.659> also<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.920> very

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
two cultures and also it's very

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.979 
two cultures and also it's very
difficult<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.970> make<00:02:16.150> any<00:02:16.420> kind<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.810> difference

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
difficult to make any kind of difference

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.470 
difficult to make any kind of difference
between<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> artist<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.580> man<00:02:18.939> because

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
between the artist and the man because

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.050 
between the artist and the man because
every<00:02:20.049> emotion<00:02:20.620> he<00:02:21.220> has<00:02:21.400> gone<00:02:21.580> through<00:02:21.640> life

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
every emotion he has gone through life

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.039 
every emotion he has gone through life
has<00:02:22.629> been<00:02:22.840> put<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.439> his<00:02:23.890> work<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.390> he<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.810> really

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
has been put in his work so he is really

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.649 
has been put in his work so he is really
a<00:02:26.170> true<00:02:26.470> artist<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.159> reconciliation<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.390> he

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
a true artist of reconciliation and he

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.000 
a true artist of reconciliation and he
is<00:02:28.750> an<00:02:28.900> artist<00:02:29.290> with<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.580> little<00:02:31.090> magic<00:02:32.010> that's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
is an artist with a little magic that's

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.680 
is an artist with a little magic that's
why<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.250> do<00:02:33.490> believe

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
why I do believe

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.500 
why I do believe
he's<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.500> one<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.490> key<00:02:36.670> artists<00:02:37.030> of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
he's really one of the key artists of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.590 
he's really one of the key artists of
today<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.020> must<00:02:38.800> say<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> deep

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
today I must say I have a deep

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.750 
today I must say I have a deep
tenderness<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.500> first<00:02:41.770> paintings<00:02:42.400> and
