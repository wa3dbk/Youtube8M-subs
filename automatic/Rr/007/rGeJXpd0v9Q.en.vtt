00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.630
 hello girls today I 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.460
 found in a new video for 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.380
 you by the hair again and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.109
 more specifically on how 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.800
 colored her hair in a semi 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.840
 permed 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.279
 so it's not going to be permanent in the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 time it means that it will go to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.730
 end of a number of champions 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.740
 that's what I have right now in my 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 hair I do not know if the color is going 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.320
 make it really like in real life it's a 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.520
 little fuchsia that pulls red 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 it's a very pretty color the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 try to match man my manicure with my 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.600
 hair I find it super nice and the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.030
 more fun in all this is that these 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.010
 semi permanent so that will fade in 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.899
 the time with the shampoos I was 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.570
 very skeptical at first I remember 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 month colors nook color pulse that 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
 was a disaster 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.699
 I know that my sister had made a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.649
 red and it was even years 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 after on his locks blondes it is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.129
 still saw so I was afraid being 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.469
 given that I still have a base 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.670
 blonde and that I intend to redo my 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.119
 wicks very soon 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.770
 I was a little skeptical so me 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.970
 I will tell you about the crazy range 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.040
 color you can find it I know 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.509
 it sells in blue stores 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.439
 dragonflies and on their websites 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.939
 at the price of six euros 50 or 100 euros 80 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.189
 I do not have the exact price but it is in 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.740
 these waters there and you have a range of 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.479
 really huge colors I know he 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.329
 there are silvert colors you have 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.520
 several black pink blue lines 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.439
 there are really cool colors 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.060
 with what we can have fun 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.560
 the only small problem is that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.049
 colors really does not make it the same 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 on your hair only on the little ones 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.259
 nice or there is in store after 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.909
 at the same time it's a little normal 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.040
 it depends on the color of your hair 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.960
 if you go on a blonde base on 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.119
 a raw base in brown with reds 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.430
 you will never have the same 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.750
 made on everyone 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.090
 so I have two colors that I have 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.969
 wanted to absolutely test 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.770
 the first is bubble gum blue and the 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.679
 second is the color ended 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.090
 it's not how it's really said 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.609
 that I know is that this one is a 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.190
 blue a little blue-green glass of water 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.379
 if reindeer is this one that's what I have 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.730
 in my hair you can see 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.879
 I tried both so I could 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.620
 to make my opinion the blue I had seen on 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.480
 a girl in town and I have so much 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.920
 loved that I was asking him everything from 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.319
 after that it was my calm explained 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.849
 the principle in fact it's simple you 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.620
 wash your hair as usual 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.880
 once your hair is a little 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.860
 little and will know how to towel you 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 apply it is less easy to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.250
 apply it on wet hair as dry 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.120
 but hey I got it I got it 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.579
 does alone and it's not a 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.209
 disaster so you apply it on 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.010
 wet hair 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.720
 then you will rinse off you leave 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.849
 ask 15 to 30 minutes depending on Grand Duke 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.430
 you want to go enough and you 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.319
 have the final result so knowing 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.090
 that the advantage is that it does not have 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.110
 hidden my shower tray which is white 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.819
 I was very scared especially for the red 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.260
 the t-shirt on what you when you 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.730
 do your coloring absolutely 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.079
 be it an old t-shirt since 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.819
 is hashed according to the color you 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.900
 take with it it was a lot less 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.319
 that she does with red but in 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.680
 all cases 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.269
 do not put a super super restraint yourself 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.639
 just bought this is me I really 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.959
 put an old pajama top that I that 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.849
 I only put to make my colors 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.519
 and I protected a little towel 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.019
 on my shoulders after you get started 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.190
 have the final result drying you and 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:24.200
 here is the blue and part I am part 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.560
 after four weeks three four 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.410
 weeks 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.910
 knowing that I did the same 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.410
 time my coconut cure so that makes 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.109
 to kill the colors so it's okay 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.940
 help but yes that it has helped to 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.560
 From I really disliked the record 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.510
 on me only on the person I saw 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200
 in town it was really blue 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.700
 Mermaid 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.680
 you who have a small picture between 2 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.720
 or at the end of this video if I arrive 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.920
 not but I liked less make him him 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.300
 frankly you maybe more for them 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.560
 good days this summer when it will be very 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.269
 beautiful and so for this here is the rank 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.480
 of the game I love because at the base I 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.280
 wanted to make red hair but that 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.170
 it's not possible that's it 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.239
 request for maintenance it's a cost etc 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.349
 and then maybe not ready yet and 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.650
 andrÃ© that I work in the sale 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.819
 it's very difficult to be able to 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.250
 to be able to do what we want on our 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.540
 Hair So here I made in 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.610
 Thai honda a little bit and that makes 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.870
 really a great effect right there it makes 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.700
 maybe a little less well given 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.380
 I got curly hair with 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.130
 foam 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.650
 besides, I will perhaps make you a 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.820
 tutorial on this hairstyle because me the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.729
 base here is my hair is still 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.760
 pretty stiff like my bangs and I have 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.979
 still managed to have a semblance of 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.360
 loops that I like enough and that makes 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.380
 same time it creates a lot of volume 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.180
 so that's fine weather 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.030
 have this hair a little airy 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.020
 clutter and so that's if you have them 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.700
 straight hair and you would like 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.080
 to do a little bit of these kinds of 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.150
 hairstyle do not hesitate to ask me 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.550
 you will do a tutorial with pleasure 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.710
 nothing complicated to come back 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.280
 in colors they are bottles of 100 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.500
 ml 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.800
 in addition to the bottle he is super cute 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.479
 here it is all pink 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.600
 it's a little dirty and so you 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.280
 have the color that is written here and 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.050
 this is me I look at the controls it has not 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.550
 not damaged my hair since these are 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.580
 semi-permanent colors that does not 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.710
 contains no ammonia necessarily and I 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.050
 think it's a pretty cool way 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.340
 to be able to change your mind as to 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.380
 marc this is me I am someone who 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.760
 love to change according to the seasons and there 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.800
 I really wanted to do in my 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.090
 hair color of peps and 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.530
 frankly I love it and I really 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.820
 want to go get me back full of 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.430
 colors to be able to change 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:28.610
 and here I think it's super super nice 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.440
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.139
 rained I try to do a little bit 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.520
 many lives 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.150
 to different for not all the time 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.110
 stayed on the same on the same theme 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.969
 do not hesitate to tell me if you had 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.389
