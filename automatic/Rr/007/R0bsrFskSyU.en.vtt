hi<00:00:03.830> I'm<00:00:04.100> Brennan<00:00:04.580> from<00:00:04.730> waffles<00:00:05.180> community

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi I'm Brennan from waffles community

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.650 
hi I'm Brennan from waffles community
robotics<00:00:06.200> and<00:00:06.399> this<00:00:07.399> is<00:00:07.550> the<00:00:07.670> last<00:00:07.970> video<00:00:08.240> that

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
robotics and this is the last video that

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.450 
robotics and this is the last video that
goes<00:00:08.990> through<00:00:09.410> all<00:00:09.680> the<00:00:09.980> different<00:00:10.010> blocks

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
goes through all the different blocks

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.600 
goes through all the different blocks
that<00:00:10.760> the<00:00:10.850> ev3<00:00:11.120> software<00:00:11.360> has<00:00:12.080> to<00:00:12.380> offer<00:00:13.010> that

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
that the ev3 software has to offer that

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.460 
that the ev3 software has to offer that
are<00:00:13.760> legal<00:00:14.150> for<00:00:14.180> FLL<00:00:15.140> and<00:00:16.180> that<00:00:17.180> one<00:00:17.359> is<00:00:17.720> the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
are legal for FLL and that one is the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.470 
are legal for FLL and that one is the
file<00:00:18.800> access<00:00:19.340> block<00:00:19.640> which<00:00:20.030> can<00:00:20.210> be<00:00:20.300> found

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
file access block which can be found

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.130 
file access block which can be found
right<00:00:20.630> here<00:00:21.550> so<00:00:22.550> if<00:00:22.610> we<00:00:22.670> drag<00:00:22.880> that<00:00:23.060> out<00:00:23.140> there

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
right here so if we drag that out there

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.310 
right here so if we drag that out there
are<00:00:24.199> a<00:00:24.230> few<00:00:24.380> different<00:00:24.680> options<00:00:25.960> but<00:00:26.960> first<00:00:27.170> I

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
are a few different options but first I

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.050 
are a few different options but first I
should<00:00:27.380> get<00:00:27.590> into<00:00:27.860> what<00:00:28.010> it<00:00:28.100> actually<00:00:28.279> does<00:00:28.699> so

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
should get into what it actually does so

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.990 
should get into what it actually does so
what<00:00:29.180> the<00:00:29.300> file<00:00:29.480> access<00:00:29.900> block<00:00:30.199> does<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:31.000> saves

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
what the file access block does is saves

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.090 
what the file access block does is saves
an<00:00:32.410> RTF<00:00:33.410> file<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.010> rich<00:00:34.160> text<00:00:34.640> format<00:00:36.100> onto

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
an RTF file so rich text format onto

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.969 
an RTF file so rich text format onto
your<00:00:37.429> brick<00:00:38.179> and<00:00:38.479> it<00:00:38.899> saves<00:00:39.170> under<00:00:39.710> your

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
your brick and it saves under your

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:44.259 
your brick and it saves under your
project<00:00:40.579> name<00:00:41.589> so<00:00:42.589> you<00:00:43.489> can<00:00:43.519> name<00:00:43.879> your<00:00:43.909> file

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
project name so you can name your file

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.059 
project name so you can name your file
and<00:00:44.539> then<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:44.899> has<00:00:45.079> you<00:00:45.739> can<00:00:45.889> write

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
and then it has you can write

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:48.219 
and then it has you can write
information<00:00:46.359> into<00:00:47.359> it<00:00:47.479> and<00:00:47.629> then<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.079> could

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
information into it and then you could

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.270 
information into it and then you could
read<00:00:48.499> it<00:00:48.679> and<00:00:48.859> you<00:00:49.100> can<00:00:49.249> delete<00:00:49.489> it<00:00:49.519> and

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
read it and you can delete it and

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.680 
read it and you can delete it and
something<00:00:52.280> that's<00:00:52.399> called<00:00:52.670> closed<00:00:53.059> which

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
something that's called closed which

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.250 
something that's called closed which
we'll<00:00:53.870> get<00:00:53.959> into<00:00:54.019> later<00:00:55.749> so<00:00:56.749> right<00:00:56.989> here<00:00:57.199> is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
we'll get into later so right here is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.619 
we'll get into later so right here is
your<00:00:57.379> file<00:00:57.589> name<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.069> can<00:00:58.729> have<00:00:59.089> it<00:00:59.209> wired<00:00:59.389> in

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
your file name you can have it wired in

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.939 
your file name you can have it wired in
through<00:01:00.619> a<00:01:00.649> variable<00:01:01.190> or<00:01:01.780> you<00:01:02.780> can<00:01:03.049> just<00:01:03.739> name

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
through a variable or you can just name

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.330 
through a variable or you can just name
it<00:01:04.570> or<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.869> can<00:01:06.110> leave<00:01:06.290> it<00:01:06.350> as<00:01:06.590> ABC<00:01:07.130> here<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:10.250> we

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
it or we can leave it as ABC here so we

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.740 
it or we can leave it as ABC here so we
have<00:01:10.460> a<00:01:10.490> few<00:01:10.670> different<00:01:10.730> modes<00:01:11.000> we<00:01:11.240> have<00:01:11.330> read

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
have a few different modes we have read

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.450 
have a few different modes we have read
and<00:01:12.050> write<00:01:13.390> when<00:01:14.390> you're<00:01:14.480> writing<00:01:15.310> we'll<00:01:16.310> go

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
and write when you're writing we'll go

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.120 
and write when you're writing we'll go
in<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.670> write<00:01:16.850> mode<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:18.170> doesn't<00:01:18.440> matter<00:01:18.740> what

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
in to write mode it doesn't matter what

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.670 
in to write mode it doesn't matter what
you'll<00:01:19.880> notice<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.450> there's<00:01:20.690> no<00:01:20.960> text<00:01:21.590> or

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
you'll notice that there's no text or

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.500 
you'll notice that there's no text or
numeric<00:01:22.100> option<00:01:22.460> for<00:01:22.670> right<00:01:22.880> there's<00:01:23.240> only

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
numeric option for right there's only

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.090 
numeric option for right there's only
just<00:01:24.310> write<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.050> because<00:01:27.410> it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
just write and this is because it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.890 
just write and this is because it
doesn't<00:01:28.430> really<00:01:28.550> matter<00:01:28.850> you<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.420> put<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.720> a

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
doesn't really matter you can put in a

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.440 
doesn't really matter you can put in a
any<00:01:30.170> any<00:01:31.450> number<00:01:32.450> or<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:33.040> letter<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:34.310> there<00:01:34.730> over

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
any any number or a letter in there over

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.110 
any any number or a letter in there over
and<00:01:35.570> over<00:01:35.720> again<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.110> it<00:01:37.040> doesn't<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.460> you

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
and over again and it doesn't and you

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.570 
and over again and it doesn't and you
can<00:01:38.360> read<00:01:38.570> whatever<00:01:38.930> file<00:01:39.230> format<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.890> ends<00:01:40.340> up

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
can read whatever file format it ends up

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.300 
can read whatever file format it ends up
being<00:01:41.320> which<00:01:42.320> you'll<00:01:42.470> have<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:42.740> indicate<00:01:43.010> when

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
being which you'll have to indicate when

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.220 
being which you'll have to indicate when
you<00:01:43.400> want<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.670> read<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.090> file<00:01:45.050> actually<00:01:46.150> so

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
you want to read the file actually so

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.760 
you want to read the file actually so
for<00:01:48.230> ABC<00:01:48.620> we<00:01:48.830> can<00:01:48.980> put<00:01:49.100> in<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.310> number<00:01:49.580> we<00:01:49.730> can<00:01:49.760> do

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
for ABC we can put in a number we can do

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.370 
for ABC we can put in a number we can do
one<00:01:51.770> two<00:01:51.800> three<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:52.900> when<00:01:53.900> we<00:01:54.020> actually

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
one two three and so when we actually

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.790 
one two three and so when we actually
run<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.650> program<00:01:55.720> what<00:01:56.720> will<00:01:56.840> happen<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.470> it

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
run this program what will happen is it

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.230 
run this program what will happen is it
won't<00:01:57.950> look<00:01:58.100> like<00:01:58.159> it'll<00:01:58.700> look<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.090> won't

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
won't look like it'll look like it won't

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.570 
won't look like it'll look like it won't
actually<00:01:59.450> do<00:01:59.750> anything<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.920> when<00:02:01.130> we<00:02:01.280> pull<00:02:01.550> it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
actually do anything but when we pull it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.630 
actually do anything but when we pull it
up<00:02:01.790> I'll<00:02:02.210> show<00:02:02.630> you<00:02:02.690> an<00:02:02.810> example<00:02:02.900> right<00:02:03.260> here

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
up I'll show you an example right here

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.280 
up I'll show you an example right here
this<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.700> an<00:02:04.940> example<00:02:05.240> of<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.600> running<00:02:05.930> three

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
this is an example of it running three

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.770 
this is an example of it running three
times<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.220> one<00:02:07.610> we<00:02:07.760> actually<00:02:08.179> open<00:02:08.509> up<00:02:08.599> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
times so one we actually open up the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.830 
times so one we actually open up the
file<00:02:09.909> you'll<00:02:10.909> see<00:02:10.999> that<00:02:11.269> there<00:02:11.480> are<00:02:11.569> three

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
file you'll see that there are three

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.739 
file you'll see that there are three
entries<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.680> one<00:02:12.829> two<00:02:13.040> three<00:02:13.340> every<00:02:14.180> time<00:02:14.450> that

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:14.749 
entries of one two three every time that

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.540 
entries of one two three every time that
that<00:02:14.900> block<00:02:15.230> executes<00:02:15.859> earlier

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that block executes earlier

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.770 
that block executes earlier
it<00:02:17.420> inputs<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:19.000> one-two-three<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.150> then<00:02:20.750> a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
it inputs a one-two-three and then a

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.350 
it inputs a one-two-three and then a
space<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.290> then<00:02:21.410> an<00:02:21.650> enter<00:02:22.150> so<00:02:23.890> yeah<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:26.180> can

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
space and then an enter so yeah you can

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.720 
space and then an enter so yeah you can
eat<00:02:26.600> keeps<00:02:26.990> building<00:02:27.260> on<00:02:27.530> top<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.010> itself

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
eat keeps building on top of itself

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.360 
eat keeps building on top of itself
so<00:02:28.820> over<00:02:29.150> and<00:02:29.240> over<00:02:29.450> again<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:30.620> won't<00:02:30.860> rewrite

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
so over and over again so won't rewrite

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.000 
so over and over again so won't rewrite
the<00:02:32.050> file<00:02:33.880> when<00:02:34.880> you're<00:02:35.290> running<00:02:36.290> them<00:02:36.530> say

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the file when you're running them say

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.220 
the file when you're running them say
the<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.550> program<00:02:37.940> again<00:02:38.240> or<00:02:38.390> mission<00:02:39.080> or

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
the the program again or mission or

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.210 
the the program again or mission or
whatever<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.680> happen<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.070> be<00:02:40.640> using<00:02:40.850> it<00:02:41.090> for

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
whatever you happen to be using it for

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.510 
whatever you happen to be using it for
so<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.400> brings<00:02:43.610> us<00:02:43.850> back<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:45.710> block

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
so that brings us back to the block

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.290 
so that brings us back to the block
again<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.650> read<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:48.980> pretty<00:02:49.220> standard<00:02:49.580> we'll

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
again the read is pretty standard we'll

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.810 
again the read is pretty standard we'll
just<00:02:50.660> pull<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:50.930> another<00:02:51.170> block<00:02:51.470> here<00:02:51.820> there's

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
just pull it another block here there's

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.720 
just pull it another block here there's
two<00:02:53.060> different<00:02:53.210> modes<00:02:53.860> read<00:02:54.860> texts<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.520> read

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
two different modes read texts and read

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.610 
two different modes read texts and read
numeric<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.450> this<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:56.930> entirely<00:02:57.260> dependent

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
numeric and this is entirely dependent

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.540 
numeric and this is entirely dependent
on<00:02:58.100> what<00:02:59.890> information<00:03:00.890> you're<00:03:01.100> putting<00:03:01.400> in

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
on what information you're putting in

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.760 
on what information you're putting in
when<00:03:02.540> you're<00:03:02.660> putting<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:03.050> for<00:03:03.200> information

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
when you're putting in for information

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.450 
when you're putting in for information
that<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:04.160> doesn't<00:03:04.490> require<00:03:04.580> a<00:03:05.210> specific<00:03:06.460> data

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
that it doesn't require a specific data

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.640 
that it doesn't require a specific data
wire<00:03:07.760> type<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.750> you<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.230> know<00:03:09.410> what's

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
wire type so you have to know what's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.820 
wire type so you have to know what's
inside<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.400> file<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.650> use<00:03:12.650> your<00:03:13.330> read

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
inside the file and use your read

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.760 
inside the file and use your read
settings<00:03:15.830> text<00:03:16.520> or<00:03:16.730> numeric<00:03:17.770> appropriately

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
settings text or numeric appropriately

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.410 
settings text or numeric appropriately
so<00:03:19.010> if<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.310> have<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> number<00:03:19.610> in<00:03:19.760> which<00:03:19.970> case<00:03:20.210> we

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
so if you have a number in which case we

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.880 
so if you have a number in which case we
do<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.750> number<00:03:20.900> we'd<00:03:21.380> want<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.620> go<00:03:21.680> into

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
do have a number we'd want to go into

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.920 
do have a number we'd want to go into
numeric<00:03:22.459> mode<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:23.330> could<00:03:23.540> also<00:03:23.660> have

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
numeric mode now you could also have

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.229 
numeric mode now you could also have
letters<00:03:24.770> and<00:03:25.010> then<00:03:25.430> you'd<00:03:25.760> want<00:03:25.820> to<00:03:26.000> go<00:03:26.120> into

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
letters and then you'd want to go into

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.650 
letters and then you'd want to go into
text<00:03:26.660> mode<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:31.100> other<00:03:31.220> mode<00:03:31.520> another<00:03:32.390> mode

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
text mode the other mode another mode

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.590 
text mode the other mode another mode
here<00:03:32.870> is<00:03:33.020> a<00:03:33.050> delete<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:34.459> what<00:03:34.760> this<00:03:34.880> does<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.420> it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
here is a delete so what this does is it

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.170 
here is a delete so what this does is it
deletes<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.260> file<00:03:36.709> whatever<00:03:37.520> file<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:37.940> can

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
deletes the file whatever file you can

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.680 
deletes the file whatever file you can
indicate<00:03:38.830> off<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.160> brick<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.850> your<00:03:41.239> specific

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
indicate off the brick in your specific

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.760 
indicate off the brick in your specific
project<00:03:42.200> that's<00:03:42.980> pretty<00:03:43.280> standard

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
project that's pretty standard

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.110 
project that's pretty standard
now<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.830> close<00:03:46.100> file<00:03:46.400> is<00:03:46.610> a<00:03:46.640> little<00:03:46.880> bit<00:03:47.000> more

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
now the close file is a little bit more

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.000 
now the close file is a little bit more
complicated<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:50.300> would<00:03:50.420> think<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:50.900> get<00:03:51.500> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
complicated you would think you get the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.630 
complicated you would think you get the
close<00:03:52.340> isn't<00:03:52.730> probably<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.510> great<00:03:53.870> name<00:03:54.080> for<00:03:54.110> it

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
close isn't probably a great name for it

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.080 
close isn't probably a great name for it
basically<00:03:55.640> what<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:55.970> does<00:03:56.000> is<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:57.970> redirects<00:03:58.970> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
basically what it does is it redirects a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.830 
basically what it does is it redirects a
pointer<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.230> top<00:04:00.470> of<00:04:00.680> your<00:04:00.860> your<00:04:01.640> file<00:04:02.030> so

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
pointer to the top of your your file so

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.870 
pointer to the top of your your file so
if<00:04:03.200> we<00:04:03.920> go<00:04:04.070> back<00:04:04.100> to<00:04:04.520> our<00:04:05.480> example<00:04:09.850> every<00:04:10.850> time

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
if we go back to our example every time

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.720 
if we go back to our example every time
you<00:04:11.180> read<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.540> file<00:04:12.220> when<00:04:13.220> you're<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.519> read

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
you read the file when you're in read

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.020 
you read the file when you're in read
mode<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.390> only<00:04:14.540> reads<00:04:14.810> one<00:04:15.050> line<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:16.190> if<00:04:16.580> you

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
mode it only reads one line so if you

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.699 
mode it only reads one line so if you
want<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.239> read<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.570> third<00:04:17.750> line<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:18.500> have<00:04:18.590> to

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
want to read the third line you have to

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.280 
want to read the third line you have to
execute<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.489> read<00:04:19.730> block<00:04:20.000> three<00:04:20.450> times<00:04:20.480> so

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
execute the read block three times so

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.430 
execute the read block three times so
that<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.530> can<00:04:21.680> get<00:04:21.799> down<00:04:22.010> here<00:04:22.340> now<00:04:23.380> say<00:04:24.380> you

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
that it can get down here now say you

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.870 
that it can get down here now say you
want<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.710> read<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.979> first<00:04:25.130> line<00:04:25.400> again<00:04:25.700> you

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
want to read the first line again you

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.990 
want to read the first line again you
have<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.419> use<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.720> closed<00:04:27.020> mode<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:28.000> redirect

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
have to use the closed mode to redirect

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.450 
have to use the closed mode to redirect
the<00:04:29.150> pointer<00:04:29.479> back<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.020> top

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
the pointer back to the top

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.360 
the pointer back to the top
so<00:04:31.840> if<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:32.990> have<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.140> whole<00:04:33.500> bunch<00:04:33.710> of<00:04:33.800> data<00:04:34.010> in

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
so if you have a whole bunch of data in

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.430 
so if you have a whole bunch of data in
it<00:04:34.580> your<00:04:34.820> only<00:04:35.000> each<00:04:35.540> read<00:04:35.870> block<00:04:36.080> is<00:04:36.260> going<00:04:36.380> to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
it your only each read block is going to

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.460 
it your only each read block is going to
only<00:04:36.890> export<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.720> specific<00:04:38.720> line<00:04:39.050> then<00:04:39.350> the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
only export the specific line then the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.140 
only export the specific line then the
second<00:04:39.770> line<00:04:39.860> then<00:04:40.100> third<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.610> fourth<00:04:40.940> and

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
second line then third the fourth and

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.940 
second line then third the fourth and
however<00:04:41.390> many<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:41.990> then<00:04:42.380> the<00:04:42.470> clothes<00:04:42.740> will

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
however many and then the clothes will

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.820 
however many and then the clothes will
reset<00:04:43.340> it<00:04:43.490> to<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.820> top<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.570> say<00:04:48.260> we're<00:04:48.560> going

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
reset it to the top so say we're going

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.580 
reset it to the top so say we're going
to<00:04:49.510> doing<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.930> program<00:04:51.740> here<00:04:52.070> and<00:04:53.050> we'll<00:04:54.050> read

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
to doing a program here and we'll read

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.210 
to doing a program here and we'll read
numeric<00:04:55.550> value<00:04:56.410> get<00:04:57.410> rid<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:58.160> then

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
numeric value get rid of that and then

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.660 
numeric value get rid of that and then
we'll<00:04:58.730> display<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.180> on<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.330> screen<00:05:03.430> so<00:05:04.430> if<00:05:04.460> we

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
we'll display it on the screen so if we

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.690 
we'll display it on the screen so if we
go<00:05:04.850> into<00:05:04.970> text<00:05:06.310> pixels<00:05:07.630> have<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> wired<00:05:08.990> input

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
go into text pixels have a wired input

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.990 
go into text pixels have a wired input
and<00:05:11.320> wire<00:05:12.320> it<00:05:12.500> up

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.060 

so<00:05:19.770> here<00:05:20.770> we<00:05:20.889> have<00:05:21.780> it<00:05:22.780> inputting<00:05:23.710> the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
so here we have it inputting the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.980 
so here we have it inputting the
information<00:05:24.100> and<00:05:24.910> putting<00:05:25.180> it<00:05:25.330> on<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.539> screen

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
information and putting it on the screen

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.760 
information and putting it on the screen
it'll<00:05:26.380> only<00:05:26.740> input<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.729> first<00:05:28.030> line<00:05:28.449> so<00:05:29.380> it

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
it'll only input the first line so it

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.860 
it'll only input the first line so it
only<00:05:29.919> input<00:05:30.430> one<00:05:30.610> two<00:05:30.789> three<00:05:31.090> if<00:05:31.330> you<00:05:31.690> have<00:05:31.840> a

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
only input one two three if you have a

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.150 
only input one two three if you have a
different<00:05:32.789> value<00:05:33.789> for<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:35.500> second<00:05:35.830> line<00:05:35.919> like

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
different value for the second line like

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.219 
different value for the second line like
four<00:05:36.400> five<00:05:36.550> six<00:05:36.910> then<00:05:37.240> then<00:05:37.840> you'd<00:05:38.020> have<00:05:38.169> to

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
four five six then then you'd have to

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.770 
four five six then then you'd have to
press<00:05:38.800> the<00:05:39.039> read<00:05:39.250> button<00:05:39.490> again<00:05:40.030> or<00:05:40.180> put<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:40.690> in

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
press the read button again or put it in

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.600 
press the read button again or put it in
a<00:05:40.870> loop<00:05:41.050> or<00:05:41.199> something<00:05:41.350> so<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.370> you'll<00:05:42.460> be

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
a loop or something so that you'll be

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.420 
a loop or something so that you'll be
able<00:05:42.699> to<00:05:42.940> see<00:05:43.120> it<00:05:43.210> again<00:05:44.100> so<00:05:45.100> that's<00:05:45.250> pretty

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
able to see it again so that's pretty

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.270 
able to see it again so that's pretty
much<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.789> for<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.530> for<00:05:47.530> this<00:05:47.680> block<00:05:47.979> it's

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
much it for the for this block it's

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.189 
much it for the for this block it's
really<00:05:48.699> interesting<00:05:49.509> some<00:05:49.990> of<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
really interesting some of the

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.439 
really interesting some of the
applications<00:05:51.099> that<00:05:51.250> you<00:05:51.370> can<00:05:51.400> have<00:05:51.699> with<00:05:52.270> this

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
applications that you can have with this

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.620 
applications that you can have with this
block<00:05:52.780> it<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.199> record<00:05:53.560> data<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:55.060> save<00:05:55.389> it<00:05:55.570> on

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
block it can record data and save it on

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.879 
block it can record data and save it on
your<00:05:55.690> file<00:05:56.020> or<00:05:56.289> use<00:05:56.860> data<00:05:57.220> that<00:05:57.400> you've<00:05:57.729> preset

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
your file or use data that you've preset

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:02.300 
your file or use data that you've preset
in<00:05:59.889> your<00:06:00.310> program<00:06:00.699> to<00:06:01.330> do<00:06:01.900> different<00:06:02.199> things

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
in your program to do different things

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.740 
in your program to do different things
perhaps<00:06:03.310> based<00:06:03.729> on<00:06:03.910> an<00:06:04.060> old<00:06:04.240> mission<00:06:04.479> or<00:06:04.720> a

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
perhaps based on an old mission or a

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.080 
perhaps based on an old mission or a
previous<00:06:05.470> run<00:06:05.800> of<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:05.979> mission<00:06:06.280> so<00:06:06.520> you<00:06:06.550> you

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
previous run of the mission so you you

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.510 
previous run of the mission so you you
run<00:06:07.300> a<00:06:07.330> mission<00:06:07.740> realize<00:06:08.740> that<00:06:09.009> it<00:06:09.190> didn't<00:06:09.430> go

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
run a mission realize that it didn't go

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.279 
run a mission realize that it didn't go
far<00:06:09.729> enough<00:06:09.789> and<00:06:10.240> somehow<00:06:10.389> it<00:06:10.599> automatically

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289 
far enough and somehow it automatically

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.930 
far enough and somehow it automatically
corrects<00:06:11.800> so<00:06:11.949> that<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.190> second<00:06:12.550> mission<00:06:12.699> that

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
corrects so that the second mission that

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.860 
corrects so that the second mission that
you<00:06:13.030> do<00:06:13.770> fixes<00:06:14.770> itself<00:06:15.160> really<00:06:16.120> crazy

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
you do fixes itself really crazy

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.439 
you do fixes itself really crazy
applications<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:17.860> have<00:06:18.639> some<00:06:18.849> fun<00:06:18.970> exploring

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
applications and have some fun exploring

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.900 
applications and have some fun exploring
with<00:06:19.599> this<00:06:19.720> one
