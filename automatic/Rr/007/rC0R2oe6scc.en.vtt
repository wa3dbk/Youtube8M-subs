00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
so one other thing I want to make clear

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.410 
so one other thing I want to make clear
the<00:00:06.049> the<00:00:07.049> taxiway<00:00:07.500> names<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.189> should<00:00:09.179> say<00:00:09.269> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
the the taxiway names I should say the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.870 
the the taxiway names I should say the
segment<00:00:09.809> names<00:00:09.990> are<00:00:10.290> always<00:00:11.250> pronounced

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
segment names are always pronounced

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.720 
segment names are always pronounced
phonetically<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.540> X<00:00:12.960> plane<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:14.009> if<00:00:14.490> for

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
phonetically in X plane so if for

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.560 
phonetically in X plane so if for
instance<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.150> wanted<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> put<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:17.000> taxiway<00:00:18.000> here

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
instance we wanted to put a taxiway here

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.250 
instance we wanted to put a taxiway here
called<00:00:19.410> Bravo<00:00:19.980> 3<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:21.359> would<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.600> type<00:00:21.779> B<00:00:21.960> 3

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
called Bravo 3 we would just type B 3

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.130 
called Bravo 3 we would just type B 3
and<00:00:22.500> then<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.000> click<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.720> here

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
and then you know click here and here

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.570 
and then you know click here and here
press<00:00:25.800> return<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> snaps<00:00:27.210> there

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
press return and and it snaps there

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.179 
press return and and it snaps there
so<00:00:29.580> there's<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:30.859> that's<00:00:31.859> how<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.040> would

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so there's your that's how you would

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.389 
so there's your that's how you would
name<00:00:32.340> taxiways<00:00:33.210> like<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.840> lot<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.559> lot

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
name taxiways like that a lot of a lot

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.560 
name taxiways like that a lot of a lot
of<00:00:35.430> airports<00:00:35.910> especially<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.420> large

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
of airports especially the large

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.950 
of airports especially the large
airports<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:38.030> numbers<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.329> taxiway

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
airports have numbers in the taxiway

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.510 
airports have numbers in the taxiway
name<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.440> just<00:00:40.800> type<00:00:41.010> them<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.460> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
name so you just type them in just the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.180 
name so you just type them in just the
way<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.940> them<00:00:42.379> so<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.770> other<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.070> we

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
way you see them so one other thing we

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.869 
way you see them so one other thing we
can<00:00:44.340> talk<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:45.200> is<00:00:46.200> turn<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.489> objects

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
can talk about is turn on some objects

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.150 
can talk about is turn on some objects
here<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> deal<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> terminal<00:00:49.829> areas

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
here how to deal with the terminal areas

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
here how to deal with the terminal areas
so<00:00:50.670> over<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
so over here we actually have the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
so over here we actually have the
terminal<00:00:53.539> right<00:00:54.539> now<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> problem<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:56.210> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
terminal right now the problem is you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.700 
terminal right now the problem is you
know<00:00:57.300> let's<00:00:57.510> say<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.809> aircraft<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.469> here

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
know let's say this aircraft right here

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.270 
know let's say this aircraft right here
the<00:00:58.859> 747<00:00:59.699> needed<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.090> taxi<00:01:00.539> 2<00:01:00.719> 3<00:01:00.899> 4<00:01:01.079> right

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the 747 needed a taxi 2 3 4 right

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
the 747 needed a taxi 2 3 4 right
the<00:01:02.520> AGC<00:01:02.850> system<00:01:03.000> would<00:01:03.300> pretty<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.539> draw<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the AGC system would pretty much draw a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.340 
the AGC system would pretty much draw a
line<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.290> where<00:01:04.470> he<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.799> now<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> nearest

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
line from where he is now to the nearest

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.130 
line from where he is now to the nearest
segment<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.760> he<00:01:08.760> would<00:01:08.909> jump<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> over<00:01:09.960> here

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
segment and he would jump on over here

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.690 
segment and he would jump on over here
somewhere<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> process<00:01:11.159> he's<00:01:11.520> going

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
somewhere but in the process he's going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.750 
somewhere but in the process he's going
to<00:01:11.760> turn<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.299> buildings<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> whatnot<00:01:13.920> so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
to turn through buildings and whatnot so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.030 
to turn through buildings and whatnot so
we<00:01:14.790> can<00:01:15.180> alleviate<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.890> right

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
we can alleviate this a little bit right

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.179 
we can alleviate this a little bit right
now<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.780> do<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.080> by<00:01:19.290> bringing<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
now and we can do that by bringing the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.960 
now and we can do that by bringing the
taxiway<00:01:20.990> into<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.920> terminal<00:01:23.310> area<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.820> maybe

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
taxiway into the terminal area so maybe

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
taxiway into the terminal area so maybe
we<00:01:24.150> want<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.420> bring<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:27.560> let's<00:01:28.560> beam<00:01:28.799> or

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
we want to bring it let's beam or

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:39.470 
we want to bring it let's beam or
something<00:01:29.310> like

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.900 

something<00:01:40.480> like<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.660> basically<00:01:41.580> and<00:01:42.580> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
something like that basically and the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.770 
something like that basically and the
reason<00:01:43.180> this<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.870> okay<00:01:44.230> is<00:01:45.600> no<00:01:46.600> matter

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
reason this this is okay is no matter

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.170 
reason this this is okay is no matter
where<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.140> aircraft<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.860> there's<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.520> taxi

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
where the aircraft is there's a taxi

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.970 
where the aircraft is there's a taxi
segment<00:01:49.570> right<00:01:50.170> near<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:50.800> doesn't

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
segment right near it that doesn't

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.740 
segment right near it that doesn't
require<00:01:51.280> them<00:01:51.580> to<00:01:51.610> taxi<00:01:52.150> through<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.360> building

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
require them to taxi through a building

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.540 
require them to taxi through a building
to<00:01:52.900> get<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:53.920> would<00:01:54.040> obviously<00:01:54.190> want<00:01:54.490> to

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
to get to so you would obviously want to

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.070 
to get to so you would obviously want to
continue<00:01:54.910> this<00:01:55.090> on<00:01:55.300> their<00:01:55.570> around<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:55.990> other

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
continue this on their around the other

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.350 
continue this on their around the other
side<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.530> terminals<00:01:57.090> now<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.150> other

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
side of the terminals now the other

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.740 
side of the terminals now the other
thing<00:01:58.540> these<00:01:58.750> are<00:01:58.840> not<00:01:58.990> real<00:01:59.290> taxiways<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
thing these are not real taxiways so

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.400 
thing these are not real taxiways so
they<00:02:02.680> really<00:02:03.100> should<00:02:03.250> not<00:02:03.340> have<00:02:03.430> any<00:02:03.640> name<00:02:04.410> now

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
they really should not have any name now

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.260 
they really should not have any name now
I've<00:02:05.590> given<00:02:05.800> them<00:02:06.070> names<00:02:06.280> just<00:02:06.940> because<00:02:07.030> I

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
I've given them names just because I

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.710 
I've given them names just because I
didn't<00:02:07.570> update<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:09.119> toolbar<00:02:10.119> at<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.270> top<00:02:10.360> so

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
didn't update the toolbar at the top so

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.820 
didn't update the toolbar at the top so
we<00:02:10.840> can<00:02:10.869> select<00:02:11.320> all<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.500> these<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:15.360> then

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
we can select all of these and then

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.900 
we can select all of these and then
delete<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.950> name<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.430> then<00:02:18.580> hold<00:02:18.760> down

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
delete the name and then hold down

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.210 
delete the name and then hold down
option<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.360> press<00:02:19.810> return<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.230> now<00:02:20.530> none<00:02:21.190> of

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
option and press return and now none of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.500 
option and press return and now none of
these<00:02:21.370> have<00:02:21.550> any<00:02:21.700> names<00:02:21.910> so<00:02:22.150> what<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.450> means

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
these have any names so what this means

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.560 
these have any names so what this means
now<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.200> if<00:02:23.800> we<00:02:23.980> take<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.370> 747<00:02:25.240> here<00:02:25.390> for

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
now is if we take this 747 here for

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.180 
now is if we take this 747 here for
example<00:02:25.780> if<00:02:26.050> he<00:02:26.170> needed<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.530> taxi<00:02:26.920> two<00:02:27.010> three

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
example if he needed to taxi two three

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.890 
example if he needed to taxi two three
four<00:02:27.340> right<00:02:27.520> he<00:02:28.240> would<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.390> given<00:02:28.750> this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
four right he would be given this

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.570 
four right he would be given this
segment<00:02:29.350> but<00:02:29.740> there's<00:02:29.980> no<00:02:30.100> name<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.460> that

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
segment but there's no name on that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.310 
segment but there's no name on that
segment<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.270> taxi<00:02:31.600> clearance<00:02:31.750> would<00:02:32.110> say

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
segment so the taxi clearance would say

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.590 
segment so the taxi clearance would say
taxi<00:02:33.160> three<00:02:33.340> four<00:02:33.520> right<00:02:33.700> via<00:02:34.030> Bravo<00:02:34.420> because

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
taxi three four right via Bravo because

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.500 
taxi three four right via Bravo because
this<00:02:35.320> segment<00:02:35.680> has<00:02:35.770> no<00:02:35.980> name<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:37.120> segment

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
this segment has no name this segment

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.150 
this segment has no name this segment
has<00:02:37.600> no<00:02:37.810> name<00:02:37.990> this<00:02:38.410> segment<00:02:38.740> has<00:02:38.800> no<00:02:38.980> name

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
has no name this segment has no name

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.370 
has no name this segment has no name
this<00:02:39.940> one<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:40.270> no<00:02:40.390> name<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.080> one<00:02:41.260> is

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
this one has no name and this one is

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.490 
this one has no name and this one is
called<00:02:41.530> Bravo<00:02:41.950> so<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:43.000> gonna<00:02:43.120> be<00:02:43.330> nameless<00:02:44.050> -

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
called Bravo so it's gonna be nameless -

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.080 
called Bravo so it's gonna be nameless -
Bravo<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.070> it<00:02:45.190> won't<00:02:45.370> pronounce<00:02:45.640> anything

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
Bravo so it won't pronounce anything

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.240 
Bravo so it won't pronounce anything
except<00:02:47.020> Bravo<00:02:47.230> which<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.650> which<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:48.010> what<00:02:48.130> we

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
except Bravo which is which is what we

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.140 
except Bravo which is which is what we
want<00:02:48.430> cuz<00:02:48.580> they're<00:02:48.730> not<00:02:48.760> real<00:02:48.970> taxiways<00:02:51.150> okay

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
want cuz they're not real taxiways okay

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.120 
want cuz they're not real taxiways okay
so<00:02:52.209> let's<00:02:52.480> say<00:02:52.630> at<00:02:52.750> this<00:02:52.900> point<00:02:53.170> you've<00:02:53.410> you

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
so let's say at this point you've you

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.440 
so let's say at this point you've you
think<00:02:54.340> you've<00:02:54.430> finished<00:02:54.760> your<00:02:54.850> layout<00:02:55.209> and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
think you've finished your layout and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.510 
think you've finished your layout and
you're<00:02:55.570> ready<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.840> export<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.650> app<00:02:56.980> dot<00:02:57.280> dot

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
you're ready to export your app dot dot

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.600 
you're ready to export your app dot dot
file<00:02:58.050> for<00:02:59.050> X<00:02:59.170> plane<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.560> use<00:02:59.709> there's<00:03:00.250> there's

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
file for X plane to use there's there's

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.460 
file for X plane to use there's there's
one<00:03:00.790> final<00:03:01.030> set<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.510> steps<00:03:01.750> that<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.050> should

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
one final set of steps that you should

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.650 
one final set of steps that you should
definitely<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.400> before<00:03:03.820> exporting<00:03:04.209> anything

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
definitely do before exporting anything

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.630 
definitely do before exporting anything
and<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.650> should<00:03:05.830> come<00:03:05.980> up<00:03:06.070> here<00:03:06.400> to

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and that's you should come up here to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.670 
and that's you should come up here to
the<00:03:06.790> select<00:03:07.239> menu<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.750> there's<00:03:08.500> three

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
the select menu and there's three

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.140 
the select menu and there's three
commands<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.130> should<00:03:09.280> run<00:03:09.459> which<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:09.700> select

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
commands you should run which is select

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.060 
commands you should run which is select
zero-length<00:03:10.510> edges<00:03:10.989> select<00:03:11.560> double<00:03:11.860> nodes

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
zero-length edges select double nodes

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.100 
zero-length edges select double nodes
and<00:03:12.400> select<00:03:12.670> crossing<00:03:13.090> edges<00:03:13.239> so<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:13.900> we<00:03:13.989> do

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
and select crossing edges so if we do

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.780 
and select crossing edges so if we do
that<00:03:14.260> now<00:03:14.530> what<00:03:14.890> we're<00:03:15.040> looking<00:03:15.160> for<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.640> down

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that now what we're looking for is down

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.910 
that now what we're looking for is down
here<00:03:16.150> in<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.330> selection<00:03:16.600> box<00:03:16.900> we're<00:03:17.680> looking

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
here in the selection box we're looking

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.990 
here in the selection box we're looking
for<00:03:18.040> nothing<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.400> show<00:03:18.550> up<00:03:18.670> because<00:03:18.850> these

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
for nothing to show up because these

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.180 
for nothing to show up because these
these<00:03:19.600> three<00:03:19.840> commands<00:03:20.320> are<00:03:20.530> bad<00:03:20.739> when<00:03:21.010> they

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
these three commands are bad when they

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.180 
these three commands are bad when they
find<00:03:21.400> something<00:03:21.670> they're<00:03:22.180> looking<00:03:22.540> for<00:03:23.190> some

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
find something they're looking for some

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.600 
find something they're looking for some
mistakes<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:24.850> your<00:03:24.880> layout<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:26.520> what<00:03:27.520> does

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
mistakes in your layout so what does

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.660 
mistakes in your layout so what does
zero-length<00:03:28.000> edges<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:29.680> if<00:03:30.190> you<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:30.400> two

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
zero-length edges is if you have two

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.100 
zero-length edges is if you have two
nodes<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:31.090> are<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.600> are<00:03:31.690> co-located

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
nodes that are that are co-located

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.780 
nodes that are that are co-located
meaning<00:03:32.709> they're<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.010> top<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.430> one<00:03:33.550> another

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
meaning they're on top of one another

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.680 
meaning they're on top of one another
but<00:03:34.750> yet<00:03:34.930> they're<00:03:35.110> connected<00:03:35.530> by<00:03:35.650> an<00:03:35.769> edge

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
but yet they're connected by an edge

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.140 
but yet they're connected by an edge
that's<00:03:37.690> bad<00:03:37.959> for<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.350> ATC<00:03:38.739> system<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.430> we're

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
that's bad for the ATC system so we're

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.420 
that's bad for the ATC system so we're
gonna<00:03:40.239> click<00:03:40.989> on<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.380> see<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.280> we

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
gonna click on that and see that that we

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.759 
gonna click on that and see that that we
don't<00:03:42.550> have<00:03:42.760> any<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.030> these<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:44.140> next<00:03:44.380> one<00:03:44.530> is

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
don't have any of these the next one is

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.590 
don't have any of these the next one is
selecting<00:03:45.610> double<00:03:45.850> nodes<00:03:46.030> which<00:03:46.240> is<00:03:46.390> very

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
selecting double nodes which is very

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.070 
selecting double nodes which is very
similar<00:03:46.900> it's<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.470> having<00:03:47.830> no

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
similar it's it's having no

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.260 
similar it's it's having no
you<00:03:48.500> know<00:03:48.620> one<00:03:48.800> on<00:03:48.830> top<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.310> other<00:03:49.460> but

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
you know one on top of the other but

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.730 
you know one on top of the other but
these<00:03:50.540> are<00:03:50.660> nodes<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:50.990> are<00:03:51.050> not<00:03:51.140> necessarily

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
these are nodes that are not necessarily

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.000 
these are nodes that are not necessarily
connected<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.430> each<00:03:52.580> other<00:03:52.810> by<00:03:53.810> an<00:03:54.440> edge<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
connected to each other by an edge and

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.270 
connected to each other by an edge and
again<00:03:55.870> we<00:03:56.870> have<00:03:57.020> no<00:03:57.170> double<00:03:57.470> nodes<00:03:57.650> here<00:03:57.890> now

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
again we have no double nodes here now

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.950 
again we have no double nodes here now
if<00:03:58.490> you<00:03:58.610> do<00:03:58.820> have<00:03:59.030> zero<00:03:59.300> length<00:03:59.450> edges<00:03:59.840> or

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
if you do have zero length edges or

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.050 
if you do have zero length edges or
double<00:04:00.260> nodes<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:00.650> X<00:04:00.860> plane

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
double nodes in X plane

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.170 
double nodes in X plane
it<00:04:02.690> will<00:04:03.050> if<00:04:03.710> they're<00:04:04.250> used<00:04:04.490> in<00:04:04.640> any<00:04:04.760> taxi

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
it will if they're used in any taxi

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.470 
it will if they're used in any taxi
clearances<00:04:05.660> it<00:04:05.810> will<00:04:05.960> trigger<00:04:06.230> a<00:04:07.000> an<00:04:08.000> assert

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
clearances it will trigger a an assert

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.990 
clearances it will trigger a an assert
in<00:04:08.690> X<00:04:08.960> plane<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.500> will<00:04:09.740> pop<00:04:10.160> up<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.430> dialog<00:04:10.790> box

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
in X plane that will pop up a dialog box

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.370 
in X plane that will pop up a dialog box
and<00:04:11.180> pretty<00:04:11.360> much<00:04:11.480> terminate<00:04:11.960> that<00:04:12.200> your

and pretty much terminate that your

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.120 
and pretty much terminate that your
session<00:04:13.930> so<00:04:14.930> we<00:04:15.500> definitely<00:04:15.650> want<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.010> make

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
session so we definitely want to make

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.920 
session so we definitely want to make
sure<00:04:16.160> you<00:04:16.370> check<00:04:16.580> before<00:04:16.790> exporting<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.660> the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
sure you check before exporting and the

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.690 
sure you check before exporting and the
last<00:04:18.049> one<00:04:18.290> is<00:04:18.410> crossing<00:04:18.650> edges<00:04:18.950> now<00:04:19.190> crossing

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
last one is crossing edges now crossing

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.610 
last one is crossing edges now crossing
edges<00:04:19.850> isn't<00:04:20.390> it's<00:04:20.870> not<00:04:21.049> a<00:04:21.080> dangerous<00:04:21.350> thing

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
edges isn't it's not a dangerous thing

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.140 
edges isn't it's not a dangerous thing
that's<00:04:21.830> gonna<00:04:21.920> cause<00:04:22.130> X<00:04:22.340> plane<00:04:22.520> to<00:04:22.610> crash<00:04:22.820> but

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
that's gonna cause X plane to crash but

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.510 
that's gonna cause X plane to crash but
it<00:04:23.180> does<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.900> does<00:04:24.170> likely<00:04:24.890> mean<00:04:25.130> that<00:04:25.370> you've

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
it does it does likely mean that you've

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.010 
it does it does likely mean that you've
done<00:04:25.700> something<00:04:26.000> that<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:26.360> probably<00:04:26.690> didn't

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
done something that you probably didn't

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.100 
done something that you probably didn't
mean<00:04:27.170> to<00:04:27.350> do<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:28.240> I'm<00:04:29.240> gonna<00:04:29.450> I'm<00:04:29.750> gonna<00:04:29.840> make

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
mean to do so I'm gonna I'm gonna make

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.070 
mean to do so I'm gonna I'm gonna make
some<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.410> these<00:04:31.600> artificially<00:04:32.600> just<00:04:32.810> to<00:04:32.900> show

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
some of these artificially just to show

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.020 
some of these artificially just to show
you<00:04:33.140> how<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:33.950> might<00:04:34.190> get<00:04:34.400> into<00:04:34.640> these<00:04:34.760> types

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
you how you might get into these types

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.150 
you how you might get into these types
of<00:04:35.150> situations<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:35.810> I'm<00:04:36.050> gonna<00:04:36.170> come<00:04:36.860> off<00:04:37.010> to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
of situations so I'm gonna come off to

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.500 
of situations so I'm gonna come off to
here<00:04:37.310> with<00:04:37.460> some<00:04:37.610> open<00:04:37.850> space<00:04:37.970> here<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.420> I'm

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
here with some open space here and I'm

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.570 
here with some open space here and I'm
gonna<00:04:38.630> click<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:38.960> create<00:04:39.200> an<00:04:39.440> edge<00:04:39.590> I'm<00:04:40.430> gonna

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
gonna click and create an edge I'm gonna

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.860 
gonna click and create an edge I'm gonna
click<00:04:40.790> over<00:04:41.030> here<00:04:41.210> and<00:04:41.300> create<00:04:41.420> another<00:04:41.690> edge

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
click over here and create another edge

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.310 
click over here and create another edge
so<00:04:42.620> now<00:04:42.740> let's<00:04:43.070> say<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.310> decide<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.300> move<00:04:44.480> this

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
so now let's say you decide to move this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.600 
so now let's say you decide to move this
and<00:04:45.620> you<00:04:45.680> go<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.830> know<00:04:46.070> this<00:04:46.220> should<00:04:46.370> really<00:04:46.490> be

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
and you go I know this should really be

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.430 
and you go I know this should really be
over<00:04:46.790> here<00:04:47.000> like<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:47.900> what<00:04:47.990> we<00:04:48.080> have<00:04:48.230> now

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
over here like this so what we have now

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.990 
over here like this so what we have now
is<00:04:48.590> we<00:04:48.680> have<00:04:48.800> two<00:04:49.010> edges<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.520> cross<00:04:49.700> one

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
is we have two edges that cross one

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.820 
is we have two edges that cross one
another<00:04:50.030> but<00:04:51.020> if<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.140> notice<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.560> middle

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
another but if you notice in the middle

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.200 
another but if you notice in the middle
there's<00:04:51.980> no<00:04:52.190> node<00:04:52.430> linking<00:04:52.910> them<00:04:53.060> together<00:04:53.240> so

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
there's no node linking them together so

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.420 
there's no node linking them together so
taxi<00:04:56.210> networks<00:04:56.510> in<00:04:56.660> in<00:04:56.990> in<00:04:57.380> world<00:04:57.950> editor<00:04:58.280> and

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
taxi networks in in in world editor and

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.280 
taxi networks in in in world editor and
x-plane<00:04:58.790> are<00:04:59.000> two-dimensional<00:04:59.450> they<00:04:59.930> need<00:05:00.140> to

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
x-plane are two-dimensional they need to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.310 
x-plane are two-dimensional they need to
be<00:05:00.410> two-dimensional<00:05:00.710> in<00:05:01.550> this<00:05:01.790> case<00:05:02.080> we<00:05:03.080> can't

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
be two-dimensional in this case we can't

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.780 
be two-dimensional in this case we can't
tell<00:05:03.500> if<00:05:03.620> one<00:05:03.770> overlaps<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.340> other<00:05:04.460> or<00:05:04.610> under

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
tell if one overlaps the other or under

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.940 
tell if one overlaps the other or under
laps<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.150> other<00:05:05.300> there's<00:05:05.570> there's<00:05:05.840> no<00:05:05.990> set

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
laps the other there's there's no set

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.280

this side of the edge to this side

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.210 
this side of the edge to this side
there's<00:05:11.630> no<00:05:11.810> intersection<00:05:12.620> to<00:05:12.740> cross<00:05:12.980> you

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
there's no intersection to cross you

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.159 
there's no intersection to cross you
need<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.610> need<00:05:13.730> to<00:05:13.790> go<00:05:14.030> from<00:05:14.600> one<00:05:14.780> edge<00:05:14.930> to

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
need it you need to go from one edge to

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.230 
need it you need to go from one edge to
another<00:05:15.290> by<00:05:15.740> crossing<00:05:16.070> through<00:05:16.640> a<00:05:16.669> node<00:05:17.030> there

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
another by crossing through a node there

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.150 
another by crossing through a node there
always<00:05:17.360> has<00:05:17.630> to<00:05:17.660> be<00:05:17.810> a<00:05:17.900> node<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.710> if<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:18.950> needed

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
always has to be a node so if you needed

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.820 
always has to be a node so if you needed
to<00:05:19.310> get<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:20.780> side<00:05:21.020> of<00:05:21.200> the<00:05:21.290> airport<00:05:21.560> and

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
to get on this side of the airport and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.400 
to get on this side of the airport and
you<00:05:22.130> were<00:05:22.220> over<00:05:22.460> on<00:05:22.580> this<00:05:22.760> side<00:05:23.290> there's<00:05:24.290> no

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
you were over on this side there's no

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.280 
you were over on this side there's no
way<00:05:24.530> of<00:05:24.650> doing<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:24.980> without<00:05:25.100> this<00:05:25.400> node<00:05:25.990> so<00:05:26.990> if

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
way of doing it without this node so if

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.659 
way of doing it without this node so if
we<00:05:27.440> say<00:05:28.330> select<00:05:29.330> crossing<00:05:29.840> edges<00:05:30.460> you'll<00:05:31.460> see

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
we say select crossing edges you'll see

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.640 
we say select crossing edges you'll see
that<00:05:31.850> it<00:05:31.970> selects<00:05:32.870> out<00:05:32.990> of<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.169> whole<00:05:33.290> airport

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
that it selects out of the whole airport

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.200 
that it selects out of the whole airport
it<00:05:33.770> only<00:05:33.890> selects<00:05:34.280> these<00:05:34.460> two<00:05:34.700> because<00:05:35.060> these

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
it only selects these two because these

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.030 
it only selects these two because these
two<00:05:35.510> are<00:05:35.540> crossing<00:05:36.080> edges<00:05:36.229> so<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.680> is<00:05:36.800> a<00:05:36.830> bad

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.040 
two are crossing edges so this is a bad

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.420 
two are crossing edges so this is a bad
thing

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
thing

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700 
thing
now<00:05:38.000> crossing<00:05:38.630> edge<00:05:38.750> is<00:05:38.900> unfortunately<00:05:39.470> is<00:05:39.680> a

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
now crossing edge is unfortunately is a

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.190 
now crossing edge is unfortunately is a
little<00:05:39.860> tricky<00:05:40.580> to<00:05:40.760> solve<00:05:41.600> because<00:05:41.990> it's<00:05:42.140> a

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
little tricky to solve because it's a

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.260 
little tricky to solve because it's a
Multi<00:05:42.500> multi<00:05:43.100> step<00:05:43.310> process<00:05:43.370> so<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.060> first

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
Multi multi step process so the first

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.760 
Multi multi step process so the first
thing<00:05:44.419> you<00:05:44.510> need<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:44.690> do<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:45.530> need<00:05:45.620> to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
thing you need to do is you need to

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.540 
thing you need to do is you need to
split<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:47.510> as<00:05:47.870> we<00:05:48.020> said<00:05:48.200> earlier<00:05:48.229> split<00:05:49.040> is<00:05:49.250> an

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
split and as we said earlier split is an

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.090 
split and as we said earlier split is an
option<00:05:50.270> click<00:05:50.540> on<00:05:50.570> an<00:05:51.440> edge<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.830> you'll<00:05:51.919> see

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
option click on an edge and you'll see

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.740 
option click on an edge and you'll see
that<00:05:52.190> it<00:05:52.340> split<00:05:52.610> it<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:52.850> joined<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.270> with<00:05:53.300> with

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
that it split it and joined it with with

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.010 
that it split it and joined it with with
a<00:05:53.780> node

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
a node

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.040 
a node
so<00:05:56.020> we<00:05:56.169> need<00:05:56.319> to<00:05:56.440> split<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:57.569> split<00:05:58.569> each<00:05:58.750> edge

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
so we need to split it split each edge

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.320 
so we need to split it split each edge
so<00:05:59.259> now<00:05:59.380> we<00:05:59.440> have<00:05:59.710> splits<00:06:00.430> we<00:06:00.669> have<00:06:00.789> nodes<00:06:01.060> for

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
so now we have splits we have nodes for

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.779 
so now we have splits we have nodes for
each<00:06:01.449> and<00:06:01.780> now<00:06:02.380> what<00:06:02.560> we<00:06:02.650> need<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:02.919> do<00:06:03.039> is<00:06:03.340> move

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
each and now what we need to do is move

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:06.719 
each and now what we need to do is move
one<00:06:03.970> of<00:06:04.000> these<00:06:04.150> nodes<00:06:04.860> closer<00:06:05.860> here<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.610> then

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
one of these nodes closer here and then

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.270 
one of these nodes closer here and then
move<00:06:06.940> this<00:06:07.120> one<00:06:07.300> closer<00:06:07.569> here<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.199> join<00:06:09.039> them

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
move this one closer here and join them

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.020 
move this one closer here and join them
so<00:06:10.270> now<00:06:10.419> what<00:06:10.690> we<00:06:10.780> have<00:06:10.810> is<00:06:10.990> is<00:06:11.410> they<00:06:11.949> joined<00:06:15.030> it

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
so now what we have is is they joined it

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.379 
so now what we have is is they joined it
appears<00:06:16.360> to<00:06:16.509> be<00:06:16.599> joined<00:06:16.840> anyway<00:06:17.669> so<00:06:18.669> this<00:06:19.210> is

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
appears to be joined anyway so this is

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:21.320 
appears to be joined anyway so this is
problem<00:06:19.750> number<00:06:19.780> two<00:06:20.169> so<00:06:20.349> now<00:06:20.470> if<00:06:20.560> we<00:06:20.620> say

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
problem number two so now if we say

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.670 
problem number two so now if we say
select<00:06:22.330> crossing<00:06:22.750> edges<00:06:22.900> we<00:06:23.259> don't<00:06:23.470> have<00:06:23.590> the

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
select crossing edges we don't have the

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.050 
select crossing edges we don't have the
problem<00:06:24.009> anymore<00:06:24.039> so<00:06:24.460> we're<00:06:24.580> all<00:06:24.639> set

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
problem anymore so we're all set

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.450 
problem anymore so we're all set
but<00:06:25.569> now<00:06:25.690> if<00:06:25.780> you<00:06:25.840> say<00:06:26.110> select<00:06:26.919> double<00:06:27.250> nodes

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
but now if you say select double nodes

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.360 
but now if you say select double nodes
oh<00:06:27.960> what<00:06:28.960> happened<00:06:29.289> is<00:06:29.440> we<00:06:29.590> created<00:06:29.979> two<00:06:30.130> nodes

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
oh what happened is we created two nodes

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.040 
oh what happened is we created two nodes
and<00:06:30.699> then<00:06:30.820> we<00:06:30.940> put<00:06:31.360> them<00:06:31.449> on<00:06:31.570> top<00:06:31.810> of<00:06:31.930> one

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
and then we put them on top of one

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.999 
and then we put them on top of one
another<00:06:32.280> so<00:06:33.930> they're<00:06:34.930> co-located<00:06:35.560> which<00:06:35.860> is

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:36.009 
another so they're co-located which is

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:36.420 
another so they're co-located which is
bad

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
bad

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.040 
bad
so<00:06:36.699> you<00:06:36.789> can<00:06:36.940> see<00:06:37.090> it<00:06:37.210> selected<00:06:37.630> both<00:06:37.780> of<00:06:37.960> the

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
so you can see it selected both of the

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.409 
so you can see it selected both of the
nodes<00:06:38.259> now<00:06:38.530> the<00:06:39.009> right<00:06:39.220> way<00:06:39.400> to<00:06:39.460> join<00:06:40.240> these

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
nodes now the right way to join these

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.620 
nodes now the right way to join these
together<00:06:40.660> is<00:06:41.110> to<00:06:42.099> go<00:06:42.639> to<00:06:42.699> the<00:06:42.910> edit<00:06:43.210> menu<00:06:43.240> and

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
together is to go to the edit menu and

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.480 
together is to go to the edit menu and
then<00:06:43.960> say<00:06:44.199> merge<00:06:44.470> and<00:06:44.979> what<00:06:45.099> it's<00:06:45.220> going<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.370> do

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
then say merge and what it's going to do

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.330 
then say merge and what it's going to do
is<00:06:45.639> combine<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:46.120> two<00:06:46.240> nodes<00:06:46.449> into<00:06:46.750> one<00:06:47.340> merge

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
is combine the two nodes into one merge

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.820 
is combine the two nodes into one merge
the<00:06:48.490> properties<00:06:48.940> together<00:06:49.090> and<00:06:49.509> now<00:06:50.440> what<00:06:50.740> we

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
the properties together and now what we

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.189 
the properties together and now what we
have<00:06:50.880> if<00:06:51.880> I<00:06:52.000> select<00:06:52.360> this<00:06:52.479> as<00:06:52.690> you<00:06:52.780> can<00:06:52.810> see<00:06:52.960> we

00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 
have if I select this as you can see we

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:55.050 
have if I select this as you can see we
have<00:06:53.319> one<00:06:53.560> node<00:06:53.800> that<00:06:54.039> ties<00:06:54.310> all<00:06:54.520> these<00:06:54.699> edges

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
have one node that ties all these edges

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.330 
have one node that ties all these edges
together<00:06:55.500> which<00:06:56.500> is<00:06:56.650> what<00:06:56.770> we<00:06:56.919> want<00:06:57.099> so<00:06:57.280> you

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
together which is what we want so you

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.879 
together which is what we want so you
can<00:06:57.370> reposition<00:06:57.699> this<00:06:58.090> how<00:06:58.210> we<00:06:58.710> how<00:06:59.710> we'd<00:06:59.860> like

00:06:59.879 --> 00:06:59.889 
can reposition this how we how we'd like

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:02.700 
can reposition this how we how we'd like
it<00:07:00.159> to<00:07:00.190> be<00:07:01.020> something<00:07:02.020> like<00:07:02.139> that<00:07:02.169> and<00:07:02.560> we're

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710 
it to be something like that and we're

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.210 
it to be something like that and we're
all<00:07:02.800> set<00:07:03.180> now<00:07:04.199> zero<00:07:05.199> length<00:07:05.409> edges<00:07:05.830> I<00:07:05.949> can't

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
all set now zero length edges I can't

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.800 
all set now zero length edges I can't
off<00:07:06.370> the<00:07:06.520> top<00:07:06.699> my<00:07:06.849> head<00:07:06.880> think<00:07:07.270> of<00:07:07.389> any<00:07:07.599> way<00:07:07.780> of

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
off the top my head think of any way of

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.029 
off the top my head think of any way of
recreating<00:07:08.710> this<00:07:09.960> but<00:07:10.960> if<00:07:11.050> you<00:07:11.139> have<00:07:11.169> it<00:07:11.650> what

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 
recreating this but if you have it what

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:14.670 
recreating this but if you have it what
you'll<00:07:12.219> want<00:07:12.370> to<00:07:12.430> do<00:07:12.580> is<00:07:12.909> is<00:07:13.210> find<00:07:13.870> the<00:07:14.080> find

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
you'll want to do is is find the find

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.890 
you'll want to do is is find the find
the<00:07:14.770> node<00:07:14.979> and<00:07:15.310> delete<00:07:16.270> it<00:07:16.419> which<00:07:16.570> will<00:07:16.750> also

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
the node and delete it which will also

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.890 
the node and delete it which will also
delete<00:07:17.440> the<00:07:18.120> segment<00:07:19.120> that's<00:07:19.240> that's<00:07:19.599> joining

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
delete the segment that's that's joining

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.089 
delete the segment that's that's joining
the<00:07:20.110> two<00:07:20.229> nodes<00:07:20.409> because<00:07:20.620> again<00:07:20.860> there's

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.099 
the two nodes because again there's

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:22.920 
the two nodes because again there's
there's<00:07:21.729> just<00:07:22.240> two<00:07:22.479> nodes<00:07:22.690> that<00:07:22.840> are

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
there's just two nodes that are

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.540 
there's just two nodes that are
co-located<00:07:23.650> that<00:07:23.770> are<00:07:23.889> joined<00:07:24.070> together<00:07:24.219> by<00:07:24.430> a

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
co-located that are joined together by a

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.189 
co-located that are joined together by a
segment<00:07:25.000> if<00:07:25.120> you<00:07:25.240> pick<00:07:25.449> any<00:07:25.659> one<00:07:25.750> of<00:07:25.960> the<00:07:26.020> nodes

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 
segment if you pick any one of the nodes

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.600 
segment if you pick any one of the nodes
it<00:07:26.349> doesn't<00:07:26.590> matter<00:07:26.710> which<00:07:26.919> and<00:07:27.099> delete<00:07:27.340> it<00:07:27.460> it

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
it doesn't matter which and delete it it

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.459 
it doesn't matter which and delete it it
will<00:07:27.759> delete<00:07:27.969> the<00:07:28.120> segment<00:07:28.419> underneath<00:07:28.719> so

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.469 
will delete the segment underneath so

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:30.480 
will delete the segment underneath so
now<00:07:29.590> if<00:07:29.650> we<00:07:29.710> run<00:07:29.860> through<00:07:30.070> these<00:07:30.190> commands

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
now if we run through these commands

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.290 
now if we run through these commands
again<00:07:30.789> we<00:07:31.389> have<00:07:31.570> no<00:07:32.699> we<00:07:33.699> have<00:07:33.789> no<00:07:33.909> errors<00:07:34.270> in

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
again we have no we have no errors in

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.240 
again we have no we have no errors in
the<00:07:34.509> layout<00:07:34.630> and<00:07:34.870> now<00:07:34.960> we<00:07:35.020> can<00:07:35.229> do<00:07:35.380> an<00:07:35.740> export

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
the layout and now we can do an export

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.500 
the layout and now we can do an export
to<00:07:37.080> explain<00:07:38.080> to<00:07:38.199> use<00:07:38.320> it
