long enough to know what he wanted and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.510 
long enough to know what he wanted and
that<00:04:51.560> kind<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.860> bothered<00:04:52.220> me

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
that kind of bothered me

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.990 
that kind of bothered me
and<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.680> think<00:04:54.740> at<00:04:55.100> that<00:04:55.220> point<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.730> engine

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and and I think at that point the engine

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.230 
and and I think at that point the engine
shop<00:04:56.180> started<00:04:56.600> going<00:04:56.810> downhill

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.790 

with<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.390> but<00:05:02.510> if<00:05:02.600> you<00:05:02.690> think<00:05:02.750> spill<00:05:03.170> vibration

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
with it but if you think spill vibration

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.150 
with it but if you think spill vibration
come<00:05:03.920> on<00:05:04.070> have<00:05:04.580> to<00:05:04.760> come<00:05:04.970> in<00:05:05.980> this<00:05:06.980> come

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
come on have to come in this come

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.250 
come on have to come in this come
already<00:05:07.520> on<00:05:07.850> there<00:05:08.090> just<00:05:08.360> go<00:05:08.480> home<00:05:08.630> that'll<00:05:09.080> be

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
already on there just go home that'll be

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.620
