00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.960
 People are starting with themselves at the start 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.120
 The pizza reviews are finally here 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.759
 regularly follow videos where just pizza 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.100
 I may also prove it to you 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.410
 a general food series do so 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.310
 so ready meals you take out there 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.320
 can buy 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.760
 I would then just test max marck 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.260
 allround so design looks like that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.090
 how that smells et cetera 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.710
 In any case, I will be having a pizza 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.570
 start with one or the other 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.309
 maybe not so expected 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 because I do not like them at instagram 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.180
 have posted is in principle I think 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.460
 but never posted on transition but 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.260
 I thought I set my bar 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.539
 his head like the other pizzas was 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.899
 Power has to be concerned anyway 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.989
 The beginning will be with the original warning 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.879
 balance pizza so i can only say 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 the markus from the left are real 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.920
 really crass you even have a angle 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.620
 So good that would not matter now 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.430
 because I said but is even 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.200
 vegetarian so I value the markus 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 After that speaks in any case 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.650
 but I say I wanted to go directly 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 one with a new or with 10 at 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.880
 makes big of it 110 points 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.500
 I wanted to renew urgently or 19 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.150
 say start because I tell you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 this number does not towering markus 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 So I think there is no other 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.270
 pizza no matter which brand of which 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 Manufacturer that surpasses the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.560
 Mars he tastes and etc 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.140
 I'll deal with that in a moment 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.250
 could be curious as I said if 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.930
 you still in case you still 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 So you have any other ideas 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.070
 as of re in the category 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.860
 can not introduce so i have to 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 now only taste macro and allround 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.479
 That means giving food design 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.060
 the packaging is whether it appealing 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.740
 as the right 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.780
 and of course the taste most important 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580
 but if you still 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.650
 come up with criteria then do not let it 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.570
 otherwise want to know in the comments 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.520
 I wish you a lot of fun with the pizza view 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.830
 I am already hungry and treat myself 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.240
 First of all, here I am in truth 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.229
 actually still a work that will 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.070
 you do not see her 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.410
 they go so must be equal to 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.850
 Preheating the oven is always very important 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.520
 here again the pizza in full splendor 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:21.319
 not the nicest packaging but now 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.780
 hey that's not the main criterion like that 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.890
 The pizza then synonymous from maximum 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.890
 short at the start 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.640
 They are now coming in the oven at 200 30 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.640
 Degree 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.550
 wait for a while now on the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.790
 Packing takes ten to twelve minutes 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.530
 all right so special action series 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.840
 that he does not seem to be at 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.000
 pizza so other pizzas he go 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.430
 maybe high or so but the pizza 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.120
 when it is on baking relatively 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.120
 boring 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.480
 so the good piece looks now even 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.910
 out so the pizza looks fuller 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.180
 splendidly looks right appetizing 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.280
 from food design what was that 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.880
 optical is definitely on 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.850
 successful 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.210
 let's see if the taste is yes 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.010
 can hold with it 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.470
 yes and the end product looks like this then 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.940
 principle from really nice pizza can 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.560
 really nothing to say against looks real 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.570
 but I already have appetizing 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.820
 now said the most important 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.230
 probably the taste because it 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.120
 brings nothing if the pizza is great 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.660
 Looks like the pizza is super nutritious 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.880
 but it does not taste good 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.990
 I first a piece and then can 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.990
 I tell you more about it 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.200
 the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.780
 as it was not to be expected is 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.330
 the pizza is not the tastiest 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.980
 frozen pizza because the market 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.900
 more likely to do so well if 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.430
 of course grease and other saved 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.829
 yes, then the taste remains 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.570
 bit on the track how many points 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.580
 at the end of the closing of now 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.320
 I get that for the taste 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.340
 will you see it soon and there? 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.780
 Of course I will also be on the 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.340
 markus and on the third point 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:39.440
 Of course, then come in again 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:41.570
 be curious what I just forgot 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.070
 this pizza was about 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.650
 of course, this normal one 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.720
 Italian with this thin bottom 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.120
 Of course, there is one in the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.890
 oven fresh has one mixes between the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.570
 thick American penn beans and 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.740
 the thin Italian soil 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.570
 Here you have just the classic thin 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.790
 So what's my father's pizza 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:08.060
 So always go through times 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:10.640
 here we have 3 4 grams of fat at 102.7 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.320
 So 3.4 already extremely low I think 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.750
 the lowest value per 100 here 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.370
 have seen on the pizza now 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.300
 Then we have 27 grams of fiber 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.690
 which is also a very good value per 100 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.390
 and eight grams of protein per month 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.280
 I would say this pizza 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.630
 earned 9 at markus I give no 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.690
 ten it was maybe someday 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.610
 which is even better but is entered 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.440
 that's really what markus is concerned with 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.660
 the best pizza you can treat yourself 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.940
 can 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.660
 tastily as I said there are better 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.310
 things from the scale of 1 to 10 would 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.630
 I maybe a five or six 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.970
 Just give me my five 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.950
 Tastes okay so there are really delicious 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.530
 pizzas you can honestly say a 5's 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.990
 I think that's fine on everyone 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.120
 case justified and otherwise 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.560
 the rest I would now times 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.590
 want to sum up and we have 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.930
 first lactose free now for people who 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.120
 that's important for that, too 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.130
 maybe great we have thick bottom 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.720
 that is not a negative point now 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.080
 is 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.660
 the pizza actually eats vegetarians 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.580
 is not negative is already in the 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.150
 taste in there if one of the pizza 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.950
 if meat likes the rating is the 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.670
 of course, learn the taste 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:33.070
 a bit lower 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:34.150
 yes and this also pretty gray tip 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.340
 I smelled good 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.590
 the packaging is good that he does not matter at all 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.830
 they are now completely normal from nothing 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:46.120
 painting anything or anything else 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.920
 So if I'm the rest of the whole 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.510
 around it I would be an eight 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.950
 Eight or nine markus also give 95 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.070
 macros of taste are natural 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.950
 more important in my opinion everything in 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.940
 I would all the pc seven and a half 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.040
 I think give 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.410
 I think overall you can see that 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.540
 It's relatively good for me to ask you 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.620
 actually good as it said the 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.930
 markus have it at the real 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.340
 rausgerissen 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.990
 if a better pizza knows with 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.220
 better macros then let me like it 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.990
 always in the comments will not know 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.090
 more interesting as I said because of me 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.500
 know that with the lowest 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:26.410
 fat percentage and relatively high proportion 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.760
 it runs moderate protein so that was 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.590
 it already with the Peter reviews 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.120
 if you liked the video then 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.640
 it always gives the thumb up 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.560
 So if you have more reviews 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.240
 then want to see overheat as I said 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.470
 subscribe thumbs up 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.870
 so that I also know that the 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.430
 well , otherwise videos would arrive 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.300
 I still like you a day and extremely 

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.400
 of course a good hunger 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.570
 if you inspiring one or the other 

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.340
 could not get in better 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.840
 whistle yes see you next time 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.840
 video pilot
