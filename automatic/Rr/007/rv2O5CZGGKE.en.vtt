00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.590
 application there feels that I saw that I said to myself 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.730
 a romantic nod because where are they 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.069
 where are these carteis glued 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.690
 not glass of a bar then that is removed 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.299
 application but I do not know what you think of you 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.159
 to me the posters can never be missing 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.650
 but I think what everything to advance a 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.769
 topic because what I've said about sant 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.900
 the place advance the talent because 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.670
 destroy or that is already facebook the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 whenever there is a poster at the end what 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.670
 first is the poster of the application 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.410
 it's great from the same owner 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.060
 explanatory in a Galician moment there is 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.430
 say in printers and Galician men 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.280
 to put something seen are here 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.900
 giving tremendous tremendous success too 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.900
 nine hits the orchestras themselves 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.709
 given the preparation for another for another 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.810
 sector that we said that eclipsed that 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.430
 does this power offer services a 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.410
 musician so in bigger I think I 'm 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.970
 thinking to provide what you see you can 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.590
 get in there to see if it gets 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.140
 something later when this one the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.110
 orchestras because if we are thinking that 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.810
 everything that happened was better right now 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.550
 with those applications with your words 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.560
 reinvent myself I think the orchestras 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.019
 it even meant also knowing is 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:47.250
 looking at this application that was the 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:48.750
 competition is not a way to be in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.920
 I like that application like chegarán 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.950
 basket many times and gps 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.590
 because those people as well as where they are from 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.040
 this is how far is the owner 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.040
 taxes 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.400
 because although it had three times that 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.600
 it was the vermouth session or valència assault 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.330
 verbena 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.330
 is made in one cause or another 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.050
 the letters 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.050
 both metals 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.720
 it must be said that to panorama let's say that 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.370
 changed that trend a bit 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.110
 it was said that orchestras a cause of 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.630
 beautiful always said like that and there 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.490
 a lot of new people that you follow but 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.920
 I also exercise that you are for example 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:55.710
 tell me that these orchestras are not for 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.110
 dance but answer that afternoon 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.060

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.190

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.479
