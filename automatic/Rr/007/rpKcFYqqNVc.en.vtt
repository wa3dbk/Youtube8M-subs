00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.560
 i 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.260
 today I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.469
 make a delicious nutri pudding either 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.809
 with red fruits or with some other fruit 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.240
 that you like, we are going to use 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 obviously chia because with this we are going to 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.189
 make the pudding and we will stay 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.739
 delicious first of all I ask you 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.680
 take out your bottle of chia let's go 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.989
 also use almond milk or 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.600
 coconut milk as you prefer a 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.120
 little bit of honey to sweeten and here I 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 I have about a cup of fruits 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 reds are blackberry strawberries and among others 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.820
 but you can choose the ones 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.820
 want 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.470
 later I will take out some jars 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.110
 as these are mason jr one is 16 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.540
 ounces and the other is tiniest where 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.770
 I 'm going to be able to save me I fed pudding 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.790
 when I finish it 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.970
 in this container I'll put what 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.270
 are my red fruits and that's where I'm going 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.240
 to try to crush them and also in 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.420
 this transparent jar is where I'm going 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.820
 to put the Jew and this is where we are going to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.790
 do the mixture first I'm going to 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.570
 place about a quarter of 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.420
 Chia cup are approximately 4 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.880
 soup spoons and here I am 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.670
 serving for you to see how it 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.810
 is filling my measuring cup we are 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.810
 measuring it very well 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.640
 remember that chia when you are in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.520
 contact with some liquid is going to put 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.049
 chubby let's say that its size is going to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.970
 duplicate will triple 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.130
 that means he's saving all 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.920
 the humidity of this little seed we know very 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.170
 well that the chia is also one of the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.060
 let's say of the seeds right now 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.190
 we see that it is a super fort because it is 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.159
 Rich in protein has omega 3 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.290
 It has a lot of fiber so it's very 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.810
 very good option to use it as 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.080
 collation or as a dessert in a moment 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.080
 dice 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.240
 and in our bottle we will incorporate 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.720
 what would be the chia 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.120
 and the milk here I am serving I am going to 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.340
 put a little bit of almond milk and 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 also a little bit of coconut milk 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.150
 to make that mixture if you do not 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.580
 like this type of vegetable milks 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.730
 they can also use cow's milk 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.160
 but semi-skim or completely 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.170
 skim any of the two 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.640
 options is a very good idea but today 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.330
 Today there are many people who prefer not to 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.330
 use cow's milk for example 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:07.910
 now let's incorporate what would be 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.600
 our seeds and our dairy products to 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.600
 my container 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.240
 in this way I will place the seeds 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.210
 inside the mason jr or the jar 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.500
 and later I will incorporate 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.500
 everything that milk would be 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.090
 here we see how it would look 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.830
 and now let's put what would be a 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.540
 cup of milk as I remind you can 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.540
 be the type of milk that you most 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.750
 like it because this is a question now 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.989
 Yes, very personal, I suggest you 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.190
 they serve that was still a little 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.280
 thick you put a little bit more 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.340
 liquid or milk now we're going to 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.190
 Mix a little bit , we are going to cover it 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.220
 and we 're going to leave it at least two 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.170
 or three hours in the refrigerator too 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.820
 you can put it all night 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.220
 so that way 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.790
 these little seeds form this kind of 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.310
 gel and it is well formed our pudding what 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.850
 we cover very well and we go straight to 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.850
 rehash 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.300
 very well now we are going to have around here 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.550
 our red fruits what I want 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.940
 to do with them is a kind of puree 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.640
 I'm going to crush them a little bit and if still 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.340
 well I see that it is not enough then to what 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.860
 I can use a little knife for 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.010
 make them into very small pieces and I 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.440
 there is a kind of jam here what 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.570
 come and I did it with my fork comes out 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.580
 loose all your ulna in fact know 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.960
 delicious so nothing else until with a 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.360
 little bit of yogurt I think it would have 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.030
 exquisite if they feel that in their that their 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.090
 fruits are not very sweet you can 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.610
 adding a little honey for example is 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.690
 also bee or you can put a 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:12.080
 little bit of agave honey that also 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.360
 Now this is a lot of consumption and 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.360
 nothing else we are going to give him a little touch 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.460
 this is practically a teaspoon 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.889
 if your fruits are enough 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.650
 sweet because I think they can even 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.990
 avoid it just with the pure sweetness of 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.120
 our fruits is enough then 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.810
 this will also be to the taste of each 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.810
 one of you 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.030
 Well, it's been about three hours already 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.550
 I took out my chia seeds can see that 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.040
 Obviously they already stuck and got this 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.860
 consistency as a kind of pudding or of 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.560
 gel that is very similar to the tapioca if 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.250
 you realize and now what I'm going 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.700
 to do is going to be putting a layer of chia 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:00.449
 a layer of red fruits later 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.639
 again I will put another layer of chia 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.849
 how are we doing here 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.499
 and another capita of red fruits there are thousands 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.090
 in ways that we can do it 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.889
 we can forgive 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.199
 we can use apple we can 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.300
 use banana what I more 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.430
 I suggest you try not to go over 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.819
 a cup of fruit that in this case would be 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:25.180
 of red fruits or half a banana 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.729
 it would be a serving of half banana fruit 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.909
 this any of this kind of fruit 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:34.029
 they would be delicious as I commented 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:37.090
 You can also add a little bit of 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:39.009
 honey or a little bit of agave honey 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.740
 at a given moment until a little bit of 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:44.379
 sugar but try not to abuse because 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.699
 what we want is to use sweeten 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.279
 of the fruits and make it something 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:51.419
 completely natural and super super 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.419
 super healthy 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.179
 well, that 's how our 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:00.399
 nutri red fruit pudding is 

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:02.919
 delicious and you can actually put a 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:05.199
 little bit of nuts on top or almonds in 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.349
 Any case would be even more 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.239
