so<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.350> problem<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.890> how<00:02:03.040> do<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.220> deal

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
so the the problem is how do we deal

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.020 
so the the problem is how do we deal

that's<00:02:37.270> what<00:02:37.450> we<00:02:37.600> think<00:02:37.750> Express<00:02:38.170> Lanes<00:02:38.440> do

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709

onto those lanes so that you can get the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.660

will free up congestion in the other

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.990 
will free up congestion in the other
lanes<00:06:50.050> if<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:51.100> lane<00:06:51.250> is<00:06:51.400> be<00:06:51.550> going<00:06:51.760> to<00:06:51.910> be

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
lanes if the lane is be going to be
