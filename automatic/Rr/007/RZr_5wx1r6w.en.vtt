you all are awesome I have a few videos
coming<00:02:59.590> up<00:02:59.650> about<00:02:59.920> my<00:03:00.130> flat<00:03:00.459> ironing

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
coming up about my flat ironing

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.000 
coming up about my flat ironing
experience<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.020> chop<00:03:02.230> it<00:03:02.260> up<00:03:02.500> because

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
experience going to chop it up because

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.160 
experience going to chop it up because
it's<00:03:03.190> 22<00:03:03.760> minutes<00:03:04.090> long<00:03:04.270> which<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.540> too<00:03:04.959> long

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it's 22 minutes long which is too long

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.900 
it's 22 minutes long which is too long
so<00:03:05.770> i<00:03:05.800> think<00:03:05.950> i'm<00:03:06.100> going<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.280> chop<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.520> up<00:03:06.760> into

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
so i think i'm going to chop it up into

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.020 
so i think i'm going to chop it up into
three<00:03:07.510> or<00:03:07.690> four<00:03:07.900> pieces<00:03:08.170> so<00:03:08.620> that's<00:03:08.980> easier<00:03:09.790> to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
three or four pieces so that's easier to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.750 
three or four pieces so that's easier to
watch<00:03:10.330> easier<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.959> view<00:03:11.020> and<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.700> should

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
watch easier to view and so you should

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.720
