00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 how do you determine the turning point 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.579
 now 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.689

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 these are 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.850
 the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.850
 by 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.590
 the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.380
 the 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.880
 fire 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 the fire 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.190
 you have 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.440
 fire 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 the burning shed too long 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.580
 a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.580
 I mean you 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.910

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 haha 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.089
 4 th 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.779
 the players home 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.569
 eyi can 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 nintendo has 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.679
 is harder with that 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:58.449
 and why 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:00.879
 the province properly 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.279
 soon be able to show how that is possible 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.279
 I live at work 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.239
 meant 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.239
 the plans 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.529
 I don't think it's difficult 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.439
 quit smoking 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.489
 will do well to the overview 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.489
 you can do 2 of everything 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.989
 not 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.099
 it is the strongest points 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.179
 the kitchen 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.179
 furthermore ensures that you register smeets 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.809
 that is not the first this is the future 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.559
 beg simon 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.559
 also around the star and certainly supports 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.300
 something does not beg 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.159
 nice 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.159
 so do not want to see how good or how come 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.600
 4 many options
