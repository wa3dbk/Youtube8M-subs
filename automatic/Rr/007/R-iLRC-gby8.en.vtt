baron zero xeriscaping so what exactly
they're<00:00:27.449> escaping<00:00:27.720> basically<00:00:28.590> they're

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
they're escaping basically they're

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320 
they're escaping basically they're
escaping<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.340> gardening<00:00:29.699> with<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> natural

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
escaping is gardening with the natural

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.460 
escaping is gardening with the natural
environment<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.080> live<00:00:31.289> in

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
environment that you live in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
environment that you live in
so<00:00:32.070> gardening<00:00:32.700> such<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.300> you're<00:00:33.450> just<00:00:33.600> using

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
so gardening such that you're just using

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.080 
so gardening such that you're just using
the<00:00:34.050> natural<00:00:34.230> rainfall<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.460> there's<00:00:35.850> seven

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the natural rainfall and there's seven

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.760 
the natural rainfall and there's seven
principles<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.690> xeriscape<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.350> think

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
principles of xeriscape and I think

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.420 
principles of xeriscape and I think
they're<00:00:37.890> fabulous

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
they're fabulous

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
they're fabulous
I<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.600> best<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.200> a

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
I I think it's the best way to have a

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.990 
I I think it's the best way to have a
successful<00:00:40.440> garden<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.280> follow<00:00:41.579> these<00:00:41.760> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
successful garden if you follow these so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.420 
successful garden if you follow these so
their<00:00:42.149> planning<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.629> design<00:00:43.250> practical<00:00:44.250> turf

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
their planning and design practical turf

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.819 
their planning and design practical turf
areas<00:00:44.940> soil<00:00:45.510> preparation<00:00:45.960> efficient

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
areas soil preparation efficient

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.340 
areas soil preparation efficient
irrigation<00:00:47.539> appropriate<00:00:48.539> plant<00:00:48.780> selection

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
irrigation appropriate plant selection

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
irrigation appropriate plant selection
which<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> fun<00:00:50.010> part<00:00:50.809> mulching<00:00:51.840> and

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
which is the fun part mulching and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.410 
which is the fun part mulching and
timely<00:00:53.010> maintenance<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.149> what<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.390> some

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
timely maintenance and so what are some

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
timely maintenance and so what are some
of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> biggest<00:00:54.899> misconceptions<00:00:55.620> well<00:00:56.460> like

of the biggest misconceptions well like
you<00:00:56.940> said<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> beginning<00:00:57.480> zero<00:00:58.140> scape

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you said at the beginning zero scape

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040

people<00:00:58.920> call<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> zero<00:00:59.489> scape<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
people call it zero scape and it's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.740 
people call it zero scape and it's
actually<00:01:01.440> xeriscape<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.670> X<00:01:02.820> Eri<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.449> the

and cities are more and more going to be

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
and cities are more and more going to be
putting<00:01:42.689> restrictions<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.530> using<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.100> on
