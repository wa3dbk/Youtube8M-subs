00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.700
 today will not succeed the 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.850
 best but the fastest one that adapts to 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.300
 the changes the photographer is destined 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.490
 to disappear the video will win 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.100
 just look at the technological advances 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.039
 current create a pattern and project it 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.260
 towards the future for photography as 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.810
 technique is the chronicle of a death 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.000
 announced 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.150
 the pixel is the unit of measurement more 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.520
 small that exists in the digital image 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.370
 basically it is a point of a color the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 sum of points or pixels create a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.280
 image and the amount of them establish 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 the resolution if we distribute the points 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.160
 in the form of a grid 640 points 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.770
 horizontals by 480 vertical points 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.980
 result in a composite image 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.740
 by 307 thousand 200 pixels 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.900
 for reasons of practicality for the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.520
 development of supports were chosen 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.680
 some combinations as standards 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.630
 with names to identify them 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:21.040
 quickly the aforementioned was old age to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.759
 720 x 480 or 720 x 576 are the standard 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:29.980
 television classics thousand 280 x 720 is 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:33.040
 hd 1920 x 1080 is full hd 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.710
 if we multiply the thousand 920 pixels 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.560
 horizontal by the 1080 pixels 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.990
 verticals of the full hd standard 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.550
 we obtain as a result 2 million 73 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.550
 thousand 600 pixels mega million 2 million 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.860
 of pixels 2 megapixels line and with 3 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.650
 x the most expensive model in cameras 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.970
 professional photographic of this brand 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:00.790
 produces 24.5 megapixel images are 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.930
 photographs with a resolution of 6 thousand 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.640
 48 by 4 thousand 32 pixels the model is 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.310
 able to shoot five photos by 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.370
 second in mode and by continuous or bursts 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.740
 up to an approximate limit of 130 photos 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.380
 before filling your buffer 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.620
 now on video in addition to what 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.030
 previous a new parameter is added 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.270
 taking into account that the video is not 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.040
 more than a batch of photographs that 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.650
 reproduced at a certain speed one after 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.950
 another create the feeling of movement in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.110
 the eye and the human brain the speed 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.620
 per second in which those 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.150
 images is called fps or frames per se 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.940
 with 16 fps and it's enough to create the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.860
 feeling of movement however the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.230
 human brain has evolved along the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.900
 video and it's becoming more and more proficient to read 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.450
 each image to the point of seeing speeds 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.910
 up to 50 or 60 frames per second 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.160
 network dragon is a video camera 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.560
 for professional use 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.099
 the model captures according to the standard of 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:12.019
 dry resolution that means that each 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:15.980
 frame has 6,144 by three thousand 160 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.510
 pixels or 19 total megapixels 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.819
 you want to know how many frames per 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.299
 second uses 100 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.810
 yes it is to say that this model is capable of 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.389
 capture 100 images per second of 19 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.819
 megapixels each one is true that the 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.709
 price difference is abysmal and I am 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.139
 aware that I am comparing a 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.579
 of the highest video ranges with the 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:44.750
 highest photo management h5 of 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.819
 for example capture at 50 megapixels 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.430
 but if we think about supports the 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.620
 hegemony of the screens the role 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.099
 it is practically only used for 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.840
 advertising world and 19 megapixels is 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.060
 much more than is necessary for 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.269
 current home screens even 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.579
 for any current paper support 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.069
 also knowing the speed of 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.439
 technological advance is not going to happen much 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.260
 time for the video system of 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:16.829
 seika are available to everyone at the end and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:22.680
 out the new samsung s 6 signature 4cast 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:25.260
 bone 4096 by 3.112 pixels that although 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.990
 are likely to be questioned 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.540
 talking about a cell phone as the last 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.090
 proof of this reality the sessions of 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.130
 couture fashion in Europe is no longer 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.080
 do with photographers the so-called look 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.360
 book that are the presentation of 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.670
 season of a collection are recorded 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.280
 on video and from there the 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.860
 photographs or frames covering two 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.440
 services at the same time at the end and 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.840
 No photographer out by fast and skillful 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.590
 that it can capture reality like this 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.590
 in images per second 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.560
 not for nothing is there the career of the video 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.040
 in the cameras of sl 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.680
 my name is alejandro you yes yes the video 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.419
 You liked it, I like to subscribe to my 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.419
