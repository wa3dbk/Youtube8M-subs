00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 yesterday a twitter user 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.690
 asked 2k about the full roster 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.790
 of the game to which 2k replied there 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.250
 points that will be revealed once 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.830
 play the video game apparently the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.080
 2k strategy to generate hype about 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.789
 the video game is bearing fruit 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.779
 remember that there is less than a week 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 for the launch in ps3 and xbox360 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 here they also have some small 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.570
 new images of the game I'm very 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.810
 eager to get his hands on the game and see 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.820
 its interface is only five days away 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.540
 cast did an interview with the hand 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.989
 ambrosi who was promoting ww 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 the and the 2014 is born here you have the most 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 highlight of the interview on the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.579
 possibility that your combat with thirst 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.039
 rollins is not the main event if we are not 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.739
 the main event someone will be committing 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.500
 a big mistake will regret it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.199
 about their that rivalry with rollins 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.289
 go to finish this Sunday the reality 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.840
 is that the wwf is a crazy world that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.880
 is constantly changing you can not 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.619
 get ready for tomorrow 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 the fight for the pay per view and we 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.590
 you have changed you are going to face jones in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.720
 in the pay per view then the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.360
 Monday and I find out that we will fight in 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.000
 raw things can change like the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.880
 wind so you just have to do each 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 thing to your day could run over me 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.490
 bus tomorrow about the discontent of 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.369
 the people with brock lesnar not showing up 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 in all the shows in each show and 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.560
 we record many there has to be a 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 fight for the world championship every 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.599
 Monday in raw there should not be a fight 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.689
 for the world championship but that the 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.700
 champion does not appear to me that's not 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.740
 so big I compare it with the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.439
 champions who had to travel 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.319
 constantly in the 70s or in years 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.009
 previous you will not see a fight for the 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.899
 world championship every week 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.659
 I sincerely believe that we offer a lot 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.880
 material we offer a lot of wear 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.519
 string tv and there's a lot of time for 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.730
 fill brock lesnar could be used 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.840
 you will not see it very much 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.239
 I take the belt 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.790
 he took it to his castle to keep it 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.830
 locked in your attic we'll have to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.720
 wait a long period of time until 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.599
 that we see him fight again for the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.599
 championship like that is not so big that 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.670
 the champion does not appear in the show I'm 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.760
 sure yes that question is asked 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.099
 dolphin dolph ziggler he would say is a 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.530
 shit that the champion does not appear though 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.230
 clear then they take away the title and they 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.150
 It will fix the good dressing 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.580
