the<00:00:10.740> new<00:00:10.920> theory<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.700> orange<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.390> a<00:00:12.570> fast<00:00:13.080> ship

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:13.350 
the new theory in orange is a fast ship

products<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:15.059> neutrino<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:15.990> see<00:00:16.440> is

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
products and the neutrino that I see is

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.859 
products and the neutrino that I see is
one<00:00:16.830> of<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.040> first<00:00:17.340> people<00:00:18.000> up<00:00:18.119> here<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
one of the first people up here and

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.300 
one of the first people up here and
that's<00:00:19.170> what<00:00:19.650> matters<00:00:19.860> isn't<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:22.040> want<00:00:23.040> to<00:00:23.100> hear

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
that's what matters isn't I want to hear

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.750 
that's what matters isn't I want to hear
and<00:00:23.580> I'm<00:00:24.510> sure<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.110> we<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.040> the<00:00:26.070> measure

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and I'm sure that we have the measure

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.810 
and I'm sure that we have the measure
and<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.270> facility<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.710> later<00:00:28.950> it's

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
and the facility to see that later it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.700 
and the facility to see that later it's
another<00:00:30.440> really<00:00:31.440> an<00:00:31.830> amazing<00:00:32.250> product<00:00:33.710> key
