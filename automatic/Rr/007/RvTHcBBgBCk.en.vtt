about<00:00:12.179> cinema<00:00:12.570> 4d<00:00:12.809> we're<00:00:13.200> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> learn<00:00:13.799> how

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
about cinema 4d we're going to learn how

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.730 
about cinema 4d we're going to learn how
to<00:00:14.250> put<00:00:14.549> multiple<00:00:15.089> textures<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.500> object

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
to put multiple textures on one object

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.250 
to put multiple textures on one object
and<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.850> different<00:00:18.449> polygons<00:00:18.990> have

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and have different polygons have

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.609 
and have different polygons have
different<00:00:19.680> textures<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> basically<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.140> just

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
different textures so basically I just

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.740 
different textures so basically I just
have<00:00:22.740> three<00:00:22.920> materials<00:00:23.640> down<00:00:23.880> here<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.300> have

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
have three materials down here I have

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.009 
have three materials down here I have
cyan<00:00:25.320> yellow<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.160> purple<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.840> any

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
cyan yellow and purple you can do any

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
cyan yellow and purple you can do any
number<00:00:28.109> effects<00:00:28.710> on<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.400> set<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
number effects on here I just set the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
number effects on here I just set the
color<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:30.960> demonstrative<00:00:31.740> purposes

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
color just for demonstrative purposes

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.200 
color just for demonstrative purposes
and<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.630> cube<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.670> so<00:00:35.670> let's<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.059> say

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and I have a cube here so let's just say

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.229 
and I have a cube here so let's just say
we<00:00:36.420> wanted<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> change<00:00:37.280> the<00:00:38.280> three<00:00:38.879> different

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
we wanted to change the three different

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.600 
we wanted to change the three different
sides<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.140> into<00:00:40.460> three<00:00:41.460> different

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
sides that we see into three different

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
sides that we see into three different
colors<00:00:42.149> well<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.350> actually<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.770> very<00:00:44.430> easy

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
colors well it's actually very very easy

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
colors well it's actually very very easy
to<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.660> there's<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.170> much<00:00:46.469> explanation

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to do there's not much explanation

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
to do there's not much explanation
needed<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.450> basically<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.710> drag<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
needed but basically if we just drag a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.910 
needed but basically if we just drag a
material<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.030> entire<00:00:51.480> object<00:00:51.809> gets<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
material the entire object gets that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.209 
material the entire object gets that
material<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.710> when<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.860> place

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
material so you can see when we place

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
material so you can see when we place
multiple<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:57.000> top<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.420> each<00:00:57.539> other<00:00:57.780> they're

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
multiple on top of each other they're

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.349 
multiple on top of each other they're
really<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.620> layering<00:00:59.039> themselves<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
really just layering themselves on that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.219 
really just layering themselves on that
one<00:01:00.629> object<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> actually<00:01:02.340> make<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:03.229> only

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
one object so to actually make them only

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.250 
one object so to actually make them only
apply<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:05.549> polygon<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.689> side<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
apply to one polygon or one side of the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.620 
apply to one polygon or one side of the
shape<00:01:07.530> as<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.850> we<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
shape as we can see here all we have to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.350 
shape as we can see here all we have to
do<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.020> select<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.040> polygon<00:01:11.580> selection<00:01:12.030> tool

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
do is select the polygon selection tool

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.469 
do is select the polygon selection tool
and<00:01:12.979> as<00:01:13.979> far<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.460> tell<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.850> has<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.330> be

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and as far as I can tell this has to be

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.230 
and as far as I can tell this has to be
at<00:01:15.720> an<00:01:15.930> editable<00:01:16.409> object<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:18.030> not

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
at an editable object if it's not

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
at an editable object if it's not
editable<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.770> believe<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.159> will

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
editable then I don't believe it will

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.210 
editable then I don't believe it will
work<00:01:20.420> but<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.590> select<00:01:22.799> one

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
work but all we have to do is select one

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.050 
work but all we have to do is select one
of<00:01:23.250> these<00:01:23.490> sides<00:01:24.770> drag<00:01:25.770> our<00:01:25.979> object<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.610> top<00:01:26.880> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
of these sides drag our object on top of

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.420 
of these sides drag our object on top of
that<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.540> now<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.380> applied<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that and now it's only applied on to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
that and now it's only applied on to
that<00:01:29.579> side<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.570> we<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:31.020> select<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> top

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that side so we can just select the top

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.810 
that side so we can just select the top
drag<00:01:33.060> yellow<00:01:33.720> select<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.280> side<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
drag yellow select the right side to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.140 
drag yellow select the right side to
drag<00:01:36.090> our<00:01:36.680> magenta<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> for

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
drag our magenta and we can do it for

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.660 
drag our magenta and we can do it for
any<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> sides<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.650> just<00:01:40.680> set

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
any of the sides here so I can just set

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
any of the sides here so I can just set
yellow<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> bottom<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.780> something<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
yellow on the bottom or something like

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.679 
yellow on the bottom or something like
that<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.360> on<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> right

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
that and you can see that on the right

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
that and you can see that on the right
side<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:46.799> doing<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.909> it's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
side what it's actually doing is it's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.840 
side what it's actually doing is it's
creating<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:49.320> selection<00:01:50.070> tags<00:01:50.340> which<00:01:50.700> are

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
creating these selection tags which are

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
creating these selection tags which are
the<00:01:51.000> orange<00:01:51.240> triangles<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.799> basically<00:01:53.250> it's

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the orange triangles so basically it's

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.690 
the orange triangles so basically it's
saving<00:01:53.970> whichever<00:01:54.920> size<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.340> whichever

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
saving whichever size or whichever

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.080 
saving whichever size or whichever
selection<00:01:57.509> should<00:01:57.899> have<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.590> material<00:01:59.100> this

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
selection should have this material this

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.440 
selection should have this material this
is<00:02:00.299> saving<00:02:00.600> whatever<00:02:01.640> material<00:02:02.640> whatever<00:02:02.969> we

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is saving whatever material whatever we

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
is saving whatever material whatever we
should<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.469> material<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> saving

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
should have this material this is saving

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.520 
should have this material this is saving
whatever<00:02:06.180> should<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.750> material<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
whatever should have this material and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.350 
whatever should have this material and
it's<00:02:08.250> saving<00:02:08.520> whatever<00:02:08.879> should<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it's saving whatever should have this
