00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.740
 dollar or the blue kick hello everyone 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.540
 well let's go home wait do not go 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.360
 look at everything that happened this week in 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.719
 cartoon jake and end were camping 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.390
 a little spin eat a cherry cookie 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.359
 he did manicure ton gum he ate a 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.320
 Muscled bee was belly model 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.000
 sprite slipped without a floto a lady 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.759
 he confused Clarence into a piece of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.220
 meat made a party in cloud kingdom 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.939
 and they discovered Mr. bosch looking 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.939
 crocodile videos 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.400
 how crazy 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.320
 another week in cartoon 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.910
 I assume her clarice Clarence and juice 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.250
 they found themselves in the supermarket and 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.559
 They made tremendous mess they made an effect 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.840
 dominated with products 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:10.910
 Clarence climbed an instant 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.430
 rosquillas donuts and they used a pizza 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.640
 as frisbee and I was curious to know 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.040
 how it would work in the real world 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.979
 so we went with a pizza to the beach 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.960
 to see what if the truth that the pizza 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.909
 works well as a frisbee but the 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.909
 frisbee does not work well as pizza 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.520
 end floated in the sky quietly 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.579
 when suddenly spatial shortcuts 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.500
 yes spatial shorties in the chapter 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.479
 earlier we saw a butter and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.579
 now we find this and I 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.799
 I wonder what it would be like if they made a 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.210
 Space Butters Film 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.800
 the reason he thinks of them in that 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.450
 a simple butter 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.450
 that can save the world 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.300
 it's not special is space 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.790
 facial 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 they come to save 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.070
 with the special participation of purpose 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.440
 like the rider in mantecal and saras 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.010
 franklin as the mother butter 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.130
 the amounts and exposures soon 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.220
 in no zinc they also stay looking 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.530
 to the ceiling for 15 minutes today in 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.120
 analyzing things let's see how they have 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.370
 decorated the house with you 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.470
 good as they broke everything for a change 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.239
 let's analyze something else in the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.459
 previous chapter we saw caritas in the 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.819
 plugs and this week they appeared by 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.129
 all sides in this fryer hi in 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.739
 this cereal 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:55.400
 in this shed 1 in this toilet paper 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:58.340
 that looks like a duck is not true fatma in 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.739
 this speaker or side and in my house 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.790
 I found in this camera hi in the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.799
 hello sinks in this kitchen hello and for 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.799
 the window I saw this nice building 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:18.230
 although the crazy 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.910
 56 47 48 49 50 the inflatable princess will 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.140
 I combed quietly when suddenly 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 an intruder appeared 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.459
 the 6 many risks the university 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.430
 know why he said 6 4 3 2 1 but he squeezed 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.040
 39 80 is one of the mysteries of this 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.930
 week how to know why a second 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.910
 for the other the food of 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.200
 these plates 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.530
 just like this microphone 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.840
 and this skateboard after steven 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.519
 I push steven he did not see it anymore and 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.379
 coincidentally we could see that the magician 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.970
 evil now has a very clock 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.519
 similar to the one that disappeared in the 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.769
 last chapter know if you're 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.830
 Disappearances are the work of the evil magician 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.830
 it is undoubtedly the mystery of the week 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.230
 a favorite secondary character of this 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.130
 week are the nice lady 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.720
 the neuron of gombÃ¡u 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.730
 the square coach 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.040
 the man who came down in a pair of underpants 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.260
 cab 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.750
 and in the festival of the cloud kingdom I saw many 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.920
 incredible clouds but my favorite was the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.050
 cloud of chanchito 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.340
 and it is therefore our character 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.340
 favorite secondary 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.600
 and we are getting closer to the end is all not 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.940
 we still need to see what we learned 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.550
 this week that validate win is 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.160
 they wore weird in a time that clarence 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.590
 It is funny that many things are 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.600
 written in a weird language that the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.520
 Space butters saved the world 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.700
 that the muscular ones also have 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.700
 feelings 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.020
 that not all walls are easy to 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.419
 breaking the world is full of objects 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.520
 with caritas and that a frisbee does not work 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:11.120
 like pizza like a washing machine we 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.889
 serves as a dishwasher that the madman does not and 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.889
 all this happened this week in cardboard 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.750
 We are not going to see, I only see things that I 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.750
 they challenge intellectually
