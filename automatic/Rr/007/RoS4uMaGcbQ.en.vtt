00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you may not always remember this but

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
you may not always remember this but
Timothy<00:01:00.420> Bradley<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.079> undefeated<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
Timothy Bradley is undefeated in the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.939 
Timothy Bradley is undefeated in the
world<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.670> boxing<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> record<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.140> 31<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
world of boxing with a record of 31 and

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920 
world of boxing with a record of 31 and
oh<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.729> Manny<00:01:06.119> Pacquiao<00:01:06.630> would

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
oh and I think Manny Pacquiao would

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.770 
oh and I think Manny Pacquiao would
actually<00:01:07.439> give<00:01:07.680> him<00:01:07.950> his<00:01:08.400> first<00:01:08.700> loss<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.420> think

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
actually give him his first loss I think

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
actually give him his first loss I think
Manny<00:01:09.990> Pacquiao<00:01:10.470> skills<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.220> diminished

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
Manny Pacquiao skills have diminished

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730 
Manny Pacquiao skills have diminished
since<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> first<00:01:12.600> time<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:13.049> for<00:01:13.290> two<00:01:13.500> years

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
since the first time they for two years

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
since the first time they for two years
ago<00:01:13.920> but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.490> he's<00:01:14.850> gonna<00:01:15.000> take<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
ago but I think he's gonna take the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.390 
ago but I think he's gonna take the
fight<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.720> Timothy<00:01:16.290> Bradley<00:01:16.530> who<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.159> also

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
fight to Timothy Bradley who I also

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
fight to Timothy Bradley who I also
think<00:01:17.790> has<00:01:18.030> improved<00:01:18.450> since<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.259> last<00:01:19.470> time

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
think has improved since the last time

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.340 
think has improved since the last time
he<00:01:20.040> fought<00:01:20.310> Manny<00:01:20.549> Pacquiao<00:01:21.030> if<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.170> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
he fought Manny Pacquiao if this is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.770 
he fought Manny Pacquiao if this is
gonna<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:23.070> 12<00:01:23.430> rounds<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.060> probably

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
gonna go all 12 rounds it's probably

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.690 
gonna go all 12 rounds it's probably
gonna<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.110> Bradley<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> think<00:01:26.490> Manny

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
gonna be Bradley but I think Manny

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
gonna be Bradley but I think Manny
Pacquiao<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.570> give<00:01:27.810> him<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.259> hard<00:01:28.680> enough

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
Pacquiao will give him a hard enough

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.980 
Pacquiao will give him a hard enough
time<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.850> he<00:01:30.000> will<00:01:30.150> either<00:01:30.329> knock<00:01:30.659> him<00:01:30.840> out

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
time that he will either knock him out

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.380 
time that he will either knock him out
yes<00:01:31.380> Tim<00:01:32.040> Bradley<00:01:32.310> will<00:01:32.700> probably<00:01:33.210> get

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
yes Tim Bradley will probably get

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.109 
yes Tim Bradley will probably get
knocked<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.770> goes<00:01:34.979> 12<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.670> gotta<00:01:35.970> go
