00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
I'm cutting off the neck and as you can

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.790 
I'm cutting off the neck and as you can
see<00:00:57.880> I'm<00:00:58.180> cutting<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:58.630> top<00:00:58.990> and<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.530> bottom

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
see I'm cutting the top and the bottom

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.700 
see I'm cutting the top and the bottom
layer<00:01:00.550> separately<00:01:01.150> so<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:02.200> way<00:01:02.350> I<00:01:02.380> did<00:01:02.620> that

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
layer separately so the way I did that

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.679 
layer separately so the way I did that
was<00:01:02.920> just<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.280> take<00:01:03.490> a<00:01:03.520> little<00:01:03.790> snip<00:01:04.150> into<00:01:04.540> the

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
was just to take a little snip into the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.200 
was just to take a little snip into the
edge<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.320> shirt<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.890> then<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:06.820> can<00:01:06.969> stick

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
edge of the shirt and then you can stick

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.700 
edge of the shirt and then you can stick
the<00:01:07.329> bottom<00:01:07.630> blade<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.960> your<00:01:08.079> scissors<00:01:08.289> in<00:01:08.469> and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
the bottom blade of your scissors in and

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.830 
the bottom blade of your scissors in and
that<00:01:09.159> way<00:01:09.340> you<00:01:09.399> can<00:01:09.700> start<00:01:10.179> cutting<00:01:10.539> the<00:01:10.630> top

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
that way you can start cutting the top

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.469 
that way you can start cutting the top
and<00:01:11.140> not<00:01:11.289> touch<00:01:11.679> the<00:01:11.859> bottom<00:01:11.979> yet<00:01:12.399> and<00:01:12.640> that's

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
and not touch the bottom yet and that's

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.389 
and not touch the bottom yet and that's
because<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:13.929> wanted<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.560> back<00:01:14.950> of<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.219> neck

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
because I wanted the back of the neck

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.639 
because I wanted the back of the neck
should<00:01:15.579> be<00:01:15.700> as<00:01:15.789> high<00:01:15.820> as<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.240> could<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:17.229> it's

should be as high as it could so it's

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.069

lower<00:01:39.340> just<00:01:39.760> so<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:41.380> right<00:01:41.620> at<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.390> bust

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
lower just so it's right at the bust

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.950 
lower just so it's right at the bust
here

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
here

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.410 
here
and<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.040> found<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.670> armpit<00:01:47.240> hole

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
and so I found that the armpit hole

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.420 
and so I found that the armpit hole
weren't<00:01:48.140> big<00:01:48.380> enough<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.800> my<00:01:48.890> liking<00:01:49.160> it

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
weren't big enough to my liking it

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.310 
weren't big enough to my liking it
wasn't<00:01:49.760> sitting<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.240> right<00:01:50.360> spot<00:01:50.690> so<00:01:51.080> I

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
wasn't sitting in the right spot so I

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.250 
wasn't sitting in the right spot so I
wanted<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.100> cut<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:53.270> where<00:01:53.600> my<00:01:53.750> bust

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
wanted to cut it just to where my bust

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.560 
wanted to cut it just to where my bust
was<00:01:54.590> if<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.250> watch<00:01:55.460> my<00:01:55.640> previous<00:01:55.670> video<00:01:56.480> about

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
was if you watch my previous video about

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.320

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
actually put the t-shirt on and I

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.030 
actually put the t-shirt on and I
measure<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.790> where<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.119> waist<00:02:05.420> was<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:06.080> I

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
measure to where my waist was and I

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.270 
measure to where my waist was and I
added<00:02:07.729> however<00:02:08.600> much<00:02:08.899> more<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.709> needed<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.100> cut

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280

and I just cut the arm that holes too so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.830 
and I just cut the arm that holes too so
I<00:02:12.890> would<00:02:13.070> reach<00:02:13.280> my<00:02:13.459> waist<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.150> that's<00:02:14.720> how

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I would reach my waist and that's how

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.870 
I would reach my waist and that's how
you<00:02:14.900> get<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.260> really<00:02:15.560> oversized<00:02:16.130> baggy<00:02:16.490> tank

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 

and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:31.230> didn't<00:02:31.440> want<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.709> have<00:02:31.830> such<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> thick

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and I didn't want to have such a thick

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.170 
and I didn't want to have such a thick
straps

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
straps

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
straps
I'm<00:02:33.269> cutting<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.109> little<00:02:34.620> bit<00:02:34.950> thinner<00:02:35.280> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
I'm cutting it a little bit thinner and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.610 
I'm cutting it a little bit thinner and
especially<00:02:36.060> at<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.750> part<00:02:37.019> where<00:02:37.079> there<00:02:37.439> is<00:02:37.590> a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
especially at the part where there is a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.380 
especially at the part where there is a
seam<00:02:38.040> across<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.549> top<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.790> your<00:02:38.909> shoulders

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
seam across the top of your shoulders

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.369 
seam across the top of your shoulders
that<00:02:40.049> part<00:02:40.469> won't<00:02:40.739> quarrel<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.340> fabric

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
that part won't quarrel and the fabric

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.410 
that part won't quarrel and the fabric
directly<00:02:43.379> below<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:44.040> above<00:02:44.129> it<00:02:44.459> will<00:02:44.760> curl<00:02:45.060> so

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
directly below and above it will curl so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.360 
directly below and above it will curl so
it's<00:02:45.900> going<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.140> make<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.530> same<00:02:46.799> part<00:02:47.069> stick

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
it's going to make the same part stick

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.330 
it's going to make the same part stick
out<00:02:47.579> so<00:02:47.849> I'm<00:02:47.939> just<00:02:48.150> trimming<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.629> so<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.340> sort

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
out so I'm just trimming it so it sort

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.610 
out so I'm just trimming it so it sort
of<00:02:50.400> curves<00:02:50.700> inward<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.629> it<00:02:51.780> naturally<00:02:52.439> will

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
of curves inward so it naturally will

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.190 
of curves inward so it naturally will
become<00:02:53.010> more<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.489> straight<00:02:53.730> line<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.200> now

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
become more of a straight line so now

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.599 
become more of a straight line so now
you<00:02:55.260> can<00:02:55.379> see<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.769> straps<00:02:56.040> fit<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.400> lot

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
you can see that the straps fit a lot

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.520 
you can see that the straps fit a lot
better<00:02:56.819> but<00:02:57.150> I'm<00:02:57.599> going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.930> taking<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.379> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
better but I'm going to be taking it in
