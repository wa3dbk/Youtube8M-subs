00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
send in the barbarian king and the units

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.870 
send in the barbarian king and the units
are<00:01:32.439> just<00:01:32.590> knocking<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.399> rest<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.790> the

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
are just knocking out the rest of the

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940 
are just knocking out the rest of the
defenses<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.899> rest<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.469> buildings

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
defenses and the rest of the buildings

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.889 
defenses and the rest of the buildings
here<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.180> gonna<00:01:37.299> go<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:37.509> to<00:01:37.750> be<00:01:37.869> a

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
here and so this is gonna go on to be a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.620 
here and so this is gonna go on to be a
fairly<00:01:38.770> straightforward<00:01:39.030> three-star<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.299> a

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
fairly straightforward three-star of a

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.780 
fairly straightforward three-star of a
townhall<00:01:40.990> 8<00:01:41.200> which<00:01:41.409> is<00:01:41.560> great<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.920> see<00:01:42.100> when

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
townhall 8 which is great to see when

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.910 
townhall 8 which is great to see when
you're<00:01:42.939> a<00:01:42.969> townhall<00:01:43.420> 8<00:01:43.479> as<00:01:43.750> well<00:01:43.899> so<00:01:44.799> hopefully

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
you're a townhall 8 as well so hopefully

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.770 
you're a townhall 8 as well so hopefully
that's<00:01:45.280> something<00:01:45.549> that<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.570> can<00:01:46.750> use

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
that's something that that you can use

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.690 
that's something that that you can use
in<00:01:47.110> your<00:01:47.200> own<00:01:47.259> attacks<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.890> it's<00:01:48.009> fairly

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
in your own attacks and it's fairly

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.880 
in your own attacks and it's fairly
inexpensive<00:01:48.969> on<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.750> elixir<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.380> only<00:01:50.530> takes

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
inexpensive on the elixir it only takes

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.999 
inexpensive on the elixir it only takes
one<00:01:51.460> dragon<00:01:52.119> they're<00:01:53.049> only<00:01:53.289> level<00:01:53.500> one<00:01:53.770> minion

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
one dragon they're only level one minion

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.249 
one dragon they're only level one minion
so<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.490> not<00:01:54.670> not<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> high-powered<00:01:55.930> attack

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
so it's not not a high-powered attack

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.340 
so it's not not a high-powered attack
and<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:57.280> fairly<00:01:57.460> easy<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:58.090> uh<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.600> execute<00:01:59.020> so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
and it's fairly easy to uh to execute so

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.810 
and it's fairly easy to uh to execute so
hope<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.710> enjoyed<00:01:59.979> watching<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.310> video<00:02:00.640> and
