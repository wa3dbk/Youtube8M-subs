00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
when you're using this gun as weird as

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.660 
when you're using this gun as weird as
it<00:01:04.650> seems<00:01:04.830> for<00:01:05.010> an<00:01:05.070> assault<00:01:05.250> rifle<00:01:05.339> you're

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
it seems for an assault rifle you're

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
it seems for an assault rifle you're
actually<00:01:05.880> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> want<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.780> in

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
actually going to want to be up in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.200 
actually going to want to be up in
people's<00:01:07.439> faces<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.490> gun<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.670> very<00:01:09.000> good

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
people's faces now this gun is very good

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.340 
people's faces now this gun is very good
but<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> reason<00:01:09.570> why<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.900> comes<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.320> number

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
but the reason why it comes in at number

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
but the reason why it comes in at number
five<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.159> not<00:01:11.400> higher<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.030> list<00:01:12.090> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
five and not higher on this list is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.750 
five and not higher on this list is
because<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.080> hbr<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> 3<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.040> better<00:01:14.369> weapon

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
because it the hbr a 3 has better weapon

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
because it the hbr a 3 has better weapon
variants<00:01:15.060> such<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.900> insanity<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.740> my

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
variants such as the insanity and in my

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
variants such as the insanity and in my
opinion<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.490> average<00:01:17.880> Joe<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:19.140> rather

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
opinion the average Joe I would rather

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
opinion the average Joe I would rather
use<00:01:19.590> those<00:01:19.830> two<00:01:20.070> over<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.580> Raider<00:01:20.790> but<00:01:21.210> if

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
use those two over the Raider but if

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.580 
use those two over the Raider but if
you're<00:01:21.570> running<00:01:21.869> around<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.229> game<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you're running around the game and you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.200 
you're running around the game and you
see<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> Raider<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.670> afraid<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.909> pick<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
see a Raider don't be afraid to pick it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.760 
see a Raider don't be afraid to pick it
up<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> handles<00:01:24.869> very<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.350> well<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
up because it handles very very well and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.469 
up because it handles very very well and
it's<00:01:25.920> definitely<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.700> you're<00:01:27.180> probably

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it's definitely one you're probably

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.249 
it's definitely one you're probably
going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.140> give<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> shot

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.289 

so<00:01:34.259> coming<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.979> number<00:01:35.250> four<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
so coming in at number four we have the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.840 
so coming in at number four we have the
KF<00:01:36.630> five<00:01:36.840> genuine<00:01:37.470> another<00:01:37.710> KF<00:01:37.950> five<00:01:38.130> genuine

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
KF five genuine another KF five genuine

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.999 
KF five genuine another KF five genuine
is<00:01:39.119> definitely<00:01:39.659> very<00:01:39.690> good<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> couldn't

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
is definitely very good but I couldn't

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.499 
is definitely very good but I couldn't
decide<00:01:41.280> whether<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.549> put<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.330> there

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
decide whether to put this one in there

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
decide whether to put this one in there
or<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.080> endless<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.590> ended<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:43.920> deciding<00:01:44.250> on

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
or the endless I ended up deciding on

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670 
or the endless I ended up deciding on
this<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:44.909> just<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:46.110> happens

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
this one just because what that happens

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.289 
this one just because what that happens
with<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.009> weapon<00:01:47.190> is<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> actually<00:01:47.909> changes

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
with this weapon is it actually changes

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
with this weapon is it actually changes
this<00:01:48.840> gun<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.229> six<00:01:49.470> bullet<00:01:49.770> kill<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.039> range

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this gun from a six bullet kill at range

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
this gun from a six bullet kill at range
to<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.820> five<00:01:51.149> bullet<00:01:51.479> killer<00:01:51.659> range<00:01:51.899> which<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
to a five bullet killer range which is

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.930 
to a five bullet killer range which is
actually<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.369> big<00:01:53.670> difference

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
actually a really really big difference

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.029 
actually a really really big difference
the<00:01:54.600> one<00:01:54.899> problem<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:55.799> gun<00:01:56.009> is

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
the one problem I have with this gun is

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.460 
the one problem I have with this gun is
that<00:01:56.220> you<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:56.670> can't<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> red<00:01:58.259> dot

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
that you actually can't use a red dot

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.260 
that you actually can't use a red dot
sight<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.580> enjoy<00:01:59.850> using<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
sight and I really really enjoy using a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.910 
sight and I really really enjoy using a
red<00:02:00.390> dot<00:02:00.570> sight<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:00.990> KF<00:02:01.259> five<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.890> I

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
red dot sight with the KF five but I

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
red dot sight with the KF five but I
know<00:02:02.039> not<00:02:02.670> everyone<00:02:03.360> needs<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.690> and<00:02:03.929> that's

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
know not everyone needs that and that's

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.510 
know not everyone needs that and that's
why<00:02:04.289> I<00:02:04.350> ended<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.679> putting<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.280> list

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
why I ended up putting it on this list

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.950 
why I ended up putting it on this list
because<00:02:05.819> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.179> lot<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.479> people<00:02:06.600> will<00:02:06.929> be

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
because I think a lot of people will be

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.259 
because I think a lot of people will be
more<00:02:07.259> successful<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> genuine<00:02:08.970> than

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
more successful with the genuine than

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.180 
more successful with the genuine than
they<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.750> endless<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.619> if<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
they will with the endless so if you

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.070 
they will with the endless so if you
have<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.580> gun<00:02:11.819> definitely<00:02:12.660> check<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.900> out

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
have this gun definitely check it out

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.750 
have this gun definitely check it out
it's<00:02:13.260> not<00:02:13.440> very<00:02:13.650> rare<00:02:13.980> at<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> lot<00:02:14.730> of

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
it's not very rare at all so a lot of

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.860 
it's not very rare at all so a lot of
people<00:02:15.060> are<00:02:15.150> gonna<00:02:15.209> have<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.690> you'll

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
people are gonna have it so you'll

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.090 
people are gonna have it so you'll
probably<00:02:16.019> find<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> ground<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.920> all

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
probably find it on the ground and all

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.309 
probably find it on the ground and all
that<00:02:17.280> stuff<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.810> list<00:02:19.080> this

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that stuff and I think on this list this

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.920 
that stuff and I think on this list this
gun<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.700> most<00:02:20.910> underrated<00:02:21.450> gun

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
gun is actually the most underrated gun

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.960 
gun is actually the most underrated gun
on<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> list<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.709> gun<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:22.920> very<00:02:23.430> very<00:02:23.730> good

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
on the list this gun is very very good

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.699 
on the list this gun is very very good
and<00:02:24.150> most<00:02:24.750> people<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.230> even<00:02:25.319> think<00:02:25.560> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
and most people don't even think of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.440 
and most people don't even think of
using<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:26.310> definitely<00:02:26.819> if<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.269> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
using it but definitely if you have it

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.600 
using it but definitely if you have it
check<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.019> out<00:02:28.110> because<00:02:28.319> it<00:02:28.590> packs<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.190> mean

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
check it out because it packs a mean

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.430 
check it out because it packs a mean
mean<00:02:30.269> punch<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:36.390> coming<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.720> at<00:02:36.810> number<00:02:36.930> 3<00:02:37.260> hip

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
mean punch so coming in at number 3 hip

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440 
mean punch so coming in at number 3 hip
we<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> ASM<00:02:38.430> one<00:02:38.670> rigger<00:02:39.060> now<00:02:39.299> you're

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
we have the ASM one rigger now you're

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.490 
we have the ASM one rigger now you're
probably<00:02:39.660> going<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.079> few<00:02:40.350> questions

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
probably going to have a few questions

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.610 
probably going to have a few questions
to<00:02:40.920> ask<00:02:41.040> about<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.760> first<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.480> all<00:02:42.540> why<00:02:43.350> isn't

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
to ask about this first of all why isn't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.930 
to ask about this first of all why isn't
the<00:02:43.739> reckless<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.459> think<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.730> lot<00:02:44.760> of

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the reckless on here I think a lot of

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.610 
the reckless on here I think a lot of
people<00:02:45.060> consider<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> reckless<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
people consider the reckless to be a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.080 
people consider the reckless to be a
better<00:02:46.829> gun<00:02:47.130> than<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> rigger<00:02:47.579> because<00:02:47.970> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
better gun than the rigger because the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.449 
better gun than the rigger because the
reckless<00:02:48.420> has<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.720> fire<00:02:49.079> right<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.070> rapid

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
reckless has up fire right and the rapid

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.920 
reckless has up fire right and the rapid
fire<00:02:50.609> attachment<00:02:51.120> already<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.540> but

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
fire attachment already on it but

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.080 
fire attachment already on it but
there's<00:02:52.079> two<00:02:52.380> reasons<00:02:52.620> why<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.640> reckless

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
there's two reasons why the reckless

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.240 
there's two reasons why the reckless
isn't<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.630> good<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.079> rigger<00:02:55.290> first<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.160> all

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
isn't as good as the rigger first of all

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.280 
isn't as good as the rigger first of all
the<00:02:56.700> reckless<00:02:57.150> already<00:02:57.570> has<00:02:57.720> up<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.109> fire

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the reckless already has up one fire

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.380 
the reckless already has up one fire
rate<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.709> hat<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.640> have<00:02:59.790> rapid<00:03:00.239> fire

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
rate and hat you have to have rapid fire

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.420 
rate and hat you have to have rapid fire
on<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:00.900> first<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.290> all<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.890> amount<00:03:02.280> of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
on it so first of all that amount of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.490 
on it so first of all that amount of
fire<00:03:02.640> rate<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.060> honestly<00:03:03.540> too<00:03:03.810> much<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.290> makes

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
fire rate is honestly too much and makes

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.840 
fire rate is honestly too much and makes
it<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.709> little<00:03:04.859> bit<00:03:05.040> harder<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.370> control<00:03:05.579> the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
it a little bit harder to control the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.660 
it a little bit harder to control the
recoil<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.540> top<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.400> may<00:03:08.640> not

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
recoil on top of that what you may not

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
recoil on top of that what you may not
know<00:03:08.910> about<00:03:09.480> rapid<00:03:09.989> fire<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.410> rapid<00:03:10.739> fire

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
know about rapid fire is rapid fire

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.099 
know about rapid fire is rapid fire
actually<00:03:11.430> decreases<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.299> three<00:03:12.600> bullet<00:03:12.900> kill

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
actually decreases the three bullet kill

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.900 
actually decreases the three bullet kill
range<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.620> sm<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.130> which<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.430> huge

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
range for the sm one which is a huge

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.430 
range for the sm one which is a huge
huge<00:03:15.269> deal<00:03:15.540> because<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.959> three<00:03:16.200> bullet

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
huge deal because that three bullet

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.810 
huge deal because that three bullet
killed<00:03:16.620> range<00:03:16.829> is<00:03:17.010> what's<00:03:17.459> absolutely

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
killed range is what's absolutely

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.640 
killed range is what's absolutely
amazing<00:03:18.540> on<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> air<00:03:18.870> someone<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.380> i<00:03:19.410> actually

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
amazing on the air someone so i actually

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.280 
amazing on the air someone so i actually
don't<00:03:20.160> use<00:03:20.519> rapid<00:03:20.970> fire<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.359> any<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.720> my<00:03:21.780> ASM

don't use rapid fire on any of my ASM

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.500 
don't use rapid fire on any of my ASM
ones<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.980> top<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> ASM<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:24.209> rigor

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.130 
ones on top of that the ASM one rigor
has<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.260> amazing<00:03:26.000> amazing<00:03:27.000> accuracy<00:03:27.630> no

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
actually kill people out of range almost

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.680 
actually kill people out of range almost
I<00:03:31.799> think<00:03:32.040> better<00:03:32.310> than<00:03:32.549> any<00:03:32.760> other<00:03:33.000> ASM<00:03:33.510> one

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
I think better than any other ASM one

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.420 
I think better than any other ASM one
and<00:03:33.840> some<00:03:34.260> people<00:03:34.380> actually<00:03:34.650> consider<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
and some people actually consider the

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.370 
and some people actually consider the
rigor<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.850> be<00:03:36.150> better<00:03:36.390> than<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.810> speakeasy

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
rigor to be better than the speakeasy

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.069 
rigor to be better than the speakeasy
now<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.769> wouldn't<00:03:38.130> go<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.280> say<00:03:38.669> that<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.870> this

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
now I wouldn't go to say that but this

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.259 
now I wouldn't go to say that but this
gun<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.320> definitely<00:03:40.949> really<00:03:41.639> really<00:03:42.030> good<00:03:42.180> if

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
gun is definitely really really good if

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.490 
gun is definitely really really good if
you<00:03:42.329> put<00:03:42.479> some<00:03:42.630> extended<00:03:43.079> mags<00:03:43.260> on

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
you put some extended mags on

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.800 
you put some extended mags on
here<00:03:43.650> with<00:03:43.770> advanced<00:03:44.100> trifling<00:03:44.700> with<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.390> ASM

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
here with advanced trifling with the ASM

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.470 
here with advanced trifling with the ASM
one<00:03:45.930> rigger<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.650> will<00:03:46.980> just<00:03:47.250> tear<00:03:47.760> people

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
one rigger it will just tear people

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.020 
one rigger it will just tear people
apart<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:50.220> being<00:03:50.430> said<00:03:50.520> if<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.000> have

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
apart now that being said if you have

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.400 
apart now that being said if you have
the<00:03:51.390> reckless<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.960> don't<00:03:52.140> have<00:03:52.260> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the reckless and you don't have the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.050 
the reckless and you don't have the
rigger<00:03:52.590> go<00:03:53.070> ahead<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.400> use<00:03:53.490> the<00:03:53.610> reckless<00:03:53.940> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
rigger go ahead and use the reckless the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.700 
rigger go ahead and use the reckless the
reckless<00:03:54.330> is<00:03:54.450> very<00:03:54.630> very<00:03:54.840> good<00:03:54.990> I<00:03:55.170> just<00:03:55.500> put

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
reckless is very very good I just put

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.070 
reckless is very very good I just put
the<00:03:55.890> rigger<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.310> bit<00:03:56.910> above<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.510> reckless<00:03:57.930> and

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
the rigger a bit above the reckless and

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.720 
the rigger a bit above the reckless and
that's<00:03:58.230> why<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.530> rigor<00:03:58.890> is<00:03:59.160> on<00:03:59.430> this<00:03:59.580> list<00:04:04.730> so

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
that's why the rigor is on this list so

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.390 
that's why the rigor is on this list so
coming<00:04:06.090> in<00:04:06.330> at<00:04:06.570> number<00:04:06.959> two<00:04:07.380> we<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
coming in at number two we have the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.460 
coming in at number two we have the
amelie<00:04:08.940> subvert<00:04:09.480> er<00:04:09.510> now<00:04:09.750> when<00:04:10.020> advanced

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
amelie subvert er now when advanced

warfare<00:04:10.590> was<00:04:11.100> first<00:04:11.400> released<00:04:11.640> this<00:04:11.970> gun<00:04:12.180> was

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
warfare was first released this gun was

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.820 
warfare was first released this gun was
kind<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.660> brought<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.140> forefront<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.620> think

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
kind of brought to the forefront I think

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.740 
kind of brought to the forefront I think
hutch<00:04:14.010> brought<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.459> up<00:04:14.580> and<00:04:14.760> he<00:04:15.270> kind<00:04:15.480> of<00:04:15.540> just

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
hutch brought it up and he kind of just

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.060 
hutch brought it up and he kind of just
said<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.230> this<00:04:16.410> gun<00:04:16.620> was<00:04:16.709> really<00:04:16.919> really

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
said that this gun was really really

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.199 
said that this gun was really really
good<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.609> people<00:04:17.790> started<00:04:18.180> using

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
good and a lot of people started using

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.750 
good and a lot of people started using
it<00:04:18.480> now<00:04:18.540> that<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.169> life<00:04:19.470> cycle<00:04:19.950> of<00:04:19.980> advanced

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
it now that the life cycle of advanced

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.580 
it now that the life cycle of advanced
warfare<00:04:21.060> has<00:04:21.209> kind<00:04:21.419> of<00:04:21.480> moved<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.380> think

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
warfare has kind of moved on I think

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.140 
warfare has kind of moved on I think
people<00:04:22.830> have<00:04:23.040> just<00:04:23.370> kind<00:04:23.640> of<00:04:23.700> forgot<00:04:24.090> about

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
people have just kind of forgot about

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.480 
people have just kind of forgot about
this<00:04:24.480> gun<00:04:24.690> but<00:04:24.870> really<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.410> gun<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.680> really

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
this gun but really this gun is really

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.940 
this gun but really this gun is really
really<00:04:27.240> really<00:04:27.419> good<00:04:27.750> um<00:04:28.020> in<00:04:28.260> fact<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:28.919> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
really really good um in fact you have a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.159 
really really good um in fact you have a
two<00:04:29.280> bullet<00:04:29.580> head<00:04:29.760> shot<00:04:30.000> kill<00:04:30.300> and<00:04:30.510> a<00:04:30.870> three

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
two bullet head shot kill and a three

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.470 
two bullet head shot kill and a three
bullet<00:04:31.500> kill<00:04:31.790> anywhere<00:04:32.790> into<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.300> body

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
bullet kill anywhere into the body

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.050 
bullet kill anywhere into the body
anywhere<00:04:34.440> on<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> map<00:04:34.919> at<00:04:35.130> any<00:04:35.490> distance<00:04:35.730> it's

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
anywhere on the map at any distance it's

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.880 
anywhere on the map at any distance it's
ridiculous<00:04:36.480> so<00:04:36.570> two<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:37.080> three<00:04:37.350> bullet<00:04:37.680> kill

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
think the only gun in the game that

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.220
