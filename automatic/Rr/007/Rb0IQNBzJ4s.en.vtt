00:00:46.329 --> 00:01:00.460
 folkschor genetics finally with new 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.159
 microphone 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.259
 I hope you realize and today I say 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.350
 you times my triceps workout by coach 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.390
 the b many of you have asked me 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.759
 after I bicep my tears 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.009
 explained when I said that 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.740
 I think that makes the biceps difficult 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.750
 train so with a few raps because you yes 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.340
 the back offers all the time in 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.520
 already trained with i say now 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.470
 moderate raps 8 to 12 as you can 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.690
 not really an advantage in the back 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.149
 if you go in too hard as you go 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.490
 otherwise directly in overcompensated with 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.990
 the poor and there I have a lot 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 As I asked that we are in the triceps 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.799
 do and that answers now 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.409
 actually your about to ask a 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.049
 a little bit because I know how you know 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.759
 Putsch tears very hard to the point 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.060
 go military press goes with me 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.039
 currently down to three raps so 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.470
 the really heavy weights that 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.390
 I move there and therefore I think 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.310
 personally it is not as important as 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.190
 Hard to get in the biceps 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.800
 On the contrary my elbows are not 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.560
 made for example this exercise 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.459
 here french press with over 50 kilo 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.379
 perform 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.910
 that hurts me even with it 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.140
 this attitude I now have her 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.780
 I really try that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.550
 elbows to the rear and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800
 do not make it lying down I do 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.409
 Most of the time you are in the exercise 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.450
 or just do not lie in the seat 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.769
 I do not like it that way and what I like 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.480
 it's still going on at the end of the day 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.129
 here that is that is the 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.269
 decisive point simply this 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.760
 to get stretch 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.650
 That requires extreme mobility 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.019
 that he does not try this directly at 30 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.610
 40 kilo tried out with the empty one 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.379
 If he ever behind the head 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.750
 The point of the matter is really 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.760
 head the triceps for the long features 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.890
 to load properly because it works 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.890
 mostly with the regular push exercises 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 pretty much and yes that's for 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.790
 every case the focus on this day here 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.470
 The long one offers the long triceps 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.900
 head to load properly 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.269
 You can see that here again, me too 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.909
 extremely heavy weight and lasers 1 1 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.709
 actually the dumbbell, so to speak 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.870
 So my long head offers pull 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.340
 the stretch is incredible and that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.620
 I just hold for a few seconds 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.950
 and then try this one now 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.230
 weight just to get a rap and that 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.420
 then widget directly too 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.459
 lighter weight that it is such an endless 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.840
 set I'm depending on need 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.060
 longer today a bit shorter 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.859
 starting with 20 then it goes on 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.099
 at 18 or 16 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.470
 and then another 14 or twelve tells you 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.510
 I've got some apps here already 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.519
 but try out anyway 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.120
 in this in this stretch position too 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.340
 linger 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.560
 just head around this long triceps 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.560
 the sweep to be mainly from the front 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.359
 really cool looks so that's it 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.329
 actually for me the most important part 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.189
 especially at the triceps training now 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.700
 this day because you just these muscles 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:54.159
 eating neglected and yes that would be 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.349
 then the second exercise as I said yet 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.760
 Sometimes it requires an extreme shoulder 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.049
 Mobility you see it is here 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.489
 maybe that will do some of you 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.919
 even hurt while watching 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.209
 It's not that easy 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.220
 I have to practice that a bit 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.419
 but once you've discovered how 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.310
 which then runs is actually already 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.690
 therefore no longer such a problem now 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.419
 each from pumps 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.370
 that's about three sentences altogether 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.769
 french press where everyone says that it 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.289
 also for me rather inserts are the same 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.909
 there are up to 15 repetitions then go 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.460
 I'm doing this endless set exactly 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:27.280
 once explicitly only once can 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.680
 one therefore counts as two sentences of 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.530
 volume and then finally there 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.270
 nor the machine comes to be now 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.270
 grave and that would actually be too 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.159
 already the push training or the streets 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.599
 been put into training about eight 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.479
 total when the first Sun 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.440
 expects the machine I now 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.990
 degree 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.020
 which is then again for me say it 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.940
 the horseshoe the so-called this 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.590
 horseshoe suite that's that's mine 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.810
 personal weak points triceps 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.090
 What matters to me is this horseshoe shape 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.639
 not so blatantly represented 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.060
 genetically conditioned and as you can see here 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.710
 I really do that with extremely tight 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.990
 set sat comes close 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.220
 pure and that really important because you 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.320
 you otherwise yourself 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.540
 shit are automatically a bit 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.040
 swing brings me something here too 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.200
 can say it is not every 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.670
 machine be the same america five weeks 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.130
 on the way and have no machine 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:24.190
 found that I liked as much as the 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.570
 here from jim so that can also for you 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.320
 be an obstacle to this machine 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.750
 perform 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.820
 these were my three exercises now 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.290
 here on this day if you do 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.700
 liked this video gives me up 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.440
 any case , I tend to do it soon 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.300
 also the second triceps training 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.800
 that looks a bit different and 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.210
 of course I am also for others 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.720
 suggestions like to be open 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:49.290
 Therefore, guys enjoy having your evening 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.290
 good workout and whatever i saw
