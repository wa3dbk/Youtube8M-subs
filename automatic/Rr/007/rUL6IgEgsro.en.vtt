formation that you guys said that i
couldnt<00:00:30.890> episode<00:00:31.189> 1<00:00:31.429> so<00:00:31.699> that<00:00:32.180> wouldn't<00:00:32.419> make

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
couldnt episode 1 so that wouldn't make

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.200 
couldnt episode 1 so that wouldn't make
a<00:00:32.540> difference<00:00:32.750> but<00:00:33.140> in<00:00:34.040> a<00:00:34.070> pre<00:00:34.370> average<00:00:34.730> isn't

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
a difference but in a pre average isn't

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.430 
a difference but in a pre average isn't
like<00:00:35.450> outstanding<00:00:35.690> ones<00:00:36.020> I<00:00:36.080> think<00:00:36.260> it<00:00:36.320> would

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
bronze as well so and it's just easier

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.480 
bronze as well so and it's just easier
