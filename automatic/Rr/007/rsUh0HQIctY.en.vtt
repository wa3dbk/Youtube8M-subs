00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.960
 Hello everyone 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.019
 this week we will talk about kolda 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.640
 Julienne it's 2 and the first one 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.840
 video there he comes there is not so I 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.629
 did not have enough content for the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.309
 wanted to present this year I pick up 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.360
 last year's content leads from 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.670
 this year and then I publish it for 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.280
 start - the procession of cork ready to 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.899
 to pass like a race that is to say that 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.699
 my goal is not to take a 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.290
 thirty even forty cork 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.850
 - 1 joe school like yesterday I finally 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.470
 do this activity there to have some 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.890
 pleasure to be in harmony with the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.890
 nature 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.830
 then see and understand how 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.340
 animals on vicoin they do for 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.540
 pass through the winter so less 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.130
 listen follow 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.590
 I installed about twenty paste 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.299
 in knows his mother big area then 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.189
 if I have not put a hundred then 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.170
 really recovered by all who come 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.259
 loot or a little ruler of the wolf 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.499
 you prefer to be more the trails 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.780
 hare that more traffic 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.700
 and then if i will not deny dival my 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.679
 season I saw really happy 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.609
 of my two main techniques 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.200
 down to 20 km at the same except that these 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.270
 two methods are a little earlier a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.039
 little bit different so the first one and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.429
 well I want to install have stuck on 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.979
 a perch hamburg so styling and have 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.009
 they're not really propitious trees are 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.729
 elastic enough to really take the 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.810
 ivy then that as a background and well I 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.789
 will go find me a perch 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.110
 a bead preferably from end to end 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.880
 so like tonight is really 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.520
 the more you do when I see 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.009
 apply it in the pudding to be there 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.380
 laborie on a club in our era have 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.630
 really hatch at the boom and well I'm going 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.880
 see that thil and lab the perch is 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.680
 elastic so the hare he sees 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.390
 some calves start running or 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.090
 monday little faster but I saw all 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.030
 that snare case where this rest because 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.920
 it's going to order too sic so it's okay 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 really worth this lab returns this pillar 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.930
 that the colleague tightened more and more 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.880
 so I can not see if I see 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.400
 that my island trails that is well 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.989
 placed between two small windows of 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.020
 fir well the cure stuck me on a 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.850
 point height and well I would like 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.830
 know about there so much of the soul at the 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.050
 hand height below the neck a 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.140
 college hole vosu promises m 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.360
 two branches really fine each fine 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.060
 ball had like this know to entice the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.520
 ivy arras raised class raise the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.840
 head for a massacre committed in the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.000
 college then some wood and sam 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.380
 well it bothers me skin of really 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.130
 to make a barrier 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.500
 each side of the collar but when the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.440
 sparse forest thing is not much 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.780
 of room branches and I do not want too much 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.519
 modified habitat because the link him 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.830
 is pushive a big barrier a 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.780
 where that's able to see a 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.340
 good distance normally they see 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.260
 know-how danger then be it must 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.970
 not go back or to get around the pass 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.650
 is like that happened to me the year 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.810
 passed I scored a lot of cork 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.690
 precisely because they stuck me 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.230
 in the collar is too big or a name that 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.850
 was poorly positioned at the height 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.280
 so that's why I stuck to 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.410
 base I do it to the size of the point 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.549
 even if a little bit smaller when 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.230
 you will have taken a ticket 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.000
 look at the size of the size it 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.580
 give you a good idea 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.230
 what dimension to do there 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.530
 the circumference and the diameter of the 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.240
 collar for making my 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.310
 colleagues well that's a pretty way 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.470
 simple I do it myself I do 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.210
 stick as have learned a lot it's 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.630
 really do it a magnifying glass have to 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.180
 pass the snare lot in the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.609
 rent it otherwise we will go see on the site 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.769
 health or banon on youtube but hey 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.520
 there are a lot of videos to show you 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.690
 how to mount the collets so 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.550
 study it in my area well I you 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.870
 would I say I will not lie to you there is no 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.040
 millions cork but more have to 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.740
 every year I see that there is always 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.220
 more and more of liev that's what 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.780
 in my corner or six more know more 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.120
 which is traps to two canines 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.860
 so it really helps to control the 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.790
 amount of fox coyote in the 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.680
 corner so that the father during all 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.190
 the summer july can increase can 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.820
 increase his being attacked by canes 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.340
 2 to complete the coding of the hare 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.190
 be it done in a very pro way 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.840
 for to hurt the beautiful alley 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.880
 see your anger regularly because 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.200
 if not also recognize warner he 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.250
 will not leave you lucky he'll go 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.140
 pick him up the hare 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.850
 then be careful that you put 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.010
 take off identify them so as not to 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.660
 forget then try all the time to not 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.690
 not have accidental catch or otherwise 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.320
 you take away the cold and hares by 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.780
 the loss 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.090
 try all the time to make your 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.580
 better position the collar to 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.240
 what he has me quickly without 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.610
 pain 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.669
 so on this thank you for having 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.670
 listened I do not have to share comment 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.700
 2 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.290
