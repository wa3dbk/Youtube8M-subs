00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
believe this was fair because the

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
believe this was fair because the
Indians<00:01:09.540> were<00:01:09.689> still<00:01:10.020> there<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.439> the

Indians were still there and the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.830 
Indians were still there and the

colonists went on to their land there

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
colonists went on to their land there
