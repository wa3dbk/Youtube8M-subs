so first of all there's no longer any

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.609 
so first of all there's no longer any
champion<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.370> Centurion<00:00:15.030> commendations<00:00:15.839> or

mercenary<00:00:17.369> combinations<00:00:18.000> as<00:00:18.240> well<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.840> if<00:00:18.930> you

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
mercenary combinations as well so if you

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.140 
mercenary combinations as well so if you
had<00:00:19.230> any<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.680> those<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.580> can't<00:00:20.760> really<00:00:20.970> use

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
had any of those you can't really use

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.660 
had any of those you can't really use
them<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.720> anything<00:00:22.109> there<00:00:22.859> that's<00:00:23.130> also

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
them for anything there that's also

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.439 
them for anything there that's also
three<00:00:24.210> new<00:00:24.390> tears<00:00:25.099> which<00:00:26.099> are<00:00:26.369> recruit<00:00:26.880> which

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
three new tears which are recruit which

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
three new tears which are recruit which
is<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> starting<00:00:28.260> default<00:00:28.769> gear<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.099> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
is the starting default gear that you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.580 
is the starting default gear that you
can<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.760> level<00:00:30.000> 50<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.599> credits

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
can get right at level 50 with credits

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
can get right at level 50 with credits
so<00:00:31.920> these<00:00:32.219> aren't<00:00:32.399> very<00:00:32.579> good<00:00:32.669> obviously<00:00:33.360> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
so these aren't very good obviously I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
so these aren't very good obviously I
think<00:00:33.690> they're<00:00:33.809> similar<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.710> Centurion

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
think they're similar to the Centurion

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.639 
think they're similar to the Centurion
stats<00:00:35.730> maybe<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.630> bit<00:00:36.899> worse<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.440> don't

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
stats maybe a bit worse but I don't

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.319 
stats maybe a bit worse but I don't
really<00:00:37.770> remember<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.579> stats<00:00:38.850> were<00:00:39.090> on

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
really remember what the stats were on

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.690 
really remember what the stats were on
that<00:00:39.899> Centurion<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> blue<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that Centurion here but it is blue so

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.090 
that Centurion here but it is blue so
I'm<00:00:41.790> sure<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.149> probably<00:00:42.719> worse<00:00:43.079> then<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
I'm sure it's probably worse then the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.700 
I'm sure it's probably worse then the
second<00:00:44.520> tier<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.850> now<00:00:45.030> battle<00:00:45.570> master<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.230> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
second tier is now battle master and you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
second tier is now battle master and you
can<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.940> regular<00:00:48.149> warzone

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
can get these with just regular warzone

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.779 
can get these with just regular warzone
commendations<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.489> get<00:00:50.640> these

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
commendations and you get these

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.970 
commendations and you get these
combinations<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.840> doing<00:00:51.960> regular<00:00:52.379> war

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
combinations by just doing regular war

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.430 
combinations by just doing regular war
zones<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.699> then<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.930> purchase<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
zones and then you can purchase this

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.010 
zones and then you can purchase this
gear<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.370> gear<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.360> same<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
gear so this gear is the same as the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.430 
gear so this gear is the same as the
battle<00:00:58.379> master<00:00:58.530> gear<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.300> 1.1<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.870> any<00:01:01.170> patch

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
battle master gear in 1.1 and any patch

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.500 
battle master gear in 1.1 and any patch
before<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.030> still<00:01:03.210> better<00:01:03.390> than

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
before that so it's still better than

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.070 
before that so it's still better than
the<00:01:03.840> champion<00:01:04.439> gear<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.510> still<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.780> get

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the champion gear and still get to get

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.890 
the champion gear and still get to get
at<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:08.070> anyways<00:01:08.580> moving<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.270> final

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
at but anyways moving on to the final

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.770 
at but anyways moving on to the final
tier<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> war<00:01:10.740> hero<00:01:11.270> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.600> these

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
tier which is war hero you can get these

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.270 
tier which is war hero you can get these
by<00:01:13.729> obtaining<00:01:15.229> ranked<00:01:16.229> warzone<00:01:16.590> combinations

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
