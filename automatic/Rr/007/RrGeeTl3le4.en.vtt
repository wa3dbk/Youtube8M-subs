00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.369 

I<00:00:43.010> knew<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.120> were<00:00:44.269> going<00:00:44.480> to<00:00:44.629> be<00:00:44.750> a<00:00:44.780> fucking

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
I knew you were going to be a fucking

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.560

problem<00:00:45.920> it's<00:00:46.339> been<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.579> year<00:00:46.670> since<00:00:47.000> we<00:00:47.390> last

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
problem it's been a year since we last

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.959 
problem it's been a year since we last
saw<00:00:47.929> Clementine<00:00:48.559> which<00:00:48.920> is<00:00:49.250> good<00:00:49.550> because<00:00:49.789> I

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
saw Clementine which is good because I

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.029 
saw Clementine which is good because I
think<00:00:50.030> we<00:00:50.449> all<00:00:50.480> needed<00:00:51.109> that<00:00:51.260> time<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.559> recover

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
think we all needed that time to recover

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.369 
think we all needed that time to recover
if<00:00:52.850> season<00:00:53.239> one<00:00:53.359> proved<00:00:53.629> anything<00:00:53.809> it's<00:00:54.260> that

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
if season one proved anything it's that

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.649 
if season one proved anything it's that
