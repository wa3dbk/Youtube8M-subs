00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:09.650
 hello friends for a long time did not shoot a video 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.849
 somehow I do not have time fully Affairs 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.890
 the computer did not turn on already 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:20.630
 a few weeks is not enough for you 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.359
 In my work, I think this will be more frequent in the winter 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.750
 Well, as always on Dr. Brown 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.230
 My name is Vladimir today I want 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.660
 show one thing got yourself on 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.719
 the expanses of the internet will not speak 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.960
 no one should have thought I would find without problems 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.500
 where to buy such a thing and they are full of all sorts 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.260
 different modifications modifications but i 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.570
 show exactly this one 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.600
 this thing i'm shooting it like that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.500
 manual monopod to shoot 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 yourself beloved your talk and now his 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.710
 I will show in detail how it looks and what 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.250
 he liked me so much thing 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.720
 really entertaining and comfortable now 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.930
 show closer how it looks like this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.369
 Looks like this thing 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:24.229
 weighs very little I would think so 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.500
 less than 200 grams no grams 100 150 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.479
 maximum means it is a comfortable neoprene 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.880
 the pen can be used straight like this 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.689
 here is not laying out that I still immediately 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.000
 I liked it that here such 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.560
 here is the head is separately screwed 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.380
 Tripod head altogether will crown 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.420
 the handle just here such here a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.369
 here's a bolt and an underground nut which 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 not even on the deep thread allows it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.180
 screw means tripod heads these 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.140
 there are separately sold in this 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:07.759
 case it all went in the kit and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.360
 sold together this head allows 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.360
 turn the camera 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.520
 this monopod quota itself so here 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 decomposed has a length of little 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:27.350
 less than a meter I think about 90 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.390
 centimeters here and so he looks and 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.430
 It has such a gap that is to me 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.410
 did not immediately like it I thought it was 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.780
 probably marriage because it's all like this 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.570
 hat actually everything turned out 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.730
 much easier it is made easy 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.700
 by turning all these details are fixed and 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.910
 there is no backlash anymore 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.430
 it is necessary to fold back and turn it all 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.370
 the only thing that comes together again is easy 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.170
 inconvenience this happens so if all u 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.810
 we are folded we start to fasten 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.180
 the camera is all fixed there and after 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.090
 this is already problematic it's all released 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.720
 in fact it all pulled out 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.630
 pretty easy to turn and everything 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.490
 and fixed in that position 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:19.820
 the design becomes pretty 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:25.910
 tough is it all inexpensive order 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.370
 In my 300 rubles I will not 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.770
 now lie but about that somewhere around 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.770
 10 dollars all this construction costs 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.640
 so why does this look like a tripod 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.750
 head allows you to turn the camera on 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.330
 yourself there is such a cog lamb such 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.570
 movable itself it is made of aluminum 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.150
 in general it is all aluminum construction 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.670
 this lamb is turning the head 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.959
 as we want including this propyl 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.959
 allows and rotated 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.660
 that is, you can fix it like this 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.800
 such a corner screw the camera here 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.410
 shoot shoot yourself also with this 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.709
 is a plus this here this so cho 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.840
 he is screwed in here 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.500
 metal thing she 's mine too 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 made of aluminum and ordinary here 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.160
 tripod carving 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.400
 that is, if you take another small tripod 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.940
 here it can be screwed 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.040
 vertically this whole structure 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.790
 using a tripod or put on a tripod 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.250
 lengthening all the tripod height that is 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.870
 make it taller 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:49.280
 what is the usual tripod carving 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:53.010
 plus plus of course is plus a 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.419
 Also this lanyard can be unscrewed 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.260
 this item 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.470
 screw the love camera and make 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.840
 countryman 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.400
 on the camera if one of the holes 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.540
 There is no well, and here is such 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.430
 here is a small but useful thing 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.560
 a lot of space does not take you can put in 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.750
 pocket backpack handbag in some kind 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:22.320
 small for everyday wear 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.330
