 Hello, I want to show you Centrifuge. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 An open-source platform for real-time message broadcasting in your web applications. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Here's the documentation for detail information. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 Let's run centrifuge. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 We should run database first. Here I am launching MongoDB, but you can use PostgreSQL too 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Then run Centrifuge instance and go to http: // localhost: 8000 (default) 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 This is an administrative web interface. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Now let's send the event to the Centrifuge using the terminal client. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 After sending 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Now let's test Centrifuge with external application. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 We run example app from Centrifuge repository - page with text input, displaying all messages coming. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Type something ... say "Hello". Click here to see what we just sent, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Now open another tab to see broadcasting. Type something again. And look - both tabs received new message. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Try again - it works! 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Go back to admin web interface. Here we see those three messages in "programming" project. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Please read the documentation and try it yourself. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Feedback is very appreciated, just email me - frvzmb@gmail.com. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Source code can be found on Github. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Thanks for your time. Good luck!
