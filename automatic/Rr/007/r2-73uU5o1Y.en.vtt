00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.900
 I know we 're in the winter more. 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.510
 this does not mean that our skin does not 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.430
 can look more beautiful but the light and 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.110

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.570
 I love passion in any way 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.369
 beauty that is the bronzer and the illuminator 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.989
 there are some neighbors tricks to 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.210
 The right way to apply I'm going to tell you everything 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.970
 for you in this video because the fine 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.130
 just released the hd powders that they are 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.530
 they are very thin with 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.140
 particles and has the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.690
 sunscreen and illuminator beyond 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.550
 that it is translucent and that it 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.399
 Can be used over your makeup 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.230
 but today we will focus on a beach skin 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.510
 a beautiful and well-cared skin that we 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.550
 You need not to be exposed to the sun 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.230
 this super beautiful and radiant effect 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.300
 then you already separates your bronze the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.280
 illuminators and some brushes with 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.960
 an application tip then to apply 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.230
 the bronze we will use the brush of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.970
 blush number 9 that he is anatomically 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.490
 perfect for doing this the illuminator to 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.950
 people have two forms both the brush 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.570
 number 11 which is that of fiber that is well 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.270
 soft and leaves a perfect finish 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.189
 like the corrective brush that is the 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.200
 number five detail brush to 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.090
 you apply in smaller neighbor regions 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 and start and we already left the skin 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.560
 ready then I used the basilica today 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.290
 mate with a number 12 brush that the flash 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 top kabuki to do the polishing and 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.119
 also apply a little 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.399
 with number 5 and finally 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.159
 where do people apply the 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:45.399
 tanner thinks you're on the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.189
 beach enjoying that sun where it hits 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.610
 the sun when you are standing thus 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.530
 on the top of the nose tips 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.939
 apples, that's when we apply a 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.680
 sunscreen to have an effect well 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.079
 natural and a pack that cool people 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.759
 I'll prepare you this touch lipstick that 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.579
 this packaging that opens and closes for 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.170
 avoid the waste then for you to use 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.710
 The right amount only gives you some 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.030
 tapping on the lid even 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.120
 small amount 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.650
 and as this polga of it is thin it is 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.960
 super pigmented advice that you 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.090
 start slowly and then you go 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.950
 testing the quantity then so smile 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.530
 The sun is beating here I'm already 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.380
 imagining on the beach so we do 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.740
 movements 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.540
 Here apples clÃ³vis accommodate a 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.480
 little things we do the same thing as 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.150
 other hand and the hand light people holding 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.100
 here for the tip of the brush help 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.410
 you have more delicacy to apply 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.780
 these circular motions give more 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.030
 uniformity for your result now 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.130
 on the top of the forehead 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.140
 we are very close to the root of the 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.260
 hair and going down here 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.980
 side with the tapping sky 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.950
 start applying people here at the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.840
 nose without reaching the tip 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.030
 so as not to run the risk of having a 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.990
 flat nose then we apply 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.290
 right up here and I'll be brunette 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.100
 bet on without ruining tees that the best 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.900
 part 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.930
 and if you want you can give a brush stroke 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.210
 here at the tip of the chin to create 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.670
 a harmony with the rest and 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.590
 other than blush the sunscreen when 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.540
 Do you want to be made more beach? 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.070
 you can bring even a little more 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.440
 inside 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.140
 and so does that coradinho of whom 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.060
 take a little sun and everything is fine 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.160
 uniform and not so marked 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.840
 Now I'll show you how to do the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.760
 finish with the illuminator because 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.160
 using the two people the result is 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.980
 more beautiful and more natural also the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.200
 illuminator people he highlights highlight 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.250
 that as you move from that goal 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.650
 pretty 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.800
 so I'll start by applying it to the temples 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.410
 actually so above the apple of the face 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.140
 here topic in fiber convinced him 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.590
 also comes from the side it skirts 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.090
 here eye eyebrow and comes in the region 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.950
 of the temples 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.500
 you can make circular or 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.200
 even use a smaller brush the same thing 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.900
 on the other side now we can 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.120
 applying the tip of the nose is a trick 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.730
 much used in editorials and 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.500
 parades because it gives an up knows how to 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.709
 so that beautiful skin with visa 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.270
 wonderful skin and yes over the 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.290
 brother that we passed on the chin that 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.170
 it was optional 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.790
 We can give a lit up more or 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.190
 only pass them I wanted was 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.930
 a little retracted and the ground 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.130
 to emphasize and with filling of 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.460
 tapioca, I'm going to give some 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.229
 beating in the same batter 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.780
 because it also has the possibility of 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.699
 use the illuminator instead of the blush case 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.600
 you were more basic than just giving a 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.490
 up right 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.380
 another tip is you make the 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.199
 look corner I'm using the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.940
 corrective brush that is number five 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.280
 You can also use your little finger. 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.520
 pinky to do this and for us 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.650
 finish our look with a touch too 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.419
 especially we apply a little bit of 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.310
 gloss 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.169
 I chose the colorless but it can also be 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:11.289
 a nude little goliath 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:13.750
 and now we are going to be an illuminator with 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.000
 little beats in the center of the lips 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.280
 seen only today we had this tip that 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.470
 You asked a lot about sunscreen. 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.720
 and illuminators people are not afraid of 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.050
 use can use the whole year I think 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.639
 more and more natural skin and more 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.490
 radiant is being used because 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.139
 just that beautiful skin effect 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.449
 healthy skin 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.340
 the effect of eternal youth that people 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.830
 both likes and is a way for you 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.599
 complementing your makeup is 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.409

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.570
