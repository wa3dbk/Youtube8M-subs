colors<00:00:13.280> perform<00:00:13.910> just<00:00:14.120> like<00:00:14.240> conventional

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599

colors perform just like conventional
oil<00:00:15.019> colors<00:00:15.349> except<00:00:15.679> you<00:00:15.740> can<00:00:15.860> use<00:00:15.980> water<00:00:16.279> to

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
oil colors except you can use water to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.670 
oil colors except you can use water to
clean<00:00:16.760> them<00:00:16.940> up<00:00:17.060> the<00:00:17.690> reason<00:00:17.869> you<00:00:18.140> can<00:00:18.289> do<00:00:18.470> that

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
clean them up the reason you can do that

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.290 
clean them up the reason you can do that
is<00:00:18.830> because<00:00:18.980> it's<00:00:19.250> been<00:00:19.369> chemically<00:00:19.730> modified

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
is because it's been chemically modified

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.790 
is because it's been chemically modified
to<00:00:20.539> be<00:00:20.630> able<00:00:20.750> to<00:00:20.840> accept<00:00:21.170> the<00:00:21.350> water<00:00:21.529> for

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
to be able to accept the water for

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.680 
to be able to accept the water for
cleanup<00:00:21.980> it's<00:00:22.520> still<00:00:22.880> in<00:00:23.180> these<00:00:23.390> tubes<00:00:23.570> of

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
cleanup it's still in these tubes of

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.930 
cleanup it's still in these tubes of
paint<00:00:23.720> just<00:00:23.990> pigment<00:00:24.440> and<00:00:24.529> linseed<00:00:25.310> oil<00:00:25.430> so

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
paint just pigment and linseed oil so

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.010 
paint just pigment and linseed oil so
you<00:00:26.000> can<00:00:26.180> still<00:00:26.420> go<00:00:26.510> through<00:00:26.720> all<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
you can still go through all the

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.330 
you can still go through all the
techniques<00:00:27.439> that<00:00:27.560> you<00:00:27.650> normally<00:00:28.070> would<00:00:28.189> but

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
techniques that you normally would but

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.560 
techniques that you normally would but
the<00:00:28.430> great<00:00:28.580> thing<00:00:28.760> about<00:00:28.850> it<00:00:29.180> is<00:00:29.300> if<00:00:29.449> you<00:00:29.539> have

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
the great thing about it is if you have

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.480 
the great thing about it is if you have
some<00:00:29.840> sort<00:00:29.960> of<00:00:30.109> sensitivity<00:00:30.529> to<00:00:30.800> solvents<00:00:31.310> or

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
some sort of sensitivity to solvents or

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.069 
some sort of sensitivity to solvents or
you<00:00:31.609> just<00:00:31.760> want<00:00:31.970> the<00:00:32.059> ease<00:00:32.210> of<00:00:32.239> cleanup<00:00:32.750> or

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
you just want the ease of cleanup or

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.170 
you just want the ease of cleanup or
like<00:00:33.920> myself<00:00:34.280> I<00:00:34.399> go<00:00:34.520> out<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.760> paint<00:00:35.000> in

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
like myself I go out and paint in

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.670 
like myself I go out and paint in
landscape<00:00:35.660> sometimes<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.140> don't<00:00:36.200> have<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.530> take

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
landscape sometimes I don't have to take

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.130 
landscape sometimes I don't have to take
solvent<00:00:37.100> with<00:00:37.280> me<00:00:37.520> this<00:00:38.000> is<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.180> great<00:00:38.480> way<00:00:38.870> to

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
solvent with me this is a great way to

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.500 
solvent with me this is a great way to
go<00:00:39.440> void<00:00:39.710> that<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.280> move<00:00:40.880> forward<00:00:40.910> with<00:00:41.270> your

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
go void that and move forward with your

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.660 
go void that and move forward with your
oil<00:00:41.540> painting<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:42.230> they<00:00:42.829> also<00:00:43.070> dry<00:00:43.370> by

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
oil painting and they also dry by

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.400 
oil painting and they also dry by
oxidation<00:00:44.180> just<00:00:44.630> like<00:00:44.780> conventional<00:00:45.020> oil

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
oxidation just like conventional oil

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.260 
oxidation just like conventional oil
colors<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:46.190> means<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.879> paint<00:00:47.090> needs

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
colors that means that the paint needs

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.750 
colors that means that the paint needs
to<00:00:47.540> come<00:00:47.719> into<00:00:48.050> contact<00:00:48.260> with<00:00:48.620> air<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.520> lock

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
to come into contact with air to lock

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.940 
to come into contact with air to lock
into<00:00:49.969> place<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.540> form<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.899> stable<00:00:51.140> paint<00:00:51.590> film

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
into place and form a stable paint film

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.830 
into place and form a stable paint film
so<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.730> want<00:00:52.969> to<00:00:53.030> make<00:00:53.149> sure<00:00:53.360> that<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:53.690> don't

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
so you want to make sure that you don't

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.069 
so you want to make sure that you don't
thin<00:00:54.230> out<00:00:54.410> your<00:00:55.000> paint<00:00:56.000> with<00:00:56.329> too<00:00:56.600> much<00:00:56.780> water

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
thin out your paint with too much water

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.900 
thin out your paint with too much water
or<00:00:57.350> too<00:00:57.530> much<00:00:57.649> thinner<00:00:58.010> because<00:00:58.640> it's<00:00:58.820> going

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
or too much thinner because it's going

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.670 
or too much thinner because it's going
to<00:00:58.969> separate<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.539> pigment<00:00:59.930> they're<00:01:00.110> too<00:01:00.469> far

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
to separate the pigment they're too far

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.500 
to separate the pigment they're too far
apart<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.399> can<00:01:01.430> lead<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.969> cracking<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
apart and you can lead to cracking and

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.389 
apart and you can lead to cracking and
instability<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.620> same<00:01:03.860> way<00:01:04.039> you<00:01:04.339> don't

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
instability in the same way you don't

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:05.709 
instability in the same way you don't
want<00:01:04.609> to<00:01:04.670> add<00:01:04.759> too<00:01:04.909> much<00:01:04.999> oil<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.569> mix

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
want to add too much oil to the mix

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.809 
want to add too much oil to the mix
either<00:01:05.899> too<00:01:06.560> much<00:01:06.590> oil<00:01:06.950> in<00:01:07.219> your<00:01:07.340> mediums<00:01:07.700> is

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:07.819 
either too much oil in your mediums is

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:09.699 
either too much oil in your mediums is
going<00:01:07.999> to<00:01:08.060> cause<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.389> paint<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.689> bind<00:01:08.959> up<00:01:09.200> what

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:09.709 
going to cause the paint to bind up what

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.169 
going to cause the paint to bind up what
we<00:01:09.799> call<00:01:09.920> alligatoring<00:01:10.549> it's<00:01:10.819> also<00:01:10.939> not

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
we call alligatoring it's also not

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:12.249 
we call alligatoring it's also not
stable<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:11.689> it<00:01:11.779> doesn't<00:01:11.990> look<00:01:12.079> too<00:01:12.229> good

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
stable and it doesn't look too good

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.690 
stable and it doesn't look too good
either<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:12.889> you<00:01:12.979> want<00:01:13.130> to<00:01:13.189> be<00:01:13.249> careful<00:01:13.459> with

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
either so you want to be careful with

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.050 
either so you want to be careful with
that

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.149 
that
now<00:01:14.450> there's<00:01:14.630> 11<00:01:14.899> mediums<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:15.319> the<00:01:15.380> range<00:01:15.590> two

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
now there's 11 mediums in the range two

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.289 
now there's 11 mediums in the range two
of<00:01:16.279> them<00:01:16.369> I<00:01:16.429> have<00:01:16.579> here<00:01:16.729> though<00:01:16.939> are<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.149> more

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
of them I have here though are the more

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.899 
of them I have here though are the more
popular<00:01:17.689> ones<00:01:17.869> linseed<00:01:18.619> oil<00:01:18.709> and<00:01:18.950> stand<00:01:19.700> oil

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
popular ones linseed oil and stand oil

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:20.919 
popular ones linseed oil and stand oil
I'm<00:01:20.060> going<00:01:20.209> to<00:01:20.270> use<00:01:20.359> a<00:01:20.389> little<00:01:20.509> bit<00:01:20.569> of<00:01:20.719> sand

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
I'm going to use a little bit of sand

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.050 
I'm going to use a little bit of sand
oil<00:01:21.200> right<00:01:21.349> now<00:01:21.520> pour<00:01:22.520> some<00:01:22.670> of<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:22.819> on<00:01:22.969> the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
oil right now pour some of this on the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.269 
oil right now pour some of this on the
pallet<00:01:23.479> it's<00:01:24.469> got<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.619> very<00:01:24.740> honey-like

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
pallet it's got a very honey-like

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.879 
pallet it's got a very honey-like
consistency<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:26.179> like<00:01:26.749> stand<00:01:27.079> on<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:27.829> a

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
consistency I like stand on it's a

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.099 
consistency I like stand on it's a
little<00:01:28.039> bit<00:01:28.279> more<00:01:28.689> yellowing<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.840> Moline

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
little bit more yellowing the Moline

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.319 
little bit more yellowing the Moline
seed<00:01:30.319> oil<00:01:30.469> both<00:01:30.979> will<00:01:31.310> provide<00:01:31.549> a<00:01:31.609> gloss<00:01:31.909> and

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
seed oil both will provide a gloss and

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.089 
seed oil both will provide a gloss and
both<00:01:32.509> will<00:01:32.689> improve<00:01:32.990> flow<00:01:33.319> I'm<00:01:33.829> going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.009> take

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:34.099 
both will improve flow I'm going to take

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:38.800 
both will improve flow I'm going to take
a<00:01:34.130> little<00:01:34.310> bit<00:01:34.490> of<00:01:34.579> the<00:01:35.529> ultramarine<00:01:36.529> here<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
a little bit of the ultramarine here and

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.169 
a little bit of the ultramarine here and
you<00:01:38.929> want<00:01:39.109> to<00:01:39.169> use<00:01:39.319> only<00:01:39.950> as<00:01:40.130> much<00:01:40.369> oil<00:01:40.609> as<00:01:41.149> you

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
you want to use only as much oil as you

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.730 
you want to use only as much oil as you
need<00:01:41.450> only<00:01:41.689> as<00:01:41.810> much<00:01:41.929> medium<00:01:42.349> as<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.529> need<00:01:42.649> to

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
need only as much medium as you need to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.649 
need only as much medium as you need to
get<00:01:42.859> the<00:01:42.950> paint<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:43.279> flow<00:01:43.520> again<00:01:44.179> you<00:01:44.389> don't<00:01:44.479> to

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
get the paint to flow again you don't to

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.979 
get the paint to flow again you don't to
use<00:01:44.689> too<00:01:44.929> much<00:01:46.119> now<00:01:47.119> look<00:01:47.270> at<00:01:47.359> that<00:01:47.389> it<00:01:47.599> just<00:01:47.630> it

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:47.989 
use too much now look at that it just it

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:49.510 
use too much now look at that it just it
really<00:01:48.289> gets<00:01:48.469> it<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.679> flow<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.219> it's<00:01:49.340> got<00:01:49.489> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
really gets it to flow but it's got a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.659 
really gets it to flow but it's got a
nice<00:01:50.109> nice<00:01:51.109> feel<00:01:51.439> to<00:01:51.469> it<00:01:51.709> the<00:01:52.189> brushstrokes

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:52.669 
nice nice feel to it the brushstrokes

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:54.489 
nice nice feel to it the brushstrokes
level<00:01:53.060> nicely<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:53.749> if<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.899> want<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.139> use<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.380> for

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
level nicely so if I want to use it for

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.109 
level nicely so if I want to use it for
glazing<00:01:54.799> that's<00:01:55.189> that's<00:01:55.459> wonderful<00:01:55.729> that's

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
glazing that's that's wonderful that's

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.190 
glazing that's that's wonderful that's
one<00:01:56.239> of<00:01:56.329> the<00:01:56.389> things<00:01:56.569> I<00:01:56.689> always<00:01:56.809> liked<00:01:57.109> about

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
one of the things I always liked about

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.169 
one of the things I always liked about
is<00:01:57.529> just<00:01:57.739> a<00:01:57.889> kind<00:01:58.249> of<00:01:58.369> great<00:01:58.549> feel<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.909> you

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
is just a kind of great feel to you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.289 
is just a kind of great feel to you
really<00:01:59.389> need<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.599> feel<00:01:59.840> it<00:02:00.969> to<00:02:01.969> see<00:02:01.999> what's

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
really need to feel it to see what's

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.389 
really need to feel it to see what's
happening<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:03.020> I'm<00:02:03.139> going<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.319> take<00:02:03.529> water

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
happening and I'm going to take water

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.709 
happening and I'm going to take water
here<00:02:04.639> of<00:02:04.759> course<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.619> clean<00:02:06.619> that<00:02:06.799> up<00:02:07.719> all

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:08.719 
here of course and clean that up all

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.569 
here of course and clean that up all
right<00:02:08.899> wipe<00:02:09.200> off<00:02:09.379> my<00:02:09.409> paintbrush<00:02:10.039> a<00:02:10.369> little

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
right wipe off my paintbrush a little

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.729 
right wipe off my paintbrush a little
bit<00:02:10.700> more<00:02:10.939> and<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.569> can<00:02:11.719> do<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:11.930> now<00:02:12.260> also<00:02:12.409> have

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
bit more and I can do that now also have

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.770 
bit more and I can do that now also have
thinner<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.489> too<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:14.090> might<00:02:14.209> wonder<00:02:14.420> well

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
thinner here too you might wonder well

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.080 
thinner here too you might wonder well
why<00:02:15.290> would<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.620> need<00:02:15.739> an<00:02:16.129> artisan<00:02:16.730> thinner<00:02:16.969> or

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
why would I need an artisan thinner or

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.880 
why would I need an artisan thinner or
water<00:02:17.390> mixable<00:02:17.689> thinner<00:02:17.989> if<00:02:18.170> I've<00:02:18.319> got<00:02:18.680> water

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
water mixable thinner if I've got water

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.440 
water mixable thinner if I've got water
it<00:02:19.099> seems<00:02:19.250> does<00:02:19.459> not<00:02:19.579> make<00:02:19.730> any<00:02:19.879> sense<00:02:20.150> but

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
it seems does not make any sense but

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.300 
it seems does not make any sense but
there's<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> good<00:02:21.140> reason<00:02:21.170> for<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.560> water

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
there's a good reason for that water

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.650 
there's a good reason for that water
evaporates<00:02:22.969> more<00:02:23.299> koi

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
evaporates more koi

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.510 
evaporates more koi
then<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.290> thinner<00:02:24.500> does<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:25.220> you'll<00:02:25.340> have<00:02:25.460> a

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
then the thinner does so you'll have a

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.310 
then the thinner does so you'll have a
longer<00:02:25.880> open<00:02:26.150> working<00:02:26.570> time<00:02:26.780> with<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.080> and

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
longer open working time with that and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.500 
longer open working time with that and
also<00:02:27.710> what's<00:02:28.040> going<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.250> happen<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:28.790> when<00:02:29.420> you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
also what's going to happen is when you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.660 
also what's going to happen is when you
introduce<00:02:30.020> water<00:02:30.350> into<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> paint<00:02:31.370> film

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
introduce water into the paint film

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.090 
introduce water into the paint film
light<00:02:32.540> refracts<00:02:33.020> off<00:02:33.290> water<00:02:33.560> differently

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
light refracts off water differently

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.290 
light refracts off water differently
than<00:02:34.250> other<00:02:34.370> surfaces<00:02:34.940> and<00:02:35.030> what's<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.240> to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
than other surfaces and what's going to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.550 
than other surfaces and what's going to
happen<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:35.720> going<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.870> appear<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.170> little<00:02:36.410> bit

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
happen it's going to appear a little bit

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.890 
happen it's going to appear a little bit
lighter<00:02:36.980> than<00:02:37.730> straight<00:02:38.450> out<00:02:38.570> of<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.750> tube

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
lighter than straight out of the tube

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.750 
lighter than straight out of the tube
without<00:02:39.050> water<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.740> that<00:02:39.920> but<00:02:40.340> that's<00:02:40.430> okay

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
without water in that but that's okay

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760 
without water in that but that's okay
it's<00:02:41.540> going<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.810> evaporate<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.530> water<00:02:42.560> is

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
it's going to evaporate the water is

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:43.990 
it's going to evaporate the water is
going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.950> evaporate<00:02:43.130> from<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.550> paint<00:02:43.790> film

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
going to evaporate from the paint film

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.040 
going to evaporate from the paint film
in<00:02:44.090> about<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.300> week<00:02:44.480> or<00:02:44.630> two<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.900> going<00:02:44.990> to

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
in about a week or two and it's going to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.900 
in about a week or two and it's going to
return<00:02:45.350> back<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.890> its<00:02:46.040> normal<00:02:46.220> color<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.790> its

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
return back to its normal color and its

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.070 
return back to its normal color and its
normal<00:02:47.210> Sheen<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.600> don't<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.900> worry

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
normal Sheen so you don't have to worry

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.450 
normal Sheen so you don't have to worry
about<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.500> but<00:02:48.680> it's<00:02:48.770> just<00:02:48.860> something<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.340> be

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
about that but it's just something to be

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.820 
about that but it's just something to be
aware<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.270> we've<00:02:50.960> also<00:02:51.110> got<00:02:51.350> varnishes

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
aware of and we've also got varnishes

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.020 
aware of and we've also got varnishes
over<00:02:52.010> here<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.580> you<00:02:52.610> can<00:02:52.700> go<00:02:52.820> through<00:02:52.970> the

over here so you can go through the
whole<00:02:53.270> entire<00:02:53.570> process<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:54.200> painting<00:02:54.470> through

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
whole entire process of painting through

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.090 
whole entire process of painting through
varnishing<00:02:55.430> with<00:02:56.210> water<00:02:56.990> cleanup<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.560> we've

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
varnishing with water cleanup and we've

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.040 
varnishing with water cleanup and we've
got<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.580> matte<00:02:58.880> satin<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.810> gloss<00:03:00.020> finish

got a matte satin and a gloss finish

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.350 
got a matte satin and a gloss finish
over<00:03:00.620> there<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:00.950> you'll<00:03:01.250> notice<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.520> the
