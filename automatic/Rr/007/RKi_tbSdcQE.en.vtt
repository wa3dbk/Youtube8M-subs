00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
a unique way

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.420 
a unique way
this<00:00:17.810> patient<00:00:18.260> presented<00:00:18.410> with<00:00:18.769> two<00:00:18.920> large

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
this patient presented with two large

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.720 
this patient presented with two large
amalgams<00:00:20.150> on<00:00:20.449> 18<00:00:21.019> and<00:00:21.050> 19<00:00:21.680> that<00:00:22.220> required

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
amalgams on 18 and 19 that required

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.150 
amalgams on 18 and 19 that required
crowns<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.630> normally<00:00:24.410> if<00:00:24.710> you're<00:00:24.949> going<00:00:25.099> to

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
crowns and normally if you're going to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.979 
crowns and normally if you're going to
build<00:00:25.310> these<00:00:25.489> teeth<00:00:25.759> up<00:00:26.029> the<00:00:26.599> dentist<00:00:26.930> would

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
build these teeth up the dentist would

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.109 
build these teeth up the dentist would
take<00:00:27.169> the<00:00:27.320> amalgams<00:00:27.829> out<00:00:28.070> and<00:00:28.430> they<00:00:28.910> put

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
take the amalgams out and they put

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.700 
take the amalgams out and they put
matrix<00:00:29.570> bands<00:00:29.750> around<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.349> fill<00:00:30.529> those

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
matrix bands around it and fill those

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.350 
matrix bands around it and fill those
teeth<00:00:30.919> with<00:00:31.160> their<00:00:31.640> building<00:00:31.970> material

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
teeth with their building material

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.420 
teeth with their building material
instead<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.260> taking<00:00:33.589> the<00:00:33.680> whole<00:00:33.800> amalgam<00:00:34.309> out

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
instead of taking the whole amalgam out

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.040 
instead of taking the whole amalgam out
what<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.670> did<00:00:34.910> was<00:00:35.120> I<00:00:35.150> just<00:00:35.300> took<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.780> center

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
what I did was I just took the center

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.450 
what I did was I just took the center
portion<00:00:36.260> amalgam<00:00:36.800> out<00:00:36.890> leaving<00:00:37.220> the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
portion amalgam out leaving the

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.640 
portion amalgam out leaving the
interproximal<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.510> act<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:38.930> my<00:00:39.110> matrix

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
interproximal to act as my matrix

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.250 
interproximal to act as my matrix
instead<00:00:40.250> of<00:00:40.309> possibly<00:00:41.239> causing<00:00:41.750> bleeding<00:00:41.989> by

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
instead of possibly causing bleeding by

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.079 
instead of possibly causing bleeding by
taking<00:00:42.650> interproximal<00:00:43.460> out<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:43.940> putting

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
taking interproximal out and putting

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.360 
taking interproximal out and putting
matrix<00:00:44.510> bands<00:00:44.720> around<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.199> left<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:45.890> amalgam

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
matrix bands around I left the amalgam

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.729 
matrix bands around I left the amalgam
in<00:00:46.550> to<00:00:47.000> act<00:00:47.180> as<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.600> matrix<00:00:47.839> prior<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.500> forming

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
in to act as a matrix prior to forming

in to act as a matrix prior to forming
my<00:00:48.980> core<00:00:50.019> as<00:00:51.019> you<00:00:51.199> can<00:00:51.379> see<00:00:51.589> here<00:00:51.920> I'm<00:00:52.070> using

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
my core as you can see here I'm using

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.880 
my core as you can see here I'm using
cosmic<00:00:52.909> or<00:00:53.119> blue<00:00:53.449> blue<00:00:53.869> why<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:54.619> that<00:00:54.650> when<00:00:54.860> I

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
cosmic or blue blue why so that when I

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.740 
cosmic or blue blue why so that when I
prepped<00:00:55.220> this<00:00:55.430> tooth<00:00:55.640> I'm<00:00:55.820> able<00:00:56.089> to<00:00:56.180> see<00:00:56.420> where

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
prepped this tooth I'm able to see where

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.899 
prepped this tooth I'm able to see where
the<00:00:56.930> core<00:00:57.170> material<00:00:57.589> is<00:00:57.680> versus<00:00:58.159> a<00:00:58.189> tooth<00:00:58.489> if

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
the core material is versus a tooth if

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.429 
the core material is versus a tooth if
this<00:00:59.180> was<00:00:59.330> going<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.510> be<00:00:59.659> an<00:00:59.750> all<00:00:59.900> ceramic

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:00.439 
this was going to be an all ceramic

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.200 
this was going to be an all ceramic
crown<00:01:00.650> I<00:01:00.680> would<00:01:00.949> either<00:01:01.100> use<00:01:01.309> the<00:01:01.519> a2<00:01:01.699> or<00:01:02.119> the

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
crown I would either use the a2 or the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.270 
crown I would either use the a2 or the
white<00:01:02.449> cosmic<00:01:03.320> or<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:03.650> when<00:01:03.739> I'm<00:01:03.860> doing<00:01:04.159> a

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
white cosmic or but when I'm doing a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.820 
white cosmic or but when I'm doing a
metal<00:01:05.000> ceramic<00:01:05.510> crown<00:01:05.780> or<00:01:06.049> a<00:01:06.080> gold<00:01:06.350> crown<00:01:06.590> I'm

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
metal ceramic crown or a gold crown I'm

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.399 
metal ceramic crown or a gold crown I'm
going<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.040> use<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.369> blue<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.210> that<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:09.200> see

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
going to use the blue so that I can see

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.179 
going to use the blue so that I can see
where<00:01:09.619> my<00:01:09.650> prep<00:01:10.070> is<00:01:10.310> easier<00:01:11.180> than<00:01:11.390> having<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
where my prep is easier than having to

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.130 
where my prep is easier than having to
use<00:01:13.189> white<00:01:13.490> or<00:01:13.670> a2<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.420> what<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:14.960> can<00:01:15.110> see

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
use white or a2 and what you can see

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.440 
use white or a2 and what you can see
here<00:01:15.560> is<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.159> amalgams<00:01:16.700> are<00:01:16.820> still<00:01:17.060> in<00:01:17.180> place

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
here is the amalgams are still in place

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.929 
here is the amalgams are still in place
but<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:17.900> holding<00:01:18.320> my<00:01:18.500> core<00:01:18.830> material<00:01:19.400> so

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
but it's holding my core material so

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.639 
but it's holding my core material so
that<00:01:19.970> i<00:01:20.119> don't<00:01:20.360> have<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:20.960> matrix<00:01:21.350> band

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
that i don't have to have a matrix band

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.660 
that i don't have to have a matrix band
around<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:22.039> tooth

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
around the tooth

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
around the tooth
tooth<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.450> prepped<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> full<00:01:25.170> crown<00:01:25.470> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
tooth was prepped for a full crown and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.490 
tooth was prepped for a full crown and
the<00:01:26.400> amalgams<00:01:26.790> would<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.510> come<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.900> leaving

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the amalgams would just come out leaving

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.950 
the amalgams would just come out leaving
the<00:01:28.740> core<00:01:29.010> material<00:01:29.490> behind<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.510> an<00:01:30.690> easy

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the core material behind it's an easy

the core material behind it's an easy

technique if you don't have
