Donkey Kong this title as a two-player

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.729 
Donkey Kong this title as a two-player
mode<00:03:39.190> and<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:40.000> a<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.360> B<00:03:40.510> mode<00:03:40.780> B<00:03:41.230> mode<00:03:41.440> is<00:03:41.560> just

a<00:03:41.830> harder<00:03:42.160> version<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.670> regular<00:03:42.880> game<00:03:43.299> I

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
a harder version of the regular game I

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.570 
a harder version of the regular game I
think<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.260> original<00:03:44.440> Donkey<00:03:45.010> Kong<00:03:45.220> might<00:03:45.459> be

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
think the original Donkey Kong might be

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.250 
think the original Donkey Kong might be
the<00:03:45.700> most<00:03:45.850> famous<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.510> all<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.690> Donkey<00:03:47.080> Kong

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
the most famous of all the Donkey Kong

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.320 
the most famous of all the Donkey Kong
games<00:03:47.560> but<00:03:48.040> I<00:03:48.070> think<00:03:48.310> Donkey<00:03:48.580> Kong<00:03:48.760> jr.<00:03:48.970> might

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
games but I think Donkey Kong jr. might

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.150 
games but I think Donkey Kong jr. might
be<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.630> best<00:03:49.780> Donkey<00:03:50.200> Kong<00:03:50.380> game<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
be the best Donkey Kong game that the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.199 
be the best Donkey Kong game that the

NES had to offer

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.240 
NES had to offer
