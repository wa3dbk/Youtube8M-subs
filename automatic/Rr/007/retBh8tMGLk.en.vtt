00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
go ahead and place them in the opposite

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.260 
go ahead and place them in the opposite
direction<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.489> end<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
direction so you end up with a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:53.279 
direction so you end up with a
crisscross<00:00:45.600> look

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.169

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
should end up with something that looks

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.349 
should end up with something that looks
like<00:00:56.440> this<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.160> then<00:00:57.730> you<00:00:57.850> want<00:00:58.000> to<00:00:58.059> go<00:00:58.239> ahead
