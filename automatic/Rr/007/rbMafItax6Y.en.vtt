hello<00:00:04.410> I'm<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.250> quickly<00:00:05.790> demonstrate

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
hello I'm going to quickly demonstrate

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.110 
hello I'm going to quickly demonstrate
the<00:00:06.959> difference<00:00:07.410> between<00:00:07.499> the<00:00:08.400> original<00:00:08.490> we

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the difference between the original we

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.169 
the difference between the original we
move<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.980> even<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.879> the<00:00:12.030> one

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
move to you I even for that and the one

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.990 
move to you I even for that and the one
with<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.450> strip<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.040> know<00:00:14.549> you've<00:00:14.759> got<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
with the strip so you know you've got a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630 
with the strip so you know you've got a
bit<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.389> smoke<00:00:15.599> application<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.800> draw<00:00:17.550> around

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
bit of smoke application you draw around

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.880 
bit of smoke application you draw around
the<00:00:17.880> core<00:00:18.060> stuff<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.690> from<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.230> Pyo

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the core stuff that this from the Pyo

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.120 
the core stuff that this from the Pyo
website<00:00:20.930> but<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.050> used<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.560> points<00:00:22.980> with

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
website but it's used two points with

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.910 
website but it's used two points with
the<00:00:23.250> Wiimote<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.570> sometimes<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.500> line

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the Wiimote you sometimes get this line

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.540 
the Wiimote you sometimes get this line
in<00:00:26.820> between<00:00:26.940> the<00:00:27.480> context<00:00:27.900> where<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.130> buffers

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
in between the context where the buffers

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.100 
in between the context where the buffers
are<00:00:29.730> essentially<00:00:30.180> swapping<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.690> with<00:00:30.900> 30

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
are essentially swapping out with 30

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.229 
are essentially swapping out with 30
things<00:00:31.350> point<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.550> point<00:00:32.789> see<00:00:33.059> when

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
things point one this point see when

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
things point one this point see when
vice<00:00:33.420> versa<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:34.710> no<00:00:34.859> real<00:00:35.100> history<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
vice versa there's no real history of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.639 
vice versa there's no real history of
tracking<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.539> can<00:00:36.629> imagine<00:00:36.750> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
tracking and as you can imagine that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.979 
tracking and as you can imagine that
creates<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.129> sorts<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.489> problems<00:00:38.839> when<00:00:39.839> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
creates all sorts of problems when you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.639 
creates all sorts of problems when you
try<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.289> use<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> moss<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:42.649> intricate

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
try and use it in a moss and intricate

00:00:43.649 --> 00:01:06.940 
try and use it in a moss and intricate
or<00:00:43.829> clever<00:00:44.190> application<00:00:54.350> application

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.609 

you'll<00:01:07.759> see<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:08.990> don't<00:01:09.229> get<00:01:09.409> those

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
you'll see that you don't get those

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.609 
you'll see that you don't get those
cotton<00:01:09.920> at<00:01:10.070> all<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.030> events<00:01:11.899> are<00:01:12.289> completely

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
cotton at all the events are completely

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.029 
cotton at all the events are completely
separate<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:14.119> know<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:14.869> can<00:01:15.110> get<00:01:15.770> rough

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:16.039 
separate you know and you can get rough

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.419 
separate you know and you can get rough
actually<00:01:16.729> like<00:01:17.350> remember<00:01:18.350> where<00:01:19.009> you're<00:01:19.159> from

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
actually like remember where you're from

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.120 
actually like remember where you're from
and<00:01:19.909> what<00:01:19.969> you<00:01:20.149> do<00:01:20.920> pretty<00:01:21.920> good

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
and what you do pretty good

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.859 
and what you do pretty good
and<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:24.229> next<00:01:24.439> cool<00:01:24.740> thing<00:01:24.799> about<00:01:25.340> this

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
and the next cool thing about this

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.940 
and the next cool thing about this
application<00:01:26.869> is<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.479> often<00:01:30.289> generates

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
application is that it often generates

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.840 
application is that it often generates
you<00:01:31.819> standard<00:01:32.360> Windows<00:01:33.110> 7<00:01:33.619> touch<00:01:34.490> event

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
you standard Windows 7 touch event

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.080

unlike<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:35.750> other<00:01:35.869> one<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:37.219> can<00:01:37.490> launch

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
unlike the other one so you can launch

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.050 
unlike the other one so you can launch
all<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:39.099> things<00:01:40.099> from<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.429> like<00:01:40.580> soft<00:01:40.849> touch

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
all the things from the like soft touch

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:54.460 
all the things from the like soft touch
