00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:35.390 
once it's done most of the things it
needs<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.510> do<00:03:32.720> this<00:03:33.720> is<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.049> 32<00:03:34.470> bit<00:03:34.680> version

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
needs to do this is the 32 bit version

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.690 
needs to do this is the 32 bit version
of<00:03:35.670> Windows<00:03:36.060> or<00:03:36.810> sit<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.350> think<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.650> nod<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.280> don't

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
of Windows or sit I think it nod I don't

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.849 
of Windows or sit I think it nod I don't
actually<00:03:39.120> if<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.359> 64-bit<00:03:40.200> or<00:03:40.230> 32-bit<00:03:40.700> XP<00:03:42.859> but

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
actually if it's 64-bit or 32-bit XP but

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.080 
actually if it's 64-bit or 32-bit XP but
it's<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.400> come<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:44.730> my<00:03:44.880> dell

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
it's the one that come with my dell

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:52.800 
it's the one that come with my dell
anyway<00:03:45.480> so

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.330 

still<00:03:53.810> going<00:03:54.019> on<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:54.440> it's<00:03:54.620> starting

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
still going on that it's starting

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.580 
still going on that it's starting
windows<00:03:55.730> now<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:56.890> hopefully<00:03:57.890> touch<00:03:58.430> wood<00:03:59.590> it's

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
windows now so hopefully touch wood it's

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.960 
windows now so hopefully touch wood it's
formats<00:04:01.129> in<00:04:01.310> now<00:04:02.170> five<00:04:03.170> gigabytes<00:04:03.970> we

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
formats in now five gigabytes we

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.360 
formats in now five gigabytes we
shouldn't<00:04:05.330> really<00:04:05.510> take<00:04:05.810> long<00:04:06.069> but<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:07.190> can

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
shouldn't really take long but you can

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.710 
shouldn't really take long but you can
see<00:04:07.549> five<00:04:07.879> thousand<00:04:08.420> and<00:04:09.909> 106<00:04:10.909> well<00:04:11.360> that's

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
see five thousand and 106 well that's

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.020 
see five thousand and 106 well that's
pretty<00:04:11.900> fast<00:04:12.200> now<00:04:13.129> it's<00:04:13.280> just<00:04:13.370> setting<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.819> talk

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
pretty fast now it's just setting a talk

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:20.110 
pretty fast now it's just setting a talk
I<00:04:17.739> think<00:04:18.739> I'll<00:04:18.889> be<00:04:18.949> able<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.190> go<00:04:19.340> on<00:04:19.519> quite<00:04:20.090> a

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
I think I'll be able to go on quite a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.780 
I think I'll be able to go on quite a
while<00:04:20.329> without<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.750> serial<00:04:21.620> key<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:22.070> just<00:04:22.669> have

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
while without a serial key I just have

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.659 
while without a serial key I just have
to<00:04:22.880> get<00:04:22.970> on<00:04:23.150> from<00:04:23.360> somewhere<00:04:24.550> something<00:04:25.550> you

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
to get on from somewhere something you

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.730 
to get on from somewhere something you
can<00:04:25.820> use<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:26.120> for<00:04:26.210> 30<00:04:26.449> days<00:04:26.780> without<00:04:27.020> a<00:04:27.169> serial

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
can use it for 30 days without a serial

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.670 
can use it for 30 days without a serial
number<00:04:28.039> I've<00:04:28.400> done<00:04:28.639> it<00:04:28.760> before<00:04:28.789> so<00:04:29.410> I'm<00:04:30.410> sure

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
number I've done it before so I'm sure

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:39.910 
number I've done it before so I'm sure
of<00:04:30.860> it

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.790

is<00:04:57.310> touch<00:04:58.310> wood<00:04:58.660> working<00:04:59.890> it<00:05:00.890> went<00:05:01.340> through

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
is touch wood working it went through

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.770 
is touch wood working it went through
the<00:05:01.690> installation<00:05:02.690> progress<00:05:03.460> quite<00:05:04.460> simply

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
the installation progress quite simply

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:10.570 
the installation progress quite simply
no<00:05:05.780> problems<00:05:07.660> 36<00:05:08.660> minutes<00:05:08.990> approx<00:05:09.980> remaining

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
no problems 36 minutes approx remaining

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.300 
no problems 36 minutes approx remaining
so<00:05:10.880> i'll<00:05:11.060> just<00:05:11.090> do<00:05:11.330> the<00:05:11.420> same<00:05:11.630> again<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.310> pause

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
so i'll just do the same again and pause

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.680 
so i'll just do the same again and pause
it<00:05:13.580> about<00:05:15.070> 7-8<00:05:16.070> minutes<00:05:16.280> of<00:05:16.610> our<00:05:16.790> if<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:17.510> not

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
it about 7-8 minutes of our if it's not

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.960 
it about 7-8 minutes of our if it's not
done<00:05:17.720> by<00:05:18.020> then<00:05:18.230> oh<00:05:18.410> yeah<00:05:19.340> it's<00:05:19.520> looking<00:05:19.610> good

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
done by then oh yeah it's looking good

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.870 
done by then oh yeah it's looking good
it's<00:05:20.780> just<00:05:20.990> how<00:05:21.170> it<00:05:21.650> looks<00:05:22.580> when<00:05:22.760> you

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
it's just how it looks when you

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.310 
it's just how it looks when you
installed<00:05:23.270> on<00:05:23.420> a<00:05:23.450> Windows<00:05:24.080> computer<00:05:24.850> so

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
installed on a Windows computer so

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.380 
installed on a Windows computer so
hopefully<00:05:27.320> this<00:05:27.680> will<00:05:27.830> be<00:05:27.890> all<00:05:28.070> right<00:05:28.250> I<00:05:28.580> was

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
hopefully this will be all right I was

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.270 
hopefully this will be all right I was
going<00:05:29.630> to<00:05:29.690> do<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.840> Vista<00:05:30.320> dis<00:05:30.500> that<00:05:30.800> I've<00:05:30.920> got

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
going to do a Vista dis that I've got

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
going to do a Vista dis that I've got
for<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:32.150> families<00:05:33.140> of<00:05:33.260> the<00:05:33.380> computer<00:05:34.030> but<00:05:35.030> I

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
for the families of the computer but I

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.050 
for the families of the computer but I
couldn't<00:05:35.900> find<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.320> so<00:05:36.350> I<00:05:36.560> just<00:05:36.950> thought<00:05:37.130> an<00:05:37.670> XP

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
couldn't find it so I just thought an XP

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.780 
couldn't find it so I just thought an XP
is<00:05:38.120> more<00:05:38.330> stable<00:05:38.600> or<00:05:38.960> not<00:05:38.990> to<00:05:39.320> use<00:05:39.440> XP<00:05:39.890> a<00:05:40.130> lot

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
is more stable or not to use XP a lot

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.920 
is more stable or not to use XP a lot
better<00:05:40.940> than<00:05:41.210> I<00:05:41.300> do<00:05:41.480> vista<00:05:41.960> so<00:05:43.690> hope<00:05:44.690> you<00:05:44.840> can

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
better than I do vista so hope you can

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.050 
better than I do vista so hope you can
join<00:05:45.110> these<00:05:45.380> things<00:05:45.740> anyway<00:05:46.100> guys<00:05:46.370> these

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
join these things anyway guys these

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.620 
join these things anyway guys these
videos<00:05:49.930> so<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.260> is<00:05:51.290> just<00:05:51.590> installing
