00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
because of the different pattern

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.509 
because of the different pattern
movements<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.320> also<00:01:04.500> helps<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.010> focus<00:01:05.489> and

hemispheres<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> brain<00:01:11.420> intertwine<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
hemispheres of the brain intertwine so

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
hemispheres of the brain intertwine so
that<00:01:12.960> children<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.590> think<00:01:14.280> better<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> school
