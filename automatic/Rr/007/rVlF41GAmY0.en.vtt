00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.250
 welcome to workstation pro tv her 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.110
 program around the topic of workstations 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.139
 my name is thomas kÃ¼chler and me 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.539
 Show them the z book 17 g2 today 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.830
 the current mobile workstation series 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.980
 from hp with me at the top of the display 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 we see the webcam here right and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.689
 on the left there are microphones for one 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.510
 good stereo recordings and here in the edge 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.809
 The display hides two each 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 were and wlan antennas on this page 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.800
 and of course on the other side so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.129
 that we have a very good cover 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.110
 and reception quality 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.480
 however, the power switch is the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.090
 wlan an off switch and the new button 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.399
 for the speakers here is the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
 fingerprint reader and a generous 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.649
 touchpad what you get here by one 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.059
 either double-click or switch off 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.159
 Turning it on can also be an eye-opener 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.200
 the right side of the mobile workstation 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.840
 and the connections here in front is one 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.860
 memory card reader next to it the audio 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 combo socket two usb 3.0 inputs here 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.090
 is the dvd rom drive could be optional 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.729
 also be ordered a blu ray and 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.330
 here at the back of the vga exit a look 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.150
 on the left side of the device 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.700
 Here we see the security in the very back 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.619
 cable slot for attaching a 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.590
 kensington locks or similar 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.450
 we see the theft protection 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 Ventilation openings for the warm exhaust air 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.470
 from the cpu and the graphics card next to it 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 a usb 2.0 port a displayport 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.290
 was abo 2 port a usb 3.0 port with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.020
 charting function so load capacity of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 15 ampere charging current also in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920
 switched off state or im 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.960
 power saving mode 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 up here is a smart carport under 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.670
 including an expresscard port as well 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.579
 the back 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.469
 on the right is the power connector 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.800
 We use our configuration 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.220
 always the 230 watt power supply that enough 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.110
 performance supplies 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.530
 to the device even at the highest 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.410
 still be able to load requests and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.590
 on the other side is the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.240
 rj45 network connectu so up here with 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.580
 The battery is installed in all ours 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.440
 configurations we use the longlife 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.550
 rechargeable batteries at this point 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.130
 important tip from us 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.480
 if you are using the device in permanent mains operation 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.610
 you should use the battery 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.500
 take out because the battery by it 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.620
 is spared and its life itself 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.950
 considerably extended and as with all 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.290
 mobile workstations from hp can be 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.510
 even this device is completely tool-free 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.850
 just open from the back 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.370
 then we have a look inside us 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.620
 see here two expansion memory 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.560
 Slots two more are under the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.709
 keyboard and an overall configuration 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.140
 of 32 gigabytes it is possible here is that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.030
 z turbo drive used and every wlan 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.970
 adapter at this point can be 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.610
 optional a 3g or lte as were 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.740
 install adapter 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.660
 Here we see the two available 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.820
 disk slots would be another 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.800
 available when we expand the dvd and 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.580
 a corresponding adapter frame 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.709
 use 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.140
 the overall configuration under 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.130
 use of all slots of hard drives 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.940
 would then be a size of 32 5 terabytes 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.940
 enable 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.290
 and now we will have another look 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.959
 into the interior of this housing we have that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.310
 prepare the keyboard solved left 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.730
 is the video card here 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.230
 under it is the cpu we have two 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.330
 Primary ram slots already available 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.440
 are equipped with ram and here you can see 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.750
 the coolpix of cooling system all z 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.910
 books are very well processed they are 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.750
 robust and reliable and accordingly 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.209
 even the standards of the us military in 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.670
 Stress test they have proved that 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.760
 she is very resistant to extreme 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.860
 temperature fluctuations humidity 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.750
 falls and shaking are the z 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.310
 book 17 g2 offers a lot 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.290
 possibilities of individual 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.880
 For example, you can use configurations 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.400
 from six different graphics cards 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.820
 Select models between 2 and 8 gb 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.990
 ram and currently the most powerful 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.880
 cpu is the 74 1940 with 3.1 gigahertz 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.500
 of course, this model is also with 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.660
 the latest wlan and bluetooth 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.610
 technologies delivered ex factory 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.460
 there is a large amount of apple 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.500
 accessories for the z book series and me 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.870
 have now a little docking station 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.220
 brought with me something talking station 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.680
 a lot of connections on the left 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.990
 Let's start by looking at them 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.650
 here is an audio on an audio input 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:59.590
 an e sata entrance and here is one 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.479
 drive by built in where you have one 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.060
 can use another drive that 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.490
 can be a dvd or blu-ray drive or 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.800
 be burner but also another 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.130
 hard disk then, for example, a 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.410
 external backup would be possible and up 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.229
 on the right side we have four usb-3s 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.600
 0-interfaces and here at the front one more 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:22.539
 security cable slot for backup 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.400
 of the device against theft and on the 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.350
 back of the device we even have 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.789
 several options against the device 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.310
 to secure theft we have here 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.289
 security cable slots left and right 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.450
 and we have another one here 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.800
 Metal hanger where to make an extra 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.810
 lock can connect 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.260
 the available connections are here 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.270
 ps2 mouse connection a ps 2 keyboard 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.210
 connect a serial port 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.520
 parallel ports a vga output 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.960
 monitor support two dvi ports two 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.240
 Display ports in the middle are again 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.990
 two usb 2.0 interfaces 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.750
 connector and the first 45 connector and 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.639
 so simple it is the docking station with 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.979
 to use the 17 g2 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.110
 a big advantage in the use 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.229
 a docking station is that one 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.200
 can control external monitors with 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.930
 we have a hp here in this scenario 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.650
 Monitor stand with 2 24 inch displays 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.260
 built up 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.590
 Here you can see how fast the notebook is 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.060
 with the laptop starts up and how 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.380
 several displays simultaneously 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.090
 be controlled 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.710
 the possibilities are here 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.840
 variously we now have two 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.970
 external and the internal display we 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.500
 can have up to four external and that 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.300
 use internal display 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.760
 but we can also use the internal display 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.300
 turn off by closing and then until 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.650
 to use six external monitors 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.320
 and finally some interesting ones 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.880
 information we from workstation pro 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.530
 Make sure that they are exactly the same 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.660
 Get the hardware for your hardware 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.240
 ideally use 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.640
 and hp respects in the frame wsv 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.380
 Certification that the hardware 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.480
 they produce one hundred percent 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.820
 In addition, construction is compatible 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.820
 environment used software components 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:10.590
 the autodesk fell with catia solidworks 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:14.500
 or similar and dead in hp 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.540
 testing process, these devices will be 115,000 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.640
 for hours on her robustness her 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.500
 reliability tested that is 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.990
 display is opened and closed 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.350
 keys are pressed and the like 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.780
 the book 17 g2 is particularly suitable for 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.390
 high demands in engineering the 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.260
 graphic design multimedia applications and 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.360
 in education 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.730
 hp delivers its devices by default 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.670
 with a three-year cent in guarantee 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.680
 out and at workstation pro you can 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.050
 this to a five years on the spot 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.340
 expand service 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.040
 I still have the hint on our 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:51.570
 other videos i thank you for your 

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.570
 attention and say goodbye
