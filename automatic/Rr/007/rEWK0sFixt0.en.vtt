cleaner the fan blades can break or
sometimes<00:00:21.350> we're<00:00:21.590> down<00:00:21.830> get<00:00:22.160> chipped<00:00:22.490> if<00:00:22.730> that

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
sometimes we're down get chipped if that

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.460

so when it's not balanced because the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.790 
so when it's not balanced because the
chip<00:00:29.300> is<00:00:29.450> busted<00:00:29.900> off<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:30.440> going<00:00:30.620> to<00:00:30.680> be

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
have to get this fan off of the shaft

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.940 
have to get this fan off of the shaft
here<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.810> way<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:58.990> do<00:01:59.200> that<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.830> get

here and the way you do that is you get
a<00:02:00.010> pair<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.280> pliers<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.960> want<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.260> turn<00:02:02.440> it

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
a pair of pliers we want to turn it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.460 
a pair of pliers we want to turn it
clockwise<00:02:03.600> turn<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.690> shelf<00:02:04.930> while<00:02:05.229> holding

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
clockwise turn the shelf while holding

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.070 
clockwise turn the shelf while holding
the<00:02:05.680> fan<00:02:05.890> turn<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.310> clockwise<00:02:09.780> once<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.899> get

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
the fan turn it clockwise once you get

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.460 
the fan turn it clockwise once you get
it<00:02:11.200> loose<00:02:13.920> right<00:02:14.920> off<00:02:16.050> sometimes<00:02:17.050> it's<00:02:17.260> hard

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
it loose right off sometimes it's hard

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.320
