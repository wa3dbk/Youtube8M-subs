there and then you can swoop that back
to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> legs<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:38.940> their<00:00:39.410> kind

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
to the legs like that to get their kind

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.209 
to the legs like that to get their kind
of<00:00:40.469> silhouette<00:00:40.860> claws<00:00:41.960> tail<00:00:44.510> start<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:46.079> and

bring<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> line<00:00:50.760> around<00:00:51.270> there<00:00:53.600> you<00:00:54.600> want

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
bring that line around there you want

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.500 
bring that line around there you want
this<00:00:54.899> top<00:00:55.199> beat<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.920> snarl<00:00:56.510> downwards

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this top beat to kind of snarl downwards

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.479 
this top beat to kind of snarl downwards
a<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:58.980> flip

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
a little bit like that and then flip

a little bit like that and then flip
back<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.910> itself<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.570> then<00:01:00.660> their<00:01:00.809> bit

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
back on itself and then their bit

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.540 
back on itself and then their bit
Pelican<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:02.010> got<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.460> of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
straight eNOS there and let's put a line

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.870 
straight eNOS there and let's put a line
down<00:01:06.869> there<00:01:07.200> that's<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.890> his<00:01:08.040> top<00:01:08.340> eyelid

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
down there that's kind of his top eyelid

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.499 
down there that's kind of his top eyelid
and<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.240> making<00:01:09.450> him<00:01:09.689> look<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.080> fierce

and<00:01:15.530> then<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:17.850> sweep<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.930> round<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.439> these

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and then just sweep that round to these

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.260 
and then just sweep that round to these
claws<00:01:21.920> sweep<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.189> round<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.670> these<00:01:23.850> clothes

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
claws sweep that round to these clothes

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.880 
claws sweep that round to these clothes

to the corners there and then on the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.200 
to the corners there and then on the
side<00:01:34.510> you<00:01:34.930> can<00:01:35.229> draw<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.190> curve<00:01:36.610> around<00:01:36.820> there

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
side you can draw a curve around there

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.250 
side you can draw a curve around there

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
the bones in like that on this one here

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.710 
the bones in like that on this one here
that<00:01:48.130> will<00:01:48.610> flip<00:01:48.880> back<00:01:49.150> there<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:52.270> come<00:01:52.479> down

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
that will flip back there will come down

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.270 
that will flip back there will come down
there<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.190> flick<00:01:54.190> there<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.920> will<00:01:57.070> come

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
there and flick there that will come

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:08.100 
there and flick there that will come
