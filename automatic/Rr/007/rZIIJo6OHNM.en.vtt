v6<00:00:28.109> they're<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> same<00:00:30.050> sensors

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
v6 they're going to be the same sensors

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.860 
v6 they're going to be the same sensors
in<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.320> same<00:00:31.529> place<00:00:33.559> this<00:00:34.790> right<00:00:35.790> here<00:00:36.360> where

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
in the same place this right here where

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
in the same place this right here where
I'm<00:00:37.020> shining<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.530> light<00:00:37.739> on<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.899> connector

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
I'm shining the light on that connector

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
I'm shining the light on that connector
right<00:00:40.110> there<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> connector<00:00:41.430> that's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
right there that is a connector that's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.650 
right there that is a connector that's
plugging<00:00:42.090> into<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:43.789> camshaft<00:00:44.789> position

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
plugging into the camshaft position

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
plugging into the camshaft position
sensor<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.670> below<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:49.160> or<00:00:50.160> just

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sensor and then just below that or just

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.540 
sensor and then just below that or just
to<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> right<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:53.129> light<00:00:53.309> shining

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
to the right of that is a light shining

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.010 
to the right of that is a light shining
on<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> bolt<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.510> has<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> be

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
on that bolt right there has to be

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.459 
on that bolt right there has to be
removed<00:00:55.489> first<00:00:56.690> actually<00:00:57.690> second<00:00:58.140> first<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
removed first actually second first you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.549 
removed first actually second first you
have<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> disconnect<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.670> wire<00:01:00.559> harness

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
have to disconnect that wire harness

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.219 
have to disconnect that wire harness
then<00:01:02.070> take<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> bolt<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> have

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
then take out that bolt and now you have

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.840 
then take out that bolt and now you have
to<00:01:04.350> finagle<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:05.100> bit<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:05.640> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to finagle it a little bit but then that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
to finagle it a little bit but then that
cam<00:01:06.119> sensors<00:01:07.010> position<00:01:08.010> sensor<00:01:08.340> should<00:01:08.490> pop

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
cam sensors position sensor should pop

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.840 
cam sensors position sensor should pop
right<00:01:08.880> out<00:01:09.290> let's<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.530> now<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
right out let's do that now and that

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.750 
right out let's do that now and that
will<00:01:12.000> move<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:13.490> crankshaft<00:01:14.490> position

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
will move on to the crankshaft position

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.260 
will move on to the crankshaft position

sometimes once it stopped once it stalls
the<00:02:36.299> tachometer<00:02:37.299> will<00:02:37.659> start<00:02:37.840> going<00:02:37.989> crazy

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
the tachometer will start going crazy

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.679 
the tachometer will start going crazy
and<00:02:38.969> you<00:02:39.969> might<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.359> wait<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.540> while

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
and you might have to wait a while

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.259 
and you might have to wait a while
before<00:02:40.900> it'll<00:02:41.260> start<00:02:41.499> again<00:02:41.969> replacing<00:02:42.969> these

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
before it'll start again replacing these

before it'll start again replacing these
sensors<00:02:43.689> it's<00:02:44.530> either<00:02:44.709> going<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.889> be<00:02:44.980> one<00:02:45.159> of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
sensors it's either going to be one of

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.119 
sensors it's either going to be one of
the<00:02:45.340> two<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:46.599> this<00:02:46.659> case<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:47.169> believe<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.919> the

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
the two in this case I believe that the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.459 
the two in this case I believe that the
actual<00:02:48.609> crankshaft<00:02:49.359> position<00:02:49.569> sensor<00:02:49.900> which

actual crankshaft position sensor which
I<00:02:50.590> haven't<00:02:50.799> we're<00:02:51.340> going<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.549> get<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.909> next<00:02:52.269> may

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
I haven't we're going to get to next may

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.750 
I haven't we're going to get to next may
be<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.049> problem<00:02:53.260> it's<00:02:53.769> our<00:02:53.919> good<00:02:54.219> idea<00:02:54.549> to<00:02:54.639> go

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
be the problem it's our good idea to go

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.580 
be the problem it's our good idea to go
ahead<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.000> replace<00:02:55.209> both<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.689> them<00:02:55.810> this<00:02:56.349> one

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
ahead and replace both of them this one

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.449 
ahead and replace both of them this one
right<00:02:56.709> here<00:02:56.919> is<00:02:57.010> only<00:02:57.159> an<00:02:57.340> extra<00:02:57.639> twenty<00:02:58.090> bucks

crankshaft position sensor it's actually

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.600 
crankshaft position sensor it's actually
pretty<00:03:30.660> easy<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.900> get<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.319> probably<00:03:32.190> be<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> bad

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
pretty easy to get to probably be a bad

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.809 
pretty easy to get to probably be a bad
idea<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:33.120> put<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:34.290> Jeep<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:34.650> on<00:03:34.830> some<00:03:35.040> ramps<00:03:35.370> or

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
idea to put the Jeep up on some ramps or

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.930 
idea to put the Jeep up on some ramps or
maybe<00:03:36.030> even<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.600> jack<00:03:37.290> stand<00:03:37.610> but<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.640> think<00:03:38.880> I

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
maybe even a jack stand but I think I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.870 
maybe even a jack stand but I think I
can<00:03:39.060> get<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.420> one<00:03:39.540> just<00:03:39.780> fine<00:03:40.880> disconnect

take<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.390> off<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.020> put<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.750> new<00:04:54.900> one<00:04:55.080> in

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.610 

okay<00:05:03.080> here<00:05:04.080> is<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:05.870> crankshaft<00:05:06.870> position

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
okay here is the crankshaft position

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.870 
okay here is the crankshaft position
sensor<00:05:08.660> now<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.720> pulled<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.230> out<00:05:10.440> and<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:11.430> just

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
sensor now I pulled this out and it just

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.210 
sensor now I pulled this out and it just
it<00:05:12.120> looked<00:05:12.540> small<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.169> me<00:05:13.320> compared<00:05:14.100> to<00:05:14.160> the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
it looked small to me compared to the

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.220 
it looked small to me compared to the
one<00:05:14.460> that<00:05:14.639> I<00:05:14.780> had<00:05:15.780> purchased<00:05:16.290> earlier<00:05:18.230> but

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
one that I had purchased earlier but

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.510 
one that I had purchased earlier but
then<00:05:19.410> after<00:05:19.740> doing<00:05:19.919> a<00:05:20.190> side-by-side

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
then after doing a side-by-side

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.090 
then after doing a side-by-side
comparison<00:05:21.620> they<00:05:22.620> are<00:05:22.950> in<00:05:23.280> fact<00:05:24.169> identical<00:05:25.169> so

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
comparison they are in fact identical so

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.280 
comparison they are in fact identical so
we're<00:05:26.820> going<00:05:27.030> to<00:05:27.090> lube<00:05:27.330> up<00:05:27.510> this<00:05:27.660> o-ring<00:05:28.110> which

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
we're going to lube up this o-ring which

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.470 
we're going to lube up this o-ring which
I<00:05:28.590> think<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:28.919> forgot<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.280> mention<00:05:29.400> with<00:05:30.330> the

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
I think I forgot to mention with the

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.210 
I think I forgot to mention with the
camshaft<00:05:31.139> position<00:05:31.230> sensor<00:05:31.830> we're<00:05:31.980> going<00:05:32.160> to

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
camshaft position sensor we're going to

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.550 
camshaft position sensor we're going to
lube<00:05:32.430> up<00:05:32.639> this<00:05:32.880> o-ring<00:05:33.120> right<00:05:33.510> here<00:05:33.840> with<00:05:34.530> some

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
lube up this o-ring right here with some

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.290 
lube up this o-ring right here with some
oil<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.250> then<00:05:36.860> put<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:37.950> back<00:05:38.100> in<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.580> hook<00:05:39.150> up

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
oil and then put it back in and hook up

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.090 
oil and then put it back in and hook up
the<00:05:39.450> battery<00:05:39.870> terminal<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.440> start<00:05:40.650> her<00:05:40.919> up

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
the battery terminal and start her up

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.450 
the battery terminal and start her up
and<00:05:41.960> I<00:05:42.960> guess<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:44.190> would<00:05:44.340> take<00:05:44.520> some<00:05:44.700> time

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
and I guess it would take some time

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.890 
and I guess it would take some time
driving<00:05:47.460> her<00:05:47.550> to<00:05:47.730> see<00:05:48.270> if<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:49.680> problem<00:05:50.280> has

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
driving her to see if the problem has

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.680 
driving her to see if the problem has
actually<00:05:51.900> fixed<00:05:52.290> itself<00:05:52.620> or<00:05:53.090> if<00:05:54.090> I<00:05:54.240> have<00:05:54.450> fixed

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
actually fixed itself or if I have fixed

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.530 
actually fixed itself or if I have fixed
the<00:05:54.810> problem<00:05:55.130> because<00:05:56.130> it<00:05:57.120> doesn't<00:05:57.419> always

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
the problem because it doesn't always

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.150 
the problem because it doesn't always
stall<00:05:57.870> out<00:05:58.080> like<00:05:58.260> I<00:05:58.350> said<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.650> cheap<00:05:58.830> drives

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
stall out like I said the cheap drives

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.070 
stall out like I said the cheap drives
fine<00:06:00.770> she<00:06:01.770> does<00:06:01.950> really<00:06:02.220> really<00:06:02.490> well<00:06:03.150> but

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
fine she does really really well but

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.590 
fine she does really really well but
every<00:06:04.290> now<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.590> again<00:06:05.120> and<00:06:06.120> this<00:06:06.300> is<00:06:06.450> my

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
every now and again and this is my

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.440 
every now and again and this is my
wife's<00:06:07.140> cheap<00:06:08.300> she<00:06:09.300> has<00:06:09.540> had<00:06:09.750> at<00:06:09.960> least<00:06:11.450> once

to<00:06:12.990> twice<00:06:13.140> a<00:06:13.260> day<00:06:13.650> it<00:06:14.400> stalled<00:06:14.790> out<00:06:14.970> on<00:06:15.180> her<00:06:15.590> and

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.060 
to twice a day it stalled out on her and
this<00:06:18.210> should<00:06:18.450> fix<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.810> problem<00:06:19.200> anyway

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070
