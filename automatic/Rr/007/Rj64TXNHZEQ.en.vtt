power meters you're doing that and check

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.550 
power meters you're doing that and check
your<00:01:43.060> heart<00:01:43.270> rate<00:01:43.330> it's<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.810> very<00:01:44.050> very<00:01:44.170> good

yes we did this is just a sample of the

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.080 
yes we did this is just a sample of the
different<00:01:53.649> ways<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:54.039> analyze<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> writer's

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
different ways we analyze a writer's

different ways we analyze a writer's
position<00:01:55.720> in<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.590> left<00:01:56.890> video<00:01:57.250> we<00:01:57.640> check<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
position in that left video we check the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.070 
position in that left video we check the
lower<00:01:58.240> leg<00:01:58.600> angle<00:01:59.490> we<00:02:00.490> check<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.569> upper<00:02:01.929> body

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
lower leg angle we check the upper body

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.199 
lower leg angle we check the upper body
angle<00:02:02.789> will<00:02:03.789> also<00:02:04.119> check<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:05.940> lower<00:02:06.940> leg

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
angle will also check the lower leg

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.180 
angle will also check the lower leg
angle<00:02:07.599> at<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.810> top<00:02:08.050> of<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.349> pedal<00:02:08.649> stroke<00:02:08.950> and

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
angle at the top of the pedal stroke and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.400 
angle at the top of the pedal stroke and
then<00:02:09.759> you'll<00:02:09.940> see<00:02:10.209> also<00:02:10.599> that<00:02:10.630> blue<00:02:11.110> line

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
then you'll see also that blue line

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.240

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
everybody's a little bit different how

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.110
