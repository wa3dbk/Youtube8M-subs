00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
spring cannot get here soon enough so I

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.709 
spring cannot get here soon enough so I
thought<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.099> today's<00:00:08.370> DIY<00:00:08.639> we<00:00:09.389> would<00:00:09.540> get<00:00:09.690> a

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
thought for today's DIY we would get a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.660 
thought for today's DIY we would get a
jump<00:00:10.050> start<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.530> mother<00:00:10.800> nature<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.370> make

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
jump start on mother nature and make

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.589 
jump start on mother nature and make
some<00:00:11.940> flowers

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
some flowers

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.200 
some flowers
but<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.080> any<00:00:13.440> flowers<00:00:14.009> giant<00:00:14.849> paper

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
but not just any flowers giant paper

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.349 
but not just any flowers giant paper
flowers<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.289> let's<00:00:16.529> get<00:00:16.680> started<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.369> love<00:00:17.910> this

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
flowers so let's get started I love this

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.540 
flowers so let's get started I love this
project<00:00:18.869> because<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> primary<00:00:19.560> material<00:00:20.400> is

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
project because the primary material is

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.300 
project because the primary material is
simple<00:00:21.090> inexpensive<00:00:21.619> colorful<00:00:22.619> construction

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
simple inexpensive colorful construction

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.310 
simple inexpensive colorful construction
paper<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> first<00:00:24.779> thing<00:00:24.960> we'll<00:00:25.080> need<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
paper so the first thing we'll need to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.900 
paper so the first thing we'll need to
do<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.830> create<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> template<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.789> our

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
do is to create a template for our

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.970 
do is to create a template for our
petals<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.960> way<00:00:28.080> we'll<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.830> by

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
petals and the way we'll do that is by

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400 
petals and the way we'll do that is by
taking<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.400> piece<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.789> cardstock<00:00:30.320> tracing<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
taking a piece of cardstock tracing a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.440 
taking a piece of cardstock tracing a
bowl<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> small<00:00:32.369> plate<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.969> create<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
bowl or a small plate to create the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.240 
bowl or a small plate to create the
upper<00:00:33.750> rounded<00:00:34.170> portion<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> petal<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
upper rounded portion of the petal and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490 
upper rounded portion of the petal and
then<00:00:35.760> take<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> ruler<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.690> create<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.230> sides

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
then take a ruler to create the sides

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
then take a ruler to create the sides
tapering<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> slightly<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> bottom<00:00:41.360> for

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
tapering it slightly at the bottom for

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
tapering it slightly at the bottom for
each<00:00:42.540> flower<00:00:42.870> you're<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> want<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
each flower you're going to want to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
each flower you're going to want to
repeat<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> shape<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.000> three<00:00:45.390> different

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
repeat the shape in three different

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.529 
repeat the shape in three different
sizes<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:47.280> next<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:47.760> we'll<00:00:47.910> need<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
sizes the next thing we'll need to do is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.020 
sizes the next thing we'll need to do is
to<00:00:48.780> trace<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.350> cut<00:00:49.410> out<00:00:49.710> our<00:00:49.739> petals<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
to trace and cut out our petals but to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.580 
to trace and cut out our petals but to
prevent<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:51.510> having<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.079> cut<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.379> each

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
prevent you from having to cut out each

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.470 
prevent you from having to cut out each
one<00:00:52.829> individually<00:00:53.190> we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> stack

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
one individually we're going to stack

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
one individually we're going to stack
two<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> three<00:00:55.140> sheets<00:00:55.440> together<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.100> time

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
two to three sheets together at a time

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.270 
two to three sheets together at a time
trace<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> template<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> top<00:00:58.230> one<00:00:58.559> clip

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
trace the template on the top one clip

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.160 
trace the template on the top one clip
the<00:00:59.460> stack<00:00:59.699> together<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.600> cut<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.930> out

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the stack together and then cut it out

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.319 
the stack together and then cut it out
the<00:01:01.829> clips<00:01:02.129> will<00:01:02.309> prevent<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.850> paper<00:01:03.059> from

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the clips will prevent the paper from

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
the clips will prevent the paper from
shifting<00:01:03.539> around<00:01:03.809> while<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.409> cut<00:01:05.060> for<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
shifting around while you cut for the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
shifting around while you cut for the
flower<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.659> creating<00:01:07.049> today<00:01:07.229> we're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
flower and creating today we're going to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
flower and creating today we're going to
need<00:01:08.189> five<00:01:08.640> large<00:01:09.030> petals<00:01:09.390> three<00:01:10.200> medium<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
need five large petals three medium and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.219 
need five large petals three medium and
three<00:01:11.250> small<00:01:11.640> once<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.810> petals<00:01:13.080> are

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
three small once your petals are

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
three small once your petals are
completely<00:01:13.680> cut<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:13.950> stack<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.030> according

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
completely cut out stack them according

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
completely cut out stack them according
to<00:01:15.479> size<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> cut<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to size and then we're going to cut a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
to size and then we're going to cut a
slit<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.970> center<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> tapered<00:01:19.200> bottom

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
slit in the center of the tapered bottom

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.530 
slit in the center of the tapered bottom
this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.340> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.759> allow<00:01:21.000> us<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.240> create

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
this is going to allow us to create

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
this is going to allow us to create
petals<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.200> are<00:01:22.350> three<00:01:22.680> dimensional<00:01:24.920> begin

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
petals that are three dimensional begin

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
petals that are three dimensional begin
with<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> largest<00:01:26.490> petals<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> take

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
with the largest petals and if you take

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
with the largest petals and if you take
the<00:01:27.900> paper<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.380> either<00:01:28.650> side<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> cut<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the paper on either side of the cut and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
the paper on either side of the cut and
gently<00:01:29.909> overlap<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.810> you'll<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
gently overlap it you'll see that the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
gently overlap it you'll see that the
petal<00:01:32.130> begins<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.640> sit<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.060> now<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.840> large

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
petal begins to sit up now the large

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.319 
petal begins to sit up now the large
petals<00:01:34.380> create<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.130> exterior<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.060> flower

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
petals create the exterior of the flower

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.810 
petals create the exterior of the flower
and<00:01:36.659> we<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.470> fairly<00:01:37.890> open<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
and we want them to be fairly open so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.460 
and we want them to be fairly open so
we're<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> overlap<00:01:39.869> them<00:01:40.079> gently

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
we're just going to overlap them gently

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.980 
we're just going to overlap them gently
and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.950> staple<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.700> place<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.750> ahead

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and then staple them in place go ahead

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
and then staple them in place go ahead

those in place

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.280 
those in place
and<00:01:57.159> then<00:01:57.820> for<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.090> smallest<00:01:58.420> size<00:01:58.780> we<00:01:59.140> want

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
and then for the smallest size we want

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.590 
and then for the smallest size we want
these<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.680> stand<00:01:59.979> up<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.250> tallest<00:02:00.700> of<00:02:00.820> all<00:02:00.970> so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600

overlap those two sides even more and

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.830 
overlap those two sides even more and
then<00:02:04.330> staple<00:02:04.810> them<00:02:04.930> together<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:07.630> we're

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
then staple them together now we're

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.480 
then staple them together now we're
going<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.050> begin<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.500> construct<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.220> flower

going to begin to construct the flower

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.400 
going to begin to construct the flower
and<00:02:09.789> we'll<00:02:10.090> move<00:02:10.209> back<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.899> large<00:02:11.110> size

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
and we'll move back to the large size

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.949 
and we'll move back to the large size
petals<00:02:11.950> we're<00:02:12.850> going<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.120> connect<00:02:13.480> these<00:02:13.690> by
