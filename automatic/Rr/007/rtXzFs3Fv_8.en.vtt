00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
come from because we have acidic blood

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.690 
come from because we have acidic blood
strong<00:01:32.469> water<00:01:32.649> acidic<00:01:33.130> blood<00:01:33.249> stream<00:01:33.520> but<00:01:33.640> we

strong water acidic blood stream but we
have<00:01:33.789> acidic<00:01:34.149> bodies<00:01:34.539> and<00:01:34.840> our<00:01:35.350> body<00:01:35.619> has<00:01:35.979> to

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
have acidic bodies and our body has to

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.300 
have acidic bodies and our body has to
have<00:01:36.460> an<00:01:36.670> alkaline<00:01:37.390> you<00:01:37.840> know<00:01:37.960> bass<00:01:38.920> blood

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
the screen there one of the blood

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.659 
the screen there one of the blood
analysis<00:03:44.229> is<00:03:44.409> that<00:03:44.620> we've<00:03:44.799> had<00:03:45.009> a<00:03:45.040> look<00:03:45.220> at<00:03:45.459> and

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
analysis is that we've had a look at and

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.999 
analysis is that we've had a look at and
it's<00:03:46.509> been<00:03:46.810> really<00:03:47.139> fascinating<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:47.919> I'm

it's been really fascinating and I'm
going<00:03:48.189> to<00:03:48.250> show<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.489> exactly<00:03:48.939> what<00:03:49.659> we<00:03:49.810> found

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
going to show you exactly what we found

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.689 
going to show you exactly what we found
as<00:03:50.199> well<00:03:50.319> as<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.500> video<00:03:50.739> of<00:03:52.650> my<00:03:53.650> blood<00:03:53.949> and<00:03:54.310> it's

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
as well as a video of my blood and it's

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.879 
as well as a video of my blood and it's
it's<00:03:55.000> kind<00:03:55.269> of<00:03:55.389> interesting<00:03:55.689> kind<00:03:56.290> of<00:03:56.379> scary

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
it's kind of interesting kind of scary

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.379 
it's kind of interesting kind of scary
but<00:03:57.340> it's<00:03:57.519> going<00:03:57.639> to<00:03:57.729> be<00:03:57.819> good<00:03:57.970> to<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.150> able<00:03:58.329> to

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
but it's going to be good to be able to

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.770 
but it's going to be good to be able to
clean<00:03:58.599> it<00:03:58.750> up<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.349> let's<00:03:59.620> have<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.769> look<00:03:59.919> at<00:04:00.099> that

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
clean it up so let's have a look at that

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.099 
clean it up so let's have a look at that
and<00:04:01.780> you<00:04:02.259> can<00:04:02.409> see<00:04:02.709> now<00:04:02.979> behind<00:04:03.430> me<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:04.359> photos

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
and you can see now behind me the photos

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.289 
and you can see now behind me the photos
and<00:04:05.409> the<00:04:05.500> video<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:06.040> got<00:04:06.310> from<00:04:06.669> the<00:04:07.030> live

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
and the video that I got from the live

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.210 
and the video that I got from the live
blood<00:04:07.569> analysis<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:08.290> so<00:04:08.859> it's<00:04:09.009> really

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
blood analysis and so it's really

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.740 
blood analysis and so it's really
interesting<00:04:09.430> stuff<00:04:09.939> so<00:04:10.150> let's<00:04:10.389> have<00:04:10.509> a<00:04:10.569> look

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
interesting stuff so let's have a look

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.369 
interesting stuff so let's have a look
at<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:10.989> I'll<00:04:11.199> show<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.709> exactly<00:04:12.069> what<00:04:13.259> what<00:04:14.259> we

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
at it I'll show you exactly what what we

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.620 
at it I'll show you exactly what what we
found<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.949> I'll<00:04:15.340> show<00:04:15.519> you<00:04:15.579> a<00:04:15.669> video<00:04:16.000> first<00:04:16.299> of

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
found and I'll show you a video first of

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.620 
found and I'll show you a video first of
my<00:04:16.870> life<00:04:17.079> blood<00:04:17.349> and<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.150> see<00:04:19.389> here

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
my life blood and you can see here

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.830 
my life blood and you can see here
that's<00:04:20.349> my<00:04:20.530> life<00:04:20.739> blood<00:04:21.009> and<00:04:21.330> you<00:04:22.330> can<00:04:22.479> see<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
that's my life blood and you can see the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.839 
that's my life blood and you can see the
cells<00:04:23.110> these<00:04:23.409> are<00:04:23.560> all<00:04:23.710> individual<00:04:24.460> blood

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
cells these are all individual blood

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.250 
cells these are all individual blood
cells<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.360> they<00:04:25.510> shouldn't<00:04:25.779> be<00:04:25.840> sticking

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
cells and they shouldn't be sticking

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.520 
cells and they shouldn't be sticking
together<00:04:26.440> like<00:04:26.830> they<00:04:27.010> look

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
together like they look

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.900 
together like they look
see<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.740> one<00:04:27.950> here<00:04:28.160> that's<00:04:28.340> that's<00:04:28.670> the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
see this one here that's that's the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.030 
see this one here that's that's the
formed<00:04:29.180> you<00:04:29.270> can<00:04:29.330> see<00:04:29.540> it's<00:04:29.690> not<00:04:29.870> round<00:04:30.110> it's

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
formed you can see it's not round it's

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.379 
formed you can see it's not round it's
like<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.190> weird<00:04:31.490> shape<00:04:31.730> that's<00:04:32.000> that's

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
like a weird shape that's that's

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.230 
like a weird shape that's that's
deformed<00:04:32.990> it's<00:04:33.770> not<00:04:33.950> good<00:04:34.130> this<00:04:34.670> bit<00:04:34.940> here<00:04:35.180> is

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
deformed it's not good this bit here is

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.940 
deformed it's not good this bit here is
a<00:04:36.080> bunch<00:04:36.950> of<00:04:37.570> gunk<00:04:38.570> in<00:04:39.110> my<00:04:39.350> blood<00:04:39.620> all

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
a bunch of gunk in my blood all

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.280 
a bunch of gunk in my blood all
crystallizing<00:04:40.880> and<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.300> forming<00:04:42.050> its<00:04:42.169> own

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
crystallizing and and forming its own

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.440 
crystallizing and and forming its own
little<00:04:42.530> garbage<00:04:43.400> bucket<00:04:43.880> you<00:04:44.000> know<00:04:44.150> where<00:04:44.360> it

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
little garbage bucket you know where it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.210 
little garbage bucket you know where it
can<00:04:44.600> all<00:04:44.690> store<00:04:44.990> itself<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:45.770> can<00:04:45.919> see<00:04:46.070> my

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
can all store itself and you can see my

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.650 
can all store itself and you can see my
blood<00:04:46.370> cells<00:04:46.669> here<00:04:46.880> that's<00:04:47.270> like<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:47.630> know

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
blood cells here that's like you know

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.390 
blood cells here that's like you know
five<00:04:47.990> blood<00:04:48.290> cells<00:04:48.560> all<00:04:48.740> connected<00:04:49.250> together

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
five blood cells all connected together

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.580 
five blood cells all connected together
you<00:04:50.210> know<00:04:50.330> they're<00:04:50.570> all<00:04:50.690> piled<00:04:50.990> on<00:04:51.230> top<00:04:51.410> of

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
you know they're all piled on top of

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.780 
you know they're all piled on top of
each<00:04:51.710> other<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.010> can<00:04:52.040> see<00:04:52.250> one<00:04:52.490> two<00:04:52.520> three

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
each other you can see one two three

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.260 
each other you can see one two three
four<00:04:53.180> or<00:04:53.630> sidon<00:04:54.790> you<00:04:55.790> know<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.120> that

four or sidon you know and that

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.730 
four or sidon you know and that
shouldn't<00:04:56.660> be<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.930> case<00:04:56.960> they<00:04:57.410> should<00:04:57.620> all<00:04:57.710> be

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
shouldn't be the case they should all be

one is yeast you can see here that's
that's<00:05:40.729> their<00:05:41.450> use<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:42.400> you<00:05:43.400> know<00:05:43.490> they

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
clean it up and this is a picture of I

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.520 
clean it up and this is a picture of I
can't<00:05:50.630> remem<00:05:50.780> what<00:05:50.900> this<00:05:51.020> one's<00:05:51.200> called<00:05:51.320> but

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
can't remem what this one's called but

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.810 
can't remem what this one's called but
basically<00:05:51.800> this<00:05:52.039> bit<00:05:52.220> shouldn't<00:05:52.520> be<00:05:52.610> black

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
basically this bit shouldn't be black

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.400 
basically this bit shouldn't be black
and<00:05:53.060> those<00:05:53.630> things<00:05:53.930> shouldn't<00:05:54.169> be<00:05:54.289> white<00:05:54.620> and

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
and those things shouldn't be white and

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.750 
and those things shouldn't be white and
so<00:05:57.410> you<00:05:57.470> know<00:05:57.890> that's<00:05:58.070> something<00:05:58.250> I'm<00:05:58.640> going

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
so you know that's something I'm going

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.000 
so you know that's something I'm going
to<00:05:58.820> be<00:05:58.880> watching<00:05:59.590> see<00:06:00.590> that'd<00:06:00.770> be<00:06:00.860> there

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
to be watching see that'd be there

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.650 
to be watching see that'd be there
shouldn't<00:06:01.310> be<00:06:01.400> white<00:06:01.669> and<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.330> shouldn't<00:06:02.600> be

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
shouldn't be white and it shouldn't be

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.120 
shouldn't be white and it shouldn't be
black<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.140> so<00:06:03.650> I'm<00:06:03.740> going<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:03.890> be<00:06:03.979> watching

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
black and so I'm going to be watching

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.920 
black and so I'm going to be watching
this<00:06:04.460> stuff<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:06.320> that<00:06:06.500> I<00:06:06.530> can<00:06:06.890> really<00:06:07.780> see<00:06:08.780> the

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
this stuff so that I can really see the

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.529 
this stuff so that I can really see the
difference<00:06:09.050> between<00:06:09.470> now<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:11.090> guys<00:06:11.270> will

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
difference between now and you guys will

difference between now and you guys will
be<00:06:11.570> able<00:06:11.720> to<00:06:11.840> see<00:06:11.990> it<00:06:12.050> as<00:06:12.140> well<00:06:12.260> because<00:06:12.500> when<00:06:12.680> I

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:12.710 
be able to see it as well because when I

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.620 
be able to see it as well because when I
do<00:06:12.830> my<00:06:13.160> next<00:06:13.220> test<00:06:13.669> which<00:06:13.850> might<00:06:14.060> be<00:06:14.180> 30<00:06:14.390> days

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
do my next test which might be 30 days

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.020 
do my next test which might be 30 days
or<00:06:14.900> 60<00:06:15.020> days<00:06:15.229> 120<00:06:15.830> days<00:06:16.160> whatever<00:06:16.400> it<00:06:16.550> whenever

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
or 60 days 120 days whatever it whenever

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.279 
or 60 days 120 days whatever it whenever
I<00:06:17.090> get<00:06:17.180> a<00:06:17.300> chance<00:06:17.479> to<00:06:17.660> get<00:06:17.780> down<00:06:17.960> there<00:06:18.200> and

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
I get a chance to get down there and

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:20.409 
I get a chance to get down there and
have<00:06:18.470> another<00:06:18.680> look<00:06:19.030> it<00:06:20.030> should<00:06:20.270> be

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
have another look it should be

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:21.880 
have another look it should be
completely<00:06:20.900> different<00:06:21.260> or<00:06:21.350> well<00:06:21.530> on<00:06:21.560> its<00:06:21.860> way

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
completely different or well on its way

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.180

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
worthwhile doing because it really it
