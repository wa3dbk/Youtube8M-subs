00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
combination between a pry bar and the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.469 
combination between a pry bar and the
knife<00:01:58.860> as<00:01:59.860> you<00:02:00.369> know<00:02:00.459> as<00:02:00.610> well<00:02:00.729> as<00:02:00.789> a<00:02:00.910> hammer<00:02:01.149> in

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
knife as you know as well as a hammer in

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.580 
knife as you know as well as a hammer in
certain<00:02:01.810> situations<00:02:02.020> and<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:04.030> the<00:02:04.599> x<00:02:04.929> m7<00:02:05.170> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
certain situations and so the x m7 is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.219 
certain situations and so the x m7 is
kind<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:05.890> meant<00:02:06.099> to<00:02:06.220> fill<00:02:06.429> those<00:02:06.580> roles<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.869> the

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
kind of meant to fill those roles so the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.080 
kind of meant to fill those roles so the
blade<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.830> an<00:02:08.920> asymmetrical<00:02:09.640> grind<00:02:09.880> so

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
blade is an asymmetrical grind so

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.089 
blade is an asymmetrical grind so
asymmetrical<00:02:10.840> means<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.740> is<00:02:11.860> not

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
asymmetrical means that it is not

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.760 
asymmetrical means that it is not
symmetrically<00:02:13.230> different<00:02:14.230> on<00:02:14.319> both<00:02:14.470> sides

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
symmetrically different on both sides

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.970 
symmetrically different on both sides
