00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 to say that I say is that I want the 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.820
 say with this watch I mean to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:16.220
 every woman to discover her talent 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:20.150
 staff to express his personality 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:24.720
 to express all that she can be and 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.840
 finally most of the time the watch 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.150
 that I create for a woman expresses her 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 soul 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 maybe that's what's more 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.880
 important to her for others who 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880
 live with her 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:53.039
 it was when my daughter told me 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.729
 said moment you have a dream since 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.850
 for a long time you work on serene but 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:03.539
 you do not throw yourself you hold you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.100
 even because you think about family 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.840
 you think about all the other things 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.320
 but you do not do what you want 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.759
 to do 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.070
 so go ahead so that I can do 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.590
 all I want to do is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.259
 that you do and then it's true that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.899
 women always put themselves finally 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.630
 very often barriers because of the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.539
 family when in fact we ask them 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.240
 not but it's just us who did not 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:34.320
 your balls that do not give us the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.580
 permission by creating 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.530
 these plants the other of lens 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.760
 I wanted to create another one for all 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.250
 women who symbolizes femininity 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.750
 but that gives women the feeling 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.330
 of belonging but also a watch that 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 symbolizes the uniqueness of each woman 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.120
 every woman is unique and that's for the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.920
 solve for which I developed this 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.920
 customization concept 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.220
 he 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.960
 why lens is a whole 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.970
 story if I created this watch for 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.720
 my mother for my daughter 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.800
 and then for all my hours with 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.000
 something that is very very 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.050
 important for me too is my father 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.470
 is all women have stories 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.230
 with their father my father died when 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.190
 I was eight years old and he was on the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.970
 point to create his watchmaking company 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:03.510
 with as lens name and when he got 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.290
 tried to find a name for the for the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.180
 mark so naturally that I have 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.150
 chose my father's name to the young 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.350
 Lens girls that's like that 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:19.230
 now you can see chemillÃ© 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.840
 with him by this is by this creation 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.800
 that he's a parent 80 do but me 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.150
 I did something of everything 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.209
 different from what they wanted to 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.209
 make 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.990
