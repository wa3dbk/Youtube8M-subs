00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.469
 how would you like that? 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.939
 It is possible if you change to Lucas 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.690
 that is LPG 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.180
 LPG is a fuel for gasoline engines 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.070
 It consists of propane or a propane-butane mixture 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.280
 These hydrocarbons occur in the extraction of oil and natural gas 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.989
 as by-products and are refined 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.990
 the same gas is also used for recreational use, for example 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.420
 when camping 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.200
 Under room temperature and normal pressure LPG is the true it will be 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.240
 composed 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.580
 that's how it works 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.500
 one speaks also of liquid gas or uses the abbreviation 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.030
 Ltd. FÃ¼rth remained folded following Gerstl 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.270
 The OFC days value is well over 100 and can therefore also at high 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.810
 Compressing motors are used which otherwise require visitors-plus 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 Up to 80 percent fewer pollutants compared to gasoline and diesel vehicles 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.420
 especially on the climate change the co2 content 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.630
 much lower mass of hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.200
 Nitric Oxide reduces the health hazard and trump the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.020
 environment 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.190
 Often you hear food is forbidden with gas powered vehicles in 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.930
 Underground parking to drive 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.550
 that is wrong and often confuse old prohibition signs 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.930
 the 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.680
 Uellendahl regulations allow the use of underground garages and 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.800
 car parks 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.950
 only on a private law level can the entrance of a gas vehicle 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.219
 be prohibited 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.109
 LPG is safer than conventional liquid fuels 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:25.659
 The car gas tanks are much more stable than conventional fuel tanks and 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.249
 moreover, with prescribed facilities for safety as above 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.499
 Top Twenty and the short-eleven filler provided 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.249
 that puts name valves on the car guest hand 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.220
 Picture automatically closed 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.150
 when the engine is stopped or when the vehicle is being driven in gasoline mode 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:52.449
 LPG is not to be confused with natural gas and CNN goes for Compressed 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.209
 Called natural gas 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.380
 LPG is held at 6 to 8 bar in special tanks natural gas 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.069
 On the other hand, it is stored in the tank at 200 to 220 bar, thus providing one 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.340
 increased risk of being plugged or destruction data 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.669
 the engine power in terms of torque is reduced for natural gas 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.019
 around ten to fifteen percent 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.959
 in LPG barely noticeable by one to two percent 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.319
 and also with the installation costs 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.640
 Sonata LPG ahead 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.669
 while the cost of installing a front gas system 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:36.309
 on Petra must amount to 2 to 3000 euros at the CNG with three and a half 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.309
 Dec four and a half thousand euros can be expected 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.169
 save book 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.910
 One liter of LPG costs about 63 cents 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.250
 but a realistic comparison value is 72 cents because of the lower 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.030
 Energy content of LPG about 10 to 20 percent more fuel needed 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.839
 becomes 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:07.069
 let's compare two deep-sea fish vehicles with different ones 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.919
 Fuel systems gasoline and LPG he is clearly how fast the 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:16.159
 Significantly differentiate expenditure on fuel 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:22.459
 we are handling one-time costs of 2500 euros for the equipment with one 

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:26.869
 In addition, we receive an indirect gas supply to the front 

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:27.689
 expenditure 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.809
 after about 40 000 kilometers 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:31.980
 that means 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.640
 that the initial investment after that mileage is targeted locally 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.000
 has saved money from this point on 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.770
 Lesser drivers with about 20 thousand kilometers per year save about 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.410
 two years a lot of bike with over 40 thousand kilometers annually saving 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.050
 already in the first year 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.789
 Do not forget the added value by installing the front 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:57.889
 gas plant 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.300
 an example 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.689
 The company Maier maintains five company vehicles 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.999
 all run 50,000 kilometers annually 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:10.259
 for gasoline nearly 34 thousand euros are spent 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.830
 after three years, over 100,000 euros 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.439
 after installation of front gas systems in all vehicles for a total of ten 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.839
 a thousand euros + fuel costs, the expenses amount to about 28 

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:27.599
 000 euros in the first year 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.749
 so despite initial investment already almost saved to 6000 euros 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:39.209
 After three years, Center 64 thousand euros were spent compared to 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.610
 Gasoline plant saved well 38 thousand euros 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.029
 that equates he forgives my savings of more than 35 percent 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.939
 The refueling is very easy and adds at many gas stations even from one 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:56.360
 Tank attendant performed 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.470
 There are now more than 2,200 filling stations in the Federal Republic 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.849
 the number is constantly growing
