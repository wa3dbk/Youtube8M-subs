what<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.289> your<00:00:58.590> character<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.370> Game

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
what is it about your character on Game

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
what is it about your character on Game
of<00:00:59.640> Thrones<00:00:59.760> it's<00:01:00.420> kind<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.809> entry

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
of Thrones it's kind of an entry

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.599 
of Thrones it's kind of an entry
character<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.620> people<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.920> relate<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.190> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
character like people can relate to you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.399 
character like people can relate to you
I<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:03.149> aria<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> only

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
I think aria is one of the only

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
I think aria is one of the only
characters<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.129> speaks<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> truth

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
characters that really speaks the truth

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.450 
characters that really speaks the truth
and<00:01:06.710> one<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> only<00:01:07.950> characters<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and one of the only characters that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.710 
and one of the only characters that
could<00:01:08.580> probably<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.090> her<00:01:09.210> own<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.600> well

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
could probably do it on her own as well

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
could probably do it on her own as well
a<00:01:10.170> lot<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> other<00:01:10.950> characters<00:01:11.580> need<00:01:11.729> other

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
a lot of other characters need other

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.640 
a lot of other characters need other
characters<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.479> give<00:01:12.600> him<00:01:12.720> power<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.320> whatnot

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
characters to give him power and whatnot

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
characters to give him power and whatnot
and<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.340> feel<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.729> he's<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.240> relatable<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and I feel like he's very relatable to

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
and I feel like he's very relatable to
people<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.530> everyday<00:01:16.770> life<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.220> mean<00:01:17.400> maybe<00:01:17.610> not

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
people in everyday life I mean maybe not

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.310 
people in everyday life I mean maybe not
killing<00:01:18.090> people<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> she's<00:01:19.170> got

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
killing people but you know she's got

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
killing people but you know she's got
the<00:01:19.409> right<00:01:19.530> intentions<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.159> feel<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.729> what's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the right intentions I feel and what's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
the right intentions I feel and what's
that<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.570> set<00:01:21.930> light<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.259> got<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> be<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that that set light it's got to be a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.149 
that that set light it's got to be a
really<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> macho<00:01:23.490> tough<00:01:24.119> set<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
really kind of macho tough set but you

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.170 
really kind of macho tough set but you
can<00:01:26.280> handle<00:01:26.549> anybody<00:01:26.970> there<00:01:28.070> sometimes<00:01:29.180> you

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
can handle anybody there sometimes you

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
can handle anybody there sometimes you
come<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> master<00:01:30.960> set<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.680> feel<00:01:31.860> like
