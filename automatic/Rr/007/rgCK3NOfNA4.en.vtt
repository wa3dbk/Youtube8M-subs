00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.680
 [music] 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.610
 hello angels and have not seen you for a long time 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.470
 I miss you very much 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.840
 this is another video that is dedicated 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.610
 many problems should be relevant 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.260
 faced with it when you wear something 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.310
 clothes that you like 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.720
 on sure there will be people they will be 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.910
 who are unhappy with their appearance 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.100
 This as teachers who first 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.820
 I ask you what is your mood 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.510
 tell you 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.659
 smile the next day for some reason 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.960
 ask why are you smiling and yet 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.150
 do for this remark people never 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.850
 It is rather will focus on the clothes 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.869
 which for some reason is considered childish because 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.510
 colors because of her cut or maybe because 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:58.309
 her jewelry do not know there someone bows 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.500
 don't like and so on in general if 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.830
 talk about like that i am with 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.990
 faced already in first class yes yes it is 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.170
 very strange when they tell you 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.939
 6 years that your clothes are too pink well 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.530
 everything is just some kids just 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.780
 want to look like an adult therefore 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.760
 such posturing begins is true 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.250
 running cases it ends 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.860
 drinking alcohol and smoking 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.730
 that just the same destroys the myth of their 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.010
 consciousness 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.630
 and now I donâ€™t know more about touched and 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.970
 all problems if not 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.040
 write about it in the comments and we have them 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.220
 also take the first they exist 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.900
 division into children's and adult clothes 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.360
 clothes are creativity the whole point is that 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.700
 when there are age restrictions and 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.159
 but if these distinctions are perceived 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.030
 seriously clothes with age will be all 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.680
 more able 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.580
 why there are no restrictions 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.860
 because children can easily be put on 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.320
 same clothes as adults don't 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.220
 there is a division into nursery and adult 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.380
 fashion it is absolutely conditional it means 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.130
 what if your size means you 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.229
 it can carry the problem is socks 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.629
 no vulgarity I don't know about you but me 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.629
 like golf and no matter there school 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.790
 this form or something else i think is 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.240
 looks cute the Japanese even have a whole 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.340
 fetish on it so here surprises me that 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 golf and are considered part of the outfit 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.690
 prostitutes who are these people who 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.000
 calculates vulgarity by item of clothing 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.760
 I am asking only two conclusions 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.769
 the first is that these people are just 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.050
 preoccupied and nothing more 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.060
 think therefore spread at all 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.099
 your thoughts 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.420
 the second is stereotypical thinking thank you 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.519
 porn industry and the second moment which 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.620
 probably too annoying when people 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.019
 think why is that girls something 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.670
 wears to like guys at the very 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.170
 business 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.730
 girls wear something just to 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.190
 to like family and because they 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.069
 like it and therefore nothing more 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.640
 remember that sometimes clothes are just 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.160
 clothes 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.629
 third problem lolita style and reaction 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.950
 in the name I stick to the other 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.620
 style gear but here it is 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.840
 style and more precisely its name lolita 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.030
 causes a lot of controversy issues and 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.160
 so on so it's just good 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.989
 example when people listen to the name of it 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.049
 style then they involuntarily arise 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.519
 associations with nabokovskoy nymphet and but 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.680
 the essence of this style is diametrically 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.569
 opposite to associative row 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.389
 girls who stick to style 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.260
 Lolita is not used at all 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.069
 the sexualized image itself 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.959
 except beautiful and expensive dresses 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.030
 decorated with bows ryushechkami and so on 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.349
 what is called in people with limited 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.819
 perception by kindergarten is also 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.000
 certain sting behavior 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.519
 ethics and so on so here it is 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.380
 really strange when something cute 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.419
 perceived as something vulgar either 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.590
 something for people who have a lag in 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:05.410
 development or is it considered something 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.470
 characteristic only for japan 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.970
 why not why not do the same 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.390
 most in Russia for example 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.570
 and that's exactly what I want to change 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.360
 colonization operation start that's all that 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.440
 I wanted to say about this 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.070
 be sure to put likes if you 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.600

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.400

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.780

 [music] 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.240
 [music] 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.740
