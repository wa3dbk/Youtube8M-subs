with dread bomb using a scorned so uh I
got<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.109> idea<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.859> by<00:00:20.100> thinking<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.910> know

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
got the idea just by thinking you know

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.140 
got the idea just by thinking you know
there's<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.330> lot<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:22.039> monster<00:00:23.039> density<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.760> Act

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
there's a lot of monster density in Act

there's a lot of monster density in Act
one<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.920> my<00:00:25.920> neck<00:00:26.099> too<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.430> matter<00:00:26.519> so

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
one now my neck too for that matter so

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.429 
one now my neck too for that matter so
I've<00:00:27.300> thought<00:00:27.480> about<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.869> know<00:00:27.900> dread<00:00:28.230> bomb

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
I've thought about you know dread bomb

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.310 
I've thought about you know dread bomb
because<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> huge<00:00:29.580> range<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.570> AOE<00:00:31.019> right

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
because it has a huge range of AOE right

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.549 
because it has a huge range of AOE right
and<00:00:31.910> using<00:00:32.910> cleave<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.600> enemies<00:00:34.140> slain<00:00:34.380> by

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
and using cleave with enemies slain by

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
and using cleave with enemies slain by
Cleveland<00:00:35.070> causing<00:00:35.940> blah<00:00:36.090> blah<00:00:36.239> blah<00:00:36.480> blah

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
Cleveland causing blah blah blah blah

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
Cleveland causing blah blah blah blah
blah<00:00:36.660> damage<00:00:37.140> over<00:00:37.440> 8<00:00:37.710> yards<00:00:38.070> um<00:00:39.200> I<00:00:40.200> think<00:00:40.770> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
blah damage over 8 yards um I think this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.130 
blah damage over 8 yards um I think this
