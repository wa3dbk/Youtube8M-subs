think about that is kind of it that
blows<00:03:08.240> my<00:03:08.480> mind<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:23.540> hearing<00:03:24.280> what<00:03:25.280> each

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
blows my mind just hearing what each

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.570 
blows my mind just hearing what each
person<00:03:25.730> had<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.240> say<00:03:26.510> about<00:03:27.040> how<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.250> trip

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
person had to say about how this trip

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.310 
person had to say about how this trip
brought<00:03:28.910> something<00:03:29.390> out<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.540> them<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:30.140> they

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
brought something out and them that they

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.080 
brought something out and them that they
felt<00:03:30.680> like<00:03:30.740> they<00:03:30.950> lost<00:03:31.190> at<00:03:31.430> Julia<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:31.970> I

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
felt like they lost at Julia and I

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.900 
felt like they lost at Julia and I
really<00:03:32.330> think<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.200> what<00:03:34.190> art<00:03:34.640> is

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
really think that that is what art is

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.280 
really think that that is what art is
about<00:03:35.090> it's<00:03:35.510> about<00:03:35.600> finding<00:03:36.020> yourself

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
about it's about finding yourself

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.010 
about it's about finding yourself
through<00:03:37.240> whatever<00:03:38.240> instrument<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.870> make

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
through whatever instrument you make

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.740 
through whatever instrument you make
play<00:03:39.260> or<00:03:39.560> how<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:39.980> dance<00:03:40.370> or<00:03:40.670> sing<00:03:41.000> or<00:03:41.180> act<00:03:41.240> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
play or how you dance or sing or act and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.360 
play or how you dance or sing or act and
I<00:03:42.320> think<00:03:42.380> that's

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
I think that's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:58.360 
I think that's
main<00:03:45.390> goal<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.810> trip

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.970

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.800

that<00:04:04.200> means<00:04:05.090> figure<00:04:06.090> out<00:04:06.209> how<00:04:06.300> I<00:04:06.330> can<00:04:06.510> take

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810
