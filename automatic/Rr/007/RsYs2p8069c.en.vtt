plants with a lot of weight on them
because<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.690> gonna<00:00:15.780> have<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.959> lot<00:00:16.170> of

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
because we're gonna have a lot of

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200 
because we're gonna have a lot of
tomatoes<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.700> to<00:00:17.789> have<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> strong

tomatoes and so you got to have a strong

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.480 
tomatoes and so you got to have a strong
support<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:19.289> support<00:00:19.440> those<00:00:19.740> tomato<00:00:20.070> plants

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
support to support those tomato plants

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.180 
support to support those tomato plants
I'd<00:00:21.480> like<00:00:21.690> to<00:00:21.810> have<00:00:21.960> my<00:00:22.170> tomatoes<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.740> cages

I'd like to have my tomatoes in cages
for<00:00:23.850> several<00:00:24.270> reasons<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.870> it<00:00:25.440> keeps<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
for several reasons one it keeps the

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.040 
for several reasons one it keeps the
tomatoes<00:00:26.250> off<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.610> ground<00:00:26.850> where<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.900> would

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
tomatoes off the ground where they would

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.730 
tomatoes off the ground where they would
rot<00:00:28.970> also<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.270> just<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.350> able<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.560> pick

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
rot also I just like to be able to pick

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.729 
rot also I just like to be able to pick
the<00:00:31.890> tomatoes<00:00:31.980> off<00:00:32.399> up<00:00:32.910> above<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.739> some

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the tomatoes off up above and some

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560 
the tomatoes off up above and some
research<00:00:35.100> has<00:00:35.340> shown<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> tomatoes<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
research has shown that tomatoes that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
research has shown that tomatoes that
are<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.810> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:36.990> air<00:00:37.100> more<00:00:38.100> exposed<00:00:38.550> to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
are up in the air more exposed to

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
are up in the air more exposed to
sunlight<00:00:39.020> have<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> higher<00:00:40.320> content<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
sunlight have a higher content of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.580 
sunlight have a higher content of
vitamin<00:00:41.250> C<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.940> very<00:00:42.150> good<00:00:42.300> reasons<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
vitamin C so very good reasons to to

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
vitamin C so very good reasons to to
cage<00:00:43.860> or<00:00:44.489> support<00:00:45.060> your<00:00:45.180> tomato<00:00:45.480> plants<00:00:45.810> get

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
them off the ground I like to use

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180 
them off the ground I like to use
concrete<00:00:48.480> reinforcing<00:00:49.320> wire<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.010> can

comes in rolls 100 feet to someone less

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.440 
comes in rolls 100 feet to someone less
and<00:00:54.810> it's<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.040> good<00:00:56.700> for<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> strong

long time so I like to make my K just
three<00:01:10.020> feet<00:01:10.200> wide<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> wire<00:01:12.360> itself

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
three feet wide and then the wire itself

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
three feet wide and then the wire itself
is<00:01:12.930> five<00:01:13.170> feet<00:01:13.440> tall<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> also<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.120> little

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
spikes at the bottom and that helps to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
spikes at the bottom and that helps to
keep<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> ground<00:01:18.390> we'll<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:18.840> stake
