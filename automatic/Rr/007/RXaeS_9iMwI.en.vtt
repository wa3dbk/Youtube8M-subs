was<00:01:12.650> really<00:01:13.650> happy<00:01:13.830> at<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.250> because<00:01:14.490> i<00:01:14.850> was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
was really happy at that because i was

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.969 
was really happy at that because i was
about<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> buy<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.930> couple<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.799> hours

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
about to buy one a couple of hours

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.560 
about to buy one a couple of hours
before<00:01:17.220> i<00:01:17.460> did<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.960> i<00:01:20.240> didn't<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> end

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
before i did it and i didn't in the end

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.469 
before i did it and i didn't in the end
but<00:01:21.990> i<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.100> did<00:01:23.369> sell<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.000> 50k

but i got one but i did sell it for 50k

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
but i got one but i did sell it for 50k

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
so overall 75 k plus discarding at that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.620 
so overall 75 k plus discarding at that
point<00:01:29.490> would<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.759> been<00:01:29.850> around<00:01:30.060> hundred<00:01:30.420> k

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
