00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
first thing that you have to do is you

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.950 
first thing that you have to do is you
could<00:01:16.090> have<00:01:16.240> some<00:01:16.479> sort<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.780> checklist<00:01:17.110> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
could have some sort of checklist of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.810 
could have some sort of checklist of
what's<00:01:19.960> critically<00:01:20.470> important<00:01:21.070> in<00:01:21.190> your

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
what's critically important in your

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.240 
what's critically important in your
setup<00:01:22.150> that<00:01:22.660> tends<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.200> go<00:01:23.320> wrong<00:01:23.650> so

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
setup that tends to go wrong so

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.770 
setup that tends to go wrong so
sometimes<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:24.940> think<00:01:24.970> the<00:01:25.270> first<00:01:25.510> thing<00:01:25.660> you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
sometimes I think the first thing you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.600 
sometimes I think the first thing you
have<00:01:25.810> to<00:01:26.020> start<00:01:26.230> doing<00:01:26.410> is<00:01:26.620> taking<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:27.280> start

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610

on<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.790> bad<00:02:48.940> dates<00:02:49.210> so<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.750> could<00:02:50.050> find<00:02:50.320> out

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
on the bad dates so you could find out

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.630 
on the bad dates so you could find out
that<00:02:50.500> maybe<00:02:50.860> some<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.340> things<00:02:51.400> you're

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
that maybe some of the things you're

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
doing on the good days has a lot to do

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.500 
doing on the good days has a lot to do
with<00:02:53.860> why<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.070> shoot<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.370> good<00:02:54.520> score<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.030> feel

with why you shoot a good score and feel
good<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.720> shoot<00:02:55.990> a<00:02:56.050> good<00:02:56.200> score<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.860> other

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
good and shoot a good score and in other

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.590 
good and shoot a good score and in other
days<00:02:57.370> they're<00:02:57.580> not<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.210> might<00:02:58.450> have<00:02:58.510> to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
days they're not so you might have to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.120 
days they're not so you might have to
start<00:02:58.840> tracking<00:02:59.110> this<00:02:59.320> stuff<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.710> find<00:02:59.950> out

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
start tracking this stuff and find out

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.120 
start tracking this stuff and find out
okay<00:03:00.550> another<00:03:01.420> thing<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.020> the<00:03:02.410> consistency

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
okay another thing is is the consistency

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.660 
okay another thing is is the consistency
comes<00:03:03.430> with<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> consistent<00:03:04.120> routine<00:03:04.210> and<00:03:05.670> you

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
comes with a consistent routine and you

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.860 
comes with a consistent routine and you
might<00:03:06.850> want<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.060> think<00:03:07.180> about<00:03:07.330> your<00:03:07.570> routine

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
might want to think about your routine

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.290 
might want to think about your routine
where<00:03:08.380> you<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.790> feel<00:03:09.970> like<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.210> were

where you do you feel like you were

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.030 
where you do you feel like you were
taking<00:03:10.600> extra<00:03:10.870> waggles<00:03:11.260> or<00:03:11.470> taking<00:03:11.830> longer

ultimately in the end the stats are
going<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.489> do<00:04:06.580> it<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.880> and<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.570> might<00:04:07.750> want<00:04:07.930> to

shooting seventy three fours and fives

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.689 
shooting seventy three fours and fives
that's<00:06:29.650> like<00:06:29.830> that's<00:06:30.250> somewhere<00:06:30.639> between

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
that's like that's somewhere between

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.820 
that's like that's somewhere between
like<00:06:30.969> a<00:06:31.120> one<00:06:31.389> to<00:06:31.509> three<00:06:31.539> handicap<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.409> then

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
like a one to three handicap and then

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.980 
like a one to three handicap and then
you're<00:06:32.949> getting<00:06:33.069> up<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.339> 81<00:06:33.699> 82<00:06:34.089> 83<00:06:34.389> s<00:06:34.779> that's

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
you're getting up to 81 82 83 s that's

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.679 
you're getting up to 81 82 83 s that's
not<00:06:35.139> well<00:06:35.319> for<00:06:35.439> about<00:06:35.589> an<00:06:35.800> 8<00:06:36.250> to<00:06:36.400> 10<00:06:36.580> or<00:06:36.699> 11<00:06:37.029> 11

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:37.689 
not well for about an 8 to 10 or 11 11

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:39.809 
not well for about an 8 to 10 or 11 11
handicap<00:06:38.110> on<00:06:38.289> average<00:06:38.589> so<00:06:39.099> that's<00:06:39.460> a<00:06:39.580> big

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:39.819 
handicap on average so that's a big

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:42.510 
handicap on average so that's a big
swing<00:06:39.969> and<00:06:40.330> I<00:06:40.689> mean<00:06:40.930> so<00:06:41.650> the<00:06:41.860> consistency<00:06:42.189> is

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
swing and I mean so the consistency is

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.820 
swing and I mean so the consistency is
off<00:06:42.669> it's<00:06:42.939> got<00:06:43.210> to<00:06:43.360> be<00:06:43.509> in<00:06:43.750> either<00:06:44.199> away<00:06:44.560> your

off it's got to be in either away your
your<00:06:45.310> feeling<00:06:45.759> the<00:06:46.029> way<00:06:46.150> you're<00:06:46.330> approaching
