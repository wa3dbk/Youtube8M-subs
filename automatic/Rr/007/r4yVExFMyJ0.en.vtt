00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to get into higher vantage points over

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170 
to get into higher vantage points over
people<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.409> also<00:01:26.280> worth<00:01:26.430> mentioning<00:01:26.460> every

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
people and also worth mentioning every

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.940 
people and also worth mentioning every
now<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> then<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> huge<00:01:27.930> crane<00:01:28.229> comes<00:01:28.500> down<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
now and then a huge crane comes down and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
now and then a huge crane comes down and
moves<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.280> crate<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.700> somewhere<00:01:29.939> else<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
moves a crate to somewhere else on the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
moves a crate to somewhere else on the
map<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.350> next<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:31.860> turbine<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
map but next we have turbine and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.340 
map but next we have turbine and
honestly<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.150> thought<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.479> map<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.810> really

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
honestly I thought this map was really

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.440 
honestly I thought this map was really
weird<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> awkward<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.189> play<00:01:35.490> because<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.360> was

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
weird and awkward to play because it was

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.569 
weird and awkward to play because it was
really<00:01:36.869> big<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.710> seemed<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.549> a

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
really big but it seemed like a like a

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429

whatever that means I'm not totally sure

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.570 
whatever that means I'm not totally sure
yet<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.450> first<00:02:07.020> we<00:02:07.259> got<00:02:07.439> carrier<00:02:07.860> which<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
yet but first we got carrier which is a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.910 
yet but first we got carrier which is a
chinese<00:02:09.060> super<00:02:09.450> carrier<00:02:09.690> open<00:02:10.349> engagements

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
chinese super carrier open engagements

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.440 
chinese super carrier open engagements
on<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> deck<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.550> great<00:02:11.849> close<00:02:12.120> quarter

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
on the deck with great close quarter

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.480 
on the deck with great close quarter
fights<00:02:12.690> throughout<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> whole

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
fights throughout the whole

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.970 
fights throughout the whole
so<00:02:14.180> i'm<00:02:14.510> guessing<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.900> top<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.560> like

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so i'm guessing the top will have like

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.590 
so i'm guessing the top will have like
little<00:02:16.310> cover<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:17.180> lot<00:02:17.360> of<00:02:17.390> gun<00:02:17.570> fights

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.310 
I thought of was look out on more for
three<00:03:09.830> it's<00:03:10.310> one<00:03:10.460> of<00:03:10.550> the<00:03:10.610> DLC<00:03:11.150> maps<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.660> believe

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
three it's one of the DLC maps I believe

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.650 
three it's one of the DLC maps I believe
it's<00:03:12.470> one<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.770> faceoff<00:03:13.100> maps<00:03:13.370> it<00:03:14.150> has<00:03:14.390> that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
it's one of the faceoff maps it has that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.450 
it's one of the faceoff maps it has that
one<00:03:14.960> side<00:03:15.320> with<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.620> higher<00:03:15.800> levels<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
one side with the higher levels and the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.610 
one side with the higher levels and the
vantage<00:03:17.150> points<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:18.260> fight<00:03:18.440> to<00:03:18.470> control

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
vantage points and you fight to control

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.800 
vantage points and you fight to control
that<00:03:18.980> probably<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:20.030> lot<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.240> a<00:03:20.300> spawn<00:03:20.540> trapping

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
that probably a lot of a spawn trapping

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.920 
that probably a lot of a spawn trapping

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
and i know Klaus say that but it

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.480
