00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.770
 today I'll show you how to make a heart 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.660
 with wings 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.670
 for making this origami crafts 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.220
 take a square sheet of paper with 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.310
 20 centimeters on one side 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:35.460
 the sheet must be white fold the sheet 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:38.329
 expand in half and again 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.329
 fold in half 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.460
 deploy again 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.149
 and here we turn this underside to 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.149
 average 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.489
 turn over the workpiece 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.510
 Now we turn this half to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510
 average 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.790
 and the second half, too, to medium 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.040
 Here is such a figure we get 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.260
 now this side is small 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.260
 bend to the middle line like this 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.130
 and on the other hand also the middle 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.799
 turn over the workpiece 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.400
 now we have to fold the paper here by 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.250
 This line is held by a triangle and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.530
 bend the paper down look paper at 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.140
 does not let us turn around 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.770
 for this we bend one side 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.770
 inside 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.080
 and the second side in the same way we press 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.860
 look again how we have it better 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.860
 here on this line bend low can 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.610
 and there came two sides of the scenes under fire 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.450
 this side to this one line 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.450
 fold 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.439
 iron this fold unfold 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.689
 paper and now we need to bend back into 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.359
 here here are the leaves see 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:08.879
 This side should bend to 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.109
 this line 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.109
 triangle inside unfolds 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.150
 and the second side is the same 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.150
 side here to this line sing along 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.170
 look again how two networks were laid 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:44.560
 folds here they are two diagonal lines 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.349
 from returned to the side one little corner and 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.660
 aside 2 little corner and bend them 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.870
 It turned out like a ship steamer 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.300
 and now this one is this part 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.549
 paper we will fold the accordion 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.549
 move to the middle line and turn down 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.420
 up under fire and down again 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.009
 Here we get an accordion but she still 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.009
 wide we will make it still dinner 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.740
 the paper we have all the time 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.740
 harmonic 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.449
 it will be the wings of the heart 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.050
 and last 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:09.240
 look, I folded the harmonica in me 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.449
 It turned out 7 folds it will be 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.419
 the wings of our heart in the center like this 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.599
 Here we collect them and for the edges a little 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.499
 turn down and pull one down 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.499
 second wing 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:34.329
 when we fold the little triangles 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:34.329
 top of 1 kiu tip and 2 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.559
 and here is exactly the same triangle 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.559
 little 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.009
 and 2 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.009
 little canon 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:55.010
 so that the heart does not have sharp edges we 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.740
 let's do another defense buckled down 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.090
 small triangle from 1 to 1 with 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.090
 and 2 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.060
 our origami sparkle heart is ready 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:14.419
 make such a gift to your friends and 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.419
 beloved
