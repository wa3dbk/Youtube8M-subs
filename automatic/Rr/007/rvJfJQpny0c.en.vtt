00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:31.220
Today is what we call multis, at the end of
training right before they graduate.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.700
It's where they take everything they've learned
from day 1 and put together a scenario.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.730
Today you saw a three man sinking vessel multi.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:01:03.205
It's to simulate a vessel that's taking on
water and there's a pump on board that they're

00:01:03.205 --> 00:01:04.205
unable to get it to run.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.205
After five minutes, the lead instructor will
blow the horn.

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:14.060
That's when the vessel sinks and everyone
gets in the water.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.229
At that point we're looking for them to be
able to re-prioritize to find out who is drowning,

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:39.330
who is not drowning and save all the survivors.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:48.930
Usually we'll have one person who is an active
survivor that is non-compliant.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.890
They're scared, they can't swim and we're
looking to see if they're able to compose

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.592
themselves and keep control of that survivor.

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:02.960
If that survivor becomes panicked and turns
on them, are they able to utilize the tools

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:21.510
we give them to either escape and get away
from that survivor or do a release, which

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:50.450
is where you turn them around and regain control.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:03:11.530
The mask really is a big help when you're
dealing with the rotor wash.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:40.519
It's almost the main reason we have it.

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.609
With rotor wash coming at you, it stings and
makes it hard to see.

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.989
They're able to think on their toes in a chaotic
situation and their ability to take everything

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.290
they've learned in their training and put
it all together for a scenario.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.680
So that when they're in the real world, it's
not their first time seeing a situation.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.220
Versus just putting one person in the water
and putting them in the basket.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.649
It's a confidence builder for them to utilize
the knowledge.
