a<00:00:33.920> tough<00:00:34.100> match<00:00:34.309> because<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:34.700> know<00:00:34.850> shahe<00:00:35.270> very

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
a tough match because I know shahe very

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.350 
a tough match because I know shahe very
well<00:00:35.720> and<00:00:35.960> when<00:00:36.800> she<00:00:36.950> plays<00:00:37.190> well<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:37.820> really

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
well and when she plays well it's really

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.150 
well and when she plays well it's really
really<00:00:38.600> tough<00:00:38.630> because<00:00:39.140> she<00:00:39.350> solid<00:00:39.740> from<00:00:40.010> both

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
really tough because she solid from both

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.860 
really tough because she solid from both
sides<00:00:40.520> and<00:00:40.850> her<00:00:41.030> back<00:00:41.210> end<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.540> really<00:00:41.840> a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
sides and her back end is really a

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.160 
sides and her back end is really a
weapon<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:43.910> think<00:00:44.450> she<00:00:44.720> played<00:00:44.900> well

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
weapon so I think she played well

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.490 
weapon so I think she played well
throughout<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:45.740> whole<00:00:45.890> match<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.810> I'm<00:00:47.810> lucky

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
throughout the whole match and I'm lucky

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.460

well<00:02:01.759> because<00:02:02.390> their<00:02:02.570> counter<00:02:02.960> punches<00:02:03.409> and

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
well because their counter punches and

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.670 
well because their counter punches and
they<00:02:03.799> they<00:02:04.280> use<00:02:04.460> my<00:02:04.670> pace<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.320> into<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
they they use my pace to to get into the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.979 
they they use my pace to to get into the
rallies<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.220> because<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.239> play<00:02:08.299> really<00:02:08.720> fast

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
rallies and because I play really fast

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.649

day<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:10.489> they<00:02:10.640> don't<00:02:11.090> have<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.450> strength

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
day and they don't have the strength

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.659 
day and they don't have the strength
themself<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.379> make<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.829> ball<00:02:12.980> fast<00:02:13.279> they<00:02:13.459> just

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:13.669 
themself to make the ball fast they just

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:14.740 
themself to make the ball fast they just
use<00:02:13.819> my<00:02:13.999> pace

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
use my pace

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.160 
use my pace
and<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:15.830> always<00:02:16.670> tend<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.150> lose<00:02:17.720> against<00:02:18.080> those

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
