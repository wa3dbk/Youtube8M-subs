00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
wants to go into these palm trees here

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.209 
wants to go into these palm trees here
so<00:00:07.550> I'll<00:00:08.550> take<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.970> back<00:00:09.150> a<00:00:09.179> notch<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.690> then<00:00:10.219> we

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
so I'll take it back a notch and then we

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.860 
so I'll take it back a notch and then we
can<00:00:11.400> watch<00:00:11.580> him<00:00:11.730> crawl<00:00:12.030> towards<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> trees<00:00:12.690> I

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
can watch him crawl towards the trees I

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.700 
can watch him crawl towards the trees I
guess<00:00:14.450> he's<00:00:15.450> uh<00:00:15.480> he's<00:00:16.020> two-and-a-half<00:00:16.500> meters

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
guess he's uh he's two-and-a-half meters

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.450 
guess he's uh he's two-and-a-half meters
I<00:00:17.039> measured<00:00:17.369> him<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:19.369> measured<00:00:20.369> him

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I measured him with the I measured him

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.529 
I measured him with the I measured him
with<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.760> tongs<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:23.240> when<00:00:24.240> he's<00:00:24.359> all

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
with the tongs and when he's all

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.779 
with the tongs and when he's all
stretched<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.050> man<00:00:25.320> he's<00:00:25.529> ninety<00:00:26.160> eight<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
stretched out man he's ninety eight to a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.240 
stretched out man he's ninety eight to a
hundred<00:00:27.180> inches<00:00:28.250> according<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> tongs<00:00:29.760> so

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
hundred inches according to the tongs so

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.030 
hundred inches according to the tongs so
that's<00:00:32.250> damn-near<00:00:33.530> what<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> three<00:00:34.920> meters

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
that's damn-near what is three meters

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.780 
that's damn-near what is three meters
that<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.870> 36<00:00:36.870> there'll<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.260> 39<00:00:38.040> 39

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
that would be 36 there'll be 39 39

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
that would be 36 there'll be 39 39
that'll<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.480> 78<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.090> he's<00:00:42.239> 2<00:00:42.600> meters<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.230> 30

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that'll be 78 so he's 2 meters and 30

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.670 
that'll be 78 so he's 2 meters and 30
inches<00:00:44.450> which<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.870> damn<00:00:46.110> big<00:00:46.350> it's
