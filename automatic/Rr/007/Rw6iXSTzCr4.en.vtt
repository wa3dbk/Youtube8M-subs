sound<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:12.960> we<00:02:13.020> are<00:02:13.200> using<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.710> olympus

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
sound so now we are using the olympus

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.750 
sound so now we are using the olympus
emmy<00:02:14.670> 15<00:02:16.220> one<00:02:17.220> thing<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.430> don't<00:02:17.490> like<00:02:17.640> about

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
emmy 15 one thing I don't like about

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.450 
emmy 15 one thing I don't like about
this<00:02:18.240> microphone<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.380> my<00:02:19.770> voice<00:02:20.040> comes

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
this microphone is that my voice comes

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.360 
this microphone is that my voice comes
in<00:02:20.670> more<00:02:20.910> dull<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.690> loses<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> bit<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
in more dull it loses a bit of the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.490 
in more dull it loses a bit of the
flavor<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.690> can't<00:02:24.900> really<00:02:24.960> explain<00:02:25.380> it

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
flavor to it I can't really explain it

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.100 
flavor to it I can't really explain it
but<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.760> voice<00:02:26.970> comes<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.570> as<00:02:27.720> flat

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
but it just the voice comes in as flat

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830 
but it just the voice comes in as flat
the<00:02:28.800> microphone<00:02:29.310> itself<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:29.940> capable<00:02:30.180> it's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
the microphone itself is capable it's

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.130 
the microphone itself is capable it's
small<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:32.310> like<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.970> metal<00:02:33.630> clipping

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
small I really like the metal clipping

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.770 
small I really like the metal clipping
its<00:02:34.320> sturdy<00:02:34.710> which<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.090> possibly<00:02:36.690> use

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
its sturdy which you can possibly use

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.940 
its sturdy which you can possibly use
for<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> hidden<00:02:37.590> camera<00:02:38.010> type<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.820> situations

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
for a hidden camera type of situations

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.680 
for a hidden camera type of situations
but<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.010> think<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:41.730> me<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.090> microphone<00:02:42.630> is

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
but I think for me this microphone is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.250 
but I think for me this microphone is
best<00:02:43.110> used<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.890> skype<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:45.210> that's<00:02:45.570> what<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:46.050> use

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
best used on skype so that's what I use

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.230 
best used on skype so that's what I use
it<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.220> costs<00:02:47.550> about<00:02:47.610> twenty<00:02:48.060> five

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
it for and it costs about twenty five

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.840 
it for and it costs about twenty five
dollars<00:02:48.780> on<00:02:48.930> Amazon<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.400> we're<00:02:50.550> gonna<00:02:50.640> switch

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
dollars on Amazon now we're gonna switch

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.210 
dollars on Amazon now we're gonna switch
over<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.720> last<00:02:51.930> microphone<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.770> testing

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
over to the last microphone I'm testing

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.740 
over to the last microphone I'm testing
the<00:02:53.490> Sony<00:02:53.840> ECM<00:02:55.250> cs3<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.480> microphone

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the Sony ECM cs3 that is this microphone

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.750 
the Sony ECM cs3 that is this microphone
right<00:02:58.320> here<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.010> I'm<00:02:59.100> going<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> change<00:02:59.520> that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
right here so I'm going to change that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.240 
right here so I'm going to change that
out<00:02:59.910> right<00:03:00.210> now<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:01.260> thing<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.740> immediately

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
out right now one thing I immediately

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.850 
out right now one thing I immediately
notice<00:03:03.030> when<00:03:03.270> using<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.690> Sony<00:03:03.990> microphone<00:03:04.560> is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
notice when using the Sony microphone is

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.640 
notice when using the Sony microphone is
that<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.300> lower<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.870> levels<00:03:07.260> quite<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
that I have to lower the levels quite a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.430 
that I have to lower the levels quite a
bit<00:03:07.950> it<00:03:08.640> seems<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.390> Olympus<00:03:09.960> needs<00:03:10.290> a

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
bit it seems that the Olympus needs a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.620 
bit it seems that the Olympus needs a
lot<00:03:10.620> more<00:03:10.650> power<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.640> get<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> same<00:03:12.240> volume

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
lot more power to get the same volume

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.840 
lot more power to get the same volume
but<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.650> problem<00:03:14.040> with<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.670> more

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
but the problem with that is the more

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.090 
but the problem with that is the more
power<00:03:15.120> you<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.840> use<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.410> more<00:03:16.620> likely

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
power you have to use the more likely

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.980 
power you have to use the more likely
you're<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.460> introduce<00:03:17.880> noise<00:03:18.450> and

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
you're going to introduce noise and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.370 
you're going to introduce noise and
other<00:03:19.860> background<00:03:20.310> artifacts<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.780> sony<00:03:22.050> has

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
other background artifacts the sony has

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.370 
other background artifacts the sony has
both<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:23.070> left<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.700> right<00:03:24.120> channel<00:03:24.570> but<00:03:25.170> again

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
both a left and right channel but again

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620 
both a left and right channel but again
i'm<00:03:25.530> recording<00:03:25.860> in<00:03:26.130> mono<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:27.300> very

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
i'm recording in mono it's very

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.810 
i'm recording in mono it's very
sensitive<00:03:27.990> it's<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.650> sensitive<00:03:29.070> mic<00:03:29.370> if<00:03:29.640> I

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
sensitive it's a sensitive mic if I

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.410 
sensitive it's a sensitive mic if I
touch<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.510> rub<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.740> caress<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.490> you're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
touch it and rub it and caress it you're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.530 
touch it and rub it and caress it you're
gonna<00:03:33.630> probably<00:03:34.260> hear<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.910> it's<00:03:36.330> not

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
gonna probably hear that so it's not

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.320 
gonna probably hear that so it's not
good<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.680> want<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.160> record<00:03:38.580> a<00:03:38.910> hidden

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
good if you want to record a hidden

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.810 
good if you want to record a hidden
camera<00:03:39.630> clip<00:03:40.050> because<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:41.010> lot<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.520> movement

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
camera clip because a lot of movement

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.930 
camera clip because a lot of movement
may<00:03:42.300> introduce<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.260> type<00:03:43.530> of<00:03:43.560> static<00:03:44.130> on<00:03:44.400> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
may introduce that type of static on the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.700 
may introduce that type of static on the
other<00:03:45.090> hand<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.540> sound<00:03:45.840> quality<00:03:46.380> with<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
other hand the sound quality with the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.790 
other hand the sound quality with the
Sony<00:03:47.480> microphone<00:03:48.480> should<00:03:48.870> probably<00:03:49.200> sound

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
Sony microphone should probably sound

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.020 
Sony microphone should probably sound
the<00:03:50.010> best<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.630> definitely<00:03:52.200> made<00:03:52.730> for<00:03:53.730> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
the best this is definitely made for the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.630 
the best this is definitely made for the
application<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.840> I'm<00:03:55.380> using<00:03:55.620> now<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.280> one

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
application that I'm using now and one

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.730 
application that I'm using now and one
thing<00:03:56.670> about<00:03:56.910> sound<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.660> really<00:03:57.960> depends<00:03:58.620> on

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
thing about sound it really depends on

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.010 
thing about sound it really depends on
the<00:03:58.800> application<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.880> depends<00:04:00.510> on<00:04:00.570> how<00:04:00.780> far

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
the application it depends on how far

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.390 
the application it depends on how far
you're<00:04:01.200> shooting<00:04:01.560> from<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.800> camera<00:04:02.160> where

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you're shooting from the camera where

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.880 
you're shooting from the camera where
you're<00:04:02.640> shooting<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.630> background<00:04:04.170> noise<00:04:04.440> and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
you're shooting the background noise and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.330 
you're shooting the background noise and
so<00:04:05.160> on<00:04:05.340> but<00:04:06.060> for<00:04:06.300> video<00:04:06.630> blogging<00:04:07.080> I'm<00:04:07.800> going

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
so on but for video blogging I'm going

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.360 
so on but for video blogging I'm going
to<00:04:08.520> probably<00:04:09.180> guess<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.800> the<00:04:11.010> best

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
to probably guess that this is the best

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.080 
to probably guess that this is the best
quality<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.380> can<00:04:13.620> get<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.130> budget<00:04:14.400> and

quality that you can get on a budget and
what's<00:04:15.720> important<00:04:16.230> is<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.710> Sony<00:04:16.980> is

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
what's important is that the Sony is

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.289 
what's important is that the Sony is
plugged<00:04:17.460> in<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:18.150> this<00:04:18.450> if<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.080> were<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.560> plug<00:04:19.859> in

hearing<00:04:30.350> now<00:04:30.380> and<00:04:30.890> that's<00:04:31.070> because<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.520> sound

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850

to<00:04:44.090> get<00:04:44.240> what<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.200> also<00:04:45.410> like<00:04:45.830> about<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.970> setup

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
to get what I also like about the setup

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.020 
to get what I also like about the setup
that<00:04:47.390> I'm<00:04:47.630> using<00:04:47.870> right<00:04:48.200> now<00:04:48.230> is<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:49.730> the

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
that I'm using right now is that the

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.370 
that I'm using right now is that the
task<00:04:50.270> cam<00:04:50.660> makes<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:51.200> easy<00:04:51.530> to<00:04:51.920> shoot<00:04:52.550> outside

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
task cam makes it easy to shoot outside

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.430

an<00:04:54.380> alternative<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.520> would<00:04:55.880> be<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.440> USB

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
an alternative to it would be the USB

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.650 
an alternative to it would be the USB
microphones<00:04:58.370> that<00:04:58.640> are<00:04:58.700> popular<00:04:59.270> because

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
microphones that are popular because

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.290 
microphones that are popular because
that<00:04:59.930> bypasses<00:05:00.800> any<00:05:00.830> crappy<00:05:01.610> sound<00:05:01.820> card<00:05:02.150> you

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
that bypasses any crappy sound card you

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.990 
that bypasses any crappy sound card you
have<00:05:02.450> on<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.900> computer<00:05:03.460> but<00:05:04.460> then<00:05:04.610> again<00:05:04.700> you

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
have on your computer but then again you

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.720 
have on your computer but then again you
need<00:05:05.240> your<00:05:05.570> computer<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:06.500> it's<00:05:06.950> basically

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
need your computer so it's basically

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.930 
need your computer so it's basically
only<00:05:08.000> good<00:05:08.450> for<00:05:08.900> filming<00:05:09.320> inside<00:05:09.610> with<00:05:10.610> a

clip-on microphone and the task cam you
can<00:05:14.090> film<00:05:14.420> inside<00:05:15.080> or<00:05:15.470> outside<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.910> it's<00:05:17.660> just

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
can film inside or outside and it's just

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.650 
can film inside or outside and it's just
one<00:05:18.290> little<00:05:18.500> step<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:19.280> transfer<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.390> file

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
one little step to transfer the file

one little step to transfer the file

the<00:05:23.419> downside<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:23.930> using<00:05:24.140> a<00:05:24.650> clip-on<00:05:25.100> mic<00:05:25.400> is

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
the downside of using a clip-on mic is

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.900 
the downside of using a clip-on mic is
that<00:05:26.000> it's<00:05:26.740> visible<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:27.950> can<00:05:28.130> see<00:05:28.400> it<00:05:28.580> and

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
that it's visible you can see it and

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.700 
that it's visible you can see it and
while<00:05:29.180> it's<00:05:29.330> not<00:05:29.419> a<00:05:29.510> big<00:05:29.810> deal<00:05:29.990> especially<00:05:30.590> if

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
while it's not a big deal especially if

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.990 
while it's not a big deal especially if
you're<00:05:30.830> just<00:05:30.950> going<00:05:31.100> to<00:05:31.160> be<00:05:31.280> talking<00:05:31.730> into<00:05:31.850> the

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
you're just going to be talking into the

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.180 
you're just going to be talking into the
camera<00:05:32.030> it's<00:05:32.480> not<00:05:32.630> as<00:05:32.750> clean<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.770> what<00:05:34.100> I'll

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
camera it's not as clean so what I'll

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.490 
camera it's not as clean so what I'll
probably<00:05:34.400> do<00:05:34.910> is<00:05:34.940> to<00:05:35.210> do<00:05:35.300> a<00:05:35.330> mixture<00:05:35.810> of<00:05:35.930> either

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
probably do is to do a mixture of either

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.150 
probably do is to do a mixture of either
using<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:37.400> clip-on<00:05:38.240> or<00:05:38.510> just<00:05:38.900> using<00:05:39.169> the<00:05:39.590> tascam

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
using a clip-on or just using the tascam

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.700 
using a clip-on or just using the tascam
but<00:05:40.880> putting<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.300> pretty<00:05:41.540> close<00:05:41.930> to<00:05:42.229> me<00:05:42.410> maybe

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
but putting it pretty close to me maybe

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.670 
but putting it pretty close to me maybe
only<00:05:43.040> a<00:05:43.190> foot<00:05:43.640> away<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:44.570> out<00:05:44.780> of<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:45.110> camera

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
only a foot away but out of the camera

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.659 
only a foot away but out of the camera
view<00:05:46.669> and<00:05:46.940> I<00:05:47.660> think<00:05:47.930> that's<00:05:48.110> going<00:05:48.380> to<00:05:48.470> be<00:05:48.669> one

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
view and I think that's going to be one

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.150 
view and I think that's going to be one
method<00:05:50.390> that<00:05:50.600> gives<00:05:50.810> you<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.350> good<00:05:51.740> combination

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
method that gives you a good combination

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.840 
method that gives you a good combination
of<00:05:53.530> sound<00:05:54.530> quality<00:05:55.990> while<00:05:56.990> also<00:05:57.410> not

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
of sound quality while also not

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.940 
of sound quality while also not
introducing<00:05:58.850> a<00:05:58.970> wire<00:05:59.210> to<00:06:00.080> get<00:06:00.229> yourself<00:06:00.680> set

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
introducing a wire to get yourself set

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.880 
introducing a wire to get yourself set
up<00:06:01.130> with<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:02.180> tascam<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.020> sony<00:06:03.290> it's

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
up with the tascam and the sony it's

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.370 
up with the tascam and the sony it's
gonna<00:06:04.010> run<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.280> about<00:06:04.600> $120<00:06:05.600> but<00:06:06.169> it's<00:06:06.290> gonna

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
gonna run you about $120 but it's gonna

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.670 
gonna run you about $120 but it's gonna
offer<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.860> huge<00:06:07.490> step<00:06:08.210> up<00:06:08.419> than<00:06:09.050> just<00:06:09.290> using<00:06:09.500> the

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
offer a huge step up than just using the

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.070 
offer a huge step up than just using the
default<00:06:09.890> microphone<00:06:10.729> and<00:06:11.090> whatever<00:06:11.690> camera

you<00:06:12.440> actually<00:06:12.800> have<00:06:13.010> so<00:06:13.820> my<00:06:14.180> recommendation

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
you actually have so my recommendation

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.230 
you actually have so my recommendation
for<00:06:14.930> you<00:06:15.200> is<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:15.919> upgrade<00:06:16.400> your<00:06:16.550> sound<00:06:16.880> first

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
for you is to upgrade your sound first

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.680 
for you is to upgrade your sound first
and<00:06:17.570> then<00:06:18.410> once<00:06:18.680> your<00:06:18.890> sound<00:06:19.190> is<00:06:19.550> is<00:06:20.030> upgraded

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
and then once your sound is is upgraded

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.510
