exhaust throttle body and cylinder head

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.190 
exhaust throttle body and cylinder head
which<00:01:18.090> gives<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> plenty<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> torque<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
which gives you plenty of torque off the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.710 
which gives you plenty of torque off the
bottom<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.710> still<00:01:20.369> good<00:01:20.610> over<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
bottom and still good over it and the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.420 
bottom and still good over it and the
power<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> engine<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.590> smooth<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
power of the engine is smooth right the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.920 
power of the engine is smooth right the
way<00:01:23.520> through<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.119> don't<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.509> hard<00:01:24.750> hat

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
way through so you don't have a hard hat

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
way through so you don't have a hard hat
which<00:01:25.140> makes<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.740> easy<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.159> write<00:01:26.369> just

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
which makes it really easy to write just

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
which makes it really easy to write just
as<00:01:27.210> pension2<00:01:27.600> has<00:01:27.900> been<00:01:28.080> updated<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.619> when

as pension2 has been updated and when
i've<00:01:28.950> been<00:01:28.979> writing<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.520> i<00:01:29.640> found<00:01:29.909> said<00:01:30.659> it's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
i've been writing it i found said it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.359 
i've been writing it i found said it's

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
450 comes out with the LOA which i think

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.920 
450 comes out with the LOA which i think
looks<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.040> true<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.600> unique<00:01:42.899> to

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
looks really true and as unique to

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.929 
looks really true and as unique to
suzuki<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.799> new<00:01:43.950> alloy<00:01:44.130> frames<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.759> neat

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
suzuki the new alloy frames really neat
and<00:01:45.119> since<00:01:45.570> I've<00:01:45.689> been<00:01:45.810> writing<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.409> found

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and since I've been writing it I found

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.550 
and since I've been writing it I found
that<00:01:46.829> tunes<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.970> good<00:01:48.210> much<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.110> 250

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that tunes really good much like a 250

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830 
that tunes really good much like a 250
for<00:01:49.740> 3<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.000> doesn't<00:01:51.299> give<00:01:51.390> away<00:01:51.509> top

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
for 3 and it doesn't give away top

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.569 
for 3 and it doesn't give away top
instability<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.040> gives<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> really

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
instability so it gives you a really

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.100 
instability so it gives you a really
good<00:01:53.610> peace<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> mind<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.570> best<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.960> both
