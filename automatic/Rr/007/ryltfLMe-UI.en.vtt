00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.070 

that's<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.030> first<00:01:52.240> pattern<00:01:52.479> but<00:01:52.720> it's<00:01:52.840> also

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
that's the first pattern but it's also

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.440 
that's the first pattern but it's also
the<00:01:53.380> first<00:01:53.590> step<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.369> second<00:01:54.880> pattern<00:01:55.090> you

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
the first step the second pattern you

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.210 
the first step the second pattern you
may<00:01:55.659> already<00:01:55.869> be<00:01:56.110> able<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.470> play<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:56.920> that's<00:01:57.009> a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
may already be able to play and that's a

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.370 
may already be able to play and that's a
shuffled<00:01:57.729> bass<00:01:57.970> drum<00:01:58.330> pattern<00:01:58.750> the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
shuffled bass drum pattern the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.410 
shuffled bass drum pattern the
subdivision<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.460> going<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.670> be<00:02:00.759> triplets<00:02:01.119> and

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
subdivision is going to be triplets and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.699 
subdivision is going to be triplets and
we're<00:02:01.509> gonna<00:02:01.630> play<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.990> first<00:02:02.289> and<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.679> third

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
we're gonna play the first and the third

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.350 
we're gonna play the first and the third
triplet<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.610> every<00:02:03.970> beat

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
triplet of every beat

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.749 
triplet of every beat
so<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.750> our<00:02:04.840> kick<00:02:05.080> drum<00:02:05.110> it'll<00:02:05.470> go<00:02:05.679> one<00:02:06.250> lolli

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
so in our kick drum it'll go one lolli

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:41.520 
so in our kick drum it'll go one lolli
to<00:02:07.060> lolli<00:02:07.659> three<00:02:08.019> lolli<00:02:08.560> for<00:02:08.920> lolli

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.679 

in<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:43.579> third<00:02:43.819> step<00:02:44.060> we're<00:02:44.269> simply<00:02:44.510> going<00:02:44.629> to

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
in the third step we're simply going to

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.050 
in the third step we're simply going to
modify<00:02:45.139> that<00:02:45.349> first<00:02:45.829> pattern<00:02:46.250> what<00:02:46.939> we're

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
modify that first pattern what we're

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.369 
modify that first pattern what we're
gonna<00:02:47.150> do<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.540> we're<00:02:47.689> now<00:02:47.780> going<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.049> add<00:02:48.200> an

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
gonna do is we're now going to add an

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.640 
gonna do is we're now going to add an
accent<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.159> beats<00:02:49.400> 2<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.030> beats<00:02:50.569> 4<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.379> that's

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
accent on beats 2 and beats 4 and that's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.159 
accent on beats 2 and beats 4 and that's
going<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:52.010> complete<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:53.030> disco<00:02:53.480> shuffle<00:02:54.049> now

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
going to complete the disco shuffle now

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:55.780 
going to complete the disco shuffle now
that's<00:02:54.650> going<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.829> cause<00:02:55.129> you<00:02:55.159> to<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.519> to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
that's going to cause you to have to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.539 
that's going to cause you to have to
play<00:02:55.969> a<00:02:55.999> tap<00:02:56.499> followed<00:02:57.499> by<00:02:57.650> an<00:02:57.799> accent

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
play a tap followed by an accent

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.789 
play a tap followed by an accent
followed<00:02:59.120> by<00:02:59.269> another<00:02:59.510> tap<00:02:59.959> ok<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.560> we're

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
followed by another tap ok so we're

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.159 
followed by another tap ok so we're
gonna<00:03:00.919> have<00:03:01.189> a<00:03:01.219> tap<00:03:01.639> down<00:03:02.180> stroke<00:03:02.540> accent<00:03:03.049> and

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
gonna have a tap down stroke accent and

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:52.840 
gonna have a tap down stroke accent and
then<00:03:03.469> another<00:03:03.709> tap

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:04:35.620 

I<00:04:33.040> hope<00:04:34.040> this<00:04:34.220> lesson<00:04:34.490> helps<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.060> see<00:04:35.330> how<00:04:35.360> a

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
couple of simple patterns put together

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.670 
couple of simple patterns put together
in<00:04:37.790> the<00:04:37.880> right<00:04:37.910> way<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.750> yield<00:04:39.110> some<00:04:39.410> pretty
