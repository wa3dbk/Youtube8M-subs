00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:13.019
 to the olive tree is all Provence 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:16.049
 all the Mediterranean in a small 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 shrub and keep potted on a balcony 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.780
 a terrace 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.240
 well it's not very complicated to 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.980
 what it needs and well before any two 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.580
 suns the olive tree is a tent of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.020
 full light 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 they must also have something 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.920
 eat because yes, an olive tree needs it 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.510
 to drink well and eat well for 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.329
 produce fruits 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 look at this subject here it's small he has 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.219
 already beautiful olive and then it takes 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.469
 humidity and for that we will put it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 in a double walled pot that makes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.949
 also scoops office and avoids 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 to have a second cuts himself underneath 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.480
 can then proceed to repotting and then 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.559
 we will carve it a little bit not 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 that it is essential 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.339
 but it does not take too much 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.460
 place on a small balcony it's gone 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.359
 start by taking out the place of his potty 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 check that the new poet enough 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.069
 great to contain it paid to the fund 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 a little soil for plants 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:07.620
 Mediterranean well suited to this type 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.080
 of us usb buffer place the fashion of 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.090
 root in the pot then add 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.210
 potting on the sides to fill the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210
 empty 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.270
 tapping to tamp the soil is 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.049
 possibly supported to remove 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.850
 pockets of air gently water on all 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.860
 the surface 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.020
 where he was thrashed a lot tamp down and 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.490
 form a hollow add years to that 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.490
 the top of the root ball is not up to us 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:45.280
 bury a little late fertilizer that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.920
 will feed the olive tree finally plan a little 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.229
 size if necessary pointed rods 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.690
 the longest ones by removing five to ten 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.369
 centimeters this size is optional 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.320
 but it is useful for keeping him a 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.490
 pretty ball-like port and harvesting 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.490
 olives will be for the end of autumn
