00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
a really short match I think we'll be

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.860 
a really short match I think we'll be
able<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.400> dominate<00:03:10.610> it<00:03:11.000> because<00:03:11.390> if<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.660> see

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
able to dominate it because if you see

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.090 
able to dominate it because if you see
we<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> whole<00:03:12.440> bunch<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.739> stuff<00:03:12.800> on

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.440 
we have a whole bunch of this stuff on
we<00:03:13.220> might<00:03:13.370> as<00:03:13.459> well<00:03:13.489> put<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.760> gold<00:03:13.940> boots<00:03:14.150> on<00:03:14.330> as

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
we might as well put a gold boots on as

we might as well put a gold boots on as
well<00:03:15.580> let's<00:03:16.580> see<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.660> we<00:03:17.690> have<00:03:17.840> any<00:03:17.959> food<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.320> we

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
well let's see do we have any food it we

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.130 
well let's see do we have any food it we
have<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:19.160> up<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.780> alright<00:03:20.780> so<00:03:20.840> we<00:03:21.050> have

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
have that up there alright so we have

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.810 
have that up there alright so we have
eight<00:03:21.320> arrows<00:03:21.530> we'll<00:03:21.860> keep<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.250> mind<00:03:22.459> and

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820

I think we should bring this down too

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.570 
I think we should bring this down too
because<00:03:24.470> we<00:03:24.770> need<00:03:24.920> some<00:03:25.160> foods<00:03:25.400> with
