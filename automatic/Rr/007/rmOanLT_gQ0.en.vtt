00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
bushing out so we're just going to use a

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:08.370 
bushing out so we're just going to use a
screwdriver<00:01:04.950> just<00:01:06.390> push<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.600> out<00:01:07.659> right

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:15.069 

okay<00:04:05.829> bushing<00:04:06.829> is<00:04:08.680> seated<00:04:13.569> there<00:04:14.569> we<00:04:14.689> can<00:04:14.870> put

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
okay bushing is seated there we can put

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:27.460 
okay bushing is seated there we can put
our<00:04:18.160> control<00:04:19.190> um<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:20.720> frame<00:04:21.049> bolt<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:26.470> let's

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
our control um the frame bolt in let's

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.070 
our control um the frame bolt in let's
pull<00:04:27.860> this<00:04:28.039> up<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.370> little<00:04:28.550> bit

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
pull this up a little bit

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:41.959

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
we have both sides of the control on

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.560 
we have both sides of the control on
tight<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:02.190> now<00:05:02.820> we're<00:05:02.970> going<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.120> check<00:05:03.540> for

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
tight and now we're going to check for

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.990 
tight and now we're going to check for
plate<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:05.310> see<00:05:05.550> if<00:05:05.700> our<00:05:06.350> new<00:05:07.350> Bush<00:05:08.000> improve

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
plate and see if our new Bush improve

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.720 
plate and see if our new Bush improve
