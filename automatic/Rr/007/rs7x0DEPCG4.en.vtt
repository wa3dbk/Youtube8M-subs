00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
first things first I'm going to start

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.360 
first things first I'm going to start
off<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.380> share<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.710> craft<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.219> need

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
off when I share to craft it you need

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.520 
off when I share to craft it you need
the<00:00:35.550> regular<00:00:36.000> jukebox<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> basically<00:00:37.050> you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the regular jukebox and basically you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
the regular jukebox and basically you
surround<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.100> by<00:00:38.280> four<00:00:38.730> diamonds<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.300> each<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
surround it by four diamonds in each of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
surround it by four diamonds in each of
the<00:00:39.629> four<00:00:39.840> corners<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.670> crafting<00:00:41.670> grid

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the four corners of the crafting grid

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.990 
the four corners of the crafting grid
and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.410> jukebox<00:00:43.890> 2<00:00:44.460> point<00:00:44.789> 0

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and then you have your jukebox 2 point 0

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.910 
and then you have your jukebox 2 point 0
basically<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.350> another<00:00:46.559> block

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
basically this is just another block

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
basically this is just another block
once<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.629> put<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.050> your

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
once you have it you can put it on your

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.229 
once you have it you can put it on your
bar<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.340> click<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> place<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.090> and
