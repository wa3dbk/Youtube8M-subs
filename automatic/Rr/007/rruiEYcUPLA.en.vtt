stupid hammer anyway your controller

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.350 
stupid hammer anyway your controller
should<00:02:11.879> look<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:13.489> no<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.519> did<00:02:14.940> not<00:02:14.970> take

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
doing a new controller there will be two

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.780 
doing a new controller there will be two
screws<00:03:09.810> one<00:03:10.319> in<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.650> top<00:03:10.889> corner<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.489> one<00:03:11.639> in
