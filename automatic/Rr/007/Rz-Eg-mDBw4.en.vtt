the neck or by their sides it really

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.670 
the neck or by their sides it really
distorts<00:00:18.420> their<00:00:18.600> overall<00:00:18.930> flush<00:00:19.199> condition

and also distorts the finish and
evenness<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> code<00:00:23.240> so<00:00:24.240> it's<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> great<00:00:24.720> idea

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
evenness of code so it's a great idea

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.200 
evenness of code so it's a great idea
not<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.529> ever<00:00:25.680> grab<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.189> animal<00:00:26.550> along<00:00:27.029> its

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240 
be even right over the top of the hip
this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.809> correctly<00:00:46.170> posed<00:00:46.469> mini<00:00:46.770> Rex<00:00:47.010> so

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
this is a correctly posed mini Rex so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
this is a correctly posed mini Rex so
you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> properly<00:00:47.789> evaluate<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> body<00:00:48.600> type

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
you can properly evaluate the body type

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.299 
you can properly evaluate the body type
you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> animal<00:00:49.920> starts<00:00:50.160> well

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you can see if the animal starts well

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.920 
you can see if the animal starts well
right<00:00:50.520> over<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.760> top<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> shoulder<00:00:51.449> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
right over the top of the shoulder it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
right over the top of the shoulder it
rounds<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.500> right<00:00:52.770> over<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> top<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
rounds well right over the top of the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
rounds well right over the top of the
hip<00:00:53.550> has<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> nice<00:00:54.300> solid<00:00:54.629> full<00:00:54.809> hind<00:00:55.050> quarter

hip has a nice solid full hind quarter
if<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> animal<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.670> posed<00:00:56.969> correctly<00:00:57.510> if

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
if the animal is not posed correctly if

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.599 
if the animal is not posed correctly if
they're<00:00:58.109> over<00:00:58.260> posed<00:00:58.620> or<00:00:58.829> under<00:00:59.100> posed<00:00:59.340> it

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
they're over posed or under posed it

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.150 
they're over posed or under posed it
will<00:00:59.789> distort<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.420> overall<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.160> top-line

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
will distort the overall of top-line

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
will distort the overall of top-line
profile<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.059> fullest<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> body<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
profile and fullest the body that the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
profile and fullest the body that the
animal<00:01:04.559> has<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.220> getting<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> true

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
animal has so you're not getting a true

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.480 
animal has so you're not getting a true
evaluation<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:06.840> animal<00:01:07.280> really<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
evaluation of what your animal really is

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
evaluation of what your animal really is
if<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.510> over<00:01:10.020> posed<00:01:10.229> these<00:01:10.470> animals<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.310> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
if you over posed these animals when you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.480 
if you over posed these animals when you
push<00:01:11.820> their<00:01:12.000> back<00:01:12.180> feet<00:01:12.830> forward<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.340> they're

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
push their back feet forward so they're

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.920 
push their back feet forward so they're
not<00:01:14.580> even<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> center<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.540> hip<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
not even with the center of the hip to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.679 
not even with the center of the hip to
push<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.409> over<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> front<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> rib<00:01:18.420> cage

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
push more over the front of the rib cage

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
push more over the front of the rib cage
it<00:01:19.170> makes<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> animals<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:19.979> nice<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> deep

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
it makes the animals look nice and deep

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
it makes the animals look nice and deep
and<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> storks<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> top-line<00:01:22.140> makes

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and also the storks that top-line makes

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109 
and also the storks that top-line makes
them<00:01:22.560> slide<00:01:22.830> very<00:01:23.159> fast<00:01:23.460> over<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> top<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
them slide very fast over the top the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
them slide very fast over the top the
hip<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> makes<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.200> look<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.470> they're

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
hip and it makes them look like they're

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
hip and it makes them look like they're
very<00:01:25.860> pinched<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.820> full<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.360> lower

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
very pinched not full in that lower

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.350 
very pinched not full in that lower
hindquarters<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.759> really<00:01:29.759> distorts<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
hindquarters so it really distorts the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.819 
hindquarters so it really distorts the
overall<00:01:30.659> top-line<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> makes<00:01:31.409> them<00:01:31.500> look<00:01:31.590> nice

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
overall top-line it makes them look nice

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
overall top-line it makes them look nice
and<00:01:32.040> deep<00:01:32.159> from<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.460> distance<00:01:32.850> people<00:01:33.420> think

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
and deep from a distance people think

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
and deep from a distance people think
wow<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> great<00:01:34.229> nice<00:01:34.500> deep<00:01:34.799> rabbit<00:01:35.130> but
