yo what's happening guys it's on host to

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.610 
yo what's happening guys it's on host to
your<00:00:02.370> native<00:00:02.639> visions<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.270> today<00:00:03.810> be<00:00:04.350> talking

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
your native visions and today be talking

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.499 
your native visions and today be talking
a<00:00:04.680> little<00:00:04.740> bit<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.130> pulse<00:00:05.490> Lin<00:00:06.000> Turner's<00:00:06.240> or

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
a little bit about pulse Lin Turner's or

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.660 
a little bit about pulse Lin Turner's or
pulse<00:00:06.750> extenders<00:00:07.259> they're<00:00:08.010> both<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.370> exact

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
pulse extenders they're both the exact

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.200 
pulse extenders they're both the exact
same<00:00:08.700> thing<00:00:09.290> the<00:00:10.290> point<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.769> them<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.880> send

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
same thing the point of them is to send

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.209 
same thing the point of them is to send
an<00:00:12.300> output<00:00:12.599> signal<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.679> will<00:00:13.830> constantly

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
an output signal that will constantly

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.109 
an output signal that will constantly
power<00:00:14.549> your<00:00:15.500> your<00:00:16.500> desired<00:00:17.090> output<00:00:18.350> for<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
power your your desired output for a

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.170 
power your your desired output for a
certain<00:00:21.119> delayed<00:00:21.420> amount<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> time<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:23.180> these

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
certain delayed amount of time and these

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
certain delayed amount of time and these
are<00:00:24.300> four<00:00:24.480> different<00:00:24.750> models<00:00:24.840> they<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.590> act

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
are four different models they all act

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.640 
are four different models they all act
the<00:00:25.890> same<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.599> one<00:00:27.599> wire<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.109> sends<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the same they have one wire that sends a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.189 
the same they have one wire that sends a
direct<00:00:28.980> signal<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.720> another<00:00:30.720> piece<00:00:31.050> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
direct signal and another piece of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.979 
direct signal and another piece of
circuitry<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.740> will<00:00:32.099> delay<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> time<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
circuitry that will delay the time that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.580 
circuitry that will delay the time that
the<00:00:34.260> redstone<00:00:34.649> wire<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.190> output<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> lit

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
the redstone wire for the output is lit

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.650 
the redstone wire for the output is lit
so<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.190> yeah<00:00:38.340> these<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.510> was

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
so so yeah these are I think this was

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
so so yeah these are I think this was
the<00:00:39.690> first<00:00:39.809> model<00:00:40.230> made<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:41.550> could<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the first model made you could see it

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
the first model made you could see it
acts<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.290> little<00:00:43.410> bit<00:00:43.590> efficient

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
acts like so it's a little bit efficient

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
acts like so it's a little bit efficient
because<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> would<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.840> use<00:00:45.960> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
because if you would like to use it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840 
because if you would like to use it
again<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.800> after<00:00:47.010> you'd<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> wait<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
again just after you'd have to wait for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.979 
again just after you'd have to wait for
these<00:00:48.020> repeaters<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.370> shut<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:51.750> one's<00:00:51.930> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
these repeaters to shut off this one's a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.069 
these repeaters to shut off this one's a
little<00:00:52.079> bulkier<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.480> actually<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.660> time

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
little bulkier and actually the time

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.139 
little bulkier and actually the time
that<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> takes<00:00:56.160> for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> first<00:00:56.730> signal<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that it takes for the first signal to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.520 
that it takes for the first signal to
get<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.899> bit<00:00:57.989> delayed<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
get there is a little bit delayed so I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.959 
get there is a little bit delayed so I
really<00:00:58.949> don't<00:00:59.100> usually<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.609> use<00:00:59.850> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
really don't usually like to use this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.660 
really don't usually like to use this
one<00:01:00.739> this<00:01:01.739> one<00:01:01.920> might<00:01:02.039> be<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.219> favorite<00:01:02.370> here

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
one this one might be my favorite here

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.160 
one this one might be my favorite here
very<00:01:03.629> compact<00:01:04.080> very<00:01:04.199> sleek<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:06.170> obviously

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
very compact very sleek and obviously

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
very compact very sleek and obviously
these<00:01:07.350> blocks<00:01:07.799> after<00:01:08.400> being<00:01:08.580> hit<00:01:08.729> by<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
these blocks after being hit by the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.620 
these blocks after being hit by the
repeater<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.740> power<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.430> redstone<00:01:12.360> dust

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
repeater will power the redstone dust

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.210 
repeater will power the redstone dust
here<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.580> yeah<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.920> like<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.009> said

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
here and yeah it's it's very like I said

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.010 
here and yeah it's it's very like I said
sleep<00:01:17.520> compact<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.119> efficient<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:20.000> finally

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
sleep compact and efficient and finally

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.100 
sleep compact and efficient and finally
here's<00:01:22.020> another<00:01:22.350> design<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.520> wide

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
here's another design here just one wide

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
here's another design here just one wide
acts<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> same<00:01:25.530> way<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:26.280> top<00:01:26.520> layer<00:01:26.790> will

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
acts the same way your top layer will

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.819 
acts the same way your top layer will
send<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.720> direct<00:01:27.930> signal<00:01:28.409> while<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> bottom

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
send a direct signal while the bottom

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.050 
send a direct signal while the bottom
will<00:01:29.700> delay<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.540> signal<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.820> see

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
will delay the signal and as you can see

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.170 
will delay the signal and as you can see
the<00:01:33.180> redstone<00:01:33.509> wire<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.170> constantly<00:01:34.740> lit

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
the redstone wire here is constantly lit

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
the redstone wire here is constantly lit
so<00:01:36.180> yeah<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.540> main<00:01:36.689> reason<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.590> these<00:01:37.829> is

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
so yeah the main reason I use these is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
so yeah the main reason I use these is
for<00:01:38.930> in<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.079> world<00:01:41.030> use<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.420> of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
for in my world use them for a lot of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270 
for in my world use them for a lot of
doors<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> doors<00:01:43.770> open<00:01:43.829> for<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> little

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
doors keep the doors open for a little

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
doors keep the doors open for a little
bit<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.759> also<00:01:45.540> use<00:01:45.810> them<00:01:45.930> for<00:01:46.110> my<00:01:46.380> cave

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
bit and also use them for my cave

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.240 
bit and also use them for my cave
spiders<00:01:47.549> boner<00:01:48.030> trap<00:01:48.770> as<00:01:49.770> well<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> blaze
