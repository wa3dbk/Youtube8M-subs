simplistic<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.609> split<00:00:27.000> your

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
simplistic that if you split your

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.910 
simplistic that if you split your
characters<00:00:27.660> up<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.109> how<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.349> right

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
now we're playing a 2v2 so I got me on

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.590 
now we're playing a 2v2 so I got me on
this<00:00:31.320> side<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.040> tall<00:00:32.279> ship<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:33.480> know

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
this side of the the tall ship you know

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.090 
this side of the the tall ship you know
the<00:00:33.750> taller<00:00:33.930> side<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> ship<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.680> then<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the taller side of the ship and then I

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950 
the taller side of the ship and then I
got<00:00:35.309> my<00:00:35.430> boy<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.820> other<00:00:36.000> side<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.450> we're

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
got my boy on the other side and we're

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.180 
got my boy on the other side and we're
going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.140> take<00:00:37.320> full<00:00:37.530> advantage<00:00:37.680> because

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
going to take full advantage because

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.380 
going to take full advantage because
we're<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.640> able<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> call<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
we're going to be able to call out the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.510 
we're going to be able to call out the
spawns<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.350> they're<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:41.010> simple<00:00:41.399> I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
spawns because they're really simple I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.709 
spawns because they're really simple I
mean<00:00:41.670> they're<00:00:41.790> either<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> spawn<00:00:42.510> on

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
mean they're either going to spawn on

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
mean they're either going to spawn on
the<00:00:42.870> bridge<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.410> either<00:00:43.710> behind<00:00:43.950> you

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
the bridge with you either behind you

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.069 
the bridge with you either behind you
but<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:45.360> split<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.960> how

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
but if you if you're split up like how

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.720 
but if you if you're split up like how
we<00:00:46.140> are<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.800> don't<00:00:47.010> spawn<00:00:47.219> behind<00:00:47.399> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
we are they don't spawn behind you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760 
we are they don't spawn behind you
that's<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.059> trick<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> gotta<00:00:49.200> split<00:00:49.590> your

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that's a trick so you gotta split your

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
that's a trick so you gotta split your
characters<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.879> gotta<00:00:51.059> split<00:00:51.420> your

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
characters up you gotta split your

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.540 
characters up you gotta split your
players<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.219> side<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
players up so I'm on this side of the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.619 
players up so I'm on this side of the
bridge<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.969> know<00:00:54.059> I'm<00:00:54.149> taking<00:00:54.300> full

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
bridge you know I'm taking full

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
bridge you know I'm taking full
advantage<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.469> they're<00:00:55.739> spawning<00:00:56.070> in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
advantage of them if they're spawning in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.220 
advantage of them if they're spawning in
the<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.579> side<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.329> cavern<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the right side of that little cavern you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
the right side of that little cavern you
know<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:58.500> an<00:00:58.590> IMS<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> watch<00:00:59.670> my

because they're not going to be that
close<00:02:39.820> together<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.450> know<00:02:40.989> depending<00:02:41.470> on<00:02:41.560> how

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
close together you know depending on how

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.440 
close together you know depending on how
bad<00:02:41.890> their<00:02:42.100> spawns<00:02:42.430> are<00:02:42.700> but<00:02:43.180> they're<00:02:43.300> never

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
bad their spawns are but they're never

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.059 
bad their spawns are but they're never
going<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.020> close<00:02:44.200> together<00:02:44.470> so

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
going to be that close together so

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.770 
going to be that close together so
definitely<00:02:45.280> put<00:02:45.640> down<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.940> ims<00:02:46.300> especially

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
definitely put down in ims especially

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.820 
definitely put down in ims especially
when<00:02:46.900> you're<00:02:47.020> striving<00:02:47.200> because<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> does
