but<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:31.080> once<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> extended<00:00:32.040> mags

but I think once I get the extended mags
on<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.700> 1014<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.690> might<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.710> take<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.190> cake

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
on them 1014 it might just take the cake

the<00:00:36.210> range<00:00:36.480> definitely<00:00:37.050> isn't<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.410> long<00:00:37.559> as

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
a great score but they were mad so

either way I was just I was on a mission

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.910 
either way I was just I was on a mission
and<00:02:02.509> yeah<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.079> taking<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.829> him

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and yeah so I was just taking it to him

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.709 
and yeah so I was just taking it to him
that<00:02:05.219> was<00:02:05.340> my<00:02:05.490> goal<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.729> game<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> came

that was my goal this game and it came
out<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.350> pretty<00:02:07.710> nice<00:02:07.890> result<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.520> know

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
intervention and an l 86 I believe but

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.920 
intervention and an l 86 I believe but
there<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.580> heard<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.970> guy<00:03:36.180> coming<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.720> ran

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
there I heard that guy coming so I ran

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.660 
there I heard that guy coming so I ran
out<00:03:37.050> there<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.350> got<00:03:37.470> him<00:03:37.650> for<00:03:37.890> my<00:03:38.250> harriers

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
out there and got him for my harriers

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.880 
out there and got him for my harriers
and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.450> plan<00:03:39.690> am<00:03:39.870> over<00:03:40.110> there<00:03:40.260> by<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.470> rocket

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
and I plan am over there by the rocket

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.990 
and I plan am over there by the rocket
thinking<00:03:41.190> they're<00:03:41.310> still<00:03:41.550> probably<00:03:41.700> gonna<00:03:41.880> be

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
thinking they're still probably gonna be

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.370 
thinking they're still probably gonna be
spawning<00:03:42.330> there<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:42.989> I'm<00:03:43.110> just<00:03:43.230> gonna

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
spawning there and then I'm just gonna

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.830 
spawning there and then I'm just gonna
go<00:03:43.500> ahead<00:03:43.770> and<00:03:43.920> lay<00:03:44.160> down<00:03:44.430> take<00:03:45.390> some<00:03:45.570> cover

go ahead and lay down take some cover
hope<00:03:46.290> my<00:03:46.470> hair<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.709> pick<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.190> my<00:03:47.340> chopper

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
hope my hair just pick up my chopper

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
this up as I just wait you know um yeah

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.830 
this up as I just wait you know um yeah
my<00:03:56.160> team<00:03:56.220> spawning<00:03:56.790> all<00:03:57.030> around<00:03:57.330> me<00:03:57.540> I'm

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
my team spawning all around me I'm

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.780 
my team spawning all around me I'm
hoping<00:03:58.380> this<00:03:58.680> gets<00:03:58.830> me<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.100> my<00:03:59.160> chopper<00:03:59.610> gunner

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
hoping this gets me to my chopper gunner

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.330 
hoping this gets me to my chopper gunner
and<00:04:00.030> luckily<00:04:00.330> it<00:04:00.660> does<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.230> got<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> spoiler<00:04:02.190> but

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
and luckily it does I got a spoiler but

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.729 
and luckily it does I got a spoiler but
my<00:04:03.270> chopper<00:04:03.690> doesn't<00:04:04.020> get<00:04:04.110> me<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> my<00:04:04.530> nuke

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
my chopper doesn't get me to my nuke

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.050 
my chopper doesn't get me to my nuke
which<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.100> think<00:04:05.310> makes<00:04:05.489> for<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:05.790> little<00:04:05.910> bit

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
which I think makes for a little bit

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.000 
which I think makes for a little bit
more<00:04:06.239> interesting<00:04:06.480> gameplay<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.770> at

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
more interesting gameplay you know at

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.470 
more interesting gameplay you know at
least<00:04:08.070> when<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.489> watching<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.970> video<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.420> a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
least when I'm watching a video it's a

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.729 
least when I'm watching a video it's a
little<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.750> interesting<00:04:10.019> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.440> more

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
little more interesting a little more

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.830 
little more interesting a little more
you<00:04:11.400> like<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.610> tension<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.360> be<00:04:12.510> there<00:04:12.690> when

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
you like that tension to be there when

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.120 
you like that tension to be there when
they<00:04:12.959> come<00:04:13.110> out<00:04:13.140> of<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.440> chopper<00:04:13.769> gunner<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
they come out of the chopper gunner and

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.650 
they come out of the chopper gunner and
you<00:04:14.220> know<00:04:14.340> they<00:04:14.459> still<00:04:14.670> need<00:04:14.850> more<00:04:15.000> kills<00:04:15.300> and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
you know they still need more kills and

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.159 
you know they still need more kills and
that<00:04:16.140> is<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.620> case<00:04:16.830> in<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.250> game<00:04:17.489> but

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
that is the case in this game but

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.349 
that is the case in this game but
luckily<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.380> all<00:04:19.470> works<00:04:19.650> out<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:20.100> me<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.910> think

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
