00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that's not bad now you can do this on

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.840 
that's not bad now you can do this on
other<00:01:09.090> mobs<00:01:09.450> we've<00:01:09.810> tried<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> few<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:11.640> tried

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
other mobs we've tried a few we tried

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
other mobs we've tried a few we tried
water<00:01:12.060> fiends<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.020> may<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.350> they<00:01:13.560> give<00:01:13.770> 1000

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
water fiends you may know they give 1000

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
water fiends you may know they give 1000
XP<00:01:14.790> per<00:01:15.090> kill<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.439> wrecked

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
XP per kill but they just they wrecked

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.060 
XP per kill but they just they wrecked
him<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.640> hits<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.439> wasn't<00:01:19.890> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
him in like two hits so that wasn't a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.310 
him in like two hits so that wasn't a
good<00:01:20.189> idea<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.270> tried<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> few<00:01:21.750> other<00:01:21.900> lower

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
good idea and we tried a few other lower

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
good idea and we tried a few other lower
level<00:01:22.650> mobs<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.939> seems<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> pretty

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
level mobs but this seems like a pretty

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.200 
level mobs but this seems like a pretty
safe<00:01:24.810> bet<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.369> also<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.549> guessing<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.030> you're

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
safe bet and also I'm guessing if you're

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
safe bet and also I'm guessing if you're
low<00:01:27.509> combat<00:01:27.990> you're<00:01:28.259> gonna<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> low

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
low combat you're gonna have a low

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.039 
low combat you're gonna have a low
prayer<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.880> drop<00:01:30.119> big<00:01:30.360> bones<00:01:30.689> which

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
prayer and these drop big bones which

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
prayer and these drop big bones which
you<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.560> nothing<00:01:31.950> special<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.329> have

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
you know nothing special but if you have

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.819 
you know nothing special but if you have
a<00:01:33.479> free<00:01:33.720> inventory<00:01:34.140> spot<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.500> could<00:01:34.650> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
a free inventory spot you could it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.859 
a free inventory spot you could it
doesn't<00:01:35.280> take<00:01:35.549> much<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.150> pick<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
doesn't take much just to pick it up and

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
doesn't take much just to pick it up and
bury<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.409> some<00:01:37.710> prayer<00:01:37.950> XP<00:01:38.159> I'm<00:01:39.090> sorry

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
