00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 but then but they are super good 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.150
 today and today I bring you very video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.770
 very very short but it can be a lot 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.670
 utility by itself the same thing happens to them 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.500
 that to me I have an iphone 4s and it makes 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.750
 some weeks ago it broke 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.240
 because I got in the car and the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.750
 cement and really shredded 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 but the am11 that I will obviously send 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.060
 a huge greeting I showed some pictures of 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.730
 instagram where it came out as an idea for 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.460
 do as it was with a casing the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.290
 iphone so he found super cute and 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 I bought the peas chats that are these 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.100
 times they are here there are two 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.190
 versions like the one that brings is the one that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.710
 brings as blue red green and the colors 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.809
 as primary and this is the one that brings well 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.700
 as green through pink moralito fuks 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 and that so obviously I 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.170
 liked more to me to be able to do as 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.879
 this same day this year, you yourself will 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 to be able to recover the back of my 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.270
 iphone that now I am going to show them 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.160
 that had been shattered and 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.109
 that's how it looks so very nice 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.660
 loved it fortunately I have the iphone 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.890
 4 and obviously these only for people 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.930
 that they fall 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.970
 and they will not do it on purpose because 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.100
 it is not one of the purpose of this video 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.080
 actually if the wife this accident 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.780
 from the back they can do this 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.720
 because he recovers very nice and now he 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 I'm going to show them that way 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.750
 precious I love only I'm going to 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.460
 put as well as it takes us more to say that 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.680
 so they can see it but it was like 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 if it was the case of the iphone so is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 how to create that side with colors 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.540
 that you prefer obviously you can 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.340
 be to your liking 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.420
 so thank you very much for the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 idea obviously and I hope to see you soon and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.350
 the thing is that we're going to start so 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.420
 see how I made this super iphone case 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.190
 are that the painted side renovated and what 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.649
 we will need will be char 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.730
 peas an iphone and a paper does not see for 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.730
 clean 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.370
 and 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.140
 what he did was super simple I took the 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.450
 char pieces or the plumes that you 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.460
 choose and then putting a little bit and go 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 cleaning with the napkin or paper not 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.200
 is that you have the idea is to go 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.150
 applying little by little because 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.790
 all colors react different 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.100
 in the cracks in my case the color 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.050
 fuchsia that was the strongest could not 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.690
 leave it a long time but only 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.250
 and applied it immediately withdrew does not 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.740
 so with the colors that are a little bit 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.360
 clearer a little bit more cakes than 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.920
 they had to leave it that they will react 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.710
 little bit so they applied a little 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.360
 color was how I was painting a 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.490
 little by little and mixing the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.390
 one by one colors to be able 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.920
 let them fall and be able to withdraw 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.870
 gently and leaving the color only 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.940
 in the cracks because the colors 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.280
 strong were only engaged as 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.980
 spot the iphone so you must see 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.500
 what color should he be allowed to act and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.330
 which you should withdraw immediately was 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.870
 as well as 20 all the iphone and I love 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.870
 the result 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.340
 or not 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.900
 and those that do not 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:42.640
 and I do not like it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.640
 and 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.790
 the color scheme you choose it and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.590
 how are they mixing colors 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.540
 so I hope you liked this 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.620
 video I loved the result and we 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.620
 we see for the next
