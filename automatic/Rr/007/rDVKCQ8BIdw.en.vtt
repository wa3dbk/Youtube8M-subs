00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
starting point guard he has shown an

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.960 
starting point guard he has shown an
amazing<00:02:40.470> improvement<00:02:40.860> ever<00:02:41.340> since<00:02:41.670> he<00:02:41.790> became

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
amazing improvement ever since he became

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.410 
amazing improvement ever since he became
a<00:02:42.420> Boston<00:02:43.019> Celtic<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.890> now<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.580> think<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.209> is

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
a Boston Celtic and now I think it is

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.050 
a Boston Celtic and now I think it is
time<00:02:45.720> rajon<00:02:46.290> rondo<00:02:46.319> he<00:02:47.160> left<00:02:47.400> for<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.640> Dallas

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
time rajon rondo he left for the Dallas

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.360 
time rajon rondo he left for the Dallas
Mavericks<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> real<00:02:48.959> NBA<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.920> he<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.190> no

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
Mavericks in the real NBA so he is no

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.240 
Mavericks in the real NBA so he is no
longer<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.209> official<00:02:51.870> face<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.739> Boston

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
longer the official face of the Boston

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.000 
longer the official face of the Boston
Celtics<00:02:53.299> we<00:02:54.299> need<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.630> work<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.140> new<00:02:55.620> face

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010

Celtics we need to work on a new face

rajon rondo one thing that we do need to

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.570 
rajon rondo one thing that we do need to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
are on expiring contracts and that means

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.000 
are on expiring contracts and that means
that<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.299> need<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.660> have<00:03:18.750> salary<00:03:19.200> cap<00:03:19.500> room<00:03:19.769> if

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.170 
that list is of course Jared Sullinger
and<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.380> very<00:03:25.709> important<00:03:26.310> piece<00:03:26.549> in<00:03:26.790> terms<00:03:27.000> of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
