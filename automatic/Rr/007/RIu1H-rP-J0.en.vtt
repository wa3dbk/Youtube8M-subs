00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:06.730
 we will start with the terrible palm and it is an outward move to steely brothers 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.369
 which aims to balance 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:10.859
 supports 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.859
 and moving the body in the liquid medium 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.060
 the pressure exerted by the palms of the hands 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.769
 keep the data always moist 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.249
 is always to counteract the desired action 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.500
 the palm movement shaft is executed in the form of eight 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.510
 party leader loss of articulation of the few means 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.190
 despite being considered in the rule as optional 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.950
 there are some palm embankments that are most commonly used because they are considered 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.890
 efficient 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.750
 not preventing that many times every athlete 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.410
 the material carbon dating for the implementation of pt 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.960
 one of the figures 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 often creating their own style 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.090
 we will start by presenting them as the possession term that the most used 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.600
 position in the opposite position cesp in the position of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.930
 front 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.400
 in the support bombardment 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 the action you want is to keep the body still 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.430
 for this the athlete must make movements with the palms of the hands pressing 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.160
 to the bottom of the pool 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.000
 in this case the position of the hand should be in line with the arm exerting 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.720
 a constant pressure with the palm of the hand contrary to the desired action 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.310
 example we have a movement carried out in the basic positions of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 back and front 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.159
 in the back position of land forms should always be located nearby 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.159
 to the hip 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.719
 in the front-facing position terms may be located 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.679
 or body mass center 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:19.829
 or as an example laterally near the thorax
