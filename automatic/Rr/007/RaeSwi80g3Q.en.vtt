00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:06.427
 Behind me you see an incredible collection 

00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:09.692
 of blue glass vases 

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:15.957
 the New York decorator and stained glass designer Luis Comfort Tiffany. 

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:18.868
 I want to concentrate mostly 

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:22.087
 on the most spectacular subject of this group - 

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:23.409
 in the center, 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:29.241
 this made of blue glass in flowing colors from 1913, 

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:33.413
 marking the highest point of this, 

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:39.937
 which is an extended study of materials and forms. 

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:43.301
 The glass is called "favril" 

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:49.375
 and uses the natural and casual beauty of the overflowing colors 

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:50.968
 of the blown glass 

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:56.709
 in this form, a plant-inspired three-pointed aisle. 

00:00:56.709 --> 00:01:00.500
 It scares me every time I look at this object. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.509
 It is so fragile and thin as a shape. 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.777
 What I like here, 

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:13.531
 is the way it combines ancient and modern. 

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:18.823
 Tiffany is inspired by ancient and Tire glass, 

00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:22.443
 who owned this end of flowing colors. 

00:01:22.443 --> 00:01:27.816
 At the same time, he wants to create a striking contemporary subject. 

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:30.152
 The people remained stunned, 

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:33.304
 when these vases were exposed at the Columbus Exhibition 

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:38.554
 and at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900. 

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:43.618
 But what you see in this blue vase of 1913, 

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:46.464
 is like last breath. 

00:01:46.464 --> 00:01:52.880
 And the culmination of this extended rediscovery of form and technique, 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.543
 with which Tiffany became famous all over the world. 

00:01:57.543 --> 00:02:01.872
 .
