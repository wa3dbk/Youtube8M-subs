sky shot and you can find 10 sky shots

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
sky shot and you can find 10 sky shots
to<00:01:00.510> make<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> sky<00:01:00.989> crystal<00:01:01.469> which<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.340> use

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
to make a sky crystal which you can use

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369 
to make a sky crystal which you can use
to<00:01:02.489> take<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.449> flying<00:01:03.960> mobs

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to take down one of these flying mobs

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
to take down one of these flying mobs
which<00:01:05.010> i<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.549> called<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> lot<00:01:06.030> alanya

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
which i think is called a lot alanya

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.539 
which i think is called a lot alanya
something<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.830> can<00:01:07.979> use<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> take

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
something but you can use that to take

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
something but you can use that to take
down<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.150> sell<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.570> kill<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
down and you can sell your kill for a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.980 
down and you can sell your kill for a
120<00:01:11.010> k<00:01:11.159> gold<00:01:11.420> which<00:01:12.420> i<00:01:12.540> think<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> average

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
120 k gold which i think is the average

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.359 
120 k gold which i think is the average
so<00:01:13.470> per<00:01:14.250> sky<00:01:14.520> shot<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:15.060> 2,000<00:01:15.540> gold<00:01:15.659> um

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
so per sky shot is around 2,000 gold um

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.710 
so per sky shot is around 2,000 gold um
let's<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.600> get

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
i made 5448 gold so if I was a tailor I

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.670 
i made 5448 gold so if I was a tailor I
would<00:04:50.080> make<00:04:50.290> probably<00:04:50.980> around<00:04:51.300> 67<00:04:52.300> k<00:04:52.510> in<00:04:52.720> total

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680
