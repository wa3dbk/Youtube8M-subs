heard like 30 different languages and I
was<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.160> like<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.030> wouldn't<00:02:17.300> get<00:02:17.390> that

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
was just like you wouldn't get that

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.820 
was just like you wouldn't get that
anywhere<00:02:17.780> else<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.290> know<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> go<00:02:18.680> visit

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
anywhere else you know you go visit

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.910

somewhere<00:02:19.160> you're<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:21.320> do<00:02:21.560> have<00:02:21.770> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
deal with other people like I said from

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
deal with other people like I said from
different<00:02:24.290> backgrounds<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.280> know<00:02:25.340> when<00:02:25.880> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
different backgrounds you know when you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.120 
different backgrounds you know when you
go<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.240> a<00:02:26.420> college<00:02:26.720> not<00:02:27.410> just<00:02:27.770> you<00:02:28.070> know

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
go to a college not just you know

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.530 
go to a college not just you know
predominantly<00:02:28.760> white<00:02:28.910> school<00:02:29.270> or

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
predominantly white school or

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.950 
predominantly white school or
predominantly<00:02:29.840> black<00:02:30.290> school<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:31.730> were

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
predominantly black school there were

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.590 
predominantly black school there were
segregated<00:02:33.010> institutions<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.970> funding<00:02:35.390> for

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
segregated institutions the funding for

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.870 
segregated institutions the funding for
the<00:02:35.690> schools<00:02:36.020> were<00:02:36.560> very<00:02:36.800> different<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.550> even

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
the schools were very different so even

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.120 
the schools were very different so even
though<00:02:38.030> black<00:02:38.270> people<00:02:38.660> pay<00:02:38.810> taxes<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.710> you

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
though black people pay taxes and you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.130 
though black people pay taxes and you
know<00:02:40.250> at<00:02:40.700> least<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.150> theory<00:02:41.390> would<00:02:41.810> get<00:02:41.990> the

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
know at least in theory would get the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.270 
know at least in theory would get the
same<00:02:42.320> amounts<00:02:42.650> of<00:02:42.740> fundings<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.070> their

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
same amounts of fundings for their

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.910 
same amounts of fundings for their
school<00:02:43.580> they<00:02:44.120> absolutely<00:02:44.300> did<00:02:44.750> not<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.440> so

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
school they absolutely did not and so

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.310 
school they absolutely did not and so
the<00:02:46.460> quality<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.300> black<00:02:47.480> education<00:02:47.960> as

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
the quality of black education as

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.479 
the quality of black education as
compared<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.400> quality<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:50.090> education<00:02:50.750> at

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
compared to the quality of education at

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.670 
compared to the quality of education at
white<00:02:52.489> schools<00:02:52.970> was<00:02:53.510> very<00:02:53.810> different<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.500> think

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
white schools was very different I think

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.440 
white schools was very different I think
that<00:02:54.800> that's<00:02:54.950> carried<00:02:55.430> over<00:02:55.550> in<00:02:55.880> some<00:02:56.150> sense

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
that that's carried over in some sense

but to the world in which we live in and

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.259 
but to the world in which we live in and
so<00:04:02.299> it's<00:04:02.690> not<00:04:02.870> a<00:04:02.900> question<00:04:03.379> of<00:04:03.730> relevance<00:04:04.730> of

so it's not a question of relevance of

so it's not a question of relevance of
the<00:04:05.930> presence<00:04:06.530> but<00:04:07.280> it's<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.549> question<00:04:09.010> will

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
the presence but it's a question will

the presence but it's a question will
the<00:04:10.310> world<00:04:10.639> begin<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.959> give<00:04:12.709> credit<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.750> the

significant contributions that graduates

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.610 
significant contributions that graduates

which we know today some HBCUs tend to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.640 
which we know today some HBCUs tend to

lag with the advancement technology
resources<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.810> I<00:04:33.710> think<00:04:33.740> that<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.280> holds<00:04:34.639> the

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
resources and I think that it holds the

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.960 
resources and I think that it holds the
students<00:04:35.150> back<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:36.680> if<00:04:37.070> they<00:04:37.340> keep<00:04:37.550> up<00:04:37.760> with

students back but if they keep up with

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.529 
students back but if they keep up with
the<00:04:38.090> times

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
the times

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.529 
the times
I<00:04:38.599> think<00:04:38.930> that<00:04:39.110> they're<00:04:39.289> relevant<00:04:40.300> HBCUs<00:04:41.300> are

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
I think that they're relevant HBCUs are

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.750 
I think that they're relevant HBCUs are
still<00:04:41.840> I<00:04:42.169> mean<00:04:42.470> supremely<00:04:42.949> important<00:04:43.610> in

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
still I mean supremely important in

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.080 
still I mean supremely important in
terms<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.360> what<00:04:44.510> they<00:04:44.630> can<00:04:44.690> do<00:04:44.990> for<00:04:46.090> instilling

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
terms of what they can do for instilling

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.480 
terms of what they can do for instilling
a<00:04:47.389> sense<00:04:47.419> of<00:04:47.750> confidence<00:04:48.310> instilling<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.460> sense

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
a sense of confidence instilling a sense

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.950 
a sense of confidence instilling a sense
of<00:04:50.289> acceptance<00:04:51.289> of<00:04:51.620> who<00:04:52.159> you<00:04:52.310> are<00:04:52.690> you<00:04:53.690> know<00:04:53.810> as

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
of acceptance of who you are you know as

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.990 
of acceptance of who you are you know as
a<00:04:53.990> person<00:04:54.470> as<00:04:54.949> an<00:04:55.039> African<00:04:55.340> American<00:04:55.729> if<00:04:55.880> you

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
a person as an African American if you

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.460 
a person as an African American if you
are<00:04:56.150> an<00:04:56.210> African<00:04:56.510> American<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:56.960> even<00:04:57.229> as

are an African American and even as

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.740 
are an African American and even as
white<00:04:58.370> students<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.120> think<00:04:59.360> that<00:04:59.570> the

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
white students I think that the

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.750 
white students I think that the
information<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.320> they<00:05:00.470> can<00:05:00.860> get<00:05:01.099> and<00:05:01.550> just

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
information that they can get and just

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.390 
information that they can get and just
the<00:05:01.849> interaction<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.960> experience<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:04.039> being

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
the interaction in a experience of being

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.580 
the interaction in a experience of being
a<00:05:04.669> minority<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:05.479> think<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:05.960> good<00:05:06.199> for<00:05:06.229> white

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
a minority I think is good for white

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.710 
a minority I think is good for white
students<00:05:07.039> also<00:05:07.250> because<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:07.940> just<00:05:08.240> allows<00:05:08.690> for

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
students also because it just allows for

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.500 
students also because it just allows for
a<00:05:08.960> different<00:05:09.080> perspective<00:05:09.409> I<00:05:09.979> hope<00:05:10.699> that<00:05:11.090> over

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
a different perspective I hope that over

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.469 
a different perspective I hope that over
time<00:05:12.280> HBCUs<00:05:13.280> can<00:05:13.550> get<00:05:13.760> more<00:05:14.389> support

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.610 

let<00:05:18.479> people<00:05:18.629> like<00:05:18.870> I've<00:05:18.990> missed<00:05:19.229> out<00:05:19.379> on<00:05:19.409> I

let people like I've missed out on I

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.529 
let people like I've missed out on I
feel<00:05:19.740> like<00:05:19.800> what<00:05:20.520> my<00:05:20.819> friends<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.180> attend<00:05:21.449> to

feel like what my friends to attend to
HBCUs<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.439> feel<00:05:22.590> like<00:05:22.680> when<00:05:22.800> I<00:05:22.830> see<00:05:23.099> them<00:05:23.279> they

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
HBCUs I feel like when I see them they

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.390 
HBCUs I feel like when I see them they
have<00:05:24.029> a<00:05:24.060> more<00:05:24.360> sense<00:05:24.539> of<00:05:24.629> community<00:05:25.400> versus

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
have a more sense of community versus

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.379 
have a more sense of community versus
going<00:05:26.699> to<00:05:26.849> ODU

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
going to ODU

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.239 
going to ODU
I<00:05:27.539> know<00:05:27.810> people<00:05:28.229> but<00:05:28.560> that's<00:05:28.710> not<00:05:28.830> that<00:05:29.009> sense

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:29.249 
I know people but that's not that sense

I know people but that's not that sense
of<00:05:29.370> community<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:29.879> that<00:05:30.779> makes<00:05:31.020> sense<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:32.270> do

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
of community and that makes sense I do

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.959 
of community and that makes sense I do
not<00:05:33.779> feel<00:05:34.379> connected<00:05:34.919> to<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.279> history<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.669> my
