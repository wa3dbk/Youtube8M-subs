00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:02.800
 how about friends of sitel or dotcom 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.080
 today we are going to learn to see something about 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.690
 of the intelligent objects in the last chapter we saw how to transform 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.489
 an image 

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:13.489
 was through a combination of control keys t 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.999
 with what they could 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.900
 moss reduce and increase that image 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.769
 the problem with filling and without giving an image 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:21.900
 when we do it 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.150
 many times 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.789
 the image is losing resolution 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.710
 what is this 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.909
 who little time with the groupers the image 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:31.900
 pixelated 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.600
 or very low resolution 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.320
 At the time of printing we will attend 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 many problems for the quality of our work 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.400
 that's why we have to take great care of the resolution in this image 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
 for that there are intelligent objects 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 how a goal is created that my people 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.430
 the Vicente manager can be a simple layer 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.780
 or it can be a combination of layers 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.240
 for example 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.240
 I want to convert layer 1 and layer 2 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.230
 a treasure smart object 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.080
 For that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.640
 I'm going to select them 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.270
 pressing the control key 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.640
 while selecting the layers that interest me 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 I click with the right button 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.980
 select the option to convert the intelligent object 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.170
 to distinguish between all our capable of the smart jet 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.610
 is represented by this icon in the lower right corner of the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.860
 slide of our layer 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.120
 the inconvenience that has 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.820
 working with smart objects 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.590
 is that I can not do any pixel modification on top of 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.860
 them as we can observe in the pampered cursor and if I click 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.930
 and appears 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.260
 this dialog box says that if you want to receive be my goal and my people 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.189
 what click 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.430
 in cancel 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.720
 says you can not use brush tools because it's an object 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.340
 smart and you can not the italy internet 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.020
 we click on hockenheim 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 to avoid an intelligent object 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.499
 I'm going to have to be the following 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:16.230
 while pressing the control key we double click on the icon of 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.089
 our layer 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.089
 a dialog box appears and says that 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.799
 after editing the content I have to click on file matched 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.269
 see what it's called 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.899
 no files 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.409
 without title 2 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.569
 I'm in layer 2 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.129
 if ricky that is not 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.310
 I open a new document called capable 2 1 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.719
 a stop st 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.019
 is different 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.779
 do not lose sight of this 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.779
 let's use the overexpose tool 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.989
 I click on the baby's coat 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.989
 I'm going to the browser panel 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.359
 do with my image 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:06.499
 and I go to the eyes of the baby 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.329
 now with my sap school tool selected I'm going to click 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.599
 spoke blue 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.870
 and we are going to add more light to your eyes 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.519
 a very exaggerated light so you can see the difference 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.849
 let's reduce the zoom again 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.169
 lets go see it 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.169
 to the real size 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.200
 let's click on the tab of my previous object 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:39.469
 with what we still have our normal baby 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.189
 let's go back to our archive of the cap of the goal that the huge 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.729
 and we click on file 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.689
 and I'm going to click on an original file 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.689
 and how can we observe the changes made 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.349
 the temporary layer or in the temporary file a cap looks 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.829
 They were made 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.639
 fear commented original 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.859
 if I want to add a mask for example I just want to see the face of the 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.479
 baby 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.569
 a selection 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.569
 and I click on this icon 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:17.889
 they look themselves 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.469
 You deserve the two layers both the original cover and the mask 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:24.139
 if I remove and the link 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.800
 iago click on the move tool 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 and then tried to move the mask 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.500
 the mask behaves as if it were a window 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 through which we see the intelligent object 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:39.370
 that is sometimes useful 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.050
 in others it is not 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.710
 what happens if we link the two layers 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.319
 both the mask layer 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.319
 as the layer of the intelligent object 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.430
 let's click 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.590
 to link them 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.220
 having my tool move selected as it knows click and dragged 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.889
 as you can observe 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.749
 they move both at the same time 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.749
 so the same place 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.060
 movie boys with this we finished 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.529
 the image modification chapter 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:11.229
 until next time
