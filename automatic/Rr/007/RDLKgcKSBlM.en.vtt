00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:15.660
 Well, today was the first match of the match 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:18.029
 turned out to be tense enough so I would 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.740
 called a few cautiously started both 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 sheriff team 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.210
 decided to play defensively that in principle 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.300
 not unusual for the team tried 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.369
 deprive us of space here but not 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.450
 less we are pretty good 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 controlled the ball 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.710
 created several scoring chances to 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.840
 sorry not scored after that lost 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.399
 of our forward mourning and unfortunately and 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.309
 then 2 forced replacement of the cylinder 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.930
 sipriano lost and if on 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.270
 defensive action basically this 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 did not affect the attackers certainly 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.980
 we lacked the ending as shown 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 the course of the match and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 moments that arose we could not 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 to realize 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.369
 we didn’t have enough for which 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.060
 put the last point and I think that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.860
 most of the match, we had a lot of 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.270
 the exception may be ending where there 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.060
 fans made 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.150
 the hosts go ahead and there were several 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.880
 fall dangerous from the corner as well as the principle 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.479
 I think that 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:33.079
 we are excluding these episodes enough 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.210
 reliably played in defense result but 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.740
 we talked before the match about what we 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.160
 come to win therefore 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.560
 Not completely, I still think that the game has 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.420
 we had better quality but 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.400
 sorry 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.600
 the quality is not exceeded that result 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.600
 who would suit us 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.820
 more specifically 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:10.100
 what principle can be claims 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:14.060
 the guys played at the limit of their strength 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.250
 I can pin down some private 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.730
 claim it for internal 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.620
 use let's say it was with us 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.790
 situations where we are in principle ourselves 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.890
 made mistakes and allowed the opponent to dangerous 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 counterattack here these situations which 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.780
 I said there were several and in principle 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.600
 last match in Tomsk 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.910
 Here we completely failed 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.120
 get rid of these errors but in general 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.960
 all played so more or less normal but 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.670
 the game plan was 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:51.180
 put pressure on the opponent's defense 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.370
 go fast on the counter attack 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.320
 they all came out of what was intended 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.990
 number for the fact that all the same rival 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.610
 large forces defended not so much 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.370
 moments we managed to create 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.890
 but nevertheless with us and with standards 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.310
 there was an advantage we understood that we 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.440
 we can survive more and in principle 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.120
 won many martial arts when 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.300
 filed standard but unfortunately too 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:27.970
 didn’t hit the final strike like that 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:29.500
 which would certainly not help me 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.330
 talked about what we basically 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.350
 proved to be very limited in 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.350
 enhancing the game 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.680
 due to the fact that there were already 2 forced 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.560
 replacements and there the third player we have limped 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.740
 let's say so and we did not until the last 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.460
 replacement in the third last here is 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:54.400
 including and for this mourning he is now 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:58.420
 bandage already walks he had bodies there 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.520
 shoulder we asked him and finish the first 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.410
 time several times but several times 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.920
 addressed the coaches asking him 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.880
 replace and after one of the already 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.570
 numerous requests end it 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.770
 replaced but the survey will show I think 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:18.100
 tomorrow what's with him and how are we going 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.109
 prepare already without him we are sorry 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.320
 really not a very simple situation 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.770
 due to the fact that we recently lost there and 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:32.010
 or maximum not now would not want 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.010
 still losing mourning and such 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.710
 but we start hoping with him today 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.039
 would give a cheerful voice feel 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.500
 I feel good this way 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:51.789
 the words he told me 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.639
 admonished us smile and hope that 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:57.949
 get better and look forward to want 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:03.520
 he is said to please him today 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.520
 Unfortunately on the way could not
