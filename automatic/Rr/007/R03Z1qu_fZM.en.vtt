00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.120
 the back to the others was designed to 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.429
 active walking activity 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.150
 day or multi-day hike 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.660
 days where the need for comfort from 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 ventilation 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.119
 and lightness are very important I 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.119
 will you detail the different 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.119
 features features this back with 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.689
 first of all the suspenders that were 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:35.650
 designed with a perforated foam so 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:40.000
 to favor the circulation of the air of a 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:43.720
 side a rather stiff guy and body side 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.750
 we have a match with a soft touch 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.510
 which gives a very airy structure that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.600
 allows to evacuate perspiration from 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.090
 very effective way at the level of 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.079
 belt we will find even foam 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.320
 perforated unlike on the face 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.449
 internal a 3d match that allows there too 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.820
 to optimize the evacuation of the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.000
 sweating a large lumbar chicks 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.770
 allows to properly carry the load on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.710
 on the basin 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.710
 and finally on the back we have a structure 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.469
 very simple which consists of a net 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.070
 stretched by a metal frame a 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:30.100
 spring steel frame that is ready 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 form so as to stretch the net against 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.590
 the back to optimize the circulation of 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.929
 look this structure although very 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.959
 simple ensures comfort 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:47.140
 optimal thanks to the lumbar api 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:50.849
 upholstered and also thanks to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.289
 comfort zones under the straps for 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:56.920
 limit hard points at the level of 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.289
 contact with the back three benefits 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.899
 leading partners tended first of all 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.439
 the air circulation between the back and 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:09.519
 the bag an evaporation of moisture that 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:11.319
 will be facilitated and finally a drying 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.290
 fast that will allow to start again 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.420
 to affix with a dry car thanks to its 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.980
 minimalist structure the back to the others 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.260
 so I say the perfect compromise between 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.260
 lightness comfort and ventilation
