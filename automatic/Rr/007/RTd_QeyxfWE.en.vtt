00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.620
 2 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.010
 I 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.090
 at 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 1 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.430
 ah ah 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.479
 the crazy 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 ap 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.150
 Oh 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.540
 Yes 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.300
 Charles dullin to their magnificent 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.280
 victory tonight after a match 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.540
 difficult Sunday there against aarau we have 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.460
 felt a little tired 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.830
 other analysis there on this meeting 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.960
 after that it's clear I think 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.940
 after the watering match was important 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.080
 to get into the match well they 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.170
 have come under pressure and 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.190
 then came hard after time 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.110
 that we put ourselves in the ried I believe that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.090
 after we imposed our game we are 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.200
 few opportunities we knew how to mark in 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.180
 first half is important 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.400
 and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.569
 and then we have brought the three 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.469
 points out of lucerne i believe that 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.140
 it's the most important thing 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:19.170
 it was difficult at first 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.090
 it's normal we played Sunday in section 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.290
 Above it was a tough game we 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.700
 had heavy legs where he was 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.889
 more and more sharpened that we because 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.760
 here they have not played this weekend 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:35.219
 after we managed the bad pass and 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.769
 here we have we scored this 1-0 for just 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.689
 before half time we managed this thing well 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.310
 next exit it's gates and here it's 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.389
 pretty much the same style of equipped a 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.939
 young man who wants 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.799
 it is the malady you go again 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.500
 score goals 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.810
 we're going to do the maximum already 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.560
 to win not lose especially at home 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.189
 and after this is the ability to mark 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.189
 we are here to do it 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.060
 and 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.889
 we 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.889
 or
