00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.399
 Well, you let me offer you another 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.790
 interpretation don't know how much she is 

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:10.799
 true maybe i thought it up too i'm here 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 die getting ready yes I will die soon 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.959
 so everything that I say should be 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.000
 digitized and posted online therefore 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.510
 the whole course that i read with water in this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880
 year it serves to read 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.170
 its enough quality read it 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.960
 not to you, but to all of you , I will prepare 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.320
 and the figure and put it on the Internet here is the efficiency 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.240
 of my educational action in this 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 audience is zero or even 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.970
 negative you will do worse than you were 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.970
 before 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.640
 Yes exactly 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.940
 I have, as it were, goals, goals, goals, goals 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.579
 miller and improve it no and how is mine 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:01.470
 point of view, too, no, I will convey 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:04.530
 it is undoubtedly hot to make me hot 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 read empty audience try believe 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:17.850
 to me that it is for me that this may be 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.960
 will have even better than you even better 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 read on 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:31.009
 yes better to read me not interested in you 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.009
 worried let me spoil you and that's it 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.810
 more yet 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.840
 and the drum is great 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.580
 even 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.649
 more 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.020
 hospital 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.770
 access 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:33.630
 She comes so can from testimony 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.190
 the fact that we need it we have proven 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.209
 tried that you need to be slow 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.560
 we denied the manifesto 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.560
 would never even hit 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:01.239
 it can do that . from the lecture listen to them and 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.239
 I want an artist at night 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.599
 Wittgenstein in a rage throws a poker 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.780
 the table so she bounces and does 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.980
 there still a couple of turns and out 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.230
 the audience leaves the battlefield nose me 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.519
 July asked last time why am I 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.810
 unhappy and why the efficiency is below zero 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.060
 I replied that there are more enemies 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.939
 getting from his lectures than friends on 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:40.670
 in fact, everything is much worse than no one 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:44.829
 didnâ€™t say anything but what about 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.829
 believe and what I showed you
