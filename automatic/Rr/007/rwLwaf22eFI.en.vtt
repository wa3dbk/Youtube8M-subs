00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
Fortress it could just because of valve

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
people playing at any given time like

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that that was at its peak hours that's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
that that was at its peak hours that's
not<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.469> how<00:00:43.530> many<00:00:43.680> people<00:00:43.829> play<00:00:44.390> overall

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
given moment like I don't even think

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
given moment like I don't even think
battlefield<00:00:49.649> 4<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.730> many<00:00:51.030> people

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
battlefield 4 has that many people

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.990 
battlefield 4 has that many people
playing<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.870> any<00:00:52.050> given<00:00:52.289> time<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.770> PC<00:00:53.250> maybe<00:00:53.760> if

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
playing at any given time on PC maybe if

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.569 
playing at any given time on PC maybe if
you<00:00:54.090> combined<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.989> old<00:00:55.199> gen<00:00:55.620> systems<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.430> new

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you combined the old gen systems the new

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.819 
you combined the old gen systems the new
gen<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.120> PC<00:00:57.180> put<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.079> together<00:00:58.230> then

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
gen and PC put them all together then

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.049 
gen and PC put them all together then
yeah<00:00:59.070> there's<00:00:59.370> probably<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.789> than<00:00:59.940> that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
yeah there's probably more than that

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.819 
yeah there's probably more than that
plane<00:01:00.300> at<00:01:00.420> any<00:01:00.570> given<00:01:00.809> moment<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> fact

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
plane at any given moment but the fact

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.700 
plane at any given moment but the fact
that<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.160> only<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.699> PC<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.589> is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that this is only on PC that is that is

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100 
that this is only on PC that is that is
just<00:01:04.949> incredible<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.240> another<00:01:06.900> thing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
just incredible to me and another thing

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.820 
just incredible to me and another thing
that<00:01:07.260> blew<00:01:07.409> me<00:01:07.560> away

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
that blew me away

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.670 
that blew me away
is<00:01:08.070> how<00:01:08.610> much<00:01:08.939> more<00:01:09.299> they've<00:01:09.750> flushed<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
is how much more they've flushed out and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
is how much more they've flushed out and
how<00:01:10.979> many<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.460> weapons<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> game

like<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.560> picked<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> way

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
like when I picked this up all the way

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.760 
like when I picked this up all the way
back<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.729> 2007<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.810> still<00:01:16.049> remember<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.560> was<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
back in 2007 I still remember it I was a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.410 
back in 2007 I still remember it I was a
freshman<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.340> college<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:17.939> winter<00:01:18.210> break

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
freshman in college it was winter break

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
freshman in college it was winter break
I<00:01:18.600> had<00:01:18.750> nothing<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> walked<00:01:20.580> to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I had nothing to do and so I walked to

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
I had nothing to do and so I walked to
my<00:01:20.880> local<00:01:21.390> gamestop<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.140> was<00:01:22.290> snowing<00:01:22.590> outside

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
my local gamestop it was snowing outside

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.219 
my local gamestop it was snowing outside
it<00:01:23.610> took<00:01:23.820> me<00:01:23.970> basically<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:24.540> hours<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> get

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it took me basically two hours to get

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
it took me basically two hours to get
there<00:01:25.439> another<00:01:25.650> two<00:01:25.860> hours<00:01:26.159> back<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> four

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
there another two hours back so a four

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
there another two hours back so a four
hour<00:01:27.150> round<00:01:27.450> trip<00:01:27.659> but<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.409> was<00:01:28.530> worth<00:01:28.740> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
hour round trip but it was worth it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.740 
hour round trip but it was worth it
because<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.610> able<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> pick<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.450> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
because I was able to pick up this this

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.890 
because I was able to pick up this this
gem<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.619> game<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.460> back<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:32.939> there<00:01:33.479> wasn't

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
gem of a game but back then there wasn't

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.770 
gem of a game but back then there wasn't
a<00:01:34.320> whole<00:01:34.619> lot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:35.070> customization<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
while at the end of my playtime with the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
while at the end of my playtime with the
game<00:01:44.250> they<00:01:44.490> slowly<00:01:44.820> started<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> add<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> couple

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
game they slowly started to add a couple

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.899 
game they slowly started to add a couple
new<00:01:46.049> weapons<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.759> not

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
new weapons here and there I was not

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.450 
new weapons here and there I was not
expecting<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.840> overload<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:49.950> only<00:01:50.130> hats

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
expecting the overload of not only hats

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.679 
expecting the overload of not only hats
like<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> knew<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.060> was<00:01:51.180> gonna<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> lot<00:01:51.630> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
like I knew there was gonna be a lot of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.480 
like I knew there was gonna be a lot of
hats<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.320> what<00:01:52.500> everyone<00:01:52.890> rages<00:01:53.340> about

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
hats that's what everyone rages about

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.130 
hats that's what everyone rages about
when<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:53.939> about<00:01:54.210> Team<00:01:54.540> Fortress<00:01:54.780> 2

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
when they think about Team Fortress 2

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.800 
when they think about Team Fortress 2
but<00:01:55.829> there<00:01:56.040> are<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.549> ridiculous<00:01:57.090> amount

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
but there are just a ridiculous amount

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.630 
but there are just a ridiculous amount
of<00:01:58.020> different<00:01:58.469> weapons<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.219> what<00:01:59.399> was<00:01:59.520> nice

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
of different weapons and what was nice

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.910 
of different weapons and what was nice
about<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.840> seem<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.500> well

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
about it is that they seem to be well

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
about it is that they seem to be well
balanced<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.939> them<00:02:03.060> have<00:02:03.270> their

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
balanced like all of them have their

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.630 
balanced like all of them have their
positives<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.560> negatives<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.369> use

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
positives and negatives like if you use

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
positives and negatives like if you use
a<00:02:05.670> certain<00:02:06.090> weapon<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.750> maybe<00:02:06.899> does<00:02:07.110> 25%

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
a certain weapon that maybe does 25%

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
a certain weapon that maybe does 25%
more<00:02:08.250> damage<00:02:08.729> if<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.910> hit<00:02:09.030> them<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.330> behind

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
more damage if you hit them from behind

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.630 
more damage if you hit them from behind
it<00:02:10.170> also<00:02:10.349> has<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.590> negative<00:02:10.890> attribute<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it also has a negative attribute that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.330 
it also has a negative attribute that
you<00:02:11.700> also<00:02:11.940> take<00:02:12.330> 25<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:13.260> 25%<00:02:14.099> more

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
you also take 25 more 25% more

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.339 
you also take 25 more 25% more
damaged<00:02:14.610> or<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.180> 25%<00:02:15.540> less<00:02:16.050> health

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
damaged or you just have 25% less health

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.170 
damaged or you just have 25% less health
like<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.860> they<00:02:17.190> always<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> min/max

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
like you know they always do a min/max

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.780 
like you know they always do a min/max
type<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.870> thing<00:02:19.050> where<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.860> allows<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.489> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
type of thing where it allows you to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.369 
type of thing where it allows you to
tailor<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> your<00:02:21.480> play<00:02:21.690> style<00:02:21.930> or<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:22.349> a

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
tailor it to your play style or do a

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.960 
tailor it to your play style or do a
different<00:02:22.500> role<00:02:23.040> than<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.340> normally<00:02:23.519> would

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
different role than you normally would

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.699 
different role than you normally would
but<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.569> same<00:02:24.780> time<00:02:25.050> doesn't<00:02:25.260> give<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.560> just

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
but the same time doesn't give you just

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.470 
but the same time doesn't give you just
an<00:02:25.800> inherent<00:02:26.069> advantage<00:02:26.280> over<00:02:26.730> everyone<00:02:27.120> else

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
an inherent advantage over everyone else

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.300 
an inherent advantage over everyone else
who<00:02:27.720> hasn't<00:02:27.959> been<00:02:28.230> playing<00:02:28.530> since<00:02:28.739> day<00:02:28.950> one

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
who hasn't been playing since day one

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.699 
who hasn't been playing since day one
and<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.090> really<00:02:30.599> like<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.989> about<00:02:31.200> Team

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
and so I I really like that about Team

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.400 
and so I I really like that about Team
Fortress<00:02:31.980> 2<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> first<00:02:32.910> time<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.720> still

exactly<00:03:05.819> how<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.090> unlock<00:03:06.510> system<00:03:06.720> works<00:03:07.049> I

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
exactly how the unlock system works I

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.410 
exactly how the unlock system works I
know<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.890> craft<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.819> couple<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.239> them

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
know that you can craft a couple of them

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.089 
know that you can craft a couple of them
but<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.019> pretty<00:03:10.170> cool<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.980> there

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
but it's pretty cool to see that there

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.100 
but it's pretty cool to see that there
is<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> wide<00:03:11.849> variety<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.420> different<00:03:12.810> weapons

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
is a wide variety of different weapons

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.530 
is a wide variety of different weapons
but<00:03:13.769> probably<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.459> best<00:03:14.700> part<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.120> Team

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
but probably the best part about Team

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.080 
but probably the best part about Team
Fortress<00:03:15.780> 2<00:03:16.140> really<00:03:16.680> comes<00:03:16.950> down<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
Fortress 2 really comes down to the

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.910 
Fortress 2 really comes down to the
teamwork<00:03:18.389> aspect<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.889> whole

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
teamwork aspect of it and and the whole

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.309 
teamwork aspect of it and and the whole
class<00:03:20.370> dynamic<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.569> this<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> game<00:03:22.290> that

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
class dynamic like this is a game that

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.039 
class dynamic like this is a game that
truly<00:03:23.190> tries<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.850> have<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.359> different<00:03:24.810> class

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
truly tries to have a different class

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.809 
truly tries to have a different class
system<00:03:25.500> like<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:25.769> you're<00:03:25.889> gonna<00:03:26.010> play<00:03:26.280> as<00:03:26.519> one

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
system like if you're gonna play as one

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.190 
system like if you're gonna play as one
different<00:03:27.120> class<00:03:27.299> over<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.569> other<00:03:27.780> you're

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
different class over the other you're

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.599 
different class over the other you're
gonna<00:03:28.319> have<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> different<00:03:28.799> experience<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.549> it

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
gonna have a different experience and it

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.789 
gonna have a different experience and it
has<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> different<00:03:30.239> type<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.450> playstyle<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.440> if

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
has a different type of playstyle and if

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.110 
has a different type of playstyle and if
you<00:03:31.889> go<00:03:32.099> against<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.489> team<00:03:32.670> that's<00:03:32.910> only

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
you go against a team that's only

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.699 
you go against a team that's only
running<00:03:33.510> Scouts<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:34.349> gonna<00:03:34.470> be<00:03:34.590> hilarious

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
running Scouts it's gonna be hilarious

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.110 
running Scouts it's gonna be hilarious
because<00:03:35.310> they're<00:03:35.489> gonna<00:03:35.579> be<00:03:35.730> bouncing<00:03:36.060> around

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
because they're gonna be bouncing around

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.089 
because they're gonna be bouncing around
all<00:03:36.420> over<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.780> place<00:03:37.019> but<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:37.560> you're<00:03:37.709> in<00:03:37.950> a

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
all over the place but if you're in a

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.500 
all over the place but if you're in a
team<00:03:38.160> oriented<00:03:38.670> game-mode<00:03:39.269> where<00:03:39.299> you

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
team oriented game-mode where you

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.970 
team oriented game-mode where you
actually<00:03:39.660> have<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:39.959> capture<00:03:40.230> objectives

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
actually have to capture objectives

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.379 
actually have to capture objectives
they're<00:03:41.370> gonna<00:03:41.489> have<00:03:41.670> a<00:03:41.700> pretty<00:03:41.940> hard<00:03:42.150> time

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
they're gonna have a pretty hard time

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.270 
they're gonna have a pretty hard time
winning<00:03:42.750> against<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> know<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> medic<00:03:44.069> or<00:03:44.220> a

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
winning against you know a medic or a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.129 
winning against you know a medic or a
heavy<00:03:44.519> combo<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.209> guess<00:03:45.389> it's<00:03:45.599> just<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.900> gonna

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
heavy combo I guess it's just not gonna

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.440 
heavy combo I guess it's just not gonna
happen<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:47.609> that<00:03:47.910> type<00:03:48.269> of

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
happen and so it's it's that type of

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.440 
happen and so it's it's that type of
teamwork<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:49.109> must<00:03:49.980> be<00:03:50.130> why<00:03:50.639> so<00:03:51.000> many<00:03:51.150> people

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
teamwork that must be why so many people

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.330 
teamwork that must be why so many people
still<00:03:51.780> love<00:03:52.139> this<00:03:52.380> game<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.799> could<00:03:52.950> be<00:03:53.130> just

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
still love this game it could be just

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.500 
still love this game it could be just
the<00:03:53.400> hats<00:03:53.639> like<00:03:53.849> I<00:03:53.940> could<00:03:54.239> be<00:03:54.359> completely

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
the hats like I could be completely

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.970 
the hats like I could be completely
wrong<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.169> everyone<00:03:55.349> is<00:03:55.560> just<00:03:55.709> trying<00:03:55.859> to<00:03:55.889> get

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
wrong and everyone is just trying to get

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.890 
wrong and everyone is just trying to get
as<00:03:56.099> many<00:03:56.250> hats<00:03:56.549> as<00:03:56.669> they<00:03:56.760> possibly<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.329> but<00:03:57.870> I

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
as many hats as they possibly can but I

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.599 
as many hats as they possibly can but I
think<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:58.319> comes<00:03:58.440> down<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.310> core

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
think it just comes down to the core

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.000 
think it just comes down to the core
gameplay<00:03:59.910> itself<00:04:00.419> that's<00:04:00.959> just<00:04:01.380> extremely

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
gameplay itself that's just extremely

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.009 
gameplay itself that's just extremely
satisfying<00:04:02.849> like<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.299> know<00:04:03.510> when<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.810> jump

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
satisfying like you know when you jump

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.960 
satisfying like you know when you jump
into<00:04:04.169> Team<00:04:04.349> Fortress<00:04:04.590> 2<00:04:04.950> here<00:04:05.669> you're<00:04:05.880> gonna

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
into Team Fortress 2 here you're gonna

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.970 
into Team Fortress 2 here you're gonna
have<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.239> good<00:04:06.480> time<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:07.049> well<00:04:07.319> balanced

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
have a good time it's well balanced

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.740 
have a good time it's well balanced
there's<00:04:08.160> class<00:04:08.459> dynamic<00:04:09.120> there<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.510> can<00:04:09.630> have

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
there's class dynamic there you can have

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.569 
there's class dynamic there you can have

a different play style it's got a good

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.620 
a different play style it's got a good

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
netcode system great frames per second

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.539 
netcode system great frames per second
it's<00:04:15.720> got<00:04:15.810> an<00:04:15.930> amazing<00:04:16.410> art<00:04:16.620> style<00:04:16.950> like<00:04:17.400> this

it's got an amazing art style like this

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.879 
it's got an amazing art style like this
truly<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:18.120> an<00:04:18.419> amazing<00:04:19.019> game<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.289> I<00:04:19.829> guess

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
truly is an amazing game and I guess

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.289 
truly is an amazing game and I guess
just<00:04:20.519> all<00:04:20.700> these<00:04:20.970> different<00:04:21.269> things

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
just all these different things

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.630 
just all these different things
combining<00:04:21.989> together<00:04:22.109> has<00:04:22.890> allowed<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.400> to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
combining together has allowed it to

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.180 
combining together has allowed it to
last<00:04:24.450> through<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:24.840> ages<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.530> seven<00:04:25.919> years

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
last through the ages like seven years

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.400 
last through the ages like seven years
for<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.580> shoe

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
for a shoe

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.980 
for a shoe
is<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:28.190> ridiculous<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:28.910> have<00:04:29.090> 80,000

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
is just ridiculous and have 80,000

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.390 
is just ridiculous and have 80,000
concurrent<00:04:30.380> players<00:04:30.470> at<00:04:30.740> any<00:04:30.890> given<00:04:31.130> moment

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
concurrent players at any given moment

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.240 
concurrent players at any given moment
it's<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:32.570> apparent<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.050> valve<00:04:33.710> just<00:04:34.070> hit

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
it's it's apparent that valve just hit

things that I had a tryout were the
custom<00:04:45.530> maps<00:04:45.770> like<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.190> community<00:04:46.610> has<00:04:46.850> some

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
custom maps like the community has some

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.790 
custom maps like the community has some

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
time it was because it was amazing for

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.010 
time it was because it was amazing for
the<00:05:01.580> sniper<00:05:01.820> like<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> sniper<00:05:02.450> was<00:05:02.720> my<00:05:02.840> go-to

took me like an hour to do it like it
took<00:05:13.820> forever<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.510> think<00:05:14.720> by<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.080> end<00:05:15.230> of<00:05:15.440> it

took forever I think by the end of it

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.810 
took forever I think by the end of it
the<00:05:15.710> enemy<00:05:15.830> was<00:05:16.100> just<00:05:16.250> like<00:05:16.370> all<00:05:16.580> right

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
the enemy was just like all right

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.760 
the enemy was just like all right
already<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.480> kill<00:05:17.780> this<00:05:17.900> over<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:18.440> over<00:05:18.710> and

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
already you kill this over and over and

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.710 
already you kill this over and over and
over<00:05:18.890> again<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:19.910> I<00:05:19.970> still<00:05:20.270> remember<00:05:20.540> to<00:05:20.630> this

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
over again but I still remember to this

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.360 
over again but I still remember to this
day<00:05:20.780> because<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.380> was<00:05:21.500> just<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:21.800> ridiculous

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
day because it was just so ridiculous

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.310 
day because it was just so ridiculous
like<00:05:22.490> 54<00:05:22.940> kills<00:05:23.300> in<00:05:23.630> Team<00:05:23.840> Fortress<00:05:23.870> 2

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
like 54 kills in Team Fortress 2

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.840 
like 54 kills in Team Fortress 2
normally<00:05:24.740> doesn't<00:05:24.890> happen<00:05:25.010> and<00:05:25.460> it<00:05:25.550> pretty

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
normally doesn't happen and it pretty

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.280 
normally doesn't happen and it pretty
much<00:05:25.970> only<00:05:26.240> happened<00:05:26.690> because<00:05:26.780> I<00:05:26.960> was<00:05:27.140> playing

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
much only happened because I was playing

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.920 
much only happened because I was playing
on<00:05:27.500> this<00:05:27.650> map<00:05:27.830> but<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.430> really<00:05:28.580> was<00:05:28.880> one<00:05:29.330> of<00:05:29.480> my

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
on this map but it really was one of my

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.140 
on this map but it really was one of my
my<00:05:30.230> favorite<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:30.920> most<00:05:31.130> memorable<00:05:31.670> gaming

moments<00:05:32.390> but<00:05:33.110> overall<00:05:33.440> I<00:05:33.890> am<00:05:33.920> so<00:05:34.340> glad<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.670> I

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
moments but overall I am so glad that I

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.670 
moments but overall I am so glad that I
went<00:05:35.060> back<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.450> played<00:05:35.600> this<00:05:35.900> game<00:05:36.140> it's<00:05:36.440> it's

went back and played this game it's it's
it's<00:05:36.920> different<00:05:37.280> from<00:05:37.460> what<00:05:37.700> I<00:05:37.730> remember

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
it's different from what I remember

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.490 
it's different from what I remember
because<00:05:38.450> it<00:05:38.570> has<00:05:38.690> all<00:05:38.900> these<00:05:39.080> different

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
because it has all these different

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
people look just ridiculous but the core

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.160 
people look just ridiculous but the core
the<00:05:43.430> core<00:05:43.580> gameplay<00:05:43.880> itself<00:05:44.330> is<00:05:44.630> still<00:05:44.930> the

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
the core gameplay itself is still the

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.840 
the core gameplay itself is still the
same<00:05:45.410> like<00:05:45.680> if<00:05:45.800> you<00:05:45.950> haven't<00:05:46.340> played<00:05:46.550> for<00:05:46.820> a

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
same like if you haven't played for a

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.580 
same like if you haven't played for a
couple<00:05:46.910> of<00:05:47.300> years<00:05:47.480> yes<00:05:48.110> it's<00:05:48.290> gonna<00:05:48.380> be<00:05:48.440> a

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
couple of years yes it's gonna be a

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.750 
couple of years yes it's gonna be a
little<00:05:48.680> different<00:05:49.100> yes<00:05:49.250> you're<00:05:49.430> gonna<00:05:49.550> come

little different yes you're gonna come

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.790 
little different yes you're gonna come
across<00:05:50.030> people<00:05:50.210> that<00:05:50.690> have<00:05:51.200> some<00:05:51.470> weapons

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
across people that have some weapons

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.350 
across people that have some weapons
that<00:05:51.920> you're<00:05:52.070> not<00:05:52.190> accustomed<00:05:52.670> to<00:05:52.730> but<00:05:53.300> it

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
that you're not accustomed to but it

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.630 
that you're not accustomed to but it
still<00:05:53.690> feels<00:05:54.080> like<00:05:54.260> Team<00:05:54.650> Fortress<00:05:54.680> 2<00:05:55.400> like

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
still feels like Team Fortress 2 like

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.310 
still feels like Team Fortress 2 like
they've<00:05:55.820> I<00:05:56.420> don't<00:05:56.660> know<00:05:56.720> how<00:05:56.840> they've<00:05:57.080> done<00:05:57.110> it

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
they've I don't know how they've done it
