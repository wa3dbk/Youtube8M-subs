00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
then we're played up obviously that's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.550 
then we're played up obviously that's
quite<00:02:05.329> a<00:02:05.360> high<00:02:05.570> speed<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.200> change<00:02:06.470> your

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
quite a high speed you can change your

quite a high speed you can change your
speed<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.069> settings<00:02:07.429> piece<00:02:07.759> just<00:02:08.600> here

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
speed in this settings piece just here

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.850 
speed in this settings piece just here
so<00:02:10.789> you<00:02:10.850> can<00:02:10.940> do<00:02:11.060> like<00:02:11.450> lower<00:02:12.140> frames<00:02:12.530> per

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
so you can do like lower frames per

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.740 
so you can do like lower frames per
second<00:02:13.310> sort<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.700> will<00:02:14.090> put<00:02:14.239> down<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.540> save

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
second sort of will put down to save

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.220 
second sort of will put down to save
five<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.880> then<00:02:17.150> like<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:19.900> which<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.049> pretty

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
a big update on it and that's why it's

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.080 
a big update on it and that's why it's
quite<00:02:31.760> down<00:02:32.420> low<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.099> any<00:02:34.099> apps<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.580> in<00:02:34.849> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
quite down low in the any apps to in the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.470 
quite down low in the any apps to in the
app<00:02:35.180> store<00:02:35.209> at<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.630> moment<00:02:35.989> um<00:02:37.180> see<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.209> best

app store at the moment um see you best
there<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.870> 699<00:02:39.620> so<00:02:39.980> it's<00:02:40.100> obviously<00:02:40.340> quite<00:02:40.430> an

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
there is 699 so it's obviously quite an

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.630 
there is 699 so it's obviously quite an
expensive<00:02:41.060> app<00:02:41.480> but<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:43.190> definitely<00:02:43.370> worth

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
expensive app but it's definitely worth

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.080 
expensive app but it's definitely worth
the<00:02:43.820> 619<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.359> in<00:02:44.510> my<00:02:44.660> view<00:02:44.930> definitely<00:02:45.790> as<00:02:46.790> I

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the 619 I in my view definitely as I

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.440 
the 619 I in my view definitely as I
said<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.870> best<00:02:48.109> app<00:02:48.260> I've<00:02:48.500> use<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:48.950> year
