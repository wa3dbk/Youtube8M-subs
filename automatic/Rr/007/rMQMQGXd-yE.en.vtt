00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.530
 I sat down here before the representatives of the word 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.680
 with Bolero Maniac Diaz is not involved 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.450
 This went wrong with me because I have been so since then you have entered 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.630
 Quite well cleared that had gotten exactly 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.699
 It's winter, of course, when they went out 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:46.860
 in the semifinals 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.030
 and I got 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.370
 Total value outside zone Euro a man tells 50 21 inches for 800 euros 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.170
 or 700 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.560
 Narcisse mam word untouched 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.440
 got through on the value of 200 euros lures 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.650
 and what about you 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.700
 and at the beginning of the evening, I'm boring and boring companies 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.030
 would want to play 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 Unger continued to make normal it was Bonn the whole year Kronor sleep and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.040
 Double spin 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.130
 and such auspicious war percent slum bungee no pedestal but not at all 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.820
 and 3000 euros cost really blatantly 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.890
 but still got butter in the part of 4 Euro 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.960
 around the Champagne run should be quite expensive 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.660
 kicked at 19 clock 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.130
 Germany would have to want a leather bag from Oberender to be higher than her 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.160
 that something and 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.170
 that I'm fine 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.070
 what you have agreed 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.430
 almost worth more than the most valuable US lost 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.430
 What does that say about the tournament in general, like the pronounced Two or 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.120
 and so on the icing on the cake, I'm super cool 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.530
 Hammer brought everything very nice a lot of course course old stadium who much 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.560
 Place for many spectators also quite full and 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.580
 Featherweights mix it is warmer inside but he is to 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.850
 otherwise wonderful 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200
 a comment from you about the tournament history of you 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.920

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.029

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.800

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.589
