 ladies approve the triple that for the a5 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.100
 bones so this is a whole followed by a tri 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.540
 for a satchel screen this is the little one 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.310
 idle which is nice to see that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.900

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.010
 Well, he thought I was the first 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.510
 think but finally the two little ones at 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.590
 bottom are made aligned and all 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.820
 others have made their lineage 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.260
 way since there are fifty trine 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.910

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.320

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.410
 clip third place we end up 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.390
 exodus on mw3 viewfinder finally sight of a 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.680
 sniper dream to make me a kill of 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.030
 that they believe they fourth 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.770
 balm insertion for mediation 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.270
 multiple what's really really 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.770
 nice clip perfect it's net it's accurate 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.600
 there is nothing to say in second place in the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.610
 find ex and gasol which is on the map 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.930
 strike area of ​​the cost that's all inks 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.860
 thermal and you'll see he's going 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.000
 we make a very good sequence 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.140
 so he's looking for a little bit 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.640
 enemies that are there they are where they are 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.600
 there they happen it or not he has 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.220
 missed a second third its parts 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.570
 approve the call at he'll pick the 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.640
 emissions to boom the hug for the cua 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.890
 immediately and the 5th unfortunately that does not 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.970
 do not take a back to back colada 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.350
 for the fluid duvet with a small 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.209
 linking from in the end he gets killed 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.140
 but that's not all is there because 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.399
 it's second place and I can you 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.810
 to say that this clip there when I saw them 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.340
 will make it to the goal ultimately he does not have 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.349
 do that and that it's a pleasure 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.810
 he gets killed these paradises continues he 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.470
 takes revenge with 1 2 3 and the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.390
 fourth 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.800
 a second couac fit here in space 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.330
 a few seconds he will redo us 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.220
 a small sequence of two years after 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.840
 so frankly well played to you the 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.580
 thermal links that has nothing to say you 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 mastery and you make very nice clip 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.780
 so with a choice you and first place 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.120
 we end up with mtk who is on the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.670
 map jail break with a double this there 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.740
 sees the lifting ks thermal followed by 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.480
 thermal links he will chain the two 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.920
 small marker it does not matter with the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.570
 veka is that goes anyway very 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.190
 serious rainbow leading cua is 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.140
 with a concatenation of two for 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.550
 keep doubling the tripling itself 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.450
 I could say the empty duvet so we 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.610
 can say that it's really a 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.080
 pig sequence with double snipe 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.820

 clips really sends pate it's been 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.600
 very difficult to make the ranking this 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.400
 morning but in the end I think that ben on 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.810

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.190
