00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.160
 for this planet hunted 25 years sought 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.710
 in the most secluded corners of the sun 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.870
 system in the search group is very sharp-sighted 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 telescopes and inquisitive astronomers and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.080
 here in 1923 hard work 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.650
 crowned with success 23 year old clyde dam 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.080
 discovered a mysterious planet x 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.640
 it is about 40 times farther than the earth 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.040
 from the sun that is on settling on 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.420
 40 astronomical units that 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.880
 he has a very elongated orbit 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.730
 quite elongated different 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.780
 after all from nearly circular orbits of planets 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.940
 solar system 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.789
 its time the ninth planet of the solar 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 the system did not immediately prompted him 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.260
 this is an 11 year old schoolgirl from england 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.629
 as on the outskirts of the solar system 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 always dark and damp here and found there 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.280
 the planet was named after Pluto 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.399
 ancient greek god of darkness and underground 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.399
 kingdom 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.580
 pluton's equatorial radius is about 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.800
 four and its mass several times 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.560
 less than the earth by cosmic standards 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.600
 he was just tiny for a long time considered 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.590
 that pluto completes a series of planets 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.290
 solar system 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.540
 confusion in the forest in 2003 one of 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 class astronomers examined beyond orbit 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.030
 pluton object like Pluto then another 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.600
 and still in the scientific circles rustled 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.340
 is Pluto a planet 2003 really? 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 International Astronomical Council 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.900
 decided to eliminate the planet pluto 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.330
 Incidentally, along with his enough 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.180
 Haron's great companion of from list to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.890
 ninth planet of the solar system 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 it turns out the title of the planet still deserve 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.150
 need main criteria certain 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.729
 the size and mass of the orbit around 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.680
 star pluto does not match all 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 necessary for the planet parameters and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.000
 because now it is completely different 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.110
 the cosmic body of the so-called cloud 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.619
 oort 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.500
 pluto it refers to icy huge 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.960
 bodies that are smaller than the moon but naturally 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.940
 there are more asteroids as a rule 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.010
 refers to the big ice blue 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.290
 such that the measures for are evident in 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.290
 result of a single billion years 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.000
 solar system formations like this 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.410
 of the nine planets of the solar system 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.239
 only 8 left 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 but the story does not end there 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.730
 Today the most vigilant telescopes and light 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.269
 minds of astronomy again turned into space 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.120
 the hunt for 9 and 10 planets continues 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.730
 apparently irresistible our earthly desire 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.340
 to close neighbors we had more 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.850
 and hopefully a grand search 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.450
 scientists will surely be crowned 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.450
 by success
