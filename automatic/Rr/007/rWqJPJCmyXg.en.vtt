00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
because I have never tried this before

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.770 
because I have never tried this before
I've<00:04:45.650> only<00:04:46.160> ever<00:04:46.370> seen<00:04:46.550> it<00:04:46.910> in<00:04:47.000> movies<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.479> TV

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
I've only ever seen it in movies and TV

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.310 
I've only ever seen it in movies and TV
shows<00:04:47.810> is<00:04:48.800> pop<00:04:49.550> rocks<00:04:49.910> now<00:04:50.900> they<00:04:51.800> were<00:04:51.860> like

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
shows is pop rocks now they were like

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.290 
shows is pop rocks now they were like
77,000<00:04:54.320> different<00:04:54.710> flavors<00:04:55.160> so<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.610> decided<00:04:56.180> to

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
77,000 different flavors so I decided to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.360 
77,000 different flavors so I decided to
pick<00:04:56.479> grape<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.440> be<00:04:58.120> interesting<00:04:59.979> so<00:05:00.979> I

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
pick grape just to be interesting so I

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.460 
pick grape just to be interesting so I
might<00:05:02.090> need<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.419> scissors<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.930> open<00:05:03.169> this<00:05:03.290> one

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
might need the scissors to open this one

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:13.780 
might need the scissors to open this one
I<00:05:03.530> think<00:05:10.030> there's<00:05:11.030> absolutely<00:05:11.570> no<00:05:12.500> smell<00:05:12.919> it

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
I think there's absolutely no smell it

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.550 
I think there's absolutely no smell it
looks<00:05:14.000> like<00:05:14.240> don't<00:05:15.020> know<00:05:15.080> if<00:05:15.139> I<00:05:15.200> could<00:05:15.350> see

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
looks like don't know if I could see

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.219 
looks like don't know if I could see
this<00:05:15.710> in<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.919> camera<00:05:16.070> or<00:05:16.310> not<00:05:16.630> it's<00:05:17.630> like<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.810> I

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
this in the camera or not it's like a I

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:19.630 
this in the camera or not it's like a I
think<00:05:18.620> you<00:05:18.680> can<00:05:18.800> see<00:05:18.950> at<00:05:19.039> the<00:05:19.130> camera<00:05:19.430> but<00:05:19.580> it

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
think you can see at the camera but it

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.740 
think you can see at the camera but it
looks<00:05:19.820> like<00:05:19.970> little<00:05:20.620> just<00:05:21.620> little<00:05:21.830> shards<00:05:22.340> of

looks like little just little shards of

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.360 
looks like little just little shards of
plastic<00:05:23.750> I<00:05:23.990> don't<00:05:24.860> know<00:05:24.979> if<00:05:25.100> what<00:05:25.280> I'm

it was I don't know it doesn't have a
specifically<00:06:16.550> great<00:06:16.880> flavor<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.479> but<00:06:17.780> um

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
specifically great flavor to it but um

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.110 
specifically great flavor to it but um
that's<00:06:20.120> really<00:06:20.599> strange<00:06:21.580> it's<00:06:22.580> a<00:06:22.640> really<00:06:22.970> odd

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
that's really strange it's a really odd

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.850 
that's really strange it's a really odd
sensation<00:06:23.720> and<00:06:23.840> it's<00:06:23.930> still<00:06:24.169> going<00:06:24.380> even<00:06:24.740> like

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
sensation and it's still going even like

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.170 
sensation and it's still going even like
thirty<00:06:25.070> seconds<00:06:25.460> later

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
thirty seconds later

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.480 
thirty seconds later
I<00:06:26.210> could<00:06:26.570> feel<00:06:26.720> it<00:06:26.900> there<00:06:27.310> mostly<00:06:28.310> there

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
I could feel it there mostly there

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.450 
I could feel it there mostly there
anywhere<00:06:28.729> else<00:06:28.880> but<00:06:29.120> oh<00:06:29.300> that's<00:06:29.510> weird<00:06:30.460> all

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
anywhere else but oh that's weird all

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.930 
anywhere else but oh that's weird all
right

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
right

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.090 
right
scores<00:06:32.479> time<00:06:32.780> um<00:06:34.750> no<00:06:35.750> I<00:06:36.050> suppose<00:06:36.590> just<00:06:36.949> for

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
scores time um no I suppose just for

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.800 
scores time um no I suppose just for
sheer<00:06:37.370> bizarreness<00:06:37.910> I'd<00:06:38.300> have<00:06:38.479> to<00:06:38.570> put<00:06:38.720> the

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
sheer bizarreness I'd have to put the

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.290 
sheer bizarreness I'd have to put the
pop<00:06:38.990> rocks<00:06:39.290> first<00:06:39.560> that<00:06:40.430> that<00:06:40.699> gets<00:06:40.910> first

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
pop rocks first that that gets first

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.370 
pop rocks first that that gets first
place<00:06:43.479> second<00:06:44.479> places<00:06:44.720> probably<00:06:45.199> take<00:06:45.830> five

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380 
place second places probably take five

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.730 
place second places probably take five
not<00:06:48.380> bad<00:06:48.680> it's<00:06:49.490> sort<00:06:49.729> of<00:06:49.960> weird<00:06:50.960> combination

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
not bad it's sort of weird combination

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.680 
not bad it's sort of weird combination
of<00:06:51.860> flavors<00:06:52.340> so<00:06:52.370> I<00:06:52.669> think<00:06:53.240> it's<00:06:53.419> one<00:06:53.540> of<00:06:53.600> those

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
of flavors so I think it's one of those

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.040 
of flavors so I think it's one of those
ones<00:06:53.900> that<00:06:53.960> will<00:06:54.110> grow<00:06:54.290> on<00:06:54.470> ya<00:06:55.479> third<00:06:56.479> place<00:06:56.780> is

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
ones that will grow on ya third place is

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.560 
ones that will grow on ya third place is
the<00:06:57.080> jujyfruits<00:06:57.560> they're<00:06:58.310> not<00:06:58.669> too<00:06:58.970> bad<00:06:59.240> but

unfortunately<00:07:17.930> the<00:07:18.729> variety<00:07:19.729> that<00:07:19.910> we<00:07:20.060> have

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
unfortunately the variety that we have

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.529 
unfortunately the variety that we have
really<00:07:20.810> doesn't<00:07:21.110> sort<00:07:21.320> of<00:07:21.789> compare<00:07:22.789> so<00:07:23.150> it's

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:23.539 
really doesn't sort of compare so it's

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:25.210 
really doesn't sort of compare so it's
