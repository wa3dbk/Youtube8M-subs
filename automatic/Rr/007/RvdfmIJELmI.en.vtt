I'm going to use the peel and stick tape

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.580 
I'm going to use the peel and stick tape
to<00:01:04.369> create<00:01:04.759> the<00:01:04.939> Rose<00:01:05.179> I<00:01:05.539> like<00:01:06.140> this<00:01:06.350> because

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
to create the Rose I like this because

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.160 
to create the Rose I like this because
it<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.340> permanent<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:08.329> also<00:01:08.539> washable

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.649 

the<00:01:12.170> first<00:01:12.530> step<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:13.340> create<00:01:13.549> a<00:01:13.999> circle

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
the first step is to create a circle

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.929 
the first step is to create a circle
with<00:01:15.020> your<00:01:15.320> fabric<00:01:15.619> now<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.009> can<00:01:16.310> see<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.729> my

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
with your fabric now you can see that my

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.300 
with your fabric now you can see that my
circle<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.630> not<00:01:17.929> very<00:01:18.170> round<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:18.679> that<00:01:18.859> really

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
circle is not very round and that really

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.190 
circle is not very round and that really
doesn't<00:01:19.549> matter<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.210> then<00:01:20.719> what<00:01:20.899> I've<00:01:21.049> done

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
doesn't matter and then what I've done

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.069 
doesn't matter and then what I've done
is<00:01:21.380> I've<00:01:21.590> drawn<00:01:21.890> a<00:01:22.159> spiral<00:01:22.789> on<00:01:22.999> the<00:01:23.060> inside<00:01:23.960> of

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
is I've drawn a spiral on the inside of

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.980 
is I've drawn a spiral on the inside of
the<00:01:24.170> circle<00:01:24.679> I've<00:01:25.100> used<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.609> marker<00:01:26.119> just<00:01:26.840> so

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the circle I've used a marker just so

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.450 
the circle I've used a marker just so
that<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.259> can<00:01:27.409> see<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.829> camera<00:01:27.859> you'll

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
that you can see it on camera you'll

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.849 
that you can see it on camera you'll
want<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.729> do<00:01:28.999> your<00:01:29.299> spiral<00:01:29.960> in<00:01:30.109> pencil<00:01:30.619> and

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 
want to do your spiral in pencil and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:32.529 
want to do your spiral in pencil and
that<00:01:30.889> way<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.189> won't<00:01:31.520> be<00:01:31.639> able<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:31.909> see<00:01:32.240> any<00:01:32.450> of

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
that way you won't be able to see any of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.370 
that way you won't be able to see any of
the<00:01:32.719> lines<00:01:32.899> or<00:01:33.139> you<00:01:33.170> can<00:01:33.530> use<00:01:33.799> a<00:01:35.079> vanishing<00:01:36.079> ink

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
the lines or you can use a vanishing ink

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.230 
the lines or you can use a vanishing ink
then<00:01:37.189> what<00:01:37.520> you'll<00:01:37.639> do<00:01:37.789> is<00:01:37.909> you'll<00:01:38.030> take<00:01:38.179> a

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
then what you'll do is you'll take a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.580 
then what you'll do is you'll take a
pair<00:01:38.509> of<00:01:38.539> scissors<00:01:38.749> and<00:01:39.380> you'll<00:01:40.159> cut<00:01:41.590> your

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
pair of scissors and you'll cut your

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.940 
pair of scissors and you'll cut your
spiral<00:01:43.009> all<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.329> way<00:01:44.479> around<00:01:44.899> to<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:45.289> center

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
spiral all the way around to the center

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.249 
spiral all the way around to the center
and<00:01:46.639> when<00:01:47.179> you<00:01:47.270> get<00:01:47.389> that<00:01:47.509> all<00:01:47.569> cut<00:01:48.049> what

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.649 
that's kind of kind of wavy here it
wants<00:01:54.409> to<00:01:54.679> curl<00:01:54.950> because<00:01:55.549> it's<00:01:56.119> cut<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.569> a

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
wants to curl because it's cut in a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.860 
you're applying it to the tape and
actually<00:02:29.960> that's<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.500> good<00:02:30.680> thing<00:02:30.890> because

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
actually that's a good thing because

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
actually that's a good thing because
that'll<00:02:32.870> create<00:02:33.080> lots<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.650> nice<00:02:33.860> little

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
that'll create lots of nice little

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.980 
that'll create lots of nice little
natural<00:02:34.340> folds<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.210> your<00:02:35.900> flower<00:02:37.870> now<00:02:38.870> I'm

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
natural folds in your flower now I'm

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.420 
natural folds in your flower now I'm
going<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.320> remove<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.740> backing<00:02:39.950> as<00:02:40.280> you've

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
going to remove the backing as you've

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.740 
going to remove the backing as you've
seen<00:02:40.610> here<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.000> I'm<00:02:41.090> not<00:02:41.240> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.450> take<00:02:41.570> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
seen here and I'm not going to take the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.510 
seen here and I'm not going to take the
backing<00:02:41.960> completely<00:02:42.650> off<00:02:42.800> I'm<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.400> to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
backing completely off I'm just going to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.520 
backing completely off I'm just going to
remove<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:44.030> little<00:02:44.270> bit<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.780> backing<00:02:45.020> at<00:02:45.470> a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
remove a little bit of that backing at a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.370 
remove a little bit of that backing at a
time<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:46.910> this<00:02:47.360> tape<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.720> very<00:02:48.020> sticky

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
time because this tape is very sticky

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.610 
time because this tape is very sticky
and<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:49.490> just<00:02:49.820> easier<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.540> manipulate<00:02:51.080> if

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and it's just easier to manipulate if

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.050 
and it's just easier to manipulate if
you<00:02:51.770> do<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.430> see<00:02:52.580> it's<00:02:52.700> sticking<00:02:52.940> to

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
you do that and can see it's sticking to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.880 
you do that and can see it's sticking to
my<00:02:53.270> fingers<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:54.320> you're<00:02:54.440> going<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> come<00:02:54.860> to

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
my fingers but you're going to come to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.880 
my fingers but you're going to come to
the<00:02:55.070> edge<00:02:55.300> here<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:57.080> you've<00:02:57.290> ever<00:02:57.590> worked

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
the edge here and if you've ever worked

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.210 
the edge here and if you've ever worked
with<00:02:58.460> ribbon<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.240> made<00:02:59.420> ribbon<00:02:59.930> roses<00:03:00.220> this

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
with ribbon and made ribbon roses this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.460 
with ribbon and made ribbon roses this
is<00:03:01.460> a<00:03:01.490> very<00:03:01.820> similar<00:03:02.180> technique<00:03:02.570> so<00:03:03.050> I'm<00:03:03.170> just

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
is a very similar technique so I'm just

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.200 
is a very similar technique so I'm just
curling<00:03:04.220> and<00:03:04.780> rolling<00:03:06.580> that<00:03:07.580> in<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.150> is

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
curling and rolling that in and this is

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.680 
curling and rolling that in and this is
making<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.810> center<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.470> flower<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:11.420> only

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
making the center of the flower the only

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.450 
making the center of the flower the only
thing<00:03:11.840> different<00:03:12.020> or<00:03:12.740> at<00:03:12.830> least<00:03:13.010> when<00:03:13.250> I've

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
thing different or at least when I've

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.060 
thing different or at least when I've
made<00:03:13.820> ribbon<00:03:14.600> roses<00:03:15.020> is<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.560> you<00:03:15.800> kind<00:03:15.950> of

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
made ribbon roses is that you kind of

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.130 
made ribbon roses is that you kind of
twist<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.550> ribbon<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.570> this<00:03:17.720> case<00:03:17.930> we're

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
twist the ribbon and in this case we're

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.229 
twist the ribbon and in this case we're
not<00:03:18.170> going<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.680> be<00:03:18.890> twisting<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.730> fabric<00:03:20.090> I'm

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
not going to be twisting the fabric I'm

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.530 
not going to be twisting the fabric I'm
just<00:03:20.540> going<00:03:20.810> to<00:03:20.870> be<00:03:21.020> rolling<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:22.540> bunching

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
just going to be rolling and bunching

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:33.210 
just going to be rolling and bunching
and<00:03:23.980> gathering<00:03:25.239> until<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.270> come<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.770> end<00:03:27.980> of

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.870 

my<00:03:34.220> fabric<00:03:35.530> all<00:03:36.530> right<00:03:36.680> before<00:03:36.830> I<00:03:37.040> finish<00:03:37.520> my

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
my fabric all right before I finish my

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.280 
my fabric all right before I finish my
flower<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.480> wanted<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:38.810> show<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.080> what<00:03:39.200> it

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
flower I wanted to show you what it

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.690 
flower I wanted to show you what it
looks<00:03:39.440> like<00:03:39.560> from<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.800> backside<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.459> as<00:03:40.580> you

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
looks like from the backside and as you

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.670 
looks like from the backside and as you
can<00:03:40.880> see<00:03:40.940> what<00:03:41.360> I<00:03:41.390> basically<00:03:41.690> done<00:03:42.260> is<00:03:42.500> I've

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
can see what I basically done is I've

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.000 
can see what I basically done is I've
recreated<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.880> spiral<00:03:44.600> that<00:03:45.320> we<00:03:45.380> cut

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
recreated that spiral that we cut

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.400 
recreated that spiral that we cut
earlier<00:03:46.310> I've<00:03:46.820> just<00:03:47.090> wrapped<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.690> fabric

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
earlier I've just wrapped the fabric

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.900 
earlier I've just wrapped the fabric
around<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.040> around<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.459> around<00:03:49.550> in<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.880> circle

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
around and around and around in a circle

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.060 
around and around and around in a circle
and<00:03:50.600> now<00:03:50.840> I'm<00:03:50.959> almost<00:03:51.140> finished<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:51.709> wanted<00:03:51.980> to

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
and now I'm almost finished I wanted to

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.790 
and now I'm almost finished I wanted to
show<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.280> how<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:53.120> would<00:03:53.480> finish<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:54.140> off<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
show you how I would finish this off so

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.900 
show you how I would finish this off so
I'm<00:03:55.430> again<00:03:56.150> I'm<00:03:56.300> just<00:03:57.310> continuing<00:03:58.310> that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
I'm again I'm just continuing that

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.540 
I'm again I'm just continuing that
spiral<00:03:59.660> to<00:03:59.930> wrap<00:04:00.140> now<00:04:00.380> sometimes<00:04:00.950> when<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.400> do

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
spiral to wrap now sometimes when you do

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.130 
spiral to wrap now sometimes when you do
these<00:04:01.730> flowers<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.300> get<00:04:02.480> kind<00:04:02.750> of<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.900> cone

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
these flowers you get kind of a cone

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.010 
these flowers you get kind of a cone
right<00:04:03.470> here<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.880> that<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.150> be<00:04:05.330> kind<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.720> bulky

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
right here and that can be kind of bulky

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.930 
right here and that can be kind of bulky
especially<00:04:06.500> if<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:06.739> want<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:07.010> to<00:04:07.520> lay<00:04:07.670> flat

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
especially if you want it to lay flat

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.590 
especially if you want it to lay flat
for<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.330> hair<00:04:08.600> accessory<00:04:08.959> or<00:04:10.360> maybe<00:04:11.360> you're

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
for a hair accessory or maybe you're

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.810 
for a hair accessory or maybe you're
going<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.840> put<00:04:12.110> this<00:04:12.230> on<00:04:12.410> a<00:04:12.440> pin<00:04:12.769> back<00:04:13.040> so

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
going to put this on a pin back so

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.040 
going to put this on a pin back so
you're<00:04:14.000> just<00:04:14.090> going<00:04:14.330> to<00:04:14.450> take<00:04:14.630> your<00:04:14.780> scissors

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
you're just going to take your scissors

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.509 
you're just going to take your scissors
pretty<00:04:15.590> sharp<00:04:15.769> pair<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.010> scissors<00:04:16.340> and

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
pretty sharp pair of scissors and

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.920 
pretty sharp pair of scissors and
there's<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.730> lot<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.090> layers<00:04:17.269> to<00:04:17.390> cut<00:04:17.720> through

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
there's a lot of layers to cut through

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.110 
there's a lot of layers to cut through
here<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.919> you're<00:04:19.160> just<00:04:19.370> going<00:04:19.580> to<00:04:19.700> trim<00:04:20.090> that

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
here and you're just going to trim that

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570 
here and you're just going to trim that
off<00:04:20.299> so<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.140> it<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.590> somewhat<00:04:22.130> flat<00:04:22.400> just

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
off so that it is somewhat flat just

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.450 
off so that it is somewhat flat just
like<00:04:22.669> I<00:04:22.880> did<00:04:23.060> there<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:24.289> end<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.950> your<00:04:25.130> fabric

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460

side in on a 45 diagonal and then in so

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.980 
side in on a 45 diagonal and then in so
you're<00:05:19.220> creating<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.910> point<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:20.630> is<00:05:20.780> almost

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990
