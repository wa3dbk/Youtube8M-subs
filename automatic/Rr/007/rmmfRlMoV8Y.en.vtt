information on our website and about
that<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.610> anyway<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.230> these<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> spb<00:00:38.340> mc2

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that but anyway so these are the spb mc2

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.830 
that but anyway so these are the spb mc2
and<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.200> are<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.980> small

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
and as you can see these are very small

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420 
and as you can see these are very small
about<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> size<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.500> jelly<00:00:43.770> bean<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.280> they

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
about the size of a jelly bean and they

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069

so<00:00:46.969> we<00:00:47.969> sometimes<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.539> questions<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.140> how<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so we sometimes get questions on how to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.889 
so we sometimes get questions on how to
install<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.920> clips<00:00:50.370> onto<00:00:51.120> these<00:00:51.360> microphones

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
install the clips onto these microphones

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.450 
install the clips onto these microphones
that's<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> show<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.370> to

that's what I'm going to show you how to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.090 
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do<00:00:53.640> today<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:55.170> microphones<00:00:55.590> come<00:00:55.890> with

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
do today so these microphones come with

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.069 
do today so these microphones come with
the<00:00:56.250> windscreens<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.059> they'll<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the windscreens and they'll be in the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
the windscreens and they'll be in the
bag<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.219> the<00:01:00.210> clips

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
bag when you get them but the clips

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
bag when you get them but the clips
sometimes<00:01:01.260> people<00:01:01.469> order<00:01:01.859> them<00:01:02.010> after<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
sometimes people order them after the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
sometimes people order them after the
fact<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.229> clip<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
fact and this is the little clip that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.520 
fact and this is the little clip that
goes<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> these<00:01:06.720> clips<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.290> little

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
goes on it and these clips have a little

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.710 
goes on it and these clips have a little
wire<00:01:07.770> bail<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.090> when<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.420> press<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
wire bail here that when you press it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.789 
wire bail here that when you press it
down<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.380> opens<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.720> closes<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.020> sort<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
down it opens up and closes it's sort of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
down it opens up and closes it's sort of
spring<00:01:14.100> loaded<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> way<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.659> works

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
spring loaded so so the way that works

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.859 
spring loaded so so the way that works
if<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.830> weren't<00:01:17.280> using<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.000> windscreen<00:01:18.390> we

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
if we weren't using the windscreen we

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.580 
if we weren't using the windscreen we
would<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.229> push<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.740> down<00:01:20.390> like<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.659> pop

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
would just push this down like that pop

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.649 
would just push this down like that pop
the<00:01:22.799> microphone<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.460> there<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> release<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the microphone in there and release the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.179 
the microphone in there and release the
bail<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> grabs<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.619> onto<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> mic

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
bail and it grabs right onto the mic

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
bail and it grabs right onto the mic
just<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:28.080> if<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.619> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
just like that but if you want to do the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
just like that but if you want to do the
windscreen<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.180> different<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
windscreen it's a little different so

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.420 
windscreen it's a little different so

bottom of the hole punch into the whole

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.030 
bottom of the hole punch into the whole
of<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> windscreen<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.170> slide<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.200> down<00:01:55.500> onto

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
of the windscreen and slide it down onto

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280 
of the windscreen and slide it down onto
the<00:01:56.070> hole<00:01:56.280> punch<00:01:56.549> about<00:01:56.820> halfway<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.630> like

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the hole punch about halfway up like

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.520 
the hole punch about halfway up like
that<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.820> give<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.060> give<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> shot<00:02:01.200> there

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that and give it a give it a shot there

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.830 
that and give it a give it a shot there
and<00:02:02.219> you'll<00:02:02.340> see<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.880> will<00:02:03.360> sometimes

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and you'll see that it will sometimes

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260 
and you'll see that it will sometimes
leave<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.380> slug<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.250> foam<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.969> there<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
leave a little slug of foam in there you

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.869 
leave a little slug of foam in there you
want<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.479> pull<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.340> which<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
want to pull that out which I'm going to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.080 
want to pull that out which I'm going to
do<00:02:09.000> now

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
do now

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.759 
do now
and<00:02:12.090> then<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.719> same<00:02:12.989> thing<00:02:13.230> on<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.499> one

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
and then the same thing on this one

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.059 
and then the same thing on this one
again<00:02:14.389> the<00:02:15.389> hole<00:02:15.569> on<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.590> windscreens<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
again the hole on the windscreens a

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.589 
again the hole on the windscreens a
little<00:02:17.310> small<00:02:17.609> for<00:02:17.639> this<00:02:17.909> but<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.299> stretches

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
little small for this but it stretches

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.179 
little small for this but it stretches
over<00:02:18.989> about<00:02:19.469> halfway<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:22.010> give<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.099> a

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
over about halfway up and give it a

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.619 
over about halfway up and give it a
punch<00:02:23.459> there<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:23.969> that<00:02:24.060> one<00:02:24.180> popped<00:02:24.420> right

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
punch there and that one popped right

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.190 
punch there and that one popped right
out<00:02:24.659> it's<00:02:25.200> nice<00:02:25.459> okay<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.689> is<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> tricky

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
out it's nice okay so this is the tricky

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.280 
out it's nice okay so this is the tricky
part<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.180> basically<00:02:30.599> what<00:02:30.810> we're<00:02:30.930> going<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.109> do

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
part so basically what we're going to do

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.000 
part so basically what we're going to do
is<00:02:31.500> take<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.250> clip<00:02:32.579> put<00:02:33.329> it<00:02:33.480> into<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.560> hole

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
is take this clip put it into the hole

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.209 
is take this clip put it into the hole
of<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.280> windscreen<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:36.569> like<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:37.019> so<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
of the windscreen just like that so that

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.050 
of the windscreen just like that so that
it's<00:02:38.400> now<00:02:38.700> inside<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.569> windscreen<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:41.060> then

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it's now inside the windscreen and then

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.330 
it's now inside the windscreen and then
we<00:02:42.569> push<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.959> windscreen<00:02:43.260> down<00:02:43.739> over<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
we push the windscreen down over the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.399 
we push the windscreen down over the
hole<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.879> we<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.239> now<00:02:45.389> see<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.810> hole<00:02:46.169> in

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
hole so that we can now see the hole in

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.459 
hole so that we can now see the hole in
the<00:02:46.530> clip<00:02:46.799> again<00:02:47.159> and<00:02:48.019> then<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.139> take<00:02:49.349> the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
the clip again and then you take the

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.539 
the clip again and then you take the
microphone<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.900> just<00:02:51.900> pushing<00:02:52.799> down<00:02:53.159> on<00:02:53.189> the

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
microphone and just pushing down on the

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.189 
microphone and just pushing down on the
bail<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:54.000> open<00:02:54.269> up<00:02:54.389> that<00:02:54.510> hole<00:02:54.719> put<00:02:55.109> the

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
bail to open up that hole put the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.920 
bail to open up that hole put the
microphone<00:02:55.609> into<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:56.730> clip<00:02:56.969> and<00:02:57.180> then

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
microphone into the clip and then

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.899 
microphone into the clip and then
release<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:59.069> just<00:02:59.310> pull<00:02:59.579> that<00:02:59.760> one

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
release it and then just pull that one

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.000 
release it and then just pull that one
screen<00:03:00.239> right<00:03:00.510> over<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.019> microphone<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.859> now

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
screen right over the microphone so now

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.939 
screen right over the microphone so now
you<00:03:02.069> have<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:03.359> clip<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.049> windscreen<00:03:04.409> on

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:04.949 
you have the clip and the windscreen on

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.839 
you have the clip and the windscreen on
the<00:03:05.310> microphone<00:03:05.609> just<00:03:06.389> like<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:07.639> then<00:03:08.639> we<00:03:08.730> do

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
the microphone just like that then we do

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.289 
the microphone just like that then we do
the<00:03:08.909> same<00:03:09.120> thing<00:03:09.359> on<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.569> other<00:03:09.599> one<00:03:11.299> again

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
the same thing on the other one again

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.789 
the same thing on the other one again
you<00:03:12.599> take<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> clip<00:03:14.060> put<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.359> whole<00:03:16.199> inside

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
you take the clip put the whole inside

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.159 
you take the clip put the whole inside
the<00:03:17.069> windscreen<00:03:18.019> push<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.199> out<00:03:19.549> like<00:03:20.549> this

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
the windscreen push it out like this

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.129 
the windscreen push it out like this
push<00:03:22.169> down<00:03:22.439> on<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.739> bail<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:23.159> open<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.669> up

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
push down on the bail to open it it up

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.780

push the microphone in release the bell

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.849 
push the microphone in release the bell
which<00:03:27.030> tightens<00:03:27.419> it<00:03:27.569> up<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.349> pull<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> wind

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
which tightens it up and pull the wind

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.490 
which tightens it up and pull the wind
screen<00:03:29.129> over<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:30.329> that's<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.319> that's

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
screen over and that's it and that's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.499 
screen over and that's it and that's
that<00:03:31.919> is<00:03:32.099> how<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.430> install<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:33.150> windscreens

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:33.509 
that is how you install the windscreens

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.369 
that is how you install the windscreens
on<00:03:34.409> end<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.189> clips<00:03:35.459> on<00:03:35.729> the<00:03:36.180> BMC<00:03:36.930> too<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.290> this

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
on end the clips on the BMC too and this

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.890 
on end the clips on the BMC too and this
procedure<00:03:38.159> would<00:03:38.430> hold<00:03:38.729> true<00:03:38.879> to<00:03:39.329> any<00:03:39.599> of<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
procedure would hold true to any of the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.399 
procedure would hold true to any of the
small<00:03:40.049> microphones<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.780> use<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> windscreen

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
small microphones that use a windscreen

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:44.780 
small microphones that use a windscreen
like<00:03:43.709> this<00:03:43.949> some<00:03:44.159> of<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.310> microphones

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
like this some of the microphones

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.849 
like this some of the microphones
actually<00:03:45.209> use<00:03:45.329> a<00:03:45.359> windscreen<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.319> that

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
actually use a windscreen that is that

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.949 
actually use a windscreen that is that
has<00:03:46.979> a<00:03:47.009> plastic<00:03:47.310> insert<00:03:48.030> or<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.269> rubber<00:03:48.540> insert

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
has a plastic insert or a rubber insert

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.199 
has a plastic insert or a rubber insert
which<00:03:49.169> just<00:03:49.409> slides<00:03:49.620> over<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.040> end<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
which just slides over the end if the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.030 
which just slides over the end if the
microphone<00:03:51.599> is<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.930> little<00:03:52.290> larger<00:03:52.739> but<00:03:52.769> this

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
microphone is a little larger but this

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.219
