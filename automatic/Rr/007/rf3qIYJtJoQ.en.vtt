between<00:01:29.779> these<00:01:29.959> two<00:01:30.319> animals<00:01:30.529> that<00:01:31.429> in<00:01:31.700> one

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
between these two animals that in one

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.059 
between these two animals that in one
hand<00:01:32.599> they<00:01:32.810> are<00:01:32.929> friendly<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.560> they<00:01:33.799> like

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
hand they are friendly and they like

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.649 
hand they are friendly and they like
each<00:01:34.279> other<00:01:34.459> and<00:01:34.729> in<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.090> other<00:01:35.270> hand<00:01:35.509> they

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
each other and in the other hand they

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.599 
each other and in the other hand they
are<00:01:35.749> always<00:01:36.170> fighting<00:01:36.380> so<00:01:36.920> that's<00:01:37.459> the

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
are always fighting so that's the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.249 
are always fighting so that's the
relationship<00:01:38.149> between<00:01:38.389> these<00:01:38.779> two<00:01:39.049> animals

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
relationship between these two animals

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.109 
relationship between these two animals
and<00:01:39.649> I<00:01:39.679> think<00:01:39.889> that's<00:01:40.069> the<00:01:40.279> kind<00:01:40.639> of<00:01:40.729> relation

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
and I think that's the kind of relation

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.910 
and I think that's the kind of relation
that<00:01:41.270> everyone<00:01:41.749> has<00:01:41.990> sometimes<00:01:42.529> you<00:01:42.799> are
