00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
just like I ain't gonna take that so I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.649 
just like I ain't gonna take that so I
have<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.889> switch<00:03:58.099> him<00:03:58.250> out<00:03:58.370> because<00:03:58.669> you<00:03:59.510> know

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
have to switch him out because you know

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.530 
have to switch him out because you know
I<00:03:59.870> just<00:04:00.229> do<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.040> I<00:04:01.159> go<00:04:01.280> in<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.430> pinch<00:04:01.699> alkis<00:04:02.329> I

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
I just do and I go in a pinch alkis I

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.089 
I just do and I go in a pinch alkis I
thought<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:02.989> know<00:04:03.109> I<00:04:03.139> get<00:04:03.470> probably<00:04:03.919> i

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
thought you know I get probably i

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.770 
thought you know I get probably i
couldnt<00:04:04.430> definitely<00:04:05.090> live<00:04:05.239> the<00:04:05.269> earth<00:04:05.569> power

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
couldnt definitely live the earth power

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.280 
couldnt definitely live the earth power
because<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:08.120> son<00:04:08.359> stabbed<00:04:08.689> and<00:04:09.019> he<00:04:09.049> isn't

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
because it son stabbed and he isn't

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.129 
because it son stabbed and he isn't
joist<00:04:09.709> at<00:04:09.919> all<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:10.729> plus<00:04:11.180> he's<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.359> lead<00:04:11.659> so<00:04:11.989> he's

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
joist at all so plus he's a lead so he's

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.229 
joist at all so plus he's a lead so he's
invested<00:04:12.620> in<00:04:12.739> speed<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:13.099> bulk<00:04:13.549> most<00:04:13.849> likely

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
invested in speed and bulk most likely

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.029 
invested in speed and bulk most likely
but<00:04:14.629> of<00:04:14.750> course<00:04:14.989> he<00:04:15.169> gets<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.439> critical<00:04:15.859> and

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
but of course he gets a critical and

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:18.699 
but of course he gets a critical and
kills<00:04:16.280> pitch<00:04:16.519> ow<00:04:16.699> like<00:04:17.419> that<00:04:17.659> sucks<00:04:18.109> kingler

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
kills pitch ow like that sucks kingler

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.069 
kills pitch ow like that sucks kingler
is<00:04:19.009> one<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.370> my<00:04:19.519> main<00:04:19.880> attackers<00:04:20.479> it's<00:04:20.720> very

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
is one of my main attackers it's very

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.200 
is one of my main attackers it's very
useful<00:04:21.349> in<00:04:21.709> every<00:04:22.009> battle<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.669> dead<00:04:22.970> now

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
useful in every battle and is dead now

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.600 
useful in every battle and is dead now
so<00:04:23.419> I've<00:04:24.110> gotta<00:04:24.349> rely<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.710> my<00:04:24.979> says<00:04:25.250> Endora

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
so I've gotta rely on my says Endora

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.370 
so I've gotta rely on my says Endora
which<00:04:25.849> can't<00:04:26.120> even<00:04:26.330> attack<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.930> seat<00:04:27.139> ran

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
which can't even attack the seat ran

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.089 
which can't even attack the seat ran
because<00:04:27.949> I<00:04:28.159> don't<00:04:28.340> have<00:04:28.400> EQ<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.860> anyway<00:04:30.860> he

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
because I don't have EQ on it anyway he

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.710 
because I don't have EQ on it anyway he
goes<00:04:31.280> for<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.490> earth<00:04:31.580> power<00:04:31.909> because<00:04:32.479> I<00:04:32.599> guess

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
goes for the earth power because I guess

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.089 
goes for the earth power because I guess
he<00:04:32.840> didn't<00:04:33.050> want<00:04:33.169> his<00:04:33.259> other<00:04:33.440> attack<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.860> Miss

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
he didn't want his other attack the Miss

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.520 
he didn't want his other attack the Miss
it<00:04:34.370> does<00:04:34.550> like<00:04:34.820> nothing<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.599> I<00:04:35.840> seismic<00:04:36.380> toss

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
it does like nothing and I seismic toss

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.379 
it does like nothing and I seismic toss
just<00:04:37.039> to<00:04:37.099> get<00:04:37.250> some<00:04:37.400> damage<00:04:37.820> because<00:04:38.180> at<00:04:38.300> this

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
just to get some damage because at this

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.300 
just to get some damage because at this
point<00:04:38.509> you<00:04:39.139> know<00:04:39.169> I<00:04:39.530> don't<00:04:39.830> have<00:04:40.009> anything

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
point you know I don't have anything

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.430 
point you know I don't have anything
else<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.820> do<00:04:41.090> I<00:04:41.449> mean<00:04:41.630> what<00:04:41.900> am<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.080> supposed<00:04:42.380> to

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
else to do I mean what am I supposed to

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.379 
else to do I mean what am I supposed to
do<00:04:42.620> against<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.039> thing<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:43.909> now<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.060> switch

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
do against this thing so now I switch

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.270 
do against this thing so now I switch
that<00:04:44.539> again<00:04:44.870> into<00:04:45.409> diamond<00:04:45.919> dodrio

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
that again into diamond dodrio

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.700 
that again into diamond dodrio
predicting<00:04:47.000> another<00:04:47.090> earth<00:04:47.449> power<00:04:47.750> because<00:04:48.620> I

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
predicting another earth power because I

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.529 
predicting another earth power because I
thought<00:04:48.830> he<00:04:48.979> might<00:04:49.130> just<00:04:49.310> go<00:04:49.460> for<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.760> to<00:04:50.060> kill

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
thought he might just go for it to kill

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.380 
thought he might just go for it to kill
me<00:04:50.719> but<00:04:51.130> unfortunately<00:04:52.130> he<00:04:52.279> decides<00:04:52.639> to

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
me but unfortunately he decides to

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.390 
me but unfortunately he decides to
play<00:04:53.480> like<00:04:53.720> a<00:04:53.750> human<00:04:54.080> being<00:04:54.380> and<00:04:54.710> when<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.220> say

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
abandoned one so it doesn't really

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.520 
abandoned one so it doesn't really
affect<00:05:24.470> me<00:05:24.890> at<00:05:25.040> all<00:05:25.130> but<00:05:25.580> still<00:05:26.260> if<00:05:27.260> he<00:05:27.410> had

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
affect me at all but still if he had

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.350 
affect me at all but still if he had
attacked<00:05:27.920> me<00:05:28.130> most<00:05:28.490> likely<00:05:28.730> would<00:05:29.120> have<00:05:29.150> been

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
attacked me most likely would have been

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360 
attacked me most likely would have been

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
able to kill me which probably what it
