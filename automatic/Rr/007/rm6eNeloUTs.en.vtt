the<00:01:32.070> bat<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> few<00:01:32.850> enemies<00:01:33.060> out<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the bat I see a few enemies out in the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
the bat I see a few enemies out in the
distance<00:01:34.290> now<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> could<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.640> started

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
distance now I could have just started

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
distance now I could have just started
to<00:01:35.970> shoot<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.329> them<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.840> maybe<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.439> could<00:01:37.740> have

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
to shoot at them and maybe I could have

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.319 
to shoot at them and maybe I could have
gotten<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.100> few<00:01:38.250> kills<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
gotten a few kills here and there the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
gotten a few kills here and there the
famas<00:01:39.630> while<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:40.650> meant<00:01:40.829> for

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
famas while it's not really meant for

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.649 
famas while it's not really meant for
long-range<00:01:41.369> combat<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.479> accurate

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
long-range combat if you're accurate

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.030 
long-range combat if you're accurate
enough<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.170> still<00:01:43.380> take<00:01:43.560> people<00:01:43.799> out<00:01:43.860> at

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
enough you can still take people out at

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560 
enough you can still take people out at
a<00:01:44.100> distance<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.970> knew<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.329> there<00:01:45.450> were

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
a distance but I knew that there were

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
a distance but I knew that there were
plenty<00:01:45.840> me<00:01:46.079> at<00:01:46.200> plenty<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.680> enemies<00:01:47.040> out<00:01:47.430> there

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
plenty me at plenty of enemies out there

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
plenty me at plenty of enemies out there
and<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.270> decided<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> smart<00:01:49.530> thing

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and so I decided to do the smart thing

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.190 
and so I decided to do the smart thing
and<00:01:49.829> close<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> gap<00:01:51.030> I'm<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.689> use<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and close the gap I'm going to use the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920 
and close the gap I'm going to use the
strengths<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> my<00:01:53.220> weapon<00:01:53.549> appropriately<00:01:54.240> as

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
strengths of my weapon appropriately as

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.359 
strengths of my weapon appropriately as
I<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.320> into<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> courtyard<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:56.100> able<00:01:56.280> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I get into the courtyard I'm able to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069 
I get into the courtyard I'm able to
take<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.820> few<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> enemy<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> are

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
take out a few of the enemy that are

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.630 
take out a few of the enemy that are
trying<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> jump<00:01:58.649> away<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.159> stairwell

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
trying to jump away from the stairwell

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.429 
trying to jump away from the stairwell
but<00:02:00.180> instead<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> charging<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
but instead of charging in there like a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
but instead of charging in there like a
madman<00:02:02.009> being<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.670> greedy<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> trying<00:02:03.390> to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
madman being really greedy and trying to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
get as many kills as I possibly can

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
get as many kills as I possibly can
before<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:05.670> teammates<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.360> able<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.750> secure

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
before my teammates are able to secure

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.070 
before my teammates are able to secure
the<00:02:07.229> kill<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.680> take<00:02:08.250> things<00:02:08.489> slowly<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.629> already

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
the kill I take things slowly I already

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.600 
the kill I take things slowly I already
knew<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> lot<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
knew that there was a lot into the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.600 
knew that there was a lot into the
stairwell<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.090> noticed

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
stairwell I noticed

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.130 
stairwell I noticed
there<00:02:12.700> was<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> mitt<00:02:13.060> there<00:02:13.210> was<00:02:13.330> many<00:02:13.540> on<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
there was a mitt there was many on the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.530 
there was a mitt there was many on the
mini-map<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.860> also<00:02:15.340> because<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> took<00:02:16.060> out<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
mini-map and also because I took out the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.970 
mini-map and also because I took out the
few<00:02:16.720> people<00:02:16.960> that<00:02:16.990> were<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> courtyard<00:02:17.590> I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
few people that were in the courtyard I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.500 
few people that were in the courtyard I
was<00:02:18.190> fairly<00:02:18.400> confident<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.210> wasn't

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
was fairly confident that I wasn't

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.500 
was fairly confident that I wasn't
spotted<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.350> because<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> also<00:02:21.160> noticed<00:02:21.820> my

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
spotted and because I also noticed my

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.000 
spotted and because I also noticed my
teammates<00:02:22.960> were<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.500> right-hand

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
teammates were all on the right-hand

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.310 
teammates were all on the right-hand
side<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.850> was<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.540> was<00:02:25.630> fairly<00:02:25.840> comfortable

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
side I I was I was fairly comfortable

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.110 
side I I was I was fairly comfortable
that<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> wasn't<00:02:26.770> going<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.130> flanked<00:02:27.610> at<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
that I wasn't going to be flanked at the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.820 
that I wasn't going to be flanked at the
end<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.510> proves<00:02:28.750> fruitful<00:02:29.170> I'm<00:02:29.380> able<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.650> take

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
end it proves fruitful I'm able to take

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
end it proves fruitful I'm able to take
out<00:02:29.980> multiple<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> enemy<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.150> noticed<00:02:31.720> at

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
out multiple of the enemy I noticed at

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.350 
out multiple of the enemy I noticed at
the<00:02:31.840> very<00:02:32.080> end<00:02:32.290> tail<00:02:32.650> here<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.460> my<00:02:33.880> teammates

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the very end tail here that my teammates

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.240 
the very end tail here that my teammates
are<00:02:34.540> starting<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.050> basically<00:02:35.530> collapse<00:02:35.980> on

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
are starting to basically collapse on

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.130 
are starting to basically collapse on
this<00:02:36.730> spawn<00:02:37.060> point<00:02:37.360> or<00:02:37.510> where<00:02:37.660> everyone<00:02:38.020> was

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
this spawn point or where everyone was

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.870 
this spawn point or where everyone was
congregating<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.400> basically<00:02:39.610> just

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
congregating and so I basically just

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.990 
congregating and so I basically just
rush<00:02:40.240> on<00:02:40.420> up<00:02:40.570> and<00:02:40.750> clear<00:02:41.290> everyone<00:02:41.650> out

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
rush on up and clear everyone out

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.160 
rush on up and clear everyone out
overall<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.090> was<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> very<00:02:43.300> fun<00:02:43.720> little<00:02:43.930> run

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
overall it was a very fun little run

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.570 
overall it was a very fun little run
there<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.740> all<00:02:44.830> came<00:02:45.010> down<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> fact

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
there and it all came down to the fact

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.520 
there and it all came down to the fact
that<00:02:45.820> I<00:02:46.000> was<00:02:46.120> able<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.570> lean<00:02:46.780> on<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.230> strength

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
that I was able to lean on the strength

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.530 
that I was able to lean on the strength
of<00:02:47.680> my<00:02:47.770> weapon<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.459> used<00:02:48.850> those<00:02:49.150> strengths

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
of my weapon I used those strengths

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.390 
of my weapon I used those strengths
appropriately<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.350> I<00:02:50.590> also<00:02:50.770> had<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> basic

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
appropriately and I also had a basic

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.790 
appropriately and I also had a basic
grasp<00:02:51.670> as<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> environments<00:02:53.170> around<00:02:53.260> me

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
grasp as to the environments around me

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.920 
grasp as to the environments around me
the<00:02:54.520> next<00:02:54.790> clip<00:02:54.970> we're<00:02:55.150> moving<00:02:55.390> on<00:02:55.480> over<00:02:55.750> into

Dawnbreaker and what I loved about this
little<00:02:58.270> situation<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.709> was<00:02:59.920> playing

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
little situation is that I was playing

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.610 
little situation is that I was playing
as<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.820> engineer<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.540> course<00:03:01.750> i<00:03:01.870> had<00:03:02.050> my<00:03:02.290> straw

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
as the engineer of course i had my straw

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.640 
as the engineer of course i had my straw
available<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.880> i<00:03:03.910> was<00:03:04.480> hunkered<00:03:05.050> down<00:03:05.080> by<00:03:05.620> a

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
available but i was hunkered down by a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.620 
available but i was hunkered down by a
bunch<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.070> these<00:03:06.220> barriers<00:03:06.610> i<00:03:06.940> noticed<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.540> a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
bunch of these barriers i noticed that a

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.510 
bunch of these barriers i noticed that a
lot<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.989> enemy<00:03:08.290> were<00:03:08.410> on<00:03:08.530> top<00:03:08.800> of<00:03:08.830> the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
lot of the enemy were on top of the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.400 
lot of the enemy were on top of the
bridge<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.120> since<00:03:10.450> i'm<00:03:10.570> also<00:03:10.720> using<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
bridge and since i'm also using a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.710 
bridge and since i'm also using a
suppressed<00:03:11.920> PDW<00:03:12.580> i<00:03:12.760> knew<00:03:13.209> that<00:03:13.239> i<00:03:13.420> was<00:03:13.570> at<00:03:13.690> a

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
suppressed PDW i knew that i was at a

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.660 
suppressed PDW i knew that i was at a
clear<00:03:13.989> disadvantage<00:03:14.230> they're<00:03:14.950> not<00:03:15.070> too<00:03:15.310> far

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
clear disadvantage they're not too far

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.100 
clear disadvantage they're not too far
away<00:03:15.700> but<00:03:16.000> there<00:03:16.270> was<00:03:16.360> no<00:03:16.540> way<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.750> was<00:03:16.959> going

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
away but there was no way that was going

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.020 
away but there was no way that was going
to<00:03:17.140> be<00:03:17.200> able<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.470> take<00:03:17.560> out<00:03:17.769> multiple<00:03:18.370> enemies

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
to be able to take out multiple enemies

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.270 
to be able to take out multiple enemies
that<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.239> a<00:03:19.390> clear<00:03:19.930> height<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.620> head<00:03:20.980> glitch

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
that have a clear height and head glitch

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.220 
that have a clear height and head glitch
advantage<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.450> do<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.900> smart<00:03:23.140> thing

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
advantage and so I do the smart thing

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.470 
advantage and so I do the smart thing
and<00:03:23.530> hide<00:03:23.890> behind<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.340> barriers<00:03:24.670> as<00:03:25.030> long<00:03:25.299> as

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
and hide behind the barriers as long as

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.509 
and hide behind the barriers as long as
I<00:03:25.570> possibly<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:26.230> but<00:03:26.860> it's<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.280> being<00:03:27.400> a

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
I possibly can but it's not just being a

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.550 
I possibly can but it's not just being a
completely<00:03:27.970> worthless<00:03:28.330> coward<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:29.140> then

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
completely worthless coward I then

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.009 
completely worthless coward I then
decide<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.340> try<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.549> mix<00:03:30.760> things<00:03:31.000> up<00:03:31.299> and<00:03:31.480> shoot

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
decide to try to mix things up and shoot

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.500 
decide to try to mix things up and shoot
a<00:03:32.200> straw<00:03:32.560> up<00:03:32.860> into<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.220> air<00:03:33.250> while<00:03:33.790> I'm<00:03:34.209> behind

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
a straw up into the air while I'm behind

a straw up into the air while I'm behind
the<00:03:34.780> barriers<00:03:35.350> reload<00:03:36.220> this<00:03:36.549> raw<00:03:36.880> aim<00:03:37.209> at

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
the barriers reload this raw aim at

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.289 
the barriers reload this raw aim at
where<00:03:38.019> I<00:03:38.350> think<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.739> they<00:03:38.890> are<00:03:38.920> and<00:03:39.370> then<00:03:39.850> try

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
where I think that they are and then try

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.150 
where I think that they are and then try
to<00:03:40.330> do<00:03:40.570> some<00:03:40.870> damage<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.230> suppress<00:03:41.769> them<00:03:41.980> with

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
to do some damage and suppress them with

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.039 
to do some damage and suppress them with
this<00:03:42.310> raw<00:03:42.580> if<00:03:43.090> you're<00:03:43.299> not<00:03:43.390> aware<00:03:43.690> this<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:43.930> a

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
this raw if you're not aware this is a

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.900 
this raw if you're not aware this is a
nifty<00:03:44.350> trick<00:03:44.530> that<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.709> can<00:03:44.799> do<00:03:45.100> with<00:03:45.340> this

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
nifty trick that you can do with this

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
nifty trick that you can do with this
weapon<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.900> can't<00:03:47.260> fire<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.860> other<00:03:47.890> straw

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
weapon you can't fire the other straw

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.310 
weapon you can't fire the other straw
but<00:03:48.670> as<00:03:48.760> long<00:03:49.000> as<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.360> reload<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.080> then<00:03:50.170> just

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
but as long as you reload and then just

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.170 
but as long as you reload and then just
aim<00:03:50.530> at<00:03:50.830> where<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.160> want<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.459> go<00:03:51.700> that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
aim at where you want it to go that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.729 
aim at where you want it to go that
first<00:03:52.510> rocket<00:03:52.900> that<00:03:52.989> you<00:03:53.110> had<00:03:53.260> fly<00:03:53.530> through

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
first rocket that you had fly through

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.800 
first rocket that you had fly through
the<00:03:53.799> air<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.220> gonna<00:03:54.580> go<00:03:54.820> where<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.600> aim<00:03:55.780> it

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the air is gonna go where you aim it

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.479 
the air is gonna go where you aim it
like<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.350> will<00:03:56.440> always<00:03:56.769> go<00:03:56.920> where<00:03:57.100> you<00:03:57.280> aim<00:03:57.459> it

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
like it will always go where you aim it

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.880 
like it will always go where you aim it
and<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.150> loops<00:03:58.390> on<00:03:58.600> back<00:03:58.840> down<00:03:59.140> in<00:03:59.410> acts<00:03:59.650> as

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
and so it loops on back down in acts as

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.759 
and so it loops on back down in acts as
sort<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.940> mortar<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.630> while<00:04:02.140> it<00:04:02.260> didn't<00:04:02.560> get

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
sort of a mortar and while it didn't get

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.710 
sort of a mortar and while it didn't get
a<00:04:02.830> kill<00:04:03.160> for<00:04:03.430> me<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.760> did<00:04:04.090> exactly<00:04:04.360> what<00:04:04.570> I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
a kill for me it did exactly what I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.570 
a kill for me it did exactly what I
wanted<00:04:05.049> to<00:04:05.230> which<00:04:05.590> caused<00:04:05.890> all<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.310> the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
wanted to which caused all of the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.430 
wanted to which caused all of the
enemies<00:04:06.910> on<00:04:07.090> top<00:04:07.450> of<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.720> bridge<00:04:07.959> to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
enemies on top of the bridge to

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.199 
enemies on top of the bridge to
basically<00:04:08.799> duck<00:04:09.160> for<00:04:09.400> cover<00:04:09.459> they<00:04:09.880> had<00:04:10.030> no

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
basically duck for cover they had no

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.000 
basically duck for cover they had no
idea<00:04:10.239> what<00:04:10.630> was<00:04:10.660> going<00:04:10.930> on<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.440> did<00:04:11.769> a<00:04:11.799> little

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
idea what was going on I did a little

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.680 
idea what was going on I did a little
bit<00:04:12.130> of<00:04:12.160> damage<00:04:12.400> which<00:04:12.730> allowed<00:04:13.030> me<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.299> secure

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
bit of damage which allowed me to secure

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.720 
bit of damage which allowed me to secure
some<00:04:13.930> nice<00:04:14.049> assist<00:04:14.500> points<00:04:14.950> but<00:04:15.250> it'll<00:04:15.430> let<00:04:15.579> me

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
some nice assist points but it'll let me

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.180 
some nice assist points but it'll let me
get<00:04:15.910> out<00:04:16.090> from<00:04:16.479> behind<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:17.109> barrier<00:04:17.769> where

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
get out from behind that barrier where

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.650 
get out from behind that barrier where
normally<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.700> would<00:04:18.940> have<00:04:19.060> been<00:04:19.150> stuck<00:04:19.419> for

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
normally I would have been stuck for

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.060 
normally I would have been stuck for
multiple<00:04:20.290> minutes<00:04:20.470> or<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> just<00:04:20.919> would<00:04:21.010> have

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
multiple minutes or I just would have

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.520 
multiple minutes or I just would have
ran<00:04:21.250> out<00:04:21.430> and<00:04:21.580> got<00:04:21.640> myself<00:04:21.940> killed<00:04:22.479> a<00:04:22.780> nifty

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
ran out and got myself killed a nifty

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.380 
ran out and got myself killed a nifty
little<00:04:23.680> trick<00:04:23.979> doesn't<00:04:24.460> happen<00:04:24.789> very<00:04:24.970> often

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
little trick doesn't happen very often

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.280 
little trick doesn't happen very often
it's<00:04:25.720> it's<00:04:25.930> hard

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
it's it's hard

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.020 
it's it's hard
to<00:04:26.590> get<00:04:26.740> into<00:04:26.890> situation<00:04:27.460> where<00:04:27.640> this<00:04:27.790> would

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
to get into situation where this would

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.760 
to get into situation where this would
even<00:04:28.150> be<00:04:28.300> useful<00:04:28.840> but<00:04:29.230> if<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.380> see<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> few

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
even be useful but if you see a few

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.560 
even be useful but if you see a few
camping<00:04:30.100> snipers<00:04:30.460> on<00:04:30.640> top<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.030> roof<00:04:31.180> top<00:04:31.360> or

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
camping snipers on top of a roof top or

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.750 
camping snipers on top of a roof top or
on<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.780> bridge<00:04:31.990> like<00:04:32.200> this<00:04:32.260> I<00:04:32.680> recommend<00:04:33.580> that

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
on a bridge like this I recommend that

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.970 
on a bridge like this I recommend that
you<00:04:33.940> give<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.300> try<00:04:34.540> I<00:04:34.870> then<00:04:35.470> progress<00:04:35.650> on

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
you give it a try I then progress on

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.820 
you give it a try I then progress on
over<00:04:36.250> into<00:04:36.640> the<00:04:36.670> sea<00:04:37.240> building<00:04:37.720> area<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.260> one

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
over into the sea building area and one

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.470 
over into the sea building area and one
thing<00:04:39.100> that<00:04:39.130> you'll<00:04:39.520> notice<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:40.060> that<00:04:40.120> when<00:04:40.450> a

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
thing that you'll notice is that when a

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.320 
thing that you'll notice is that when a
helicopter<00:04:41.020> flies<00:04:41.230> on<00:04:41.470> over<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.010> usually<00:04:42.460> whip

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
helicopter flies on over I usually whip

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.720 
helicopter flies on over I usually whip
out<00:04:43.480> this<00:04:43.690> raw<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.230> don't<00:04:44.590> take<00:04:44.890> the<00:04:45.160> shot<00:04:45.520> and

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
out this raw I don't take the shot and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.850 
out this raw I don't take the shot and
will<00:04:45.880> explain<00:04:46.240> why<00:04:46.510> in<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.870> minute<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.620> just

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
will explain why in a minute but just

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.830 
will explain why in a minute but just
kind<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.190> observe<00:04:48.310> how<00:04:48.970> quickly<00:04:49.570> these

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
kind of observe how quickly these

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.260 
kind of observe how quickly these
helicopters<00:04:50.200> are<00:04:50.530> flying<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:51.250> then<00:04:51.760> notice<00:04:52.060> two

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
helicopters are flying I then notice two

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.240 
helicopters are flying I then notice two
lovely<00:04:52.720> individuals<00:04:53.380> camping<00:04:53.770> around<00:04:53.860> the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
lovely individuals camping around the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.150 
lovely individuals camping around the
bridge<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:55.180> is<00:04:55.390> where<00:04:55.630> some<00:04:56.500> detective

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
bridge and this is where some detective

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.130 
bridge and this is where some detective
where<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.430> comes<00:04:57.640> into<00:04:57.850> play<00:04:58.150> I<00:04:58.420> noticed<00:04:59.110> that

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
where it comes into play I noticed that

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.050 
where it comes into play I noticed that
one<00:04:59.350> of<00:04:59.380> them<00:04:59.590> is<00:04:59.620> firing<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.220> his<00:05:00.400> weapon<00:05:00.850> and

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
one of them is firing to his weapon and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.640 
one of them is firing to his weapon and
this<00:05:01.270> gives<00:05:01.480> me<00:05:01.630> the<00:05:01.720> idea<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:02.170> he's<00:05:02.500> gonna

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
this gives me the idea that he's gonna

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.500 
this gives me the idea that he's gonna
have<00:05:02.860> to<00:05:03.010> reload<00:05:03.400> soon<00:05:03.700> and<00:05:03.940> so<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.120> prioritize

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
have to reload soon and so I prioritize

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.620 
have to reload soon and so I prioritize
him<00:05:05.380> as<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:06.070> person<00:05:06.100> that<00:05:06.670> I<00:05:06.820> can<00:05:07.090> avoid<00:05:07.390> at

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
him as the person that I can avoid at

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.450 
him as the person that I can avoid at
least<00:05:07.840> for<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> couple<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.440> seconds<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.070> also

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
least for a couple of seconds I also

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.390 
least for a couple of seconds I also
noticed<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.940> other<00:05:10.000> guy<00:05:10.210> is<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.780> ground

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
noticed the other guy is on the ground

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280 
noticed the other guy is on the ground
prone<00:05:12.400> when<00:05:13.060> someone's<00:05:13.420> on<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.630> ground<00:05:13.870> prone

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
prone when someone's on the ground prone

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.380 
prone when someone's on the ground prone
around<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.890> high-traffic<00:05:15.130> area<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:16.150> usually

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
around a high-traffic area it usually

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.510 
around a high-traffic area it usually
means<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:17.050> they've<00:05:17.770> been<00:05:17.800> shot<00:05:18.190> at<00:05:18.400> it

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
means that they've been shot at it

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.830 
means that they've been shot at it
usually<00:05:18.640> means<00:05:19.000> they're<00:05:19.240> ducking<00:05:19.510> for<00:05:19.780> cover

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
usually means they're ducking for cover

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.450 
usually means they're ducking for cover
they're<00:05:20.230> trying<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.650> avoid<00:05:20.770> taking<00:05:21.040> any<00:05:21.250> more

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
they're trying to avoid taking any more

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.610 
they're trying to avoid taking any more
damage<00:05:21.730> and<00:05:22.060> so<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.480> have<00:05:22.660> this<00:05:22.840> even<00:05:23.140> suspicion

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
damage and so I have this even suspicion

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.370 
damage and so I have this even suspicion
that<00:05:23.800> he's<00:05:24.670> already<00:05:25.390> vulnerable<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:26.170> he's

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
that he's already vulnerable that he's

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.050 
that he's already vulnerable that he's
already<00:05:26.620> taken<00:05:26.830> some<00:05:27.190> damage<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:27.640> that<00:05:27.910> he's

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
already taken some damage and that he's

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.760 
already taken some damage and that he's
going<00:05:28.240> to<00:05:28.330> be<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.630> easy<00:05:28.810> target<00:05:29.290> to<00:05:29.320> take<00:05:29.530> out

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
going to be the easy target to take out

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.650 
going to be the easy target to take out
alongside<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.760> fact<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.150> i'm<00:05:31.360> assuming

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
alongside the fact that i'm assuming

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.150 
alongside the fact that i'm assuming
that<00:05:31.960> the<00:05:32.050> other<00:05:32.200> guy<00:05:32.410> is<00:05:32.470> having<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:33.010> go

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
that the other guy is having to go

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.250 
that the other guy is having to go
through<00:05:33.400> his<00:05:33.580> reload<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.390> turns<00:05:34.900> out<00:05:35.080> to

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
through his reload and it turns out to

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.930 
through his reload and it turns out to
be<00:05:35.290> true<00:05:35.410> i'm<00:05:36.070> able<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.370> take<00:05:36.490> out<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.730> first

clear shot on the helicopter the reason

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.850 
clear shot on the helicopter the reason

why I took this shot over all of the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.040 
why I took this shot over all of the
others<00:05:57.160> is<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:57.490> if<00:05:58.150> you<00:05:58.360> if<00:05:58.570> you<00:05:58.690> go<00:05:58.870> back

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
others is that if you if you go back

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.930 
others is that if you if you go back
you'll<00:05:59.350> notice<00:05:59.770> that<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.250> helicopters

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
you'll notice that the helicopters

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.450 
you'll notice that the helicopters
earlier<00:06:01.390> we're<00:06:01.930> flying<00:06:02.320> at<00:06:02.560> a<00:06:02.590> terrible<00:06:02.890> angle

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
earlier we're flying at a terrible angle

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.950 
earlier we're flying at a terrible angle
they<00:06:03.550> were<00:06:03.640> usually<00:06:03.790> flying<00:06:04.240> perpendicular

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
they were usually flying perpendicular

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.840 
they were usually flying perpendicular
to<00:06:05.110> me<00:06:05.230> which<00:06:05.470> are<00:06:05.650> really<00:06:06.160> difficult<00:06:06.340> to<00:06:06.700> land

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
to me which are really difficult to land

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.210 
to me which are really difficult to land
but<00:06:07.390> they're<00:06:07.510> also<00:06:07.690> flying<00:06:08.140> very<00:06:08.500> quickly<00:06:08.860> I

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
but they're also flying very quickly I

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.280 
but they're also flying very quickly I
don't<00:06:09.850> care<00:06:09.970> what<00:06:10.150> anyone<00:06:10.540> says<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.900> don't<00:06:11.170> care

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
don't care what anyone says I don't care

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.400 
don't care what anyone says I don't care
what<00:06:11.470> dice<00:06:11.680> says<00:06:12.010> the<00:06:12.820> straw<00:06:13.120> does<00:06:13.750> have<00:06:14.050> a<00:06:14.080> lot

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
what dice says the straw does have a lot

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.530 
what dice says the straw does have a lot
of<00:06:14.440> weaknesses<00:06:14.800> it's<00:06:15.370> not<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:16.180> can't<00:06:16.420> just

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
of weaknesses it's not you can't just

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.730 
of weaknesses it's not you can't just
instantly<00:06:16.960> take<00:06:17.170> out<00:06:17.320> every<00:06:17.560> helicopter

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
instantly take out every helicopter

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.320 
instantly take out every helicopter
that's<00:06:18.130> in<00:06:18.340> the<00:06:18.430> sky<00:06:18.640> like<00:06:18.790> that's<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:19.180> not

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
that's in the sky like that's just not

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.120 
that's in the sky like that's just not
feasible<00:06:19.570> and<00:06:20.050> you<00:06:20.350> have<00:06:20.530> to<00:06:20.680> wait<00:06:20.830> for<00:06:20.860> that

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
feasible and you have to wait for that

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.820 
feasible and you have to wait for that
that<00:06:21.520> opportune<00:06:22.030> moment<00:06:22.510> to<00:06:22.660> fire<00:06:23.530> your

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
that opportune moment to fire your

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.890 
that opportune moment to fire your
rocket<00:06:24.040> and<00:06:24.490> so<00:06:24.850> I<00:06:24.880> noticed<00:06:25.300> this<00:06:25.390> particular

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
rocket and so I noticed this particular

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.870 
rocket and so I noticed this particular
helicopter<00:06:26.620> stalled<00:06:27.160> he<00:06:27.520> was<00:06:27.640> probably

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
helicopter stalled he was probably

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.970 
helicopter stalled he was probably
fighting<00:06:28.240> another<00:06:28.510> helicopter<00:06:28.840> he<00:06:29.620> was<00:06:29.770> way

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
fighting another helicopter he was way

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.920 
fighting another helicopter he was way
out<00:06:30.010> in<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.340> open<00:06:30.550> and<00:06:30.820> that's<00:06:31.330> when<00:06:31.780> I<00:06:31.810> took

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
out in the open and that's when I took

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.260 
out in the open and that's when I took
the<00:06:32.230> shot<00:06:32.470> I<00:06:32.680> didn't<00:06:33.010> waste<00:06:33.190> my<00:06:33.460> ammunition<00:06:33.820> I

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:34.270 
the shot I didn't waste my ammunition I

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.270 
the shot I didn't waste my ammunition I
didn't<00:06:34.540> waste<00:06:34.720> my<00:06:34.900> rockets<00:06:35.320> earlier<00:06:35.710> and<00:06:35.950> then

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
didn't waste my rockets earlier and then

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.670 
didn't waste my rockets earlier and then
when<00:06:36.580> the<00:06:36.669> opportunity<00:06:36.970> arose<00:06:37.720> I<00:06:38.110> was<00:06:38.320> able<00:06:38.500> to

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
when the opportunity arose I was able to

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.640 
when the opportunity arose I was able to
secure<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.340> kill

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
secure the kill

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.310
