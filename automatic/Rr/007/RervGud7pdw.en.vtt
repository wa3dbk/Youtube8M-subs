00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
and started to get problems when things

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.390 
and started to get problems when things
got<00:01:58.820> bigger<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.930> relatively<00:02:00.740> large<00:02:00.980> vast

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
got bigger this relatively large vast

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.980 
got bigger this relatively large vast
result<00:02:01.970> could<00:02:02.120> do<00:02:02.240> with<00:02:02.330> additional<00:02:02.780> light

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
result could do with additional light

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.630 
result could do with additional light
from<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.380> side<00:02:03.560> obviously<00:02:03.770> there's<00:02:04.130> nothing

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
from the side obviously there's nothing

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.950 
from the side obviously there's nothing
to<00:02:04.730> stop<00:02:04.850> me<00:02:04.910> getting<00:02:05.120> another<00:02:05.450> light<00:02:05.750> and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
to stop me getting another light and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.340 
to stop me getting another light and
shining<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:06.890> through<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.340> side<00:02:07.580> but<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:08.350> think

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
shining it through the side but I think

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.420 
shining it through the side but I think
you'd<00:02:09.440> probably<00:02:09.470> end<00:02:09.710> up<00:02:09.860> needing<00:02:10.040> three

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
you'd probably end up needing three

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
over using flash you can obviously see

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.660 
over using flash you can obviously see
what<00:02:15.500> your<00:02:15.620> shots<00:02:15.860> going<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.220> look<00:02:16.460> like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
criticism I think it would be the these

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.770
