00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.610 
randomly and it could happen everybody
in<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.329> server<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:54.900> whatever<00:02:55.349> it<00:02:55.500> just

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
in the server or whatever it just

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.379 
in the server or whatever it just
doesn't<00:02:55.950> whatever<00:02:56.159> it<00:02:56.250> feels<00:02:56.310> like<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.819> so

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
doesn't whatever it feels like it so

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.610 
doesn't whatever it feels like it so
it's<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.599> little<00:02:57.690> bit<00:02:57.900> unstable<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.470> that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's a little bit unstable in that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.729 
it's a little bit unstable in that
situation<00:02:59.220> but<00:03:00.030> that's<00:03:00.780> about<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.109> only<00:03:01.500> flaw

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
situation but that's about the only flaw

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.319 
situation but that's about the only flaw
like<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.040> said<00:03:02.220> because<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.639> aims<00:03:02.909> towards<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
like I said because this aims towards a

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.449 
like I said because this aims towards a
more<00:03:03.450> competitive<00:03:03.720> style<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:05.010> really

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459
