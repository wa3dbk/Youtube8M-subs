colors<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.720> I'm<00:03:06.720> gonna<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.530> neon<00:03:08.400> colored

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
colors so I'm gonna get the neon colored

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.060 
colors so I'm gonna get the neon colored
first<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.290> just<00:03:11.040> paint<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.900> diagonally

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
first and just paint it diagonally

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:25.520 
first and just paint it diagonally
across<00:03:14.090> right<00:03:15.090> here<00:03:22.190> and<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:24.290> you'll<00:03:25.290> get

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
across right here and then you'll get

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.670 
across right here and then you'll get
the<00:03:25.920> black<00:03:26.610> striper<00:03:27.120> polish<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.410> get

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
the black striper polish going to get

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:45.010 
the black striper polish going to get
the<00:03:35.310> yellow<00:03:36.240> polish<00:03:36.630> again<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:43.050> just<00:03:44.040> paint

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
the yellow polish again and just paint

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.010

the<00:03:46.020> triangle<00:03:47.090> sort<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.210> shape<00:03:48.450> you're<00:03:48.870> going

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
the triangle sort of shape you're going

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.270
