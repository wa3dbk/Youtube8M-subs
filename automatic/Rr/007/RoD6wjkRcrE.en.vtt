00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.279 

you<00:05:43.000> know

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
you know

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:49.589 
you know
it's<00:05:44.889> uh<00:05:47.189> I'm<00:05:48.189> probably<00:05:48.550> gonna<00:05:48.999> wash<00:05:49.330> this

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599

it's uh I'm probably gonna wash this
stuff<00:05:49.749> out<00:05:50.080> I<00:05:50.580> just<00:05:51.580> don't<00:05:51.789> like<00:05:51.969> it

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.070 

and<00:05:55.200> where<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.190> clumped<00:05:56.730> up<00:05:56.820> earlier<00:05:57.390> when<00:05:58.020> I

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
and where it clumped up earlier when I

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.810 
and where it clumped up earlier when I
first<00:05:58.320> put<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.620> gel<00:05:58.860> on<00:05:59.040> is<00:05:59.280> still<00:05:59.550> stuck

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
first put the gel on is still stuck

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.870 
first put the gel on is still stuck
together<00:06:00.770> maybe<00:06:01.770> part<00:06:02.130> of<00:06:02.220> the<00:06:02.280> problem<00:06:02.340> is

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
together maybe part of the problem is

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.440 
together maybe part of the problem is
that<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.150> never<00:06:04.400> this<00:06:07.400> bent<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.700> stayed<00:06:09.060> stuck

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
that I never this bent and stayed stuck

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.140 
that I never this bent and stayed stuck
I<00:06:10.350> think<00:06:11.160> part<00:06:11.340> of<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.520> problem<00:06:11.550> might<00:06:12.120> be

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
I think part of the problem might be

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.320 
I think part of the problem might be
that<00:06:12.690> I<00:06:13.230> put<00:06:13.530> too<00:06:13.710> much<00:06:13.860> of<00:06:14.040> it<00:06:14.100> on<00:06:14.310> trying<00:06:15.240> to

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
that I put too much of it on trying to

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.670 
that I put too much of it on trying to
weigh<00:06:15.450> it<00:06:15.570> down<00:06:16.070> also<00:06:17.810> that<00:06:18.810> my<00:06:19.080> ends<00:06:19.410> are<00:06:19.500> not

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
weigh it down also that my ends are not

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.770 
weigh it down also that my ends are not
trim<00:06:20.130> so<00:06:20.490> maybe<00:06:20.730> that's<00:06:20.910> why<00:06:21.090> I<00:06:21.120> was<00:06:21.360> nodding

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
trim so maybe that's why I was nodding

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.770 
trim so maybe that's why I was nodding
up<00:06:21.900> as<00:06:22.080> much<00:06:22.260> as<00:06:22.440> it<00:06:22.590> did<00:06:22.770> in<00:06:23.040> any<00:06:23.790> case<00:06:24.150> I'm

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
up as much as it did in any case I'm

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.450 
up as much as it did in any case I'm
gonna<00:06:25.080> have<00:06:25.230> to<00:06:25.320> do<00:06:25.470> something<00:06:25.710> else<00:06:26.010> i'm<00:06:26.310> not
