00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
technique like this can be changed up a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.950 
technique like this can be changed up a
lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> very

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
lot of some way it's not a very

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
lot of some way it's not a very
difficult<00:00:45.989> technique<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.800> all<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.329> be

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
difficult technique at all but it can be

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
difficult technique at all but it can be
the<00:00:48.870> overall<00:00:49.770> sign<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.489> changed<00:00:50.789> by

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the overall sign of it can be changed by

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.369 
the overall sign of it can be changed by
the<00:00:51.090> way<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> attack<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.780> your<00:00:51.930> pick<00:00:52.199> and

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the way you attack it with your pick and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.410 
the way you attack it with your pick and
how<00:00:52.890> rhythmic<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
how rhythmic you get with it and by that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.680 
how rhythmic you get with it and by that
I<00:00:54.570> mean

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.630 

I'm<00:01:03.690> really<00:01:04.019> attacking<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> pic<00:01:04.799> quite

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
I'm really attacking with the pic quite

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.399 
I'm really attacking with the pic quite
heavily<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.690> other<00:01:06.810> ways<00:01:06.960> getting<00:01:07.260> more

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
heavily there in other ways getting more

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.730 
heavily there in other ways getting more
rhythmic<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.190> which<00:01:08.430> would<00:01:08.550> be<00:01:12.650> you<00:01:13.650> know

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
rhythmic with it which would be you know

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.020 
rhythmic with it which would be you know
just<00:01:14.190> adding<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> little<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.729> feel<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.940> little

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
just adding a little more feel a little

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140 
just adding a little more feel a little
more<00:01:15.210> motion<00:01:15.390> into<00:01:16.040> what<00:01:17.040> could<00:01:17.159> look<00:01:17.340> someone

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
more motion into what could look someone

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.630 
more motion into what could look someone
consider<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> simple<00:01:18.780> technique<00:01:19.140> but<00:01:19.610> but<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
consider a simple technique but but a

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.560 
consider a simple technique but but a
lot<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.149> done<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:22.619> improve<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
lot can be done with it to improve on it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
lot can be done with it to improve on it
different<00:01:24.570> chord<00:01:24.750> shapes<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.259> well<00:01:25.290> you've

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
different chord shapes as well you've

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.749 
different chord shapes as well you've
got<00:01:26.340> an<00:01:26.460> E<00:01:26.580> chord<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:28.399> you've<00:01:29.399> got<00:01:29.580> an<00:01:29.700> E

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
those for layering different styles of

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:07.999 
those for layering different styles of
music<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:07.409> could<00:02:07.499> hear<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.740> tonal

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
music you could hear the tonal

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.479 
music you could hear the tonal
differences<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:09.420> different<00:02:09.569> areas<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.739> my

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
differences in the different areas so my

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.910 
differences in the different areas so my
advice<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.989> advice<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.379> be<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.560> just

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
advice to be my advice would be to just

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.430 
advice to be my advice would be to just
explore<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.430> different<00:02:17.760> shapes<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.440> Co

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
explore the different shapes to Co

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.960 
explore the different shapes to Co
different<00:02:19.709> sounds<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.129> go<00:02:20.280> for<00:02:20.549> these
