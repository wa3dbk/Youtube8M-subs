00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 Hello! 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 Suppose we have a task - to round 24.259 to hundreds. 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.820
 Perhaps you think the solution to this problem is quite simple, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.300
 but I still propose to think - what does it mean to "round up to hundreds"? 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.440
 To do this, draw a numerical line. 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.960
 Let's draw it here and mark only hundreds on it. 

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:47.291
 Suppose we have 24.100, then the next number is 24.200, then 24.300, and finally 24.400. 

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:52.485
 I think you understand what I meant when I proposed to mark only hundreds on the number line. 

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:55.886
 Every next number I increase by 100. 

00:00:56.123 --> 00:01:02.623
 Now let's determine where on the number line is 24.259? 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 So, if we look at our number line, we will see 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.580
 that 24.259 is more than 24.200, but less than 24.300. 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:24.300
 And this is 259, that is, 59. ... If this is a distance of 100 units, then 59 is somewhere here. 

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:30.144
 Note our number. This is 24.259. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 So when someone asks you to round the number to hundreds, 

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:40.800
 then it will mean that you should round it to one of these numbers, 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.840
 but rather to the one that is located closer to the specified number. 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:54.280
 If you look at our line, you will see that it is closer to 24.300 than to 24.200. 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.640
 So, if we round to the nearest value, the answer we get will be 24.300. 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.860
 This is one of the ways to explain the phrase "round to hundreds." 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.940
 You do not need to draw a number line and put all these symbols every time 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 when you have a similar problem. 

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:17.890
 Enough to do it mentally. 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:29.560
 And an even simpler way is to just look at the number (let me write it again) 24.259. 

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:36.280
 We want to round it to hundreds, so we look where we have hundreds. ... 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 Here they are. When we round off, it means that we are not interested in smaller digits, 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600
 and we need to put zeros after hundreds. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.200
 Therefore, we look at the rank, which is one less than the one to which we round. 

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.380
 We round up to hundreds, so the smaller one is tens. 

00:02:54.521 --> 00:03:01.920
 If this number is 5 or more, for example: 6, 7, 8 or 9, then we round up. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.580
 We have the number 5, so we round up. 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.180
 This means that our hundreds will increase by 1 and instead of two we will have 3. 

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:21.400
 That means 24.300. That's what it means to "round up." 

00:03:21.456 --> 00:03:25.260
 And now we will consider, some kind of, the opposite example. 

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:32.000
 We have the number 24.249 and we need to round it to hundreds. 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.840
 Let's look at dozens, this is immediately to the right of hundreds. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.800
 If this digit is not worth the figure of 5 or more, then we round down. 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.320
 But be careful, this does not mean that we should reduce the hundreds. 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.120
 We should just leave our deuce in place and remove all the numbers behind it. 

00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:56.180
 That is, we get 24.200. 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.360
 This is what happens when rounding down. When rounding to a large - we got 24.300. 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.560
 It is right. Look here: the number 24.249 would be located on a number line somewhere here. 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.280
 Closer to 24.200. We rounded down. 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:28.040
 And in the problem with the number 24.259, the closest number was 24.300. We rounded up. 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.660
 Well then. That's all for today! See you at the next lesson.
