00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hmm I figured out what our job is for

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.500 
hmm I figured out what our job is for
this<00:00:02.190> section<00:00:02.490> we're<00:00:03.000> just<00:00:03.179> gonna<00:00:03.270> look

this section we're just gonna look
really<00:00:03.840> fast<00:00:04.170> at<00:00:04.500> some<00:00:04.920> of<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.960> slides<00:00:06.960> that

this hopefully looks familiar to you at
this<00:00:14.280> point<00:00:15.199> there's<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:16.350> entire<00:00:16.710> section<00:00:17.460> on

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
this point there's an entire section on

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.189 
this point there's an entire section on
connective<00:00:18.210> tissue<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.720> there's<00:00:18.930> just<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
connective tissue but there's just a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.320 
connective tissue but there's just a
couple<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.680> wanted<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> show<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.430> up

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
couple that I wanted to show you up

close and personal first of all check
out<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:24.810> bad<00:00:25.050> boy<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> actually<00:00:26.640> skin

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
out this bad boy this is actually skin

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.419 
out this bad boy this is actually skin
we're<00:00:27.779> gonna<00:00:27.869> look<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.289> skin<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.130> lot<00:00:29.400> more

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
we're gonna look at skin in a lot more

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.030 
we're gonna look at skin in a lot more
detail<00:00:30.380> skin<00:00:31.940> lines<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.149> space<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
detail skin lines a space and so this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
detail skin lines a space and so this
what<00:00:35.280> kind<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.489> tissue<00:00:35.670> are<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.090> gonna<00:00:36.239> expect

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
what kind of tissue are you gonna expect

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.750 
what kind of tissue are you gonna expect
to<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:36.960> right<00:00:37.140> here

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
to see right here

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
to see right here
some<00:00:38.760> kind<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> epithelial<00:00:39.780> tissue<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.350> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
some kind of epithelial tissue is that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.200 
some kind of epithelial tissue is that
where<00:00:41.040> you're<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> look<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> find<00:00:42.000> your

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
where you're going to look to find your

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
where you're going to look to find your
connective<00:00:42.629> tissue<00:00:43.399> no<00:00:44.399> no<00:00:44.670> no<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.719> your

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
connective tissue no no no because your

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.069 
connective tissue no no no because your
connective<00:00:46.620> tissue<00:00:46.800> doesn't<00:00:47.160> line<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> space

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
connective tissue doesn't line a space

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
connective tissue doesn't line a space
holy<00:00:49.399> what<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> mess

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
holy what a mess

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.229 
holy what a mess
seriously<00:00:51.570> look<00:00:51.989> at<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
seriously look at this what this is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.889 
seriously look at this what this is
crazy

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
crazy

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.010 
crazy
this<00:00:55.379> crazy<00:00:55.800> mess<00:00:56.390> where<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.780> actually

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this crazy mess where you can actually

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.180 
this crazy mess where you can actually
kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.789> think<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.930> cell<00:01:01.680> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
kind of I don't think I see a cell in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.509 
kind of I don't think I see a cell in
this<00:01:02.399> madness<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:04.500> looks<00:01:04.739> like<00:01:04.830> pure

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
this madness this just looks like pure

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
this madness this just looks like pure
madness<00:01:05.760> maybe<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.260> these<00:01:07.350> dark<00:01:07.650> spots

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
madness maybe some of these dark spots

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
madness maybe some of these dark spots
ourselves<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.270> certainly<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.200> them

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
ourselves but certainly not all of them

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
ourselves but certainly not all of them
what<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.700> these<00:01:11.880> big<00:01:12.270> pink<00:01:12.810> things

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
what do you think these big pink things

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.460 
what do you think these big pink things
are<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.460> holy<00:01:14.820> mess<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.710> dense<00:01:16.909> madness

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
are in a holy mess of dense madness

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.230 
are in a holy mess of dense madness
those<00:01:19.470> are<00:01:19.619> collagen<00:01:20.189> fibers<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> guys<00:01:20.880> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
those are collagen fibers you guys and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.260 
those are collagen fibers you guys and
those<00:01:21.689> collagen<00:01:22.320> fibers<00:01:22.770> organized<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:24.060> such

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
those collagen fibers organized in such

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
those collagen fibers organized in such
an<00:01:24.420> unorganized<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:26.509> means<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.990> kind

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
an unorganized way means that this kind

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.170 
an unorganized way means that this kind
of<00:01:28.380> tissue<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.799> actually<00:01:28.950> dense<00:01:29.520> irregular

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
of tissue is actually dense irregular

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.560 
of tissue is actually dense irregular
connective<00:01:30.299> tissue<00:01:31.430> like<00:01:32.430> most<00:01:32.820> things<00:01:33.210> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
connective tissue like most things in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.359 
connective tissue like most things in
biology<00:01:35.570> we<00:01:36.570> label<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.320> dense<00:01:37.680> regular<00:01:38.189> or

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
biology we label it as dense regular or

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.300 
biology we label it as dense regular or
dense<00:01:39.360> irregular<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.770> crazy

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
dense irregular and that's just crazy

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.450 
dense irregular and that's just crazy
talk<00:01:41.520> because<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.229> spectrum<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.920> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
talk because it's a spectrum and so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.310 
talk because it's a spectrum and so
sometimes<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.119> gets<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.479> bit<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.110> is

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
sometimes it gets a little bit like is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.359 
sometimes it gets a little bit like is
this<00:01:46.590> irregular<00:01:47.250> irregular<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.979> this<00:01:49.979> dense

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
this irregular irregular is this dense

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.719 
this irregular irregular is this dense
or<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.030> loose<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.840> looks<00:01:52.409> kind<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.549> mean

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
or is it loose it looks kind of I mean

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.039 
or is it loose it looks kind of I mean
there's<00:01:53.880> some<00:01:54.090> space<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> there

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
there's some space in there

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.410 
there's some space in there
to<00:01:55.380> me<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.310> eyeball<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.939> looks<00:01:57.119> dense

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to me to my eyeball it looks dense

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289 
to me to my eyeball it looks dense
because<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> size<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.299> collagen

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
because of the size of the collagen

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
because of the size of the collagen
fibers<00:02:00.469> but<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.770> imagine<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.280> there's

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
fibers but you can imagine that there's

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.810 
fibers but you can imagine that there's
some<00:02:03.119> variation<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.229> that's<00:02:04.829> fine<00:02:05.219> don't

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
some variation here that's fine don't

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.180 
some variation here that's fine don't
worry<00:02:05.969> about<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.509> let's<00:02:07.350> look<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.920> I

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
worry about that let's look at what I

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.210 
worry about that let's look at what I
wonder<00:02:09.259> what<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.920> wanting

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
wonder what do you think I was wanting

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
is so slow you see something that looks

there's the little nucleus crammed down

giant<00:03:17.129> fat<00:03:17.819> blob<00:03:18.449> thank<00:03:19.409> you<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.919> then<00:03:20.549> look

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
giant fat blob thank you and then look

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.569 
giant fat blob thank you and then look
this<00:03:21.120> looks<00:03:21.419> like<00:03:21.629> it<00:03:22.349> looks<00:03:22.560> kind<00:03:22.949> of<00:03:23.099> regular

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
this looks like it looks kind of regular

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.610 
this looks like it looks kind of regular
but<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.879> really<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.720> would<00:03:25.079> argue<00:03:25.229> it's

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
but it really I would argue it's

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.170 
but it really I would argue it's
probably<00:03:25.709> not<00:03:26.370> dense<00:03:26.699> regular<00:03:26.970> connective

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
probably not dense regular connective

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.689 
probably not dense regular connective
tissue<00:03:27.780> you're<00:03:28.530> gonna<00:03:28.650> see<00:03:28.979> dense<00:03:29.340> regular

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.809 
tissue you're gonna see dense regular
connective<00:03:29.970> tissue<00:03:30.599> somewhere<00:03:31.229> that

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
connective tissue somewhere that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.780 
connective tissue somewhere that
experiences<00:03:32.819> like<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.540> force<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.889> one

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.379 
experiences like a force in one
direction<00:03:36.060> only<00:03:36.599> and<00:03:37.669> really<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:38.849> only<00:03:39.180> place

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
direction only and really the only place

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.969 
direction only and really the only place
that<00:03:39.419> we're<00:03:39.720> going<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.989> experience<00:03:40.560> something

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
that we're going to experience something

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:44.089 
that we're going to experience something
like<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:41.549> is<00:03:41.819> in<00:03:42.509> a<00:03:42.780> tendon<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.769> is

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
like that is in a tendon that is

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.920 
like that is in a tendon that is
attached<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:44.909> muscle<00:03:45.239> it<00:03:45.449> attaches<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
attached to a muscle it attaches a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.170 
attached to a muscle it attaches a
muscle<00:03:46.349> to<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> bone<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.639> dense<00:03:47.909> regular

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
muscle to a bone so dense regular

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.759 
muscle to a bone so dense regular
connective<00:03:48.389> tissue

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
connective tissue

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.949 
connective tissue
there's<00:03:50.159> too<00:03:50.699> much<00:03:50.909> this<00:03:51.180> looks<00:03:51.419> too<00:03:51.629> messy

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
there's too much this looks too messy

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.460 
there's too much this looks too messy
for<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.349> to<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.769> dense<00:03:53.519> regular<00:03:54.030> it<00:03:54.989> does<00:03:55.259> look

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
for it to be dense regular it does look

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.409 
for it to be dense regular it does look
dense<00:03:55.739> doesn't<00:03:56.250> it<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:56.819> I'm<00:03:56.939> going<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.150> argue

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
dense doesn't it so I'm going to argue

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.390 
dense doesn't it so I'm going to argue
that<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.900> probably<00:03:58.139> dense<00:03:58.769> irregular

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
that this is probably dense irregular

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.670 
that this is probably dense irregular
connective<00:03:59.549> tissue<00:04:00.349> let's<00:04:01.349> see<00:04:01.470> what<00:04:01.590> the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
connective tissue let's see what the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.050 
connective tissue let's see what the
other<00:04:01.769> one<00:04:01.979> is<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.370> oh<00:04:02.549> here's<00:04:03.000> another

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
other one is that oh here's another

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.960 
other one is that oh here's another
example<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.840> look<00:04:04.409> at<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:04.650> mess<00:04:04.979> really<00:04:05.639> it

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
example of look at this mess really it

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.629 
example of look at this mess really it
just<00:04:06.030> looks<00:04:06.449> super<00:04:06.720> like<00:04:07.169> crazy<00:04:07.620> look<00:04:08.489> at<00:04:08.519> all

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
just looks super like crazy look at all

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.030 
just looks super like crazy look at all
squigglies<00:04:09.329> those<00:04:09.750> are<00:04:09.900> all<00:04:10.049> collagen<00:04:10.680> fibers

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
squigglies those are all collagen fibers

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.339 
squigglies those are all collagen fibers
it's<00:04:11.579> interesting<00:04:12.000> because<00:04:12.419> we<00:04:12.689> see<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.959> bunch

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
it's interesting because we see a bunch

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.670 
it's interesting because we see a bunch
of<00:04:13.530> nuclei<00:04:13.979> here<00:04:14.489> those<00:04:15.180> nuclei<00:04:15.629> are<00:04:15.930> outside

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
of nuclei here those nuclei are outside

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.499 
of nuclei here those nuclei are outside
of<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.070> fibers<00:04:17.489> sometimes<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.209> hard<00:04:18.359> to

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
of the fibers sometimes it's hard to

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.909 
of the fibers sometimes it's hard to
tell<00:04:18.659> because<00:04:18.840> they're<00:04:19.049> sitting<00:04:19.229> on<00:04:19.409> top<00:04:19.620> of<00:04:19.680> a

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
tell because they're sitting on top of a

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.860 
tell because they're sitting on top of a
fiber<00:04:20.159> but<00:04:20.789> they're<00:04:20.940> actually<00:04:21.479> in<00:04:21.719> between

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
fiber but they're actually in between

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.260 
fiber but they're actually in between
this<00:04:22.139> is<00:04:22.289> like<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.469> big<00:04:22.830> ol<00:04:22.979> fat<00:04:23.400> collagen<00:04:24.029> fiber

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
this is like a big ol fat collagen fiber

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.810 
this is like a big ol fat collagen fiber
right<00:04:24.539> here<00:04:24.810> that<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.950> that<00:04:26.250> means<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.700> we're

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
right here that it that means that we're

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.390 
right here that it that means that we're
probably

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
probably

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.770 
probably
we<00:04:27.490> dense<00:04:28.389> it<00:04:29.020> looks<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:30.310> looks<00:04:30.790> messy<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.750> me

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
we dense it looks it looks messy to me

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.560 
we dense it looks it looks messy to me
so<00:04:32.290> it's<00:04:32.410> probably<00:04:32.740> dense<00:04:33.160> irregular<00:04:33.669> but

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
so it's probably dense irregular but

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.379 
so it's probably dense irregular but
these<00:04:34.810> little<00:04:35.110> guys<00:04:35.229> are<00:04:35.290> actually<00:04:35.979> outside

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
these little guys are actually outside

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.080 
these little guys are actually outside
of<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:38.530> fibers<00:04:38.949> themselves<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:39.729> that's<00:04:39.940> how

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
of the fibers themselves so that's how

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.480 
of the fibers themselves so that's how
you<00:04:40.150> know<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.630> this<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.289> a<00:04:41.620> connective

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
you know that this is a connective

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.050 
you know that this is a connective
tissue<00:04:42.669> so<00:04:43.539> those<00:04:43.690> are<00:04:43.780> probably<00:04:43.930> fibroblasts

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
tissue so those are probably fibroblasts

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.219 
tissue so those are probably fibroblasts
all<00:04:46.060> right<00:04:46.210> those<00:04:46.389> are<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.630> pictures<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:46.990> I

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
all right those are the pictures that I

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.520 
all right those are the pictures that I
have<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.620> show<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.030> now<00:04:49.050> we're<00:04:50.050> gonna<00:04:50.139> take

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
have to show you now we're gonna take

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.650 
have to show you now we're gonna take
our<00:04:50.770> connective<00:04:51.280> tissues<00:04:51.729> and<00:04:52.060> we're<00:04:52.539> going

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
our connective tissues and we're going

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.150 
our connective tissues and we're going
to<00:04:52.720> combine<00:04:52.930> them<00:04:53.259> with<00:04:53.410> an<00:04:53.530> epithelial

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
to combine them with an epithelial

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.670 
to combine them with an epithelial
tissue<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.759> build<00:04:55.090> different<00:04:56.080> kinds<00:04:56.530> of

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
tissue to build different kinds of

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.430 
tissue to build different kinds of
membranes
