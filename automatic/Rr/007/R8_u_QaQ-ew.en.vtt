happened in this game I was watching

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.790 
happened in this game I was watching
this<00:02:27.740> match<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.390> saw<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.410> events

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
this match and so I saw the events

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.670 
this match and so I saw the events
unfold<00:02:31.250> wide<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.880> Julian<00:02:32.840> jumped<00:02:33.200> off<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.650> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
unfold wide and Julian jumped off to a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.610 
unfold wide and Julian jumped off to a
five<00:02:34.070> nothing<00:02:34.550> lead<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.660> noticed<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.290> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
five nothing lead and I noticed that and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.860 
five nothing lead and I noticed that and
so<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.890> thought<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.280> Julian<00:02:37.880> was<00:02:38.090> was<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.630> big

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
so I thought that Julian was was a big

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.290 
so I thought that Julian was was a big
favorite<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.440> win<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> match<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.910> turned

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
favorite to win the match but it turned

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.570 
favorite to win the match but it turned
around<00:02:41.480> very<00:02:42.020> quickly<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.770> this<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.190> one<00:02:43.460> of

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
around very quickly and this is one of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.250 
around very quickly and this is one of
the<00:02:43.640> fascinating<00:02:44.180> things<00:02:44.330> about<00:02:44.690> backgammon

arrow white opened with a 3-1 and this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.600 
arrow white opened with a 3-1 and this
is<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.300> best<00:03:02.540> possible<00:03:03.050> role<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.680> backgammon

Errol<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.180> on<00:03:32.480> shake<00:03:32.810> from<00:03:33.410> this<00:03:33.590> position<00:03:33.830> and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
Errol is on shake from this position and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.430 
Errol is on shake from this position and
the<00:03:34.400> question<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:35.000> does<00:03:35.209> he<00:03:35.390> double<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:35.930> in<00:03:36.350> a

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the question is does he double and in a

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.010 
the question is does he double and in a
money<00:03:36.709> situation<00:03:37.360> at<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.480> beginning<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.959> a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
money situation at the beginning of a

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.020 
money situation at the beginning of a
match<00:03:39.200> where<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.620> score<00:03:39.830> is<00:03:39.950> tied<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.760> would

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
match where the score is tied this would

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.360 
match where the score is tied this would
be<00:03:41.239> ludicrous<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.470> would<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.800> just<00:03:43.070> way<00:03:43.310> too

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
be ludicrous this would be just way too

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.910 
be ludicrous this would be just way too
early<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.209> double<00:03:44.510> but<00:03:44.900> at<00:03:45.050> this<00:03:45.290> kind<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.800> a

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
early to double but at this kind of a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.759 
early to double but at this kind of a
score<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:47.480> score<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.810> five<00:03:48.080> four<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.470> seven

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
score the score is five four to seven

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.009 
score the score is five four to seven
and<00:03:48.920> back<00:03:48.980> up<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.820> terms<00:03:50.060> we<00:03:50.300> think<00:03:50.570> of<00:03:50.690> this<00:03:50.810> as

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
and back up in terms we think of this as

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.350 
and back up in terms we think of this as
being<00:03:51.050> three<00:03:51.620> away<00:03:51.890> two<00:03:51.950> away<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:52.730> at<00:03:53.150> this

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
being three away two away and at this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.210 
being three away two away and at this
score<00:03:53.660> you<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.140> know<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.860> double

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
score you have to know that you double

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.240 
score you have to know that you double
very<00:03:55.519> very<00:03:55.850> early<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:56.930> need<00:03:57.140> very<00:03:57.470> little<00:03:57.890> of

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
very very early you need very little of

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.600 
very very early you need very little of
an<00:03:58.459> excuse<00:03:59.030> very<00:03:59.420> little<00:03:59.780> of<00:03:59.989> an<00:04:00.140> advantage<00:04:00.709> to

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
an excuse very little of an advantage to

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.330 
an excuse very little of an advantage to
double<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:03.050> they<00:04:03.650> don't<00:04:03.709> miss<00:04:04.100> this

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
double this and so they don't miss this

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.940 
double this and so they don't miss this
double<00:04:04.730> he<00:04:04.880> did<00:04:05.060> not<00:04:05.209> double<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.950> probably

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
double he did not double and probably

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.590 
double he did not double and probably
the<00:04:07.160> vast<00:04:07.310> majority<00:04:07.970> of<00:04:08.000> all<00:04:08.209> backgammon

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
the vast majority of all backgammon

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.960 
the vast majority of all backgammon
players<00:04:08.959> would<00:04:09.200> not<00:04:09.230> double<00:04:09.739> this<00:04:09.920> but<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:10.700> is

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
players would not double this but it is

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.120 
players would not double this but it is
correct<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.690> double<00:04:12.079> and<00:04:12.260> the<00:04:12.620> reason<00:04:12.980> it's

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
correct to double and the reason it's

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.059 
correct to double and the reason it's
correct<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.549> double<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:14.060> because<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.660> have

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
correct to double is because you have

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.310 
correct to double is because you have
huge<00:04:15.219> market<00:04:15.969> losing<00:04:16.359> sequences<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.169> what<00:04:17.289> I

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
huge market losing sequences and what I

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.710 
huge market losing sequences and what I
mean<00:04:17.620> by<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:18.009> is<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.639> there<00:04:19.329> are<00:04:19.449> some

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
mean by that is that there are some

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.719 
mean by that is that there are some
things<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.079> can<00:04:20.350> go<00:04:20.500> very<00:04:20.530> very<00:04:21.039> well<00:04:21.459> for

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
things that can go very very well for

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.760 
things that can go very very well for
white<00:04:22.180> immediately<00:04:22.570> oh<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.080> have<00:04:23.320> some<00:04:23.530> very

makes a four point board this is just a
blaster<00:04:33.639> just<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.419> an<00:04:34.539> incredible

blaster just this is just an incredible
super<00:04:35.410> Joker<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.949> this<00:04:36.370> is<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.669> number<00:04:36.880> that

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
super Joker and this is the number that

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.900 
super Joker and this is the number that
arrow<00:04:37.449> actually<00:04:37.889> rolled<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.340> match<00:04:39.520> and

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
arrow actually rolled in the match and

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.379 
arrow actually rolled in the match and
then<00:04:40.419> what<00:04:40.630> happened<00:04:40.990> was<00:04:41.199> that<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.970> Julian

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
then what happened was that that Julian

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.839 
then what happened was that that Julian
entered<00:04:44.050> one<00:04:44.289> checker<00:04:44.620> with<00:04:45.009> four<00:04:45.280> three<00:04:45.580> and

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
entered one checker with four three and

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.110 
entered one checker with four three and
at<00:04:46.210> this<00:04:46.419> point<00:04:46.860> erode<00:04:47.860> has<00:04:48.070> another<00:04:48.610> doubling

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
at this point erode has another doubling

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.850 
at this point erode has another doubling
decision<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:49.750> now<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.020> question<00:04:50.349> is<00:04:50.680> not

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
decision but now the question is not

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.230 
decision but now the question is not
whether<00:04:51.099> or<00:04:51.220> not<00:04:51.370> it's<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.639> double<00:04:51.970> it's<00:04:52.150> a

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
whether or not it's a double it's a

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.089 
whether or not it's a double it's a
question<00:04:52.599> of<00:04:52.720> whether<00:04:52.900> or<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.169> he's<00:04:53.590> too<00:04:53.860> good

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
question of whether or not he's too good

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.939 
question of whether or not he's too good
and<00:04:54.370> as<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.570> works<00:04:55.720> out<00:04:55.990> he's<00:04:56.229> not<00:04:56.440> quite<00:04:56.710> too

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
and as it works out he's not quite too

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.400 
and as it works out he's not quite too
good<00:04:57.130> this<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> double<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.270> pass<00:04:58.539> but<00:04:59.229> he

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
good this is a double and a pass but he

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.010 
good this is a double and a pass but he
has<00:04:59.590> lost<00:04:59.889> his<00:05:00.160> market<00:05:00.699> by<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.910> huge<00:05:01.419> amount<00:05:01.840> and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
has lost his market by a huge amount and

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.140 
has lost his market by a huge amount and
this<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.800> reason<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.430> he<00:05:03.789> should<00:05:03.820> have

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
this is the reason that he should have

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.170 
this is the reason that he should have
doubled<00:05:04.479> a<00:05:05.020> row<00:05:05.979> earlier<00:05:06.220> because<00:05:06.880> he<00:05:07.000> has

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
doubled a row earlier because he has

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.360 
doubled a row earlier because he has
some<00:05:07.360> really<00:05:07.630> great<00:05:07.960> sequences<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:08.949> it's

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
some really great sequences and it's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.870 
some really great sequences and it's
very<00:05:09.610> costly<00:05:10.150> when<00:05:10.449> you<00:05:10.690> when<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:11.500> roll<00:05:11.710> a<00:05:12.009> big

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
very costly when you when you roll a big

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.710 
very costly when you when you roll a big
great<00:05:13.449> sequence<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.139> you<00:05:14.470> haven't<00:05:14.830> doubled

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
great sequence and you haven't doubled

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.170 
great sequence and you haven't doubled
say<00:05:16.770> food<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.979> a<00:05:18.099> mistake<00:05:18.550> by<00:05:18.820> rolling<00:05:19.090> the

say food is a mistake by rolling the

double<00:05:19.449> five<00:05:20.340> let's<00:05:21.340> go<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.699> check<00:05:21.820> the

double five let's go and check the
