 recipes they all prepare without 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.850
 heat treatment without use 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.700
 pots and pans 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.550
 that is, imagine a dish 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.600
 all kinds of here and desserts cereals and soups 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.649

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.339
 they contain all the vitamins and 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.150
 trace elements proteins fats and carbohydrates in 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.369
 the most natural form that is alive 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.229
 know that during heat treatment 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.740
 many properties useful products 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.950
 getting lost so here this whole kitchen she 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.479
 fully preserves these properties but in 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.450
 so that's when multiplied even the form of pros 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.729
 in that very little time is spent on 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 cooking is practically necessary 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 some kind of grater if it is you 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 electric then this is a few seconds 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.890
 occupies 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 if not electric well minute this 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 May take 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.729
 A blender that will help you. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.950
 submersible or bowl well and actually 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.880
 further your fantasy is needed yours 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.549

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.920
 such a creative food look and in what 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.259
 feature of this food but not only 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.380
 that she saves time she adds 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:09.139

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:14.160
 very bright this food is very healthy and 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:16.230
 at the end you will see the mistress 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.740
 this collection is of course very 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:25.230
 a small part of what marina usually 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:28.620
 prepares and you see what happens with 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.160
 man if he turns on his diet 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:37.820
 a large number of such 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:40.770
 eating a meal well that contains itself 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.300
 tremendous energy sun energy energy 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:48.500
 life just dont even know what else 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.390
 say you just need to try 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.210
 Of course the most important thing is that these dishes 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.620
 all very tasty really when 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:02.310
 for the first time you start eating them here with me 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.740
 for example, it was a feeling that I 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.150
 it seemed I could not eat anything here I 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.130
 I constantly ate 2 one thing the other started 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.680
 try and make the second portion right there 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.020
 not because I wanted to eat like me 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.080
 was hungry and it was very tasty 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.340
 and I wanted to, as if by habit of eating 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.160
 more yummy 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.080
 I really passed the first time on 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.730
 it is but although it is on the whole and by the way 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.370
 not reflected that is, here's how 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.860
 since you can and move nothing with you 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.280
 will not happen and that's what happened to 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.920
 Marina when she began to use 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.610
 many dishes of lively cuisine 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.550
 that is, it has changed in appearance and 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:53.040
 internally broke up with part of their 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:57.120
 some health problems broke up 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.820
 with excess weight it is absolutely easy you 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.100
 you know that there are many systems of all kinds 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.370
 losing weight in the first place they are temporary 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.190
 and usually hinged dialed here at 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.520
 marinas this does not happen because she 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.850
 came to her most state 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.709
 naturally most beneficial to 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.410
 health 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.820
 so this weight will never return 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.790
 Well, I wish you 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.280
 come to my channel more often 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.380
 and be aware of all the news that 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.380
 I have a lot of money
