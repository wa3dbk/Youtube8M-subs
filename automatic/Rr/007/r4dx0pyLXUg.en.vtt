like<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.010> show<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.430> newest<00:00:53.879> project<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
like to show you my newest project and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:07.240 
like to show you my newest project and
we<00:00:57.960> previously<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:58.920> a<00:01:00.230> static<00:01:01.230> d-104<00:01:03.199> m6b<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.679 

we're<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.520> leaning<00:01:08.970> toward<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.450> base

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we're kind of leaning toward the base

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.980 
we're kind of leaning toward the base
microphone<00:01:12.320> type<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.560> stuff<00:01:13.890> here<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.840> at<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
microphone type of stuff here and at the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
microphone type of stuff here and at the
present<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:17.960> took<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.439> galaxy<00:01:20.280> base

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
present time I took my galaxy base

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.760 
present time I took my galaxy base
microphone<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.369> this<00:01:23.369> isn't<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:23.909> ordinary

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
microphone and this isn't your ordinary

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.359 
microphone and this isn't your ordinary
base<00:01:25.939> microphone<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:28.080> has<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> Roger<00:01:28.650> beep<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
base microphone it has a Roger beep and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
base microphone it has a Roger beep and
the<00:01:30.299> echo<00:01:31.220> but<00:01:32.220> uh<00:01:32.630> you're<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.930> probably

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the echo but uh you're kind of probably

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.880 
the echo but uh you're kind of probably
wondering<00:01:34.890> where<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.369> microphone<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.890> I'll

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
wondering where the microphone is I'll

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.410 
wondering where the microphone is I'll
tell<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.060> originally

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
tell you what the one that originally

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.719 
tell you what the one that originally
comes<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.470> wasn't<00:01:41.220> happy<00:01:41.549> with<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
comes with it I wasn't happy with and

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.719 
comes with it I wasn't happy with and
sometimes<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.210> mix<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.780> match<00:01:45.840> things

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
sometimes if you mix and match things

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.420 
sometimes if you mix and match things
you<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.939> better<00:01:48.149> results<00:01:48.329> down<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> road

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
you get better results down the road

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.149 
you get better results down the road
well<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.030> all<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.560> been<00:01:52.770> modified

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
well first of all this has been modified

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.969 
well first of all this has been modified
and<00:01:54.649> there's<00:01:55.649> no<00:01:55.920> 9-volt<00:01:56.490> battery<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.119> here

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
and there's no 9-volt battery in here

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.890 
and there's no 9-volt battery in here
and<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.130> have<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.280> battery<00:02:00.520> pack<00:02:00.909> let's<00:02:01.600> see<00:02:01.840> if

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
and I have a battery pack let's see if

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:11.970 
and I have a battery pack let's see if
we<00:02:02.110> get<00:02:02.680> down<00:02:03.009> in<00:02:03.280> here<00:02:08.580> well<00:02:10.620> tapped<00:02:11.620> over

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
we get down in here well tapped over

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.380 
we get down in here well tapped over
there<00:02:12.660> has<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> battery<00:02:14.020> pack<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.610> what<00:02:16.180> there

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
there has a battery pack and what there

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.000 
there has a battery pack and what there
is<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.900> their<00:02:17.709> six<00:02:18.239> double<00:02:19.239> A<00:02:19.330> batteries<00:02:20.010> which

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
is is their six double A batteries which

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.620 
is is their six double A batteries which
equals<00:02:21.430> nine<00:02:21.640> volts<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:27.730> we<00:02:27.849> go<00:02:28.000> what

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
equals nine volts and there we go what

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.979 
equals nine volts and there we go what
I'm<00:02:28.780> running<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.620> some<00:02:30.489> energizer<00:02:31.030> alternate

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
I'm running as some energizer alternate

batteries<00:02:39.430> are<00:02:39.459> two<00:02:39.910> years<00:02:40.180> old<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.920> I'm

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
batteries are two years old and I'm

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.580 
batteries are two years old and I'm
still<00:02:42.670> getting<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.209> combined<00:02:43.690> voltage<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.380> 10

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
still getting a combined voltage of 10

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.570 
still getting a combined voltage of 10
volts<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:46.440> on<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.560> base<00:02:47.739> microphone<00:02:48.370> like

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
volts and on the base microphone like

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.270 
volts and on the base microphone like
this<00:02:48.850> with<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.299> go<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.720> Roger<00:02:49.930> beep<00:02:50.290> you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
this with that go on a Roger beep you

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.180 
this with that go on a Roger beep you
kind<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.549> draw<00:02:51.819> some<00:02:52.120> power<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:53.140> on<00:02:54.069> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
kind of draw some power and on the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.800 
kind of draw some power and on the
average<00:02:54.340> some<00:02:54.850> people<00:02:55.180> are<00:02:55.269> replacing
