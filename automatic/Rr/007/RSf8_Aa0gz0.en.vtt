having a problem with their disliking
and<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.599> had<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.350> problem<00:00:16.680> not<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.859> too<00:00:17.190> long

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and I had this problem not just too long

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.109 
and I had this problem not just too long
ago<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.910> s<00:00:18.119> CTE<00:00:18.510> or<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.590> diff<00:00:19.850> I'll<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
ago my s CTE or the diff I'll put this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.090 
ago my s CTE or the diff I'll put this
together<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:21.840> guys<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.650> was<00:00:22.830> leaking

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
together for you guys it was leaking

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.660 
together for you guys it was leaking
right<00:00:24.080> here<00:00:25.080> right<00:00:25.710> between<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.160> scene<00:00:26.400> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
right here right between the scene of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.279 
right here right between the scene of
the<00:00:26.820> spur<00:00:27.750> gear<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.650> diff<00:00:28.949> housing<00:00:30.289> well

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the spur gear and the diff housing well

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.290 
the spur gear and the diff housing well
I<00:00:31.969> told<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.390> tighten<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> crap<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
I told them to tighten the crap out of

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.920 
I told them to tighten the crap out of
the<00:00:36.300> screws<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> fifth<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.750> that<00:00:39.750> would

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the screws for the fifth and that would

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
the screws for the fifth and that would
solve<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> problem<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.550> didn't<00:00:41.910> do

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
solve the problem and if that didn't do

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.290 
solve the problem and if that didn't do
it<00:00:42.180> then<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.540> seals<00:00:42.809> were<00:00:42.960> bad<00:00:43.219> so<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
it then the seals were bad so this is a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.619 
it then the seals were bad so this is a
diff<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.989> brand<00:00:49.289> new<00:00:49.469> seals<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:53.420> I'm<00:00:54.420> gonna

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
diff with brand new seals and I'm gonna

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.099 
diff with brand new seals and I'm gonna
do<00:00:54.809> how<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> bid<00:00:55.590> I'm<00:00:56.480> filling<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.750> oil

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
do how to bid I'm filling it up with oil

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.860 
do how to bid I'm filling it up with oil
and<00:00:58.500> tightening<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.170> bolts<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.760> so<00:01:02.870> let

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and tightening the bolts for it so let

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.509 
and tightening the bolts for it so let
me<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.110> started<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> guys<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.369> am

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
using team associated 5000 weight diff

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:20.719 
using team associated 5000 weight diff
all<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:12.240> take<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.149 

I<00:01:20.759> leave<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:24.710> leave<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.920> thing

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I leave that on the I leave this thing

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.749 
I leave that on the I leave this thing
in<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.710> prevent<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> leaking<00:01:29.369> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
in here to prevent from the leaking of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.109 
in here to prevent from the leaking of
it<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> all<00:01:34.009> right<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.280> when<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.790> filling<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it so all right now when I'm filling it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.279 
it so all right now when I'm filling it
up<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.360> oil<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.520> usually<00:01:38.520> want<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.930> gears<00:01:39.930> I

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
up with oil I usually want the gears I

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.639 
up with oil I usually want the gears I
mean<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> oil<00:01:41.450> just<00:01:43.460> halfway<00:01:44.460> between<00:01:45.649> just

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
mean the oil just halfway between just

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.460 
mean the oil just halfway between just
above<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.250> pins<00:01:47.640> right<00:01:47.880> here<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> use<00:01:49.140> they

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
above the pins right here and use they

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.630 
above the pins right here and use they
usually<00:01:49.619> that<00:01:49.950> marks<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.250> halfway<00:01:50.369> point

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
usually that marks the halfway point

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.800 
usually that marks the halfway point
between<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.539> bevel<00:01:52.439> gears<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.569> fill<00:01:54.569> it<00:01:54.690> up

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
between the bevel gears I fill it up

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.320 
between the bevel gears I fill it up
about<00:01:57.500> just<00:01:58.500> almost<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.640> above<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> double

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
about just almost just above the double

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.969 
about just almost just above the double
there's<00:02:00.659> almost<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.319> but<00:02:03.710> I'll<00:02:04.710> show<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
there's almost there but I'll show you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.529 
there's almost there but I'll show you
guys<00:02:05.220> in<00:02:05.429> just<00:02:05.459> a<00:02:05.700> sec<00:02:05.909> once<00:02:06.179> I<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.420> done

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.010 

there's<00:02:27.270> how<00:02:27.480> much<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.990> fill<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.380> -<00:02:29.900> you<00:02:30.900> guys

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
there's how much I fill it up - you guys

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.170 
there's how much I fill it up - you guys
gonna<00:02:31.260> see<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.590> that's<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.700> where<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> fill

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
gonna see that that's about where I fill

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.780 
gonna see that that's about where I fill
it<00:02:33.270> up<00:02:33.330> -<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.830> should<00:02:35.160> be<00:02:35.310> good<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:35.640> there

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
it up - and it should be good from there

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.600 
it up - and it should be good from there
so<00:02:36.350> let's<00:02:37.350> get<00:02:37.470> started<00:02:37.890> putting<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.459> back

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
so let's get started putting this back

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.390 
so let's get started putting this back
together<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:39.480> since<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:40.170> oils<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.770> there<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.640 

just<00:02:44.400> go<00:02:44.790> ahead<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.570> put<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.050> cap<00:02:46.230> back<00:02:46.260> on

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
just go ahead and I put the cap back on

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.580 
just go ahead and I put the cap back on
you<00:02:46.800> want<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> line<00:02:47.190> up<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.870> heads<00:02:48.870> having<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
you want to line up the heads having the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:03:00.949 
you want to line up the heads having the
holes<00:02:50.160> with<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.790> screws<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:59.780> just<00:03:00.780> set

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
holes with it and the screws I just set

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.620 
holes with it and the screws I just set
the<00:03:01.080> screws<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.530> there<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.180> then<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.300> tighten

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the screws in there and then I tighten

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:19.590 
the screws in there and then I tighten
them<00:03:03.870> up

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.840 

reason<00:03:20.380> why<00:03:20.500> I'm<00:03:20.650> using<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:21.070> smaller<00:03:21.370> Allen

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
reason why I'm using the smaller Allen

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.190 
reason why I'm using the smaller Allen
wrenches<00:03:22.240> is<00:03:22.450> because<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.840> get<00:03:23.050> better

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
wrenches is because I get better

leverage<00:03:23.590> on<00:03:24.010> these<00:03:25.410> for<00:03:26.410> now<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.860> just<00:03:27.040> want

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
leverage on these for now you just want

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.900 
leverage on these for now you just want
to<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.400> them<00:03:27.520> snug<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.170> bolts<00:03:29.350> just<00:03:29.860> in<00:03:30.670> there

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
to get them snug the bolts just in there

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.690 
to get them snug the bolts just in there
and<00:03:31.150> snug<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:32.470> want<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.800> rotate<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.490> diff

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
and snug and you want to rotate the diff

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:54.870 
and snug and you want to rotate the diff
and<00:03:35.580> put<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.700> bolts<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.090> there<00:03:37.420> on<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:38.350> screws

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.850 

once<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.000> got<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.390> go<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.870> next<00:03:57.110> bolt<00:03:57.410> on

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
once you got that go the next bolt on

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:14.140 
once you got that go the next bolt on
the<00:03:58.220> screw<00:03:59.320> bolts<00:04:00.320> curve<00:04:00.530> same<00:04:00.920> thing

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.840

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:34.640 

and<00:04:21.720> then<00:04:22.250> last<00:04:23.250> one<00:04:24.890> didn't<00:04:25.890> know<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:33.650> once

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
and then last one didn't know and once

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.180 
and then last one didn't know and once
you<00:04:34.770> get<00:04:34.920> done<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.840> want<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.080> go<00:04:37.140> back<00:04:39.890> and<00:04:40.890> you

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
you get done you want to go back and you

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.390 
you get done you want to go back and you
want<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.430> make<00:04:41.580> sure<00:04:41.610> these<00:04:42.560> bolts<00:04:43.560> are<00:04:43.710> really

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
want to make sure these bolts are really

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.420 
want to make sure these bolts are really
tight<00:04:44.930> because<00:04:45.930> from<00:04:46.680> all<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:46.950> centrifugal

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
tight because from all the centrifugal

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.220 
tight because from all the centrifugal
force<00:04:47.460> especially<00:04:48.450> with<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.720> new<00:04:48.840> motor<00:04:49.110> I

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
force especially with the new motor I

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.070 
force especially with the new motor I
have<00:04:49.970> puts<00:04:50.970> out<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.180> lot<00:04:51.420> of<00:04:51.450> power<00:04:51.720> it's<00:04:52.020> a

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
have puts out a lot of power it's a

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.810 
have puts out a lot of power it's a
castle<00:04:52.320> 3800<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:56.000> almost<00:04:57.000> ripped<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.450> there<00:04:57.630> see

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
castle 3800 I almost ripped it there see

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.590 
castle 3800 I almost ripped it there see
you<00:04:59.820> still<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.420> want<00:05:00.570> to<00:05:00.660> get<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.320> maximum

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 
you still you want to get the maximum

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.820 
you still you want to get the maximum
amount<00:05:03.600> of<00:05:04.220> when<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.310> want<00:05:05.490> to<00:05:05.610> tighten<00:05:05.940> up

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
amount of when you want to tighten up

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.690 
amount of when you want to tighten up
most<00:05:07.830> out<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.100> these

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.750 

just<00:05:15.180> keep<00:05:15.330> on<00:05:15.510> rotating<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:16.050> death<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:19.760> you

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
just keep on rotating to death and you

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.950 
just keep on rotating to death and you
basically<00:05:21.090> want<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.360> tighten<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:21.840> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
basically want to tighten it to the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.100 
basically want to tighten it to the
point<00:05:22.260> where<00:05:22.590> it's<00:05:23.430> not<00:05:23.760> you<00:05:24.510> can't<00:05:24.840> really

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
point where it's not you can't really

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.200 
point where it's not you can't really
turn<00:05:25.320> it<00:05:25.470> much<00:05:25.650> anymore<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:28.700> that's<00:05:29.700> it

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
turn it much anymore and that's it

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
turn it much anymore and that's it
and<00:05:30.420> there<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.560> is<00:05:33.890> so<00:05:34.890> with<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.760> guys<00:05:36.230> this

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
and there it is so with that guys this

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.130 
and there it is so with that guys this
is<00:05:37.350> a<00:05:37.410> how-to<00:05:37.620> video<00:05:38.010> on<00:05:38.250> how<00:05:38.580> to<00:05:38.750> fill<00:05:39.750> up<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
is a how-to video on how to fill up the

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.000 
is a how-to video on how to fill up the
diff<00:05:40.320> with<00:05:41.160> a<00:05:41.190> little<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.670> how<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:43.010> tighten

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
diff with a little and how to tighten

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.370 
diff with a little and how to tighten
the<00:05:44.100> screws<00:05:44.460> really<00:05:45.000> hard<00:05:45.210> on<00:05:45.420> tightening<00:05:46.290> the

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
the screws really hard on tightening the

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.620 
the screws really hard on tightening the
screws<00:05:46.620> really<00:05:46.980> hard<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.580> prevent<00:05:48.030> oil<00:05:48.450> from

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
screws really hard to prevent oil from

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.970 
screws really hard to prevent oil from
leaking<00:05:49.110> because<00:05:50.390> one<00:05:51.390> time<00:05:52.550> I<00:05:54.110> really<00:05:55.110> only

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
leaking because one time I really only

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.070 
leaking because one time I really only
started<00:05:56.520> doing<00:05:56.820> this<00:05:56.970> cuz<00:05:57.270> my<00:05:57.420> Allen<00:05:57.750> wrenches

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
started doing this cuz my Allen wrenches

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.270 
started doing this cuz my Allen wrenches
were<00:05:58.530> screwed<00:05:58.890> up

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
were screwed up

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.780 
were screwed up
I<00:06:00.350> really<00:06:01.350> didn't<00:06:01.650> start<00:06:01.740> tightening<00:06:02.250> the

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
I really didn't start tightening the

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.980 
I really didn't start tightening the
bolts<00:06:03.300> down<00:06:03.480> really<00:06:03.840> hard<00:06:04.080> until<00:06:05.810> just<00:06:06.810> a

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
bolts down really hard until just a

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.170 
bolts down really hard until just a
couple<00:06:07.020> races<00:06:07.770> ago<00:06:08.040> and<00:06:08.460> when<00:06:09.360> I<00:06:09.390> did<00:06:09.660> that

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
couple races ago and when I did that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.780 
couple races ago and when I did that
right<00:06:12.180> here<00:06:12.240> on<00:06:12.510> my<00:06:12.630> truck<00:06:13.520> I'll<00:06:14.520> show<00:06:14.700> you

right here on my truck I'll show you
guys<00:06:15.320> right<00:06:16.320> about<00:06:16.970> here<00:06:17.970> where<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:19.500> spur

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
guys right about here where the spur

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.040 
guys right about here where the spur
gear<00:06:20.430> basically<00:06:21.120> sits<00:06:21.450> right<00:06:22.260> in<00:06:22.410> there<00:06:24.050> at

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
gear basically sits right in there at

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.930 
gear basically sits right in there at
the<00:06:25.260> end<00:06:25.410> of<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.590> race<00:06:25.770> there<00:06:26.250> would<00:06:26.490> be<00:06:26.520> oil

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
the end of the race there would be oil

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.050 
the end of the race there would be oil
and<00:06:27.480> clay<00:06:27.930> down<00:06:28.590> in<00:06:28.800> there<00:06:29.010> like<00:06:29.310> crazy<00:06:29.700> I<00:06:29.850> mean

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
and clay down in there like crazy I mean

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.490 
and clay down in there like crazy I mean
it<00:06:30.210> would<00:06:30.300> be<00:06:30.330> it<00:06:30.660> would<00:06:30.810> go<00:06:30.990> everywhere<00:06:31.320> and

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
it would be it would go everywhere and

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.710 
it would be it would go everywhere and
it<00:06:32.040> was<00:06:32.190> just<00:06:32.370> a<00:06:32.490> mess<00:06:32.730> to<00:06:32.910> clean<00:06:33.120> up<00:06:33.150> with<00:06:33.450> and

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
it was just a mess to clean up with and

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.630 
it was just a mess to clean up with and
if<00:06:34.080> I<00:06:34.170> hit<00:06:34.320> it<00:06:34.380> with<00:06:34.590> the<00:06:34.740> air<00:06:34.860> compressor<00:06:35.430> it

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
if I hit it with the air compressor it

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.010 
if I hit it with the air compressor it
would<00:06:35.730> just<00:06:35.880> go<00:06:36.030> everywhere<00:06:36.420> and<00:06:36.720> then<00:06:36.810> we<00:06:36.900> get

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
would just go everywhere and then we get

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.470 
would just go everywhere and then we get
on<00:06:37.200> me<00:06:37.440> get<00:06:37.770> all<00:06:37.920> over<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.310> truck<00:06:38.580> it<00:06:39.180> was<00:06:39.330> just
