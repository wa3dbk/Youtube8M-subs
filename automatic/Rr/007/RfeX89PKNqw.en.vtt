00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.120 
now what take a little deeper look into
the<00:02:15.940> programs<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.660> using<00:02:19.860> what<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:20.980> would

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the programs you using what you would

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.780 
the programs you using what you would
say<00:02:22.950> changing<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:25.170> faking<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.319> money<00:02:26.790> you

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
say changing and faking the money you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.630 
say changing and faking the money you
can<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.360> with<00:02:28.800> not<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.520> this

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
can do this with not you can do this

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.210 
can do this with not you can do this
with<00:02:30.700> pretty<00:02:31.030> much<00:02:31.090> any<00:02:31.300> program<00:02:31.870> if<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.530> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
with pretty much any program if the it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.640 
with pretty much any program if the it
activates<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.209> flash<00:02:34.450> based<00:02:34.810> game<00:02:35.170> such<00:02:35.500> as

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
activates on flash based game such as

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.150 
activates on flash based game such as
runescape<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.090> use<00:02:37.180> Java<00:02:37.709> click<00:02:38.709> on<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
runescape you can use Java click on the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.670 
runescape you can use Java click on the
guy<00:02:40.120> online<00:02:40.360> if<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.989> know<00:02:41.110> what<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.380> you

guy online if you know what that is you

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.780 
guy online if you know what that is you
can<00:02:41.800> use<00:02:41.830> Java<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.760> UM<00:02:42.970> work<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
can use Java to UM work on it and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.690 
can use Java to UM work on it and
improve<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:46.800> what<00:02:47.800> they<00:02:47.950> pretty<00:02:48.220> much<00:02:48.310> day
