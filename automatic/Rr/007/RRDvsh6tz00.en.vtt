00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.099
 hello, I'm jorge clavellina in support of 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.220
 monastery of the holy family 

00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:11.419
 Vatican Catholic Puntocom I continue with this 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.969
 project to read the whole bible and 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.720
 Now I'm going to start with the letters from 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.169
 apostle san pedro 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.310
 I think these letters are very important 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:27.579
 are only two letters in which the 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.990
 fortune san pedro first this pope of the 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.820
 Catholic church in that rite 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.430
 and confirms two things that are very 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.500
 important to declare constantly to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 the Protestants who are bad 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 will the first is that san pedro- 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 clearly states that he lives in Rome 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.140
 because he says I'm writing from 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.900
 Babylon and that was something common to call 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.820
 bring Babylon to Rome because it was the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.030
 center of the roman empire that was a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.769
 pagan empire and to some extent anti 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.230
 Christian because I was going to find the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.230
 Jews and had them dominated 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.090
 then also another thing that is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.320
 important to note in addition to that pedro 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.970
 Rome is also noted that 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.869
 since apostolic times the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.880
 apostles were fighting with heretics 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.039
 because he says there are some false brothers 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.530
 who use the scriptures and 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.289
 they pervert to their own ruin 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.119
 and makes special mention of the letters 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.229
 are Pablo the writings of san pablo 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:36.280
 that the same San Pedro first dad says 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.649
 which are difficult to difficult 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.990
 understanding then I think that these two 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.869
 things are directly directed against 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.390
 Protestantism the first that many 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.830
 deny that san pedro 'has lived in 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.230
 Roma in the second 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.210
 to call them Protestants 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.460
 perverts in the sense of the letters of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.260
 san pablo to teach the justification 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.080
 by faith alone and other heresies 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.030
 then I will start with the note 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.910
 introductory mastercard straubinger 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.190
 because it is good and very useful and very 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.950
 didactic 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.910
 letters of the apostle san pedro no other 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.190
 into introductory simón barrio na son 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.500
 from jonás what was to be san pedro 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.210
 he was called to the apostolate in the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.310
 first days of public life the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.730
 sir who gave him the name that fas 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.060
 in Aramaic that fa or stone from where 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.050
 the greek the greek petros pedro we see 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.670
 in Matthew 16 in verse 17 19 as 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.590
 Jesus distinguished him from the others 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:45.020
 disciples making him prince of the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:47.630
 apostles as it comes rinse 21-15 san 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.030
 Paul is not to know that to himself as 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.400
 apostle of the Gentiles jesus had him 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.610
 entrusted directly as they say 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.250
 Galatians 111 evangelizing these 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.780
 while to Pedro as to Santiago and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.530
 John the evangelization of the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.410
 circumcised or Israelites 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.650
 from Pentecost he preached Peter the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.860
 jerusalem and palestine but towards the year 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.640
 42 moved to another place as it says in 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.740
 chapter facts of that verse 17 not 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.490
 without first admitting baptism to 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.890
 Baptism to the pagan Cornelius 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.860
 as the day with felipe had done 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.540
 with the Ethiopian outlaw few years 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.430
 later we find it again in 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.310
 Jerusalem presiding over the council of 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.350
 apostles and then in antioquia the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.970
 writing does not give more data about it but 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.550
 tradition assures us that he died 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.100
 martyr in rome the year 67 the same day 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.290
 that san pablo 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.510
 Your first letter is considered written 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.920
 shortly before the persecution of 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:52.400
 neron is to say that the fence of the year 63 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.240
 of being from rome the one that calls Babylon 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.490
 for the corruption of his pagan environment 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.830
 Its purpose is to mainly console the 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.750
 scattered Christian Hebrews that 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.930
 living also in a pagan world 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.000
 they ran the risk of losing faith without 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.590
 However, several passages testify that its 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.050
 teaching also extends to 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.210
 converted from the gentility to the 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.500
 same recipients as but 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.170
 extending the two those who have 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.720
 reached faith is directed to the second 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.510
 letter that the apostle wrote as 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.880
 says shortly before his martyrdom where 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.570
 your date is calculated for the years of 64 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.430
 at 67 of them it is deduced as probable 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.340
 that the author wrote of roma 'maybe 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.630
 from jail 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 in Christian communities 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.010
 homeless people had already entered 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.990
 false doctors who despised 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.940
 writings abused the gray 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.250
 holding a perverse concept of the 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.800
 Christian freedom of 100 also that 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.160
 Jesus would never go back against these and 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.660
 against the many imitators that will have 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.449
 at all times to the end 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.190
 the chief of the twelve lifts his voice to 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.590
 prevent the churches present and 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.720
 future being of note that while 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:04.229
 pedro usually uses verbs in 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.270
 future judas in for its parallel it 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.490
 already refers to this problem as current and 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.979
 urgent 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.449
 in these brief letters the only two 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.759
 encyclicals of the principle of 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.250
 Apostles full of the most precious 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.199
 doctrine and prophecy we see the work 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.789
 admirable of the holy spirit that 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.150
 Peter he transformed after 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:26.490
 Pentecost that ignorant restless and 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.650
 cowardly fisherman and denier of Christ is 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.410
 here the apostle full of charity of 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.310
 softness and humble wisdom that as 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.080
 pablo in second Timoteo 46 announces 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.960
 the proximity of his own death that the 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.669
 Christ himself had predicted he san 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.259
 Pedro puts us ahead from the 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.870
 beginning of the first gun until the 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:48.120
 end of the second the mystery of the future 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.919
 return of our Lord Jesus Christ as 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.840
 the theme of meditation par excellence 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.200
 to transform our souls in faith 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.600
 love and hope 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:00.200
 the main dogmatic teaching of the 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.300
 second pedro says pirote consists 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.670
 incontestably in the certainty of 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.070
 the parousia and consequently of the 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:10.290
 temperatures that will accompany it 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.450
 depending on this wait is how it should 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.730
 understood the the alternative between the 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:17.670
 Christian virtue and the license of 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.490
 scoffers the guarantees of this faith are 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.650
 the oracles of the prophets with seeing 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.810
 preserved in the old inspired bible 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.960
 and the teaching of the apostles 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.540
 witnesses of god and messengers of Christ 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:33.090
 the gospel and real realization of 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.220
 a first cycle of the prophecies and this 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.630
 realization to grows so much more our 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.270
 confidence in compliance with 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.610
 later is what Jesus himself 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.380
 resurrected fulfilled and the prophecies of 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.570
 his passion his death and his resurrection 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.960
 reiterates about future announcements of 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.550
 your glories saying it is necessary that you 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.100
 fulfill everything that is written about 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:57.810
 from me the law of Moses the prophets and 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:07:00.120
 the psalms lucas 24 44 little could 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.890
 promise yourself of the faith of those 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.570
 Christians who calling themselves children of the 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.660
 church and proclaiming that Christ is 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:08.430
 where Pedro is resigned to spend his 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.160
 whole life without worrying about knowing that 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.680
 they said in his brief letters is the pedro 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.880
 and that Pablo to be able as the 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.010
 liturgy 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.490
 and the precept of those for whom 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.380
 the religion began 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.380
 collection of the sanchez table
