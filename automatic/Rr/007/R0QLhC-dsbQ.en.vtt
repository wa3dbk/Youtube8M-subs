00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
since been discontinued I decided to get

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
since been discontinued I decided to get
rid<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.269> felt<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.470> was<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> too<00:00:31.859> big

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
rid of it I felt that it was a too big

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.479 
rid of it I felt that it was a too big
of<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.430> box<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.780> sit<00:00:34.170> alongside<00:00:34.440> my<00:00:34.829> TV<00:00:35.219> didn't

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
of a box to sit alongside my TV didn't

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.200 
of a box to sit alongside my TV didn't
have<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> hdmi<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.960> sold<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.399> let's<00:00:39.059> check

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
have a hdmi so I sold it so let's check

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.500 
have a hdmi so I sold it so let's check
out<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> new<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:42.020> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.739> dell<00:00:44.520> zino<00:00:44.550> i

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
out the new one this is a dell zino i

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
out the new one this is a dell zino i
think<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> cameras<00:00:46.379> focused<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
think the cameras focused on it

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.090 
think the cameras focused on it
hopefully<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.360> turns<00:00:48.570> out<00:00:48.750> okay<00:00:49.079> as<00:00:50.039> a

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
hopefully that turns out okay as a

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
hopefully that turns out okay as a
discontinued<00:00:50.969> dell<00:00:51.270> product<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.079> probably

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
discontinued dell product but probably

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
discontinued dell product but probably
one<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> better<00:00:53.100> solutions<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> home

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
one of the better solutions for a home

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.560 
one of the better solutions for a home
theater<00:00:54.719> pc<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.260> got<00:00:55.440> built<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.829> hdmi<00:00:56.570> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
theater pc it's got built in hdmi and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
theater pc it's got built in hdmi and
things<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.230> nature<00:00:58.350> small<00:00:58.829> form<00:00:59.100> factor

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
things of that nature small form factor

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.990 
things of that nature small form factor
so<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.539> works<00:01:00.690> good<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.730> this<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
you want to put together one like I did

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.560 
you want to put together one like I did
from<00:01:58.469> parts<00:01:58.890> if<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.670> says<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
from parts if it says that it's got a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.929 
from parts if it says that it's got a
built-in<00:02:01.020> processor<00:02:01.740> stay<00:02:02.250> away<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.520> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
built-in processor stay away from it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.639 
built-in processor stay away from it
that<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.329> means<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.170> atom

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that just means that it's a atom

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.130 
that just means that it's a atom
processor<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.520> that's<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> want<00:02:06.780> so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
processor in that's not what you want so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
processor in that's not what you want so
so<00:02:07.920> let's<00:02:08.069> take<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> look<00:02:08.489> at<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.640> see<00:02:08.849> how<00:02:08.970> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so let's take a look at it see how it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.589 
so let's take a look at it see how it
plays<00:02:09.209> here's<00:02:09.810> my<00:02:10.379> custom<00:02:10.920> menu<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.540> lot<00:02:12.540> of

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
plays here's my custom menu a lot of

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.520 
plays here's my custom menu a lot of
different<00:02:12.629> types<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.170> game

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
different types of game

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.980 
different types of game
here<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.370> yes<00:02:14.610> they<00:02:14.819> all<00:02:14.970> work<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.480> let's

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
here and yes they all work so let's

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:29.860 
here and yes they all work so let's
check<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.350> Nintendo<00:02:17.780> maybe<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:19.050> mario<00:02:19.260> 3

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.970 

place<00:02:30.870> pretty<00:02:31.080> close<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.530> urgently<00:02:31.680> I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
place pretty close to you urgently I

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.360 
place pretty close to you urgently I
think<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:34.260> might<00:02:34.410> notice<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.920> little<00:02:35.160> bit<00:02:35.250> of

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
think you might notice a little bit of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.570 
think you might notice a little bit of
tearing<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.880> screen<00:02:36.860> but<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.130> honestly

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
tearing in the screen but that honestly

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.420 
tearing in the screen but that honestly
is<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:39.709> something<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> video<00:02:41.190> card

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
is just something with a video card

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.840 
is just something with a video card
driver<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.850> can<00:02:42.120> fix<00:02:42.360> by<00:02:43.290> enabling<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.640> mode

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
driver I can fix by enabling the mode

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.479 
driver I can fix by enabling the mode
that<00:02:45.380> gets<00:02:46.380> rid<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.620> tearing<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.070> forgot<00:02:47.370> what

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
that gets rid of tearing I forgot what

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.530 
that gets rid of tearing I forgot what
it's<00:02:47.610> called<00:02:47.640> Zen<00:02:48.570> AMD<00:02:48.959> based<00:02:49.170> video<00:02:49.350> card<00:02:49.769> so

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
it's called Zen AMD based video card so

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.580 
it's called Zen AMD based video card so
I'm<00:02:51.540> sure<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.840> could<00:02:51.930> find<00:02:52.080> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.380> check<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
I'm sure you could find if you check the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.699 
I'm sure you could find if you check the
settings<00:02:53.070> but<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.720> processor<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> put<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.620> this

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
settings but the processor I put in this

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.860 
settings but the processor I put in this
one<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.130> slower<00:02:56.670> one<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.239> if<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.540> turn<00:02:57.720> that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
one is a slower one so if you turn that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.090 
one is a slower one so if you turn that
option<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.440> actually<00:02:58.560> makes<00:02:58.830> all<00:02:59.010> the

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
option on it actually makes all the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.530 
option on it actually makes all the
games<00:02:59.250> run<00:02:59.459> slower<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:00.090> should<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.390> put<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
games run slower so I should have put a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.150 
games run slower so I should have put a
faster<00:03:00.900> processor<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.769> oh<00:03:01.950> well<00:03:02.130> I

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
faster processor in it but oh well I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.460 
faster processor in it but oh well I
didn't<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.120> still<00:03:03.300> works<00:03:03.510> fine<00:03:03.690> can't

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
didn't but it still works fine can't

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.160 
didn't but it still works fine can't
complain<00:03:06.170> that's<00:03:07.170> nintendo<00:03:07.830> super<00:03:08.130> nintendo

complain that's nintendo super nintendo
take<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.200> look<00:03:10.470> at<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:13.850> this<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.060> little

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
take a look at that and this is a little

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.180 
take a look at that and this is a little
bug<00:03:15.540> where<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> first<00:03:16.440> time<00:03:16.620> i<00:03:16.769> loaded<00:03:17.040> game

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
bug where the first time i loaded game

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.490 
bug where the first time i loaded game
is<00:03:17.340> pixelated<00:03:18.030> i<00:03:18.209> don't<00:03:18.810> know<00:03:18.870> why<00:03:19.019> but<00:03:19.260> if<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
is pixelated i don't know why but if I

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.370 
is pixelated i don't know why but if I
close<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:20.190> open<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.579> back<00:03:20.640> up<00:03:20.760> again<00:03:21.380> then

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
close it and open it back up again then

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.539 
close it and open it back up again then
you'll<00:03:22.560> notice<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.010> actually<00:03:23.280> looks<00:03:23.430> pretty

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
you'll notice it actually looks pretty

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.810 
you'll notice it actually looks pretty
decent<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.860> happens<00:03:26.250> every<00:03:26.430> time<00:03:26.670> you

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
decent and that happens every time you

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.130 
decent and that happens every time you
boot<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:28.040> not<00:03:29.040> sure<00:03:29.280> why<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.459> is<00:03:29.780> but<00:03:30.780> not<00:03:31.110> a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
boot it not sure why that is but not a

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.630 
boot it not sure why that is but not a
big<00:03:31.380> deal<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:34.140> here's<00:03:34.410> mario<00:03:34.829> world<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.519> can

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
big deal so here's mario world you can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.440 
big deal so here's mario world you can
see<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.000> works<00:03:36.660> pretty<00:03:36.900> well<00:03:38.180> how<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.239> play

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450
