00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.600 

the<00:01:57.750> letter<00:01:57.960> Sephora<00:01:58.790> actively

the letter Sephora actively
pretty<00:02:01.210> much<00:02:01.390> anywhere<00:02:01.750> else<00:02:01.960> I<00:02:02.140> suspected<00:02:02.680> -

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
pretty much anywhere else I suspected -

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.650 
pretty much anywhere else I suspected -
it's<00:02:04.930> blinding<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.890> really<00:02:06.400> is<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.730> fantastic

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.430 

this<00:02:10.200> did<00:02:10.470> beautifully<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.990> think<00:02:12.990> possibly

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
this did beautifully I think possibly

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.340 
this did beautifully I think possibly
even<00:02:13.860> better<00:02:14.160> than<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.460> steering<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.230> way

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
even better than the steering is the way

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.980 
even better than the steering is the way
it<00:02:16.440> stops<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.310> don't<00:02:17.700> just<00:02:17.970> mean<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.630> power

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
it stops but I don't just mean the power

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.500 
it stops but I don't just mean the power
of<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.410> brakes<00:02:19.670> there<00:02:20.670> are<00:02:20.790> many<00:02:20.940> cars<00:02:21.210> here

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
of the brakes there are many cars here

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.660 
of the brakes there are many cars here
that<00:02:21.570> have<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.110> hugely<00:02:22.620> powerful<00:02:22.890> brakes<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
that have a hugely powerful brakes and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.620 
that have a hugely powerful brakes and
which<00:02:23.760> actually<00:02:23.940> stopped<00:02:24.360> very<00:02:24.720> well<00:02:26.630> for

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
which actually stopped very well for

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.870 
which actually stopped very well for
this<00:02:27.810> car<00:02:28.110> also<00:02:28.410> adds<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.640> this

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
this car also adds to that is this

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.770 
this car also adds to that is this
incredible<00:02:30.810> stability<00:02:31.080> over<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.800> bumps<00:02:32.130> and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
incredible stability over the bumps and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.870 
incredible stability over the bumps and
around<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.900> canvas<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.410> there<00:02:34.680> are<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> good

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
you enter a braking area you just think

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.640 
you enter a braking area you just think
what

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
what

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
what
I'm<00:02:41.099> gonna<00:02:41.370> stop<00:02:41.640> all<00:02:42.030> right<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.540> thing

I'm gonna stop all right and the thing
you<00:02:42.750> stopped

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.729 

it's<00:02:47.790> also<00:02:47.970> quick

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.040 

so<00:02:58.739> we<00:02:59.069> have<00:02:59.190> spent<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.580> last<00:02:59.670> two<00:03:00.180> days<00:03:00.450> at
