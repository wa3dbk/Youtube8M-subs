00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 a friend of crafts the hummingbird in 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.470
 this time we are going to prepare the mass of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.630
 porcelain and chrome by request of some 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.799
 little friends so that you can 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:18.410
 make the ingredients in your home 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.410
 this preparation is a frying pan or a wok 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.300
 according to plastic for when there is 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.830
 been our our mass 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.080
 in corn starch 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:37.850
 a cup of mineral oil glue and 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:41.110
 two tablespoons of lemon juice that 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.110
 we proceed to do 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.649
 let's prepare 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.660
 our mass 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.989
 We use two tablespoons of juice 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.989
 lemon 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.890
 then we make two tablespoons of oil 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.890
 of ore 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.180
 and therefore we put the starch 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180
 of corn 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.830
 ah 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.460
 finally we add the glue to 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.460
 our mix 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.600
 we mix 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.780
 until you get a consistency 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 thick 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 we put it was on the fire 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.770
 and we mix we keep mixing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.420
 until the dough 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.420
 take a consistency 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.240
 harder 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.040
 and we stayed 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.040
 in the spoon that we have 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.910
 the mass will give us the same point 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.690
 going mixing and mixing 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.959
 until the dough 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.959
 Do not stick to the pan 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.129
 look if you see that it is already taking off from 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:10.590
 pan is already taking consistency 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.590
 our mass and it's reaching its point 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:41.290
 can see has already collected everything that 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.680
 there is in the pan our dough is in its 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.950
 point to continue to knead the 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.069
 we got a glass container 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.310
 we put so much mineral oil so that 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.840
 the dough sticks and 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.840
 we continue to knead 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.930
 or killing 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.060
 we continue kneading until it is 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:27.000
 elastic our mass 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.000
 here we have reached the point we want 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.050
 then we look 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:46.470
 a bag a crazy plastic container the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.680
 we put there for him to rest and then 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.670
 we proceed to throw it in the fridge and here 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.430
 our preparation of 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.450
 the mass of porcelain and chrono many 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.450
 thank you, I hope you liked it
