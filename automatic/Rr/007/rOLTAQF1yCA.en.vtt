00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 look carefully 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.079
 we gave assurances at sea on saturday 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.809
 the decision to train with you every day until I leave for 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.989
 to do 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.269
 the installed base 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 I would not say ok that's what said yes but me it's true 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.199
 most states 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.770
 the old regime 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.770
 you can file for bankruptcy if you want more 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.320
 this Malaysian is a thing 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.490
 I will do what I am 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.950
 many times his sunset that night 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.950
 this first couac 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.370
 the game is simple 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.040
 I lost my mind 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.080
 to launch a missile towards europe it will not surely be asked to drive 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.610
 what do you want I looked at the boat I told players to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.550
 white laurent and marcel dreyfus 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 today we will take a slippery ball 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.130
 otherwise 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.810
 you would like to sup with me tonight we cook 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.160
 maybe 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.980
 well in the first 25 months of agreement you'll know 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.429
 that's what gives a second round of the global nothing less 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.220
 several months witnessing the smoke in the boat 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.520
 from December 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.800

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 after 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.820
 I'm leaving in a week 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.640
 he was suffering from a flu 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.500
 you stay 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.610
 we are already at his second seven years leading 5-2 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 it's not surprising at all 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 the center provides food Thursday 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.759
