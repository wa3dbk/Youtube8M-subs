00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
thing about sketchbook pro is that I can

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
thing about sketchbook pro is that I can

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
sketch pretty much whenever I want and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.500 
sketch pretty much whenever I want and
it<00:00:36.780> doesn't<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> setup<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.510> traditional

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it doesn't have the setup of traditional

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.049 
it doesn't have the setup of traditional
art<00:00:39.750> materials<00:00:40.219> it<00:00:41.219> gives<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> freedom<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
art materials it gives me the freedom to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
art materials it gives me the freedom to
be<00:00:42.390> able<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:43.440> things<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.890> switch<00:00:44.280> color

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
be able to do things like switch color

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.529 
be able to do things like switch color
and<00:00:45.590> even<00:00:46.590> textures<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.579> different

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and even textures and different

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.500 
and even textures and different
materials<00:00:49.200> which<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.770> something<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
materials which is something that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.000 
materials which is something that
technically<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.629> could<00:00:52.140> do<00:00:52.320> with<00:00:52.530> assistance

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
technically I could do with assistance

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.490 
technically I could do with assistance
right<00:00:53.250> now<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.809> gets<00:00:55.020> kind<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> annoying

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
right now but it gets kind of annoying

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.729 
right now but it gets kind of annoying
and<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.039> tedious<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.140> giving<00:00:58.590> me

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and it's tedious so this is giving me

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.610 
and it's tedious so this is giving me
back<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.219> freedom<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:01:00.510> able<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.989> sketch<00:01:01.260> in

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
back the freedom to be able to sketch in
color<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.309> which<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:03.000> cool<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
about a sketchbook pro is that you you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
about a sketchbook pro is that you you
can<00:01:42.270> work<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.840> layers<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.470> what<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.830> means

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
can work in layers and what that means

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.840 
can work in layers and what that means
is<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.800> build<00:01:47.520> your

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
is you can pretty much build your

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.170 
is you can pretty much build your
picture<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.130> layer<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.400> have<00:01:50.760> just<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
picture up so this layer I have just a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.660 
picture up so this layer I have just a
sketch<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.920> addle<00:01:53.220> air<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.550> going

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
sketch and I can addle air and I'm going

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.530 
sketch and I can addle air and I'm going
to<00:01:53.700> show<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.880> how<00:01:53.910> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.330> a<00:01:54.450> little

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
to show you how to do that in a little

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.280 
to show you how to do that in a little
bit<00:01:55.910> for<00:01:56.910> let's<00:01:57.119> say<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.479> color<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.170> I

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
bit for let's say the color and then I

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.990 
bit for let's say the color and then I
can<00:01:58.410> add<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.590> separate<00:01:59.009> layer<00:01:59.130> for<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> detail

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
can add a separate layer for the detail

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
can add a separate layer for the detail
and<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.869> if<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.110> make<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> mistake<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> color

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and so if I make a mistake in the color

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.540 
and so if I make a mistake in the color
I'm<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.940> going<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.710> worry<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:05.369> know

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
I'm not going to worry about you know

jeopardizing a sketch so okay an example
here's<00:02:10.530> another<00:02:10.890> layer<00:02:11.220> okay<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.150> we've

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
here's another layer okay so now we've

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.930 
here's another layer okay so now we've
added<00:02:12.600> some<00:02:13.080> more<00:02:13.890> details<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.550> some<00:02:14.790> more

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
more color I had each layer kind of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.500 
more color I had each layer kind of
blinded<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.810> can't<00:02:25.080> see<00:02:25.320> but<00:02:25.560> um<00:02:26.510> there

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
blinded so you can't see but um there

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.780 
blinded so you can't see but um there
you<00:02:27.570> go<00:02:27.660> there's<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.380> finished<00:02:29.190> product<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
you go there's the finished product and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.080 
you go there's the finished product and
then<00:02:30.330> what's<00:02:30.690> nice<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.580> when<00:02:32.580> you're<00:02:32.700> all<00:02:32.820> done

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
then what's nice is when you're all done

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.090 
then what's nice is when you're all done
what<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.720> can<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:36.500> let<00:02:37.500> me<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.769> see<00:02:37.920> right

to your gallery and then what you can do
is<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.170> send<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.320> send<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.620> to

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
is you can send it so you send it to

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.190 
is you can send it so you send it to
yourself<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.430> put<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.019> flatten<00:02:58.019> its

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
yourself you can put it to flatten its

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.009 
yourself you can put it to flatten its
itunes<00:02:58.739> email<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.670> flattens<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.450> all<00:03:00.870> that

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
itunes email it flattens and all that

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.560 
itunes email it flattens and all that
means<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.470> condenses<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.040> layers<00:03:02.570> so

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
means is it condenses the layers so

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.170 
means is it condenses the layers so
email<00:03:04.410> flattened<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.130> what<00:03:05.790> it<00:03:05.880> will<00:03:06.000> do<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
email flattened and what it will do is

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.160 
email flattened and what it will do is
it'll<00:03:06.540> it'll<00:03:06.870> turn<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> into<00:03:07.519> like<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.549> JPEG<00:03:09.170> put

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
it'll it'll turn it into like a JPEG put

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.810 
it'll it'll turn it into like a JPEG put
it<00:03:10.260> right<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.590> your<00:03:10.620> email<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.459> can<00:03:11.489> send

screen here show you some of the
features<00:03:25.579> this<00:03:26.579> little<00:03:26.850> thought<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.120> tap<00:03:27.360> on

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
features this little thought you tap on

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.110 
features this little thought you tap on
gives<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.110> toolbar<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.799> then<00:03:28.910> you<00:03:29.910> can

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
gives you the toolbar and then you can

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.590 
gives you the toolbar and then you can
access<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.260> brushes<00:03:31.950> and

access the brushes and

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.170 
access the brushes and
there's<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.590> variety<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.280> different<00:03:34.640> not<00:03:35.150> only

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
there's a variety of different not only

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.950 
there's a variety of different not only
as<00:03:36.700> different<00:03:37.700> textures<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.360> sizes<00:03:38.750> but

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
as different textures and sizes but

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.990 
as different textures and sizes but
things<00:03:39.650> that<00:03:39.710> mimic<00:03:40.100> materials<00:03:40.580> like<00:03:40.790> let's

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
things that mimic materials like let's

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.450 
things that mimic materials like let's
say<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.750> know<00:03:41.870> here<00:03:42.290> we<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.860> pencil<00:03:45.460> ok

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
say you know here we have a pencil ok

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.910 
say you know here we have a pencil ok
and<00:03:46.670> then<00:03:46.990> that's<00:03:47.990> going<00:03:48.230> to<00:03:48.320> look<00:03:48.500> totally

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
and then that's going to look totally

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.170 
and then that's going to look totally
different<00:03:49.340> from<00:03:50.120> let's<00:03:50.420> say<00:03:51.610> here<00:03:52.610> we<00:03:52.700> go<00:03:52.820> have

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
different from let's say here we go have

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.580 
different from let's say here we go have
this<00:03:53.390> splatter<00:03:54.170> effect<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.960> really<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.380> sky

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
this splatter effect so really the sky

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.970 
this splatter effect so really the sky
is<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.860> limit<00:03:58.010> in<00:03:58.400> terms<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.790> creativity<00:03:59.980> you

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
is the limit in terms of creativity you

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.870 
is the limit in terms of creativity you
can<00:04:01.220> customize<00:04:01.910> colors<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:03.640> exactly<00:04:04.640> how<00:04:04.820> you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
can customize colors to exactly how you

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.420 
can customize colors to exactly how you
like<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:07.610> can<00:04:07.940> change<00:04:08.630> how<00:04:09.590> opaque<00:04:10.040> or<00:04:10.280> how

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
like you can change how opaque or how

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.000 
like you can change how opaque or how
transparent<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:13.790> ink<00:04:13.970> or<00:04:14.180> paint<00:04:14.390> is<00:04:15.010> and

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
transparent the the ink or paint is and

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.200 
transparent the the ink or paint is and
also<00:04:16.430> it<00:04:16.760> simulates<00:04:17.470> different<00:04:18.470> materials

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
also it simulates different materials

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.670 
also it simulates different materials
which<00:04:20.210> is<00:04:20.390> really<00:04:20.570> cool<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.260> even<00:04:21.410> has<00:04:21.530> a

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
which is really cool and it even has a

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.200 
which is really cool and it even has a
couple<00:04:22.340> of<00:04:22.600> built-in<00:04:24.160> textures<00:04:25.160> which<00:04:26.060> are

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
couple of built-in textures which are

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.090 
couple of built-in textures which are
cool<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.510> kind<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.750> play<00:04:26.900> around<00:04:26.960> with<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:30.100> I

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
cool to kind of play around with and I

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.870 
cool to kind of play around with and I
love<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:31.910> it's<00:04:32.650> it's<00:04:33.650> great<00:04:33.980> because<00:04:34.340> it's<00:04:34.760> so
