00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
tutorial on this so let's get started

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.270 
tutorial on this so let's get started
we're<00:00:33.080> going<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.230> start<00:00:33.320> by<00:00:33.559> creating<00:00:33.980> a<00:00:34.160> new

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
we're going to start by creating a new

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.820 
we're going to start by creating a new
document<00:00:34.460> in<00:00:34.910> photoshop<00:00:35.420> i'm<00:00:35.870> using<00:00:36.290> 300<00:00:36.769> by

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
document in photoshop i'm using 300 by

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.100 
document in photoshop i'm using 300 by
300<00:00:37.100> pixels<00:00:37.699> depending<00:00:38.510> on<00:00:38.510> how<00:00:38.720> big<00:00:38.900> you<00:00:38.989> want

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
300 pixels depending on how big you want

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.799 
300 pixels depending on how big you want
your<00:00:39.199> brush<00:00:39.470> just<00:00:40.460> set<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:40.879> accordingly<00:00:41.420> so

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
your brush just set that accordingly so

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.090 
your brush just set that accordingly so
me<00:00:41.960> click<00:00:42.140> OK<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.650> then<00:00:44.290> in<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:46.040> situation

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
me click OK and then in this situation

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.030 
me click OK and then in this situation
let's<00:00:46.850> say<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.120> we<00:00:47.210> wanted<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.540> create<00:00:48.049> a<00:00:48.710> lot

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
let's say that we wanted to create a lot

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.500 
let's say that we wanted to create a lot
of<00:00:49.100> dots<00:00:49.430> like<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:49.879> will<00:00:50.030> had<00:00:50.119> a<00:00:50.150> polka<00:00:50.390> dot

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
of dots like we will had a polka dot

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.960 
of dots like we will had a polka dot
background<00:00:50.780> or<00:00:51.260> something<00:00:51.559> like<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.850> we

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
background or something like that and we

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.609 
background or something like that and we
wanted<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.239> make<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.449> lot<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.750> dots<00:00:54.019> very

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
wanted to make a lot of dots very

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.049 
wanted to make a lot of dots very
quickly<00:00:54.890> instead<00:00:55.250> of<00:00:55.369> making<00:00:55.640> them<00:00:55.729> all<00:00:55.940> at

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
quickly instead of making them all at

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.119 
quickly instead of making them all at
once<00:00:56.089> so<00:00:56.839> that'd<00:00:57.019> be<00:00:57.199> a<00:00:57.409> perfect<00:00:57.710> situation

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
once so that'd be a perfect situation

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.119 
once so that'd be a perfect situation
for<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.729> brush<00:00:59.619> so<00:01:00.619> I'm<00:01:00.710> just<00:01:00.799> going<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.010> grab

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
for a brush so I'm just going to grab

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.340 
for a brush so I'm just going to grab
the<00:01:01.339> ellipse<00:01:01.549> tool<00:01:01.659> hold<00:01:02.659> shift<00:01:02.720> and<00:01:03.229> then

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
the ellipse tool hold shift and then

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.109 
the ellipse tool hold shift and then
just<00:01:03.559> make<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:03.799> bunch<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.309> different<00:01:04.610> dots<00:01:04.790> and

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
just make a bunch of different dots and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.960 
just make a bunch of different dots and
then<00:01:05.780> once<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.200> have<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.470> brush<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.979> a<00:01:07.010> made

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
then once you have the brush is a made

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.570 
then once you have the brush is a made
you<00:01:08.150> can<00:01:08.330> actually<00:01:08.720> add<00:01:09.290> different<00:01:09.680> styles<00:01:10.370> to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
you can actually add different styles to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.040 
you can actually add different styles to
it<00:01:10.700> once<00:01:11.240> they're<00:01:11.450> actually<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:11.870> your

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
it once they're actually in your

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.100 
it once they're actually in your
document<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:14.510> we're<00:01:14.660> just<00:01:14.690> going<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.960> do<00:01:15.080> a

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
document so we're just going to do a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.320 
document so we're just going to do a
basic<00:01:15.290> thing<00:01:15.710> right<00:01:15.920> now<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.940> let's<00:01:17.180> say<00:01:17.300> that

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
basic thing right now so let's say that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.850 
basic thing right now so let's say that
we're<00:01:17.750> happy<00:01:18.050> with<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.500> we<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:18.710> our

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
we're happy with this and we have our

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860 
we're happy with this and we have our
dots<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:19.370> we<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:19.640> want<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.360> use<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.600> as<00:01:20.780> our

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
dots and we just want to use this as our

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.850 
dots and we just want to use this as our
brush<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:22.640> now<00:01:23.060> we<00:01:23.450> take<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.900> rasterize<00:01:24.740> the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
brush so now we take and rasterize the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.700 
brush so now we take and rasterize the
layer<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:25.670> that<00:01:25.900> we<00:01:26.900> can<00:01:27.050> make<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:27.260> a<00:01:27.320> new<00:01:27.440> brush

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
layer so that we can make it a new brush

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.040 
layer so that we can make it a new brush
so<00:01:28.220> right-click<00:01:28.430> rasterize<00:01:29.120> layer<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.510> then

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
so right-click rasterize layer and then

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.690 
so right-click rasterize layer and then
we're<00:01:30.230> going<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.500> go<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.800> edit<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.670> then

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
we're going to go to edit and then

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.140 
we're going to go to edit and then
define<00:01:32.510> brush<00:01:32.810> preset<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.610> now<00:01:34.790> you<00:01:34.850> can<00:01:35.030> see

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
define brush preset so now you can see

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.090 
define brush preset so now you can see
it<00:01:35.270> shows<00:01:35.480> a<00:01:35.510> little<00:01:35.720> brush<00:01:35.990> icon<00:01:36.260> almost<00:01:36.890> like

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
it shows a little brush icon almost like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.149 
it shows a little brush icon almost like
how<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.340> have<00:01:37.550> any<00:01:37.730> brushes<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.210> palette

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
how you have any brushes a palette

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.710 
how you have any brushes a palette
because<00:01:40.159> that's<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:40.700> we're<00:01:40.909> creating<00:01:41.210> so

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
because that's what we're creating so

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.360 
because that's what we're creating so
then<00:01:42.290> we're<00:01:42.380> just<00:01:42.409> going<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.710> title<00:01:43.070> is<00:01:43.190> just

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
then we're just going to title is just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.170 
then we're just going to title is just

call it dots and we'll click ok so now
the<00:01:48.170> brush<00:01:48.409> should<00:01:48.830> be<00:01:48.979> created<00:01:49.520> let's<00:01:50.330> click

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
the brush should be created let's click

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.530 
the brush should be created let's click
let's<00:01:51.110> close<00:01:51.409> this<00:01:51.620> and<00:01:51.970> we'll<00:01:52.970> just<00:01:53.060> create<00:01:53.450> a

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
let's close this and we'll just create a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.149 
let's close this and we'll just create a
new<00:01:53.780> document<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.409> let's<00:01:54.530> make<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:54.860> let's

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
new document and let's make it let's

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.820 
new document and let's make it let's
make<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.340> a<00:01:55.460> lot<00:01:55.790> bigger<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.330> get<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.350> thousand<00:01:57.770> by

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
make it a lot bigger I get a thousand by

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.850 
make it a lot bigger I get a thousand by
thousand<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:59.510> then<00:02:00.290> we're<00:02:00.409> going<00:02:00.500> to<00:02:00.560> grab

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
thousand and then we're going to grab

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.880 
thousand and then we're going to grab
our<00:02:01.159> brush<00:02:01.750> tool<00:02:02.750> and<00:02:02.780> then<00:02:03.470> we<00:02:03.680> should<00:02:03.860> be

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
our brush tool and then we should be

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.469 
our brush tool and then we should be
able<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.220> scroll<00:02:04.460> down<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.120> can<00:02:05.270> see

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
able to scroll down and you can see

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:06.730 
able to scroll down and you can see
right<00:02:05.510> here<00:02:05.900> at<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> bottom<00:02:06.260> this<00:02:06.500> is<00:02:06.650> the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
right here at the bottom this is the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.699 
right here at the bottom this is the
brush<00:02:06.920> we<00:02:07.100> just<00:02:07.370> created<00:02:07.760> and<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:09.349> can<00:02:09.500> see

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
brush we just created and you can see

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.670 
brush we just created and you can see
that<00:02:09.739> we<00:02:09.979> can<00:02:10.159> create<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:11.409> if<00:02:12.409> you<00:02:12.500> put

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
that we can create this and if you put

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.720 
that we can create this and if you put
these<00:02:12.769> on<00:02:12.950> different<00:02:13.190> layers<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.580> could

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
these on different layers you could

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.490 
these on different layers you could
rotate<00:02:13.970> them<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.450> can<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.750> whatever<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.319> want

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
rotate them you can do whatever you want

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.440 
rotate them you can do whatever you want
basically<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.220> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.630 

depending<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.989> i'm<00:02:19.620> using<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> bracket<00:02:20.459> keys

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
depending on i'm using the bracket keys

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.119 
depending on i'm using the bracket keys
right<00:02:20.819> now<00:02:20.970> right<00:02:21.239> above<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.720> enter<00:02:21.989> key<00:02:22.129> and

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
right now right above the enter key and

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.610 
right now right above the enter key and
i'm<00:02:23.580> making<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:24.030> bigger<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.390> smaller<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:25.080> you

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
i'm making a bigger and smaller so you

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.290 
i'm making a bigger and smaller so you
can<00:02:25.800> change<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.280> different<00:02:26.550> size<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.120> your

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
can change the different size of your

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.119 
can change the different size of your
brush<00:02:28.160> based<00:02:29.160> on<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:30.360> see<00:02:30.569> the

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
brush based on that so you can see the

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.320 
brush based on that so you can see the
possibilities<00:02:32.129> with<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.459> basically<00:02:32.940> saving

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
possibilities with this basically saving

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.720 
possibilities with this basically saving
you<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.569> ton<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.840> time<00:02:34.130> just<00:02:35.130> by<00:02:35.250> creating<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you a ton of time just by creating a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.930 
you a ton of time just by creating a
brush<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.130> things<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.370> wasn't<00:02:38.760> in

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
brush one of the things that wasn't in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
brush one of the things that wasn't in
the<00:02:38.970> request<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.050> kind<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.319> wanted<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
the request that I kind of wanted to

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.710 
the request that I kind of wanted to
show<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.800> guys<00:02:40.920> was<00:02:41.400> also<00:02:41.940> how<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.209> create<00:02:42.660> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
show you guys was also how to create a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.940 
show you guys was also how to create a
pattern<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.260> I'm<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.709> close<00:02:43.890> this

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
pattern so I'm just going to close this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
pattern so I'm just going to close this
up<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.489> we're<00:02:45.209> going<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.390> go<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.569> file<00:02:45.930> new<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
up and we're going to go to file new and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
up and we're going to go to file new and
eat<00:02:47.970> i'm<00:02:48.599> going<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.959> make<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.200> eight<00:02:49.379> pixels<00:02:49.769> by

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
eat i'm going to make it eight pixels by

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.550 
eat i'm going to make it eight pixels by
eight<00:02:50.129> pixels<00:02:50.690> patterns<00:02:51.690> generally<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:52.440> want

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
eight pixels patterns generally you want

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160 
eight pixels patterns generally you want
very<00:02:52.860> small<00:02:53.400> i'm<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.360> get<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.989> pencil

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
very small i'm going to get the pencil

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.490 
very small i'm going to get the pencil
tool<00:02:55.440> out<00:02:55.849> now<00:02:56.849> just<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.390> zoom<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.319> guys

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
tool out now just to zoom in so you guys

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.960 
tool out now just to zoom in so you guys
can<00:02:58.650> see<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.980> again<00:02:59.190> because<00:02:59.370> i<00:02:59.730> can't

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
can see this again because i can't

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.839 
can see this again because i can't
really<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.390> without<00:03:00.569> zooming<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.849> what

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
really do it without zooming in what

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.300 
really do it without zooming in what
we're<00:03:02.970> going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.150> do<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:04.590> make<00:03:04.709> this<00:03:04.860> pattern

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
we're going to do to make this pattern

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.420 
we're going to do to make this pattern
is<00:03:05.870> we're<00:03:06.870> going<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.049> grab<00:03:07.560> like<00:03:07.799> just<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.130> black

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
is we're going to grab like just a black

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.690 
is we're going to grab like just a black
and<00:03:08.760> then<00:03:09.329> we're<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.459> just<00:03:11.459> start

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
and then we're going to just start

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.370 
and then we're going to just start
making<00:03:11.849> a<00:03:12.060> pattern<00:03:12.390> like<00:03:12.569> let's<00:03:13.049> just<00:03:13.110> make<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
making a pattern like let's just make it

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.680 
making a pattern like let's just make it
like<00:03:14.299> five<00:03:15.299> down<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:18.090> kind<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.360> let's<00:03:18.540> make<00:03:18.660> a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
like five down just kind of let's make a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.530 
like five down just kind of let's make a
striped<00:03:19.110> pattern<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.910> it's<00:03:20.910> not<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
striped pattern and it's not going to

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.979 
striped pattern and it's not going to
look<00:03:21.660> great<00:03:21.959> right<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:22.769> but<00:03:23.010> once<00:03:23.519> we<00:03:24.859> start

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
look great right here but once we start

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.050 
look great right here but once we start
getting<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.200> together<00:03:28.410> you'll<00:03:28.889> see<00:03:29.190> you'll

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
getting this together you'll see you'll

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.190 
getting this together you'll see you'll
see<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.299> come<00:03:30.480> together<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:32.690> from<00:03:33.690> a<00:03:33.780> distance

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
see it come together so from a distance

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.080 
see it come together so from a distance
will<00:03:34.440> look<00:03:34.620> much<00:03:34.950> more<00:03:35.190> like<00:03:35.250> stripes<00:03:35.760> than<00:03:36.000> it

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
will look much more like stripes than it

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.599 
will look much more like stripes than it
doesn't<00:03:36.450> close<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.530> i<00:03:37.859> just<00:03:38.069> made<00:03:38.250> kind<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
doesn't close so i just made kind of a

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.160 
doesn't close so i just made kind of a
general<00:03:38.760> pattern<00:03:39.150> here<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.840> can<00:03:39.959> see

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
general pattern here and you can see

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.470 
general pattern here and you can see
like<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.590> stripes<00:03:40.859> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.489> middle<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.970> my

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
like the stripes in the middle and my

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.259 
like the stripes in the middle and my
corner<00:03:42.810> here<00:03:43.639> so<00:03:44.639> now<00:03:44.850> what<00:03:44.970> we're<00:03:45.090> going<00:03:45.180> to

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
corner here so now what we're going to

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.360 
corner here so now what we're going to
do<00:03:45.450> i<00:03:45.480> can<00:03:46.200> kind<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.620> zoom<00:03:46.829> out<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.980> little<00:03:47.100> bit

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
do i can kind of zoom out a little bit

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.110 
do i can kind of zoom out a little bit
so<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.970> guys<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.329> see<00:03:48.560> let's<00:03:49.560> do<00:03:49.739> like

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
so that you guys can see let's do like

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.970 
so that you guys can see let's do like
just<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.239> thousand<00:03:51.660> percent<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.440> guys<00:03:52.620> gotta

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
just a thousand percent you guys gotta

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.500 
just a thousand percent you guys gotta
see<00:03:53.100> how<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:53.639> starting<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:54.060> look<00:03:54.239> like

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
see how it's starting to look like

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.440 
see how it's starting to look like
stripes<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:56.519> reason<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.850> want<00:03:57.030> patterns

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
stripes the reason you want patterns

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.809 
stripes the reason you want patterns
smaller<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.170> they<00:03:58.530> look<00:03:59.160> more<00:03:59.340> seamless

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
smaller so that they look more seamless

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.970 
smaller so that they look more seamless
once<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.180> actually<00:04:00.359> create<00:04:00.690> them<00:04:01.019> so<00:04:01.889> i'm

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
once you actually create them so i'm

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.759 
once you actually create them so i'm
just<00:04:02.010> going<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:02.250> go<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.430> edit<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:03.930> define

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
just going to go to edit and then define

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.849 
just going to go to edit and then define
pattern<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.370> we'll<00:04:05.849> call<00:04:06.030> this<00:04:07.519> stripe<00:04:08.519> or<00:04:08.849> IP

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
pattern and we'll call this stripe or IP

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.449 
pattern and we'll call this stripe or IP
alright<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.040> we're<00:04:11.130> going<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.310> call<00:04:11.430> that

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
alright so we're going to call that

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.580 
alright so we're going to call that
stripe<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.630> we're<00:04:12.720> going<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:12.900> click<00:04:12.959> OK<00:04:13.410> and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
stripe so we're going to click OK and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.509 
stripe so we're going to click OK and
now<00:04:13.819> spend<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:15.000> set<00:04:15.209> as<00:04:15.389> a<00:04:15.569> stripe<00:04:16.019> so<00:04:16.500> i<00:04:16.739> can

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
now spend it set as a stripe so i can

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.849 
now spend it set as a stripe so i can
close<00:04:17.729> this<00:04:17.910> now<00:04:18.320> let's<00:04:19.320> just<00:04:19.500> make<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.680> new

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
close this now let's just make a new

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.090 
close this now let's just make a new
document

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
document

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.600 
document
let's<00:04:21.760> make<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:21.940> like<00:04:22.060> 500<00:04:22.780> x<00:04:22.870> 500<00:04:23.370> it's<00:04:24.370> very

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
let's make it like 500 x 500 it's very

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.340 
let's make it like 500 x 500 it's very
good<00:04:24.700> size<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:26.040> we'll<00:04:27.040> click<00:04:27.280> OK<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:28.350> now

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
good size and we'll click OK and now

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.850 
good size and we'll click OK and now
what<00:04:29.740> we're<00:04:29.860> going<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:30.040> do<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:31.710> don't<00:04:32.710> know

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
what we're going to do is I don't know

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.280 
what we're going to do is I don't know
let's<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.100> make<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.340> rectangle<00:04:34.830> let's<00:04:35.830> get<00:04:36.130> a

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
let's just make a rectangle let's get a

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.460 
let's just make a rectangle let's get a
gray<00:04:38.290> color<00:04:38.560> put<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> lighter<00:04:39.640> gray<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.810> we'll

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
gray color put a lighter gray and we'll

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.720 
gray color put a lighter gray and we'll
just<00:04:41.560> make<00:04:41.830> a<00:04:42.070> rectangle<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.380> now<00:04:44.430> let's<00:04:45.430> add

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
just make a rectangle and now let's add

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.330 
just make a rectangle and now let's add
our<00:04:45.760> pattern<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.480> we<00:04:46.660> can<00:04:46.840> go<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.100> cut<00:04:48.100> off

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
our pattern to that we can go to cut off

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.860 
our pattern to that we can go to cut off
the<00:04:48.370> screen<00:04:48.880> right<00:04:49.090> now<00:04:49.120> but<00:04:49.420> I'm<00:04:49.510> going<00:04:49.750> to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
the screen right now but I'm going to

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.230 
the screen right now but I'm going to
pattern<00:04:50.230> overlay<00:04:50.880> just<00:04:51.880> going<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.060> pull<00:04:52.180> up

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
pattern overlay just going to pull up

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.760 
pattern overlay just going to pull up
this<00:04:52.330> box<00:04:52.570> and<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.840> see<00:04:52.990> a<00:04:53.020> kind<00:04:53.290> of<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.410> default

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
this box and you see a kind of a default

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.250 
this box and you see a kind of a default
like<00:04:54.160> bubble<00:04:54.640> almost<00:04:54.970> pattern<00:04:55.240> there<00:04:55.450> and<00:04:55.630> if

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
like bubble almost pattern there and if

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.960 
like bubble almost pattern there and if
you<00:04:56.380> drag<00:04:56.890> this<00:04:57.070> error<00:04:57.340> if<00:04:57.430> you<00:04:57.490> click<00:04:57.760> on<00:04:57.850> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
you drag this error if you click on the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.700 
you drag this error if you click on the
little<00:04:58.090> pulldown<00:04:58.780> menu<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.110> can<00:04:59.170> see<00:04:59.440> your

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
little pulldown menu you can see your

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.440 
little pulldown menu you can see your
pattern<00:05:00.010> that<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.190> created<00:05:00.520> right<00:05:00.700> here<00:05:00.760> and

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
pattern that you created right here and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.270 
pattern that you created right here and
you<00:05:01.960> can<00:05:02.080> see<00:05:02.290> that<00:05:02.470> we<00:05:02.590> have<00:05:02.620> added<00:05:03.160> the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
you can see that we have added the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.900 
you can see that we have added the
stripes<00:05:03.670> to<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:04.290> so<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.380> can<00:05:05.470> see<00:05:05.800> how<00:05:05.910> you

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
stripes to this so you can see how you

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.000 
stripes to this so you can see how you
can<00:05:07.330> easily<00:05:07.840> make<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.050> background<00:05:08.620> like<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:08.920> we

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
can easily make a background like if we

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.680 
can easily make a background like if we
wanted<00:05:09.130> to<00:05:09.280> take<00:05:09.460> just<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.910> whole<00:05:10.120> shape<00:05:10.450> and

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
wanted to take just this whole shape and

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.990 
wanted to take just this whole shape and
kind<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.410> lower<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.860> opacity<00:05:11.980> on<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.790> or

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
kind of lower the opacity on that or

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.180 
kind of lower the opacity on that or
something<00:05:13.930> in<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.290> background<00:05:14.500> it<00:05:14.980> could

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
something in the background it could

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.370 
something in the background it could
make<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.400> really<00:05:15.760> neat<00:05:16.330> effect<00:05:16.690> just<00:05:16.870> kind<00:05:17.230> of<00:05:17.260> a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
make a really neat effect just kind of a

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.170 
make a really neat effect just kind of a
subtle<00:05:17.710> thing<00:05:17.820> that<00:05:18.820> just<00:05:18.940> add<00:05:19.150> some

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
subtle thing that just add some

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.670 
subtle thing that just add some
dimension<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:20.050> your<00:05:21.060> your<00:05:22.060> document<00:05:22.630> so<00:05:23.350> now

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
dimension to your your document so now

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.320 
dimension to your your document so now
what<00:05:24.280> I<00:05:24.310> wanted<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.580> show<00:05:24.670> you<00:05:24.790> was<00:05:24.940> actually

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
what I wanted to show you was actually

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.900 
what I wanted to show you was actually
how<00:05:25.690> you<00:05:25.750> can<00:05:26.080> save<00:05:26.380> these<00:05:26.620> out<00:05:26.920> to<00:05:27.280> upload<00:05:27.880> to

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
how you can save these out to upload to

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.100 
how you can save these out to upload to
somewhere<00:05:28.360> else<00:05:28.420> or<00:05:28.750> if<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:28.930> want<00:05:29.080> to

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
somewhere else or if you want to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.530 
somewhere else or if you want to
