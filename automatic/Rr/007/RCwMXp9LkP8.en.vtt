I just cleaned it out and it's not sore
now<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.880> mean<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.570> felt<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.439> bit

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
now I mean it felt like a little bit

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
now I mean it felt like a little bit
sore<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:22.920> that's<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:24.060> part<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> healing

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
sore but that's just part of the healing

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.189 
sore but that's just part of the healing
process<00:00:25.130> it's<00:00:26.130> still<00:00:26.519> pretty<00:00:27.119> swollen<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
process it's still pretty swollen the

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.890 
process it's still pretty swollen the
swelling<00:00:28.680> hasn't<00:00:28.920> really<00:00:29.310> gone<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.390> don't

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
swelling hasn't really gone down I don't

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.250 
swelling hasn't really gone down I don't
think<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.529> what<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.769> looks<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
think this is what it looks like so I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.569 
think this is what it looks like so I
don't<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> swelling<00:00:38.040> has<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.460> gone

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
don't think the swelling has really gone

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.869 
don't think the swelling has really gone
down<00:00:38.850> though<00:00:39.140> um<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.410> does<00:00:40.590> feel<00:00:41.100> easier<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
down though um it does feel easier to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.670 
down though um it does feel easier to
talk<00:00:42.180> though<00:00:42.540> but<00:00:43.020> maybe<00:00:43.230> that's<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.500> me

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.899 
sea salt and the mouthwash water mix um
just<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> change<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.149> up<00:02:03.240> uh<00:02:04.490> yeah<00:02:05.490> that's

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
just to change it up uh yeah that's

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.370 
just to change it up uh yeah that's
pretty<00:02:06.420> much<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.840> start

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
pretty much it I start

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.820 
pretty much it I start
getting<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.950> white<00:02:08.720> ring<00:02:09.720> around<00:02:09.830> my

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
getting this like white ring around my

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.339 
getting this like white ring around my
um<00:02:11.630> piercing<00:02:12.630> which<00:02:12.810> i<00:02:12.900> think<00:02:12.959> is<00:02:13.200> pretty

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
um piercing which i think is pretty

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.470 
um piercing which i think is pretty
normal<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:14.220> think<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.060> part<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
normal I think it's just part of the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.339 
normal I think it's just part of the
healing<00:02:15.720> process

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.660 
healing process
I<00:02:16.500> watched<00:02:16.709> my<00:02:16.980> other<00:02:17.040> videos<00:02:17.130> where<00:02:17.550> other

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
I watched my other videos where other

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.570 
I watched my other videos where other
people<00:02:17.970> got<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> little<00:02:18.540> white<00:02:18.660> ring<00:02:18.900> -<00:02:19.170> I

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
people got the little white ring - I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.370 
people got the little white ring - I
think<00:02:20.580> I'm<00:02:21.209> not<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.510> quite<00:02:21.750> sure<00:02:21.810> exactly

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
think I'm not really quite sure exactly

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.900 
think I'm not really quite sure exactly
what<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.830> is<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.760> like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
what it is but I think it's just like

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.670 
what it is but I think it's just like
the<00:02:24.090> bacteria<00:02:24.660> or<00:02:24.959> something<00:02:24.989> or<00:02:25.440> like<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the bacteria or something or like the

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.400 
the bacteria or something or like the
pus<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.420> spurred<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.660> healing<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
pus that spurred the healing and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.400 
pus that spurred the healing and
