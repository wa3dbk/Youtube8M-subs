00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
what's up guys this is lazy monkey and

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.869 
what's up guys this is lazy monkey and
today<00:00:02.639> I'm<00:00:03.149> reviewing<00:00:03.480> the<00:00:03.840> YJ<00:00:04.770> access<00:00:05.549> cube

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
today I'm reviewing the YJ access cube

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.760 
today I'm reviewing the YJ access cube
so<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.509> cube<00:00:06.779> can<00:00:06.960> be<00:00:07.049> called<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.319> access

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
so this cube can be called the access

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.360 
so this cube can be called the access
cube<00:00:08.040> or<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.400> axial<00:00:08.849> cube<00:00:09.290> it<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.320> made<00:00:10.679> by<00:00:10.710> YJ

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
cube or the axial cube it is made by YJ

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.160 
cube or the axial cube it is made by YJ
and<00:00:12.440> yeah<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:14.450> pretty<00:00:15.450> cheap<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:16.020> only

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and yeah it's a pretty cheap it's only

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.029 
and yeah it's a pretty cheap it's only
like<00:00:16.590> nine<00:00:17.010> dollars<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:18.560> I've<00:00:19.560> had<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.920> for

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
like nine dollars so I've had it for

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.260 
like nine dollars so I've had it for
quite<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.279> while

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
quite a while

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.120 
quite a while
the<00:00:21.779> stickers<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.769> good<00:00:22.920> quality

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the stickers are really good quality

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.339 
the stickers are really good quality
I've<00:00:23.550> solved<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.420> around<00:00:24.750> ten<00:00:25.109> times<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
I've solved this around ten times and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.890 
I've solved this around ten times and
yeah<00:00:28.349> nothing's<00:00:28.949> happened<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.900> stickers

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
yeah nothing's happened to this stickers

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
yeah nothing's happened to this stickers
they're<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.759> textured<00:00:32.759> tile<00:00:33.210> stickers<00:00:33.920> so

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
they're like textured tile stickers so

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
they're like textured tile stickers so
they<00:00:35.329> they<00:00:36.329> last<00:00:36.630> pretty<00:00:37.020> long<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:39.120> yeah<00:00:40.110> I've

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
they they last pretty long so yeah I've

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
they they last pretty long so yeah I've
had<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:40.980> five<00:00:41.219> months<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> it

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
had this for like five months and it

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.170 
had this for like five months and it
still<00:00:42.690> hasn't<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.170> chipped<00:00:43.530> at<00:00:43.680> all<00:00:45.739> so

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
still hasn't really chipped at all so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
still hasn't really chipped at all so
now<00:00:48.180> let's<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.539> into<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.930> turning<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.440> this

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
now let's get into the turning of this

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
now let's get into the turning of this
puzzle<00:00:50.090> turning<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> extremely<00:00:52.110> smooth<00:00:53.510> it's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
puzzle turning is extremely smooth it's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.119 
puzzle turning is extremely smooth it's
a<00:00:54.660> nice<00:00:54.899> smooth<00:00:55.410> puzzle

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
a nice smooth puzzle

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.840 
a nice smooth puzzle
there's<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:56.670> caching<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> course

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
there's no caching and that's of course

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
there's no caching and that's of course
the<00:01:00.210> layers<00:01:00.510> are<00:01:00.840> misaligned<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the layers are misaligned then it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.050 
the layers are misaligned then it
catches<00:01:02.359> but<00:01:03.359> um<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.760> pieces<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:06.030> extremely

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
catches but um the pieces are extremely

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
catches but um the pieces are extremely
pieces<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.180> extremely<00:01:09.270> nice<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.110> smooth<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
pieces are extremely nice and smooth and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
pieces are extremely nice and smooth and
that<00:01:11.490> allows<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.150> extremely<00:01:12.479> smooth

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that allows for extremely smooth

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:22.190 
that allows for extremely smooth
rotation<00:01:14.000> when<00:01:15.000> solving<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> yeah<00:01:21.049> if<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
rotation when solving so yeah if you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.429 
rotation when solving so yeah if you
didn't<00:01:22.439> already<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.960> 3x3<00:01:24.960> mod

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
didn't already know this is a 3x3 mod

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.480 
didn't already know this is a 3x3 mod
shape<00:01:26.130> mod<00:01:27.110> you<00:01:28.110> didn't<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.770> already<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
shape mod you didn't see it already this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.370 
shape mod you didn't see it already this
is<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.729> center<00:01:30.329> piece<00:01:30.509> these<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> four

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
is the center piece these are the four

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
is the center piece these are the four
edges<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.070> then<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> corner<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.540> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
edges and then this is a corner that's a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.179 
edges and then this is a corner that's a
corner<00:01:34.110> that's<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> corner<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
corner that's the corner and that's the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
corner that's the corner and that's the
corners<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.659> basically<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.259> solve

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
corners so you can basically just solve

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.550 
corners so you can basically just solve
it<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.280> 3x3<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.960> there<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.259> some

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it like a 3x3 but there are some

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.190 
it like a 3x3 but there are some
parodies<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.939> go<00:01:42.090> through<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
parodies that you have to go through I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.469 
parodies that you have to go through I
did<00:01:43.979> figure<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.310> how<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.579> solve<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.270> my

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
did figure out how to solve this on my

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.270 
did figure out how to solve this on my
own<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.110> that's<00:01:46.500> pretty<00:01:46.770> cool

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
own so that's pretty cool

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.139 
own so that's pretty cool
and<00:01:48.140> yeah<00:01:49.140> I've<00:01:49.229> solved<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.770> many<00:01:50.189> times<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.909> can

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and yeah I've solved it many times I can

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.149 
and yeah I've solved it many times I can
solve<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.020> five<00:01:52.320> minutes<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> yeah<00:01:55.159> I'll

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
solve it in my five minutes so yeah I'll

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.760 
solve it in my five minutes so yeah I'll
just<00:01:56.219> scramble<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.060> up<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.659> show<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> guys

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
just scramble it up to show you guys

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:20.420 
just scramble it up to show you guys
what<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.159> looks<00:01:59.310> like

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.089 

so<00:02:21.430> here<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.879> is<00:02:22.090> scrambled<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.920> not<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
so here it is scrambled up it's not the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.080 
so here it is scrambled up it's not the
best<00:02:24.459> scramble<00:02:25.030> but<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.360> good<00:02:25.659> enough

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
best scramble but it's good enough

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.940 
best scramble but it's good enough
also<00:02:28.090> one<00:02:28.599> bad<00:02:28.900> thing<00:02:28.930> about<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.709> puzzle

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
also one bad thing about this puzzle

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.190 
also one bad thing about this puzzle
which<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.670> probably<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.150> only<00:02:31.330> bad<00:02:31.629> thing<00:02:31.660> is

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
which is probably the only bad thing is

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.520 
which is probably the only bad thing is
that<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.250> pieces<00:02:33.549> are<00:02:33.730> very<00:02:34.060> sharp<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.810> you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
that the pieces are very sharp as you

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.080 
that the pieces are very sharp as you
can<00:02:35.680> see<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.470> pieces<00:02:38.709> are<00:02:39.040> extremely<00:02:39.819> sharp

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
can see the pieces are extremely sharp

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.009 
can see the pieces are extremely sharp
and<00:02:40.680> they<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.890> poke<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.209> have<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.840> be

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
and they can poke you so you have to be

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.569 
and they can poke you so you have to be
really<00:02:44.319> careful<00:02:45.299> when<00:02:46.299> handling<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.959> cube

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
really careful when handling this cube
