00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.979 

and<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.289> brush<00:02:10.560> looks<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.780> pretty

goes<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.830> pretty<00:02:52.070> share<00:02:53.410> hmm<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:56.890> don't<00:02:57.890> know

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
goes on pretty share hmm I don't know

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.580 
goes on pretty share hmm I don't know
how<00:02:58.130> I<00:02:58.160> should<00:02:58.340> put<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.030> house<00:02:59.630> how<00:03:00.560> I

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
how I should put a house how I

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.540 
how I should put a house how I
should<00:03:00.880> explain<00:03:01.880> how<00:03:02.210> it<00:03:02.960> smells<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:07.280> taste

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
should explain how it smells the taste

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.990 
should explain how it smells the taste
in<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.820> smell<00:03:08.120> doesn't<00:03:09.100> it's<00:03:10.100> not<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.430> bad

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
in the smell doesn't it's not that bad

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.310 
in the smell doesn't it's not that bad
I<00:03:11.030> mean<00:03:12.880> it's<00:03:13.880> bearable<00:03:14.420> it's<00:03:14.870> not<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
I mean it's bearable it's not to the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.770 
I mean it's bearable it's not to the
point<00:03:15.410> where<00:03:15.740> its<00:03:16.100> most<00:03:16.340> to<00:03:16.760> strong<00:03:17.180> where<00:03:17.510> I

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
point where its most to strong where I

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.360 
point where its most to strong where I
feel<00:03:18.790> like<00:03:19.790> I<00:03:19.970> don't<00:03:20.030> want<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.420> use<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.870> anymore

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
feel like I don't want to use it anymore

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.740 
feel like I don't want to use it anymore
so<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.400> think<00:03:22.520> I<00:03:22.730> could<00:03:23.110> bear<00:03:24.110> this<00:03:24.440> kind<00:03:24.800> of

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
so I think I could bear this kind of

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.460 
so I think I could bear this kind of
snow<00:03:27.130> clothes<00:03:28.780> see<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.200> just<00:03:30.620> instantly<00:03:32.470> stain

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
still stained pretty well inconsistency

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.060 
still stained pretty well inconsistency
was<00:04:05.240> I<00:04:05.270> think<00:04:05.690> there<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:05.959> this<00:04:06.260> I<00:04:06.530> think<00:04:06.890> that

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
was I think there is this I think that

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.160 
was I think there is this I think that
this<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.459> actually<00:04:08.060> better<00:04:08.240> than<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.630> Bennett

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
this is actually better than the Bennett

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.540 
this is actually better than the Bennett
tent

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
tent

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.890 
tent
it's<00:04:11.300> not<00:04:11.570> too<00:04:11.810> thick<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.510> feel<00:04:14.720> of<00:04:14.750> my

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
it's not too thick the the feel of my

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.020 
it's not too thick the the feel of my
lips<00:04:15.200> actually<00:04:15.680> really<00:04:16.160> feels<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:16.549> my<00:04:16.760> lips

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.060 
lips actually really feels like my lips
it<00:04:17.239> doesn't<00:04:17.270> really<00:04:17.810> like<00:04:18.080> it<00:04:18.739> doesn't<00:04:18.950> really

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
it doesn't really like it doesn't really

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.420 
it doesn't really like it doesn't really
feel<00:04:19.459> like<00:04:19.520> I<00:04:19.970> have<00:04:20.120> some<00:04:20.480> kind<00:04:20.630> of<00:04:20.750> product<00:04:21.170> on

feel like I have some kind of product on

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.960 
feel like I have some kind of product on
so<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:24.430> like<00:04:25.430> it

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
so I like it

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.490 
so I like it
I<00:04:26.320> strongly<00:04:27.320> recommend<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:28.300> she's<00:04:29.300> pretty<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
I strongly recommend it she's pretty the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.970 
I strongly recommend it she's pretty the
product<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.970> only<00:04:32.150> downside<00:04:32.900> out<00:04:33.200> say<00:04:33.650> is

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
product the only downside out say is

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.310 
product the only downside out say is
that<00:04:34.370> it<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:36.640> smells<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.940> little<00:04:38.180> bit<00:04:38.930> um

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
that it it smells a little bit um

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.890 
that it it smells a little bit um
chemically<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.340> it's<00:04:40.520> not<00:04:40.729> too<00:04:41.510> overpowering

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
chemically but it's not too overpowering

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.040 
chemically but it's not too overpowering
so<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.680> think<00:04:42.979> it's<00:04:43.400> ok<00:04:43.990> but

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
so I think it's ok but

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.649 
so I think it's ok but
actually<00:04:46.500> could<00:04:46.860> not<00:04:46.889> try<00:04:47.849> it<00:04:47.909> on<00:04:48.060> because<00:04:48.330> the

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
actually could not try it on because the

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.779 
actually could not try it on because the
display<00:04:49.080> wasn't<00:04:49.440> out<00:04:49.620> but<00:04:49.949> if<00:04:50.129> you<00:04:50.310> could<00:04:50.669> if

a<00:05:48.569> long<00:05:48.990> time<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:49.710> I<00:05:49.740> don't<00:05:49.979> think<00:05:50.310> it's<00:05:50.520> if<00:05:51.449> you

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
a long time so I don't think it's if you

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.050 
a long time so I don't think it's if you
think<00:05:52.110> of<00:05:52.229> a<00:05:52.349> hum<00:05:52.560> how<00:05:52.889> long<00:05:53.099> you<00:05:53.279> can<00:05:53.520> use<00:05:53.759> it<00:05:53.940> I

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
think of a hum how long you can use it I

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.469 
think of a hum how long you can use it I
don't<00:05:54.090> think<00:05:54.270> it's<00:05:54.479> that<00:05:54.719> expensive<00:05:55.199> but

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
don't think it's that expensive but

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.820 
don't think it's that expensive but
definitely<00:05:57.479> it's<00:05:57.690> not<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:58.139> cheaper<00:05:58.560> choice

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
definitely it's not the cheaper choice

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.670 
definitely it's not the cheaper choice
so<00:05:59.099> definitely<00:05:59.550> do<00:05:59.819> try<00:05:59.849> it<00:06:00.150> out<00:06:00.360> before<00:06:01.020> you

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680
