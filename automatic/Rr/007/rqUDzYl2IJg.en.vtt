00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:51.330 
the ball on the court using pronation
let's<00:00:41.580> take<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> look<00:00:41.910> at<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.090> exercise

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.160 

first<00:00:52.180> we're<00:00:52.300> gonna<00:00:52.390> start<00:00:52.630> with<00:00:52.720> a<00:00:52.750> million

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
first we're gonna start with a million

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.930 
first we're gonna start with a million
concise<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:54.070> this<00:00:54.250> is<00:00:54.400> to<00:00:54.520> get<00:00:54.640> rid<00:00:54.790> of<00:00:54.820> your

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
concise and this is to get rid of your

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.820 
concise and this is to get rid of your
lower<00:00:55.150> body<00:00:55.360> for<00:00:55.690> right<00:00:55.810> now<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.410> focus<00:00:56.710> on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
lower body for right now and focus on

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:48.820 
lower body for right now and focus on
pronation<00:00:57.190> here<00:00:57.670> we<00:00:57.730> go

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.080 

I<00:01:48.860> think<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.430> could<00:01:49.580> see<00:01:49.700> it's<00:01:49.820> pretty<00:01:49.970> easy

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
I think you could see it's pretty easy

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.580 
I think you could see it's pretty easy
to<00:01:50.299> make<00:01:50.390> contact<00:01:50.840> with<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.049> ball<00:01:51.229> and<00:01:51.350> ease

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
to make contact with the ball and ease

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.200 
to make contact with the ball and ease
like<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:52.010> and<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.640> don't<00:01:52.729> really<00:01:52.909> have<00:01:53.000> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
like that and you don't really have to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.090 
like that and you don't really have to
swing<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.570> hard<00:01:53.780> course<00:01:54.530> someone<00:01:54.770> hit<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> few

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
swing that hard course someone hit a few

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.050 
swing that hard course someone hit a few
in<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.250> edge<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.460> my<00:01:55.520> racket
