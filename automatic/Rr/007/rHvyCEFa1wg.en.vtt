 mini space with which I am amused 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 bunch and that I put all the illusion 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.990

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.660
 be all on the table design scripts 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.339

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.329

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.059
 of less the tele although it has been very 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.830
 hard every day there has to be 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.090
