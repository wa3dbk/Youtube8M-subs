00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.190
 hi friends today we are going to talk about one of 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.890
 the most popular and common flowers in 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.650
 all spain 'the geranium 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.090
 the big me comes from South Africa and since 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.370
 who introduced it in Spain has 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.730
 turned 9 the plants par excellence 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:29.210
 of balconies terraces and patios this is 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 because it is a very perennial plant 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.680
 rustic and very grateful there are four 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 great geranium types that are the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.000
 zonal geranium or common geranium that is 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.380
 this then we have a geranium 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.410
 greenhouse that is the general and the 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.390
 geranium thought the geranium of smell 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 it is a damage very similar to this what 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.680
 happens is that the leaves are aromatic 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.020
 It has a side like lemon and finally 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.820
 the geranium ivy or geranium gypsy 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.760
 which is the only hanging variety that 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.070
 Geranium exists, the most common are 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.649
 gypsy and geranium area what common 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.989
 they have to be in full sun but this 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.010
 it removes it in the middle of summer and 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.800
 central hours of the day 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.600
 do not appreciate a little bit of shadows and 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.940
 we have them in a courtyard we can put them 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.920
 an umbrella or an awning and we hold the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.210
 outside plant them in an area in the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.480
 that gives a little shade to the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.240
 trees you have to water the 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.430
 when the ground begins to dry in 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.320
 summer do generate most often in 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.930
 the time of autumn or winter when 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.640
 most important reggae no woman ever the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.190
 leaves since in this way we can 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.900
 cause burns and always water 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.970
 first thing in the morning or last 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.290
 evening time not to water the 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.060
 central hours for the same reason 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.430
 because they provoke we cause burns in 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.650
 leaves 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.920
 there is always removing the flowers that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.850
 are withered how are you this way 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 what we do is 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.630
 favor a new flower rotation 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.030
 ok and you also have to always take it 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.220
 dead leaves and dead failures 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.619
 because if pests can not proliferate and 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.780
 diseases you have to prune the always 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.140
 at the end of winter because the geranium 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.000
 blooms on young shoots does not like 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.890
 offer about the old bud then to 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
 prune what we do is stimulate a 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.000
 new contribution is not a very plant 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.709
 demanding in nutrients but convenient 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 pay for it in the growing season is 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.110
 say between spring and summer 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.940
 every 15-20 days with a special subscription 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.580
 for geranium are a fertilizer for flowers 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.110
 as for example these sticks that are 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.840
 very comfortable because what we can do 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 it is simply we puncture it on earth 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.420
 in the substrate and we forget until the 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.400
 next month is multiplied by cuttings 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.100
 we are going to take a cutting for 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.209
 show you how to do it easily 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.100
 then the most important thing you have to 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.810
 take a cut of a stem that does not 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.220
 have flowers or buds 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.220
 we choose from this geranium 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.560
 a flower-free garden for example 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.580
 this one here you have to always cut by 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.400
 under a knot 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.290
 we cut exactly below 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.390
 one of the knots this knot will be 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.620
 where in roots in geranium and what 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.640
 we have to do is remove all the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.910
 basal leaves 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.240
 simply leaving two or three attic 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:12.180
 we remove all the leaves 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.070
 and we would leave these here with these and 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.960
 would have more than enough to 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.340
 ensure the rooting the best is 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.110
 put a little bit of hormones 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.600
 training hormones 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.780
 rooting what they do is accelerate 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.790
 the root formation process 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.810
 those impregnated with hormones 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.100
 site 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.260
 a little bit we remove the excess 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.470
 and already just put it in the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.940
 substrate we take a flowerpot 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.670
 with substrate 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.110
 we introduce our cutting 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.550
 we tighten the substrate well 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.100
 so that it is in contact in everything 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.010
 moment 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.100
 the cutting with the substrate and water 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.060
 well for de malaga with a sprayer 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.060
 like this one 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.940
 we soak the substrate well 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.870
 and the best thing is to cover it with if we have a 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.670
 greenhouse put a greenhouse 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.499
 tiny but as I do not have any what 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.989
 What we do is put a greenhouse 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:18.440
 home we put a bottle 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.789
 transparent in this way what 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.769
 we do is get some 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.349
 Humidity and temperature conditions 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.550
 constants inside the good pot 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.789
 I hope that with these little tips 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.259
 have a constant perfect flowering 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.259
 and wonderful in you that damages
