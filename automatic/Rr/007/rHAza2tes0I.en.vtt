00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.510
 friends of from the manager today vi 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.550
 we present the mono jabra headset 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.230
 motion ec class a studied earpiece 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.689
 and developed especially for those who 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.610
 they use the phone a lot and they are 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.410
 often moving and therefore have 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.199
 need a design object 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.430
 compact and that allows it easily 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:39.589
 to carry out answering calls on 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.379
 jabra motion nucci plus is one uses 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:45.530
 let's say all the latest technologies 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.840
 in the field in the oil sector from jabra come 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.539
 for example a combination of sensors 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.340
 of movement and some microphones that 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.079
 allow the already pro motion of 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.780
 analyze the surrounding environment e 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.680
 adapt to the present audio conditions 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.289
 in various various types of situations or the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.119
 jabra motion that we present them as 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.430
 preview because it will be on sale in 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.740
 Italian stores from the first of April is 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 was developed by the jabra design team 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.690
 who opted for a circular form 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.849
 that they themselves define behind di 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.560
 that is, that pays great attention to 

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:20.899
 quality audio but also in the economy 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 of wearability of this particular 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.580
 object as you can see 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.759
 jabra provides the headset in one 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.690
 very very particular packaging that 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.849
 inside it hides and protects 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.640
 the headset together with a series of 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:42.979
 spare parts accessories very useful to 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.050
 example there are two rubber pads 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.950
 of the gel earpiece you can 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.649
 replace who the usb cable is 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.530
 allows you to connect the headset to the 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.950
 computer and use it through 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.050
 this wireless adapter that works on 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.310
 specific channels and which also allows for 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.630
 recharge it once it is attached to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.720
 computer for ops and we don't want 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.369
 recharge in this jabra mode 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.890
 provides a 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.049
 normal and simple charger with the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.610
 which we can recharge the headset 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:21.250
 this base is pretty first of all 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.680
 regarding transportability e 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.470
 the protection of the vicariate when not 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 we need it but above all it is particular 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.829
 because for it acts as a base when 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.510
 we want to recharge a headset 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.930
 I do n't know we are in the office rather than a 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.930
 home 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.489
 lips motion plus I don't have one 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.219
 innovative object is certainly the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.379
 nfc connection that allows a 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:13.140
 fast pairing and no need for 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.290
 make bering and lose seconds 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.620
 precious with smartphones and tablets that 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.790
 have a chance to have one 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.250
 phone part is not one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.189
 data connection and that support this 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.079
 innovative NFC technology 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:33.359
 through this technology enough 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:37.049
 obviously activate the connection on 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:41.040
 smartphone near the headset to the 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.280
 device open the damn e 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.379
 we already see that part or connection 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.500
 bluetooth as shown here 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.870
 or the nfc that it really is 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.519
 instantly having tried it 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.400
 closing it the shuttle turns off the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:03.450
 device with a red light is with 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.049
 reposition them on its jabra base 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.930
 motion vc plus which is the model with the 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:15.479
 fc and therefore not only with with the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:18.720
 bluetooth allows to use also 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:22.139
 specific gestures an example if 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.919
 me the jean nfc or the bluetooth 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:30.599
 combined with the alley year and I keep it 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.159
 then opened on the table 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.590
 when will a 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:37.650
 phone call will be enough to take it ha 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.080
 specified the earpiece in the ear 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.870
 will understand that there was this movement and 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.960
 will activate directly to respond 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.360
 to the phone call therefore without need of 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.490
 having to press any contrast 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.550
 moreover, in view of savings 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.580
 important energy savings 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.430
 the jabra motion if connected by al 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.020
 Bluetooth to the smartphone turns off 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.789
 after 60 minutes when it is not touched 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.120
 it is not used but it is not for 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.639
 nothing touched and five minutes instead of 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.830
 Guideline which leads the autonomy to levels 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.880
 really acceptable and above all comfortable 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.190
 to repeat more often life a 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.229
 bluetooth headset or in this case it 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.260
 I started to call and was on the move e 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:28.680
 so he doesn't always have possibilities 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.720
 to recharge it seen before in a new one 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.020
 firm is not an office already pro motion 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.330
 fabio said will be available for all 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.699
 certified reseller distributors 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.639
 jabra from April 1, 2013 at a price 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.180

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:47.070
 the only one that has Bluetooth 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:51.090
 marked with ucci in the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:57.449
 euro with the jabra link adapter together 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.000
 360 usb which is compatible with both 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:04.590
 windows from xp version up to windows 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.110
 7 to eight and apple or left that allows 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.060
 then to use this particular 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.160
 earphone not only in mobility but also 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.810
