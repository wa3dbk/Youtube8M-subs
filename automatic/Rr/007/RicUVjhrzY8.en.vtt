 panorama but in bad shape 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.590
 so much letrita plot needs a reform 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.750

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.660

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.520
 call innovate to come tell me everything 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.130
 this has been a joke so if I 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.630
 pinch I wake up from the nap not 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.440
 think of the style of those who are in 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.500

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.080

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.920
 The copypaste sounds too monotonous 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.320
 stop being the sheep 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.840
 in the wolf the panorama is full of 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.450
 I get stuck with my colleagues who 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.490
 for me they sound fat if we wanted to 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.170
 we should take a big sip but not 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.689
 we teach our talent to an audience 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.000
 Deaf Tula but favorite is there for 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.520

 based on cynicism define liberties but 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.350
 practice imperialism thanks for hobby 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.470
 but you have been defeated now you only have 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.470
 pose and modernism scream careful that the 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.819
 fame as the worst enemy enemy is 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.819
 find in oneself
