00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.610
 the globe ecology is back and in today's program we are talking about the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.610
 search for cleaner energy sources 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.720
 the place in 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.759
 for those who do not know 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.999
 This is the periodic table, hello, nice to meet you. 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.270
 but for those who know everything and chemistry 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.609
 it's time to remember 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.609
 the periodic table to the set of chemical elements 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.900
 they are organized by the initials and by the characteristics of their acts 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.610
 I'll be worth one hundred 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.610
 it represented by the letter u day considered Christmas 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 they were in the field 238 is a little bag 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410
 pay attention destination 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.500
 there are other elements even better known as hydrogen and oxygen 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 but I did not choose the uranium actor 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.910
 it will help us understand a source of energy quite controversial the energy 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.910
 nuclear' 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 so the destruction to prove the strength of the loot 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.980
 bush what in three away matches 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.780
 has a lot of energy 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.780
 the atomic bombs are made so 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 but this technology can be controlled and used in your favor 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.460
 the nuclear power plants forced forced to take the city remedies 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.710
 without emitting greenhouse gases 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.820
 which is a great advantage 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.000
 but they have a big problem 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.960
 the radioactive waste 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.420
 most of the electricity that feeds the world is produced by sources 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 carbon dioxide emitters 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 is the case of coal-fired thermoelectric plants 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.730
 the fuel is burned so it will be 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730
 new is produced in which city 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.130
 lots of smoke and criciÃºma 2 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.020
 especially greenhouse gases 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.920
 in the nuclear power plant no smoke 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.720
 the heat that electricity-generating elements come from the clash of atoms 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.720
 of controlled uranium inside nuclear reactors 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:18.749
 or earn or issue carbon dioxide and methane 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.259
 does not contribute to global warming 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.259
 but radioactive waste lasts ten thousand years 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.829
 radio activity a natural phenomenon 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.829
 some chemical elements emit radiation waves 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.179
 are the same as those used in medicine 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.039
 but at great intensity 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.609
 the radiation can cause mutations in the cells causing serious diseases like 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.049
 the cancer 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.010
 the remembrance of bombs and radioactivity to make nuclear 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.409
 a controversy around the world 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.180
 but it is gaining momentum in the energy race in search of more sources 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.839
 clean 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:58.369
 an idyllic landscape of the sea sierra is broken by a futuristic architecture 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:05.449
 and creek 2 leaves from here half of the electricity rio de janeiro food 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.339
 I could tell jokingly that I ended up blocking the accesses by noting the 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:10.379
 commander 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.029
 are the only two nuclear power plants in Brazil for the time being 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.059
 the Brazilian economy grew in energy 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:23.409
 there is a third plant to be built this winter where they should 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.409
 increase with over a thousand others to 50 thousand dead 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.569
 and then we will be responsible for the support of both its people 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.209
 of energy consumption in the state of rio de janeiro 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.369
 without having any greenhouse gas 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:37.519
 for sure 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.489
 to our brothers and sisters, our central office in the limit of no expense that may 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.870
 damage to the environment tonga 3 will cost 7 billion reals with the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.489
 money to build three medium-sized hydroelectric plants 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.650
 such favorable arguments discussed 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.650
 one of them is that the nuclear power plant does not emit greenhouse gases 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.629
 uranium tablets challenge after extracted from sleep he passes 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.359
 by a process of enrichment 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.079
 it is rather simple interposing people think that their uranium is a 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.489
 with an activity 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.649
 who initiated the mechanical aggressions in reality you 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.590
 through the use of the portal that collects centrists and 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.770
 cascade you increase 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.349
 separation than mechanics during a heavier player who is one of three 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.800
 what do you think of cci grandma ziza 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.949
 with 235 is called physical uranium 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.219
 because it can be questioned ie your file can be divided 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:43.219
 this is what generates energy 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.080
 he got stuck by size or high temperatures 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.750
 which ended up entering above two thousand and 500 degrees at the operating temperature 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.810
 of the reactors was around 600 degrees in a thousand and five hundred excited with 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.960
 about the burning of books work all under snow safety 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.540
 well-considered and with high response in relation to the same 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.830
 Thermal energy 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.029
 the ministry of justice that you are 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.759
 and file archiving impresses 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.190
 to generate the same energy from a uranium partnership are needed 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.759
 564 liters of oil 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.710
 807 pounds of meat 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.069
 no mine 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.919
 you work with a very small amount of fuel 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.030
 if you have to generate power through a coal plant you spend 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.220
 tonnes and tonnes and tonnes of coal 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.999
 includes transport via the roads by ip
