00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.569
 and start with built-up seedlings 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.939
 for the community system we are going to 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.580
 use this coconut fiber this life of 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.830
 coconut comes in roughly one kilogram 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:16.180
 you can buy it in several is a block 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.130
 more or less that comes compressed and this 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.619
 it expands more or less about 17 times 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 according to what they recommend 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.910
 then as with a small container 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.880
 some of the material and we are going to add 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.370
 water to release the fibers 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.870
 after that we're going to take some 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.850
 baskets for europol planted and 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 ccoo and there we are going to do our 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.750
 plantations and we will cover it with a 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.060
 greenhouse cover like this 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.450
 our seeds are protected 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:51.790
 and they have the necessary steam to be able 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.790
 germinate fruitfully 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 i 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.190
 in our wet and loose coconut fiber 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.430
 how we needed it and what we are going to 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.490
 to do is that we're going to take a link in 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.180
 the good stores in these stores 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.610
 many times they sell from the best 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 to achieve sell these germinates of the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.030
 our dominators then I 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.250
 I'm just going to modify it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.060
 use these these materials this 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.060
 matter is calling 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:47.479
 in mesh cups or mesh material or 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.430
 need caps in English then we are going to 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.049
 fill it with fiber and let's plant 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.729
 our templates we add a little 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.649
 of water to the bottom part and what 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.049
 we cover to start germinating 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.060
 our our seed in this case 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.020
 I'm using basil basil 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.210
 Sweet and the Genovese basil 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.460
 They are very good at fixing food 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.050
 They are very healthy and what else if we go 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.050
 to do with our system two comedians 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.480
 we are in the final part of our 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.340
 seed now I have just put more than 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 a seed to every little thing to be 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.120
 sure that some germination came 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.010
 once they start to grow 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.780
 personally the others are withdrawn 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.940
 plants and are careful transplanted 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.010
 the matitas to another place if you 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.110
 they have more space and if not then 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.480
 they are simply cut to give space 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.890
 the greatest thing is now once you already 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.260
 they are here because a little bit of 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.450
 water are taken to an internal place where 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.330
 be free of any temperature 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.850
 for now that we are in winter then 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.769
 in the case of the northern parts are very 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.780
 south of the continents and they will put it 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.130
 somewhere that is sunny so that 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.989
 the sun arrives but it is covered 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.580
 within a property within a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.830
 building 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.750
 with a little water they wait for it to grow 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.360
 and they take it out 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.460
 be it your greenhouses or good ones I made a 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.740
 greenhouse does not have to take off but if 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.590
 they are suddenly doing some cultivation 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.900
 aquatic outdoors, wait for 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.610
 pass the freezing times and if 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.680
 not because you are in paradise not 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.260
 as well as the whole equatorial part 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.630
 enjoy good temperatures 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.060
 then no problem but always 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.980
 keep it a little damp the earth a 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.230
 little loose in this case the fiber of 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.970
 coconut a little loose and then after 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.230
 can put between the rafts can not 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:43.320
 They can be floating rafts or pipe 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.540
 perforated or some other means to 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.000
 plant either stone or good there are many 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.520
 things that not only in my videos 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.490
 but in other very educational videos for 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.420
 is showing then I thank you 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.070
 who have seen the video 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.500
 please subscribe to my channel to see 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.870
 other interesting videos not only 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.880
 of opony but of construction and things 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.080
 that are fun then I am 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.080
 very good and thank you very much
