00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 videos on Wednesdays weeks but not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 much 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.190
 Well there are many ways to use a 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.900
 handkerchief on the neck on the head are 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.520
 the most known but what if 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.920
 we adapt for other places of our 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.600
 body and I do not feel the countries happened what 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.699
 but from Argentina it is very easy 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.260
 find these handkerchiefs with this design 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.090
 in particular, they can also use 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.190
 any square or triangular edge 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.449
 but you will see how to adapt them to what 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.089
 He tried to teach him the greeting that is 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.250
 fast and easy fast and easy fast and 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.070
 easy so let's see if we start with 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.390
 these ideas 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.070
 I recommend you iron first 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.870
 handkerchief so that the result is more 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.969
 neat and beautiful this first idea is the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.399
 more positive let's say and my favorite 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.350
 let's take two handkerchiefs and tie two of 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.000
 your tips this way with knots 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.740
 small so you do not notice we're going to 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.810
 put your head through that hole at 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.030
 poncho style and down we're going to put them together 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.680
 with pinholes in this way to 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.360
 I like to throw it a little on the side or 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.830
 combine it with a little bag so that 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.000
 just see the design of the medium 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.130
 It is also a little style 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.110
 untidy for whoever cheers I use it 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 with a top underneath to walk around the house or 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.130
 If I have to go out and buy something near 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.929
 the second idea the truth is not my 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.729
 preferred because it shows too much 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.990
 let's say it's not my style but although not 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.330
 they believe it I have seen that they sell in 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 shops this same design quite expensive 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.080
 then knowing how to save your pocket 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.880
 If they planned to buy it, they would only use it to 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.679
 go to the beach combined with some cute 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.050
 sunglasses as simple as using a 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.030
 bando double photo of the handkerchief a little and 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.860
 accommodate it in front and behind 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.509
 so that you only see one point falling 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 It has its charm but I would only use it 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.899
 to go to the beach or to libya sink and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.060
 for the last idea we are going to double the 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.649
 tip of the handkerchief in this way and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.270
 cook it with the sewing machine or with 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.350
 thread and needle or in my case simply 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.600
 I use a hook 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.159
 and we can pass a string or string through 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.930
 this tunnel that we created by doubling the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.850
 we're just going to tie it to the waist 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.650
 and we will adjust the chain or rope of the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.390
 neck for this black handkerchief and I said what 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.160
 same the difference is that being more 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.750
 big and have weight on the tip by 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.930
 magical handkerchief on the string and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.849
 He froze 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.650
 another similar thing that we can use with 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.329
 a square handkerchief is to do the same 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.950
 leaving the extreme fall in this way 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.680
 so that it covers a little more the tummy and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.629
 ready 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.129
 As you can see, there are three easy ideas 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.319
 which can arise many more 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.269
 ideas below, which are these three ideas ? 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.349
 liked more or which would be but good without 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.349
 throw a little in what you are 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.569
 handkerchiefs different shapes 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.320
 one 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:29.060
 the information that facebook on facebook 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.490
 it was coming 2010 so I'm going to take 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.760
 very much but finally at the moment 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.830
 Greetings made in the way that 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.360
 I decided for everyone in the world to be 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.850
 of the audio 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.850
 It's going to take a lot, but let's go 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.220
 a while 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.780
 plant and socialize making everything possible 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:06.730
 very well before I finish and good 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.730
 as I always tell them talking
