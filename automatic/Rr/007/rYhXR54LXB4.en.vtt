00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
indeed neither will I personally I think

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.659 
indeed neither will I personally I think
it's<00:00:30.599> more<00:00:30.810> interesting<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.920> transform<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it's more interesting if I transform the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.440 
it's more interesting if I transform the
utensil<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.660> plastic<00:00:35.870> to<00:00:36.870> steel<00:00:38.000> if<00:00:39.000> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
utensil from plastic to steel if this

utensil from plastic to steel if this
makes<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> heavier<00:00:40.700> and<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.210> can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
makes it heavier and now I can

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.450 
makes it heavier and now I can
manipulate<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.230> such<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.559> that'll<00:00:44.340> make

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
manipulate it in such a way that'll make

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.950 
manipulate it in such a way that'll make
