it<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.489> focused<00:01:05.489> lip<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it was focused lip like about a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500 
it was focused lip like about a
millimeter<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.770> front<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.510> nine-foot

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
millimeter in front of the nine-foot

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.280 
millimeter in front of the nine-foot
mark<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.369> i<00:01:11.549> read<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> focus

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
mark and now if i read just the focus

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.649 
mark and now if i read just the focus
right<00:01:13.770> there<00:01:15.049> it<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.439> now<00:01:16.650> about<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> millimeter

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
right there it is now about a millimeter

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.280 
right there it is now about a millimeter
behind<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.650> nine-foot<00:01:20.220> mark<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
behind the nine-foot mark so that's the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.210 
behind the nine-foot mark so that's the
difference<00:01:22.590> some<00:01:23.159> having<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.119> end<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:25.140> not

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.810

don't remember what he said about it but
I'm<00:01:38.820> pretty<00:01:39.000> sure<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.420> filters<00:01:39.930> actually<00:01:40.770> do

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.480 
I'm pretty sure all filters actually do
this<00:01:41.159> but<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.689> thought<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.200> was<00:01:43.259> kind<00:01:43.710> of

this but I just thought this was kind of
interesting<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.060> see<00:01:45.450> anyways<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:47.210> I'll<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
interesting to see anyways it I'll be

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.039 
interesting to see anyways it I'll be
