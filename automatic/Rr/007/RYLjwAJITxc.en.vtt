00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
get a another block here yep okay that's

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.140 
get a another block here yep okay that's
your<00:00:37.630> basic<00:00:37.960> circuit<00:00:38.500> complete<00:00:38.920> now<00:00:39.640> we're

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
your basic circuit complete now we're

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.360 
your basic circuit complete now we're
going<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.360> do<00:00:40.450> with<00:00:40.570> wiry<00:00:40.810> up<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:42.250> really

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
going to do with wiry up it's really

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.850 
going to do with wiry up it's really
simple<00:00:42.670> to<00:00:42.850> do<00:00:43.060> just<00:00:43.300> get<00:00:43.420> some<00:00:43.600> redstone

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
simple to do just get some redstone

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.910 
simple to do just get some redstone
torches<00:00:45.660> place<00:00:46.660> them<00:00:46.930> kind<00:00:47.530> of<00:00:47.650> like<00:00:47.770> they're

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
torches place them kind of like they're

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.950 
torches place them kind of like they're
following<00:00:48.250> each<00:00:48.460> other's<00:00:48.760> blocks<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:50.230> this

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
following each other's blocks this this

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.850 
following each other's blocks this this
this<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.350> like<00:00:54.100> this<00:00:54.130> and<00:00:54.730> then<00:00:55.350> get<00:00:56.350> redstone

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
this and like this and then get redstone

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.180 
this and like this and then get redstone
wire<00:00:57.490> and<00:00:58.110> and<00:00:59.110> you'll<00:00:59.260> notice<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.650> then

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
wire and and you'll notice that then

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.590 
wire and and you'll notice that then
when<00:01:00.310> this<00:01:00.460> one's<00:01:00.700> on<00:01:00.880> is<00:01:01.180> one<00:01:01.420> of<00:01:01.480> those

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
when this one's on is one of those

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.030 
when this one's on is one of those
powder<00:01:01.900> this<00:01:02.170> morning<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.500> will<00:01:02.650> turns<00:01:02.890> it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
powder this morning this will turns it

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:11.069 
powder this morning this will turns it
off<00:01:03.269> so<00:01:04.560> like<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:09.369> was<00:01:09.399> also<00:01:10.079> then

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
off so like this that was also then

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.679 
off so like this that was also then
through<00:01:11.560> here<00:01:11.859> and<00:01:12.149> as<00:01:13.149> you<00:01:13.270> can<00:01:13.420> see<00:01:13.450> the

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
through here and as you can see the

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.709 
through here and as you can see the
blinking<00:01:13.869> that's<00:01:14.560> simple<00:01:15.369> now<00:01:16.329> if<00:01:16.450> you<00:01:16.539> want

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
blinking that's simple now if you want

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.840 
blinking that's simple now if you want
it<00:01:16.840> now<00:01:17.049> we've<00:01:17.320> got<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:17.619> do<00:01:17.740> really<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.280> connect

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
it now we've got to do really is connect

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.450 
it now we've got to do really is connect
the<00:01:18.969> output<00:01:18.999> like<00:01:19.509> that<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:20.369> connect<00:01:21.369> the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
the output like that and connect the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.209 
the output like that and connect the
output<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.969> any<00:01:22.119> kind<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.539> thing<00:01:23.140> so<00:01:23.890> for

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
output to any kind of thing so for

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.050 
output to any kind of thing so for
example<00:01:24.310> i<00:01:24.939> get<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.600> lever<00:01:25.899> a<00:01:26.729> place<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.880> over

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
example i get a lever a place to over

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.190 
example i get a lever a place to over
there<00:01:28.329> and<00:01:29.070> turn<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.369> blinking<00:01:30.759> on<00:01:30.880> or<00:01:31.060> off

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
there and turn the blinking on or off

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.630 
there and turn the blinking on or off
and<00:01:32.200> i<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.619> from<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.609> letter<00:01:33.819> from<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
and i can from the letter from the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.980 
and i can from the letter from the
leather<00:01:36.939> lemma<00:01:37.569> i<00:01:37.929> can<00:01:38.289> put<00:01:38.590> an<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:40.810> more

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
leather lemma i can put an some more

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.789 
leather lemma i can put an some more
redstone<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.759> connect<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.090> say<00:01:43.329> a<00:01:43.840> cool<00:01:45.060> so

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
redstone and connect it to say a cool so

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.870 
redstone and connect it to say a cool so
this<00:01:47.799> when<00:01:48.130> I

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
this when I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.790 
this when I
the<00:01:49.880> door<00:01:50.060> opens<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.600> closes<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.440> very

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
the door opens and closes this is very

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.150 
the door opens and closes this is very
simple<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:53.390> can<00:01:53.510> also<00:01:53.660> be<00:01:53.810> used<00:01:53.930> to<00:01:54.530> for

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
simple and it can also be used to for

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.470 
simple and it can also be used to for
example<00:01:57.010> I'll<00:01:58.010> show<00:01:58.400> you<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.940> could<00:01:59.210> also<00:01:59.330> be

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
example I'll show you it could also be

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.110 
example I'll show you it could also be
used<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.140> pass<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> block<00:02:01.430> here<00:02:01.460> in<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.910> face

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
used to pass a block here in the face

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.620 
used to pass a block here in the face
ball<00:02:02.330> there<00:02:02.950> on<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.670> also<00:02:04.790> be<00:02:04.940> done<00:02:05.240> to

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
ball there on it can also be done to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.249 
ball there on it can also be done to
create<00:02:06.080> like<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:06.350> blinking<00:02:06.860> light<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.160> light

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
create like a blinking light of light

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.780 
create like a blinking light of light
this<00:02:09.259> can<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.470> simply<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.040> used<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.369> anything

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
this can be simply be used with anything

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.420 
this can be simply be used with anything
for<00:02:11.090> example<00:02:11.540> you<00:02:11.570> could<00:02:12.040> connect<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.160> lot<00:02:13.310> of

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
for example you could connect a lot of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.420 
for example you could connect a lot of
these<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:14.350> make<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.530> an<00:02:15.800> awesome<00:02:15.950> annoying

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
these and make it an awesome annoying

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.600 
these and make it an awesome annoying
machine<00:02:16.880> or<00:02:17.270> something<00:02:18.110> like<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.710> it's

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
machine or something like that and it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.850 
machine or something like that and it's
on<00:02:19.790> let's<00:02:20.090> also<00:02:20.240> used<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.750> my<00:02:20.930> blinker<00:02:21.410> which<00:02:21.680> I

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
on let's also used in my blinker which I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.910
