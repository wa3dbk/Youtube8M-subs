00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
probably under 30 people and we were

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.660 
probably under 30 people and we were
just<00:01:49.530> talking<00:01:49.860> basically<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.310> where<00:01:50.580> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
just talking basically out where it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.160 
just talking basically out where it
should<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:50.850> set<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.450> know<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.720> time<00:01:51.930> period

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
should be set you know what time period

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.010 
should be set you know what time period
would<00:01:52.410> work<00:01:52.830> who<00:01:53.640> our<00:01:53.820> heroes<00:01:54.150> should<00:01:54.330> be<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
would work who our heroes should be the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.810 
would work who our heroes should be the
first<00:01:55.290> two<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.070> decide<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.460> we

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
first two things we decide that we

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.310 
first two things we decide that we
thought<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.180> work<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.690> was<00:01:57.900> the<00:01:58.050> idea<00:01:58.229> of

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
thought would work one was the idea of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.749 
thought would work one was the idea of
the<00:01:58.350> American<00:01:58.680> Revolution<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> second

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the American Revolution and the second

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
the American Revolution and the second
was<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> idea<00:02:00.330> of<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.960> Native<00:02:01.229> American<00:02:01.290> hero

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
was the idea of a Native American hero

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
was the idea of a Native American hero
so<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.759> tried<00:02:02.970> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.300> build<00:02:03.450> it

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so what we tried to do is build it

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.420 
so what we tried to do is build it
almost<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.050> pyramid<00:02:04.440> an<00:02:04.710> inverse<00:02:05.009> pyramid

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
almost like a pyramid an inverse pyramid

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.499 
almost like a pyramid an inverse pyramid
where<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.610> start<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:05.940> these<00:02:06.030> big<00:02:06.240> core

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
where you start with these big core

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
where you start with these big core
decisions<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:07.229> really<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.160> stick

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
decisions and really you have to stick

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.800 
decisions and really you have to stick
with<00:02:08.399> them<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.820> then<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.179> then<00:02:09.300> work<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.660> out

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
with them and then and then work it out

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.510 
with them and then and then work it out
from<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.289> American<00:02:10.679> Revolution<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.250> lot<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
from the American Revolution a lot of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.940 
from the American Revolution a lot of
the<00:02:11.640> ideas<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.330> themes<00:02:12.780> behind<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.410> dovetail

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the ideas and themes behind it dovetail

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.070 
the ideas and themes behind it dovetail
really<00:02:14.280> nicely<00:02:14.489> with<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.880> themes<00:02:15.450> behind<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
really nicely with the themes behind the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.020 
really nicely with the themes behind the
Templar<00:02:16.590> assassin<00:02:16.680> conflict<00:02:17.340> we've<00:02:17.459> had<00:02:17.700> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
Templar assassin conflict we've had this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.290 
Templar assassin conflict we've had this
you<00:02:18.360> know<00:02:18.410> millennia-old<00:02:19.459> struggle<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.640> free

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
you know millennia-old struggle of free

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.060 
you know millennia-old struggle of free
will<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:21.840> know<00:02:21.959> versus<00:02:22.290> oppression<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.830> idea

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
will you know versus oppression the idea

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.590 
will you know versus oppression the idea
that<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.280> Templars<00:02:23.700> want<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.000> impose<00:02:24.239> their

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that the Templars want to impose their

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.690 
that the Templars want to impose their
version<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> world<00:02:25.560> upon<00:02:25.950> people<00:02:26.519> and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
version of the world upon people and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.240 
version of the world upon people and
sort<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.209> control<00:02:27.660> them<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.769> manner<00:02:29.010> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
sort of control them in that manner and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.920 
sort of control them in that manner and
I<00:02:29.430> think<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.090> draw<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.269> parallel<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.780> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
I think you can draw a parallel in that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.509 
I think you can draw a parallel in that
a<00:02:31.050> lot<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.410> Patriots<00:02:31.890> may<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.160> felt<00:02:32.370> that

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
a lot of Patriots may have felt that

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.009 
a lot of Patriots may have felt that
this<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> what<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.150> loyalists<00:02:33.630> were<00:02:33.690> trying

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
this is what the loyalists were trying

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.570 
this is what the loyalists were trying
to<00:02:34.140> do<00:02:34.290> they<00:02:34.530> wanted<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.890> take<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.280> British

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
to do they wanted to take the British

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.120 
to do they wanted to take the British
system<00:02:36.180> and<00:02:36.600> impose<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.140> upon<00:02:37.200> these<00:02:37.650> colonies

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
system and impose it upon these colonies

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.830 
system and impose it upon these colonies
in<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.489> Americas<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.330> lot<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.690> people

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
in the Americas and a lot of people

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900 
in the Americas and a lot of people
started<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.620> resist<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.040> idea<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.640> this

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
started to resist that idea this this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.280 
started to resist that idea this this
idea<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.299> like<00:02:42.450> people<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.840> are<00:02:42.900> far<00:02:43.170> away

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
idea of like people that are far away

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.050 
idea of like people that are far away
who<00:02:43.680> think<00:02:43.950> they<00:02:44.070> know<00:02:44.100> better<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.549> trying<00:02:44.910> to

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
who think they know better are trying to

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.370 
who think they know better are trying to
tell<00:02:45.269> me<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.690> do<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.840> how<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.079> live<00:02:46.350> my

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
tell me what to do and how to live my

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.840 
tell me what to do and how to live my
life<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.980> like<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.370> fact<00:02:47.489> that<00:02:47.579> when<00:02:47.730> we

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
life I like the fact that when we

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.310 
life I like the fact that when we
announced<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.329> setting<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:49.079> was<00:02:49.170> going

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
announced the setting that it was going

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.660 
announced the setting that it was going
to<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> American<00:02:49.920> Revolution<00:02:50.489> that

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
to be the American Revolution that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.460 
to be the American Revolution that
people<00:02:51.000> were<00:02:51.090> surprised<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.840> we're<00:02:52.140> asking

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
people were surprised and we're asking

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.690 
people were surprised and we're asking
how<00:02:52.590> could<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.890> work<00:02:53.070> how<00:02:53.430> would<00:02:53.579> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
how could this work how would it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.979 
how could this work how would it
function<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.630> meant<00:02:54.750> we<00:02:54.840> had

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
function because that meant we had

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.960 
function because that meant we had
somewhere<00:02:55.230> fresh<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:56.220> was<00:02:56.310> our<00:02:56.430> really

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
somewhere fresh and that was our really

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.699 
somewhere fresh and that was our really
our<00:02:57.060> first<00:02:57.269> goal<00:02:57.540> was<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.930> make<00:02:57.959> sure<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.590> it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
our first goal was to make sure that it

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.830 
our first goal was to make sure that it
was<00:02:59.250> an<00:02:59.340> unexpected<00:02:59.489> place<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.390> set<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.600> game

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
was an unexpected place to set a game

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.509 
was an unexpected place to set a game
that<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.200> was<00:03:01.320> somewhere<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.709> game<00:03:01.920> hadn't<00:03:02.370> been

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
that it was somewhere a game hadn't been

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.460 
that it was somewhere a game hadn't been
set<00:03:02.790> before<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.900> somewhere<00:03:04.140> where<00:03:04.290> we<00:03:04.320> could

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
set before and somewhere where we could

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.360 
set before and somewhere where we could
hopefully<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.890> some<00:03:04.920> new<00:03:05.519> stuff

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.979 

when<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.030> have<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> very<00:03:13.330> small<00:03:13.450> team<00:03:13.810> before

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
when you have a very small team before

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.509 
when you have a very small team before
you<00:03:14.230> have<00:03:14.379> a<00:03:14.409> lot<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.590> engineers<00:03:15.069> or<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.400> have

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
you have a lot of engineers or you have

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.490 
you have a lot of engineers or you have
a<00:03:15.549> lot<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.760> content<00:03:16.150> creators<00:03:16.659> you<00:03:17.080> still<00:03:17.319> want

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
a lot of content creators you still want

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.649 
a lot of content creators you still want
to<00:03:17.590> draw<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.769> picture<00:03:18.069> for<00:03:18.250> people<00:03:18.730> something

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
to draw a picture for people something

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.570 
to draw a picture for people something
better<00:03:19.959> than<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.200> document<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:20.890> we<00:03:21.010> build<00:03:21.280> a

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
better than a document so we build a

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.789 
better than a document so we build a
video<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.569> little<00:03:22.870> movie<00:03:23.200> it's<00:03:23.349> a<00:03:23.440> couple<00:03:23.709> of

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
video a little movie it's a couple of

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.160 
video a little movie it's a couple of
minutes<00:03:24.010> long<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:25.420> tries<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:25.659> be<00:03:25.900> as<00:03:25.989> real

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
minutes long and it tries to be as real

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.780 
minutes long and it tries to be as real
as<00:03:26.290> possible<00:03:26.349> no<00:03:26.799> assets<00:03:27.220> that<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.519> couldn't

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
as possible no assets that you couldn't

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.750 
as possible no assets that you couldn't
use<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> in<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.480> real<00:03:28.780> game<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:30.400> cameras

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
use in the in the real game the cameras

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.949 
use in the in the real game the cameras
in<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:30.970> same<00:03:31.120> position<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.599> we<00:03:31.659> want<00:03:31.690> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
in the same position that we want the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.930 
in the same position that we want the
camera<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.230> be<00:03:32.409> in<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> final<00:03:32.980> game<00:03:33.129> any

camera to be in the final game any
weapons<00:03:34.360> you<00:03:34.480> use<00:03:34.659> our<00:03:34.900> ideas<00:03:35.349> we<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.799> for

weapons you use our ideas we have for

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.920 
weapons you use our ideas we have for
gameplay<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.940> know<00:03:37.060> as<00:03:37.209> systemic<00:03:37.599> and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
gameplay you know as systemic and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.839 
gameplay you know as systemic and
believable<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:38.590> possible<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.519> target

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
believable as possible the target

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.399 
believable as possible the target
gameplay<00:03:40.120> footage<00:03:40.329> is<00:03:40.599> really<00:03:40.930> critical<00:03:41.140> for

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
gameplay footage is really critical for

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.080 
gameplay footage is really critical for
just<00:03:41.709> setting<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.519> is<00:03:42.670> what<00:03:42.819> we're<00:03:42.970> aiming

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
just setting this is what we're aiming

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.119 
just setting this is what we're aiming
for<00:03:43.269> it<00:03:43.780> gives<00:03:43.959> us<00:03:44.110> basically<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.680> living

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
for it gives us basically a living

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.089 
for it gives us basically a living
visible<00:03:45.760> prototype<00:03:46.599> these<00:03:47.079> are<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.650> people

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
visible prototype these are the people

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.589 
visible prototype these are the people
i'm<00:03:48.190> going<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.459> see<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.910> kinds<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.269> enemies

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
i'm going to see the kinds of enemies

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.530 
i'm going to see the kinds of enemies
i'll<00:03:49.810> meet<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:51.190> experience<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.209> want<00:03:52.420> to

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
i'll meet the experience that I want to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.449 
i'll meet the experience that I want to
have<00:03:52.959> for<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.349> player<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.829> we<00:03:54.010> take<00:03:54.250> that

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
have for the player that we take that

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.440 
have for the player that we take that
video<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:57.220> can<00:03:57.370> basically<00:03:57.579> just<00:03:58.150> break

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
video and we can basically just break

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.970 
video and we can basically just break
that<00:03:58.480> down<00:03:58.840> into<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:59.230> series<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.709> different

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
that down into a series of different

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.190 
that down into a series of different
features<00:04:00.609> right<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.450> things<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:01.900> I'm<00:04:02.019> going

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
features right the things that I'm going

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.050 
features right the things that I'm going
to<00:04:02.290> need<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.470> be<00:04:02.709> able<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.040> give<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.609> the<00:04:03.730> coders

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
to need to be able to give to the coders

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.240

the the features that I need to be able
to<00:04:14.319> create<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.709> game<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.549> any<00:04:15.700> project<00:04:16.209> we

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
to create this game like any project we

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.120 
to create this game like any project we
start<00:04:16.959> with<00:04:17.109> ideas<00:04:17.440> and<00:04:17.470> then<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.950> first

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
start with ideas and then the first

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.509 
start with ideas and then the first
thing<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.549> want<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.789> do<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.239> prototype<00:04:20.519> key

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
thing you want to do is prototype key

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.540 
thing you want to do is prototype key
ideas<00:04:21.940> or<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.690> most<00:04:23.200> risky<00:04:23.740> ideas<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.340> need

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
ideas or the most risky ideas you need

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.969 
ideas or the most risky ideas you need
to<00:04:24.669> have<00:04:24.789> risk<00:04:25.450> to<00:04:25.750> be<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.380> be<00:04:26.470> lowered<00:04:26.800> right

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
to have risk to be to be lowered right

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.409 
to have risk to be to be lowered right
from<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.280> start<00:04:27.340> like<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.700> tree<00:04:27.880> navigation

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
from the start like the tree navigation

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.060 
from the start like the tree navigation
like<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.840> need<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.139> know<00:04:29.320> early<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.740> that

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
like you need to know early on that

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070 
like you need to know early on that
works<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.970> naval<00:04:31.300> battle<00:04:31.570> we<00:04:31.660> need<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.930> know

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
works the naval battle we need to know

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.260 
works the naval battle we need to know
early<00:04:32.320> on<00:04:32.349> networks<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.070> engine<00:04:33.789> side<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
early on networks on the engine side and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.730 
early on networks on the engine side and
on<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.389> gameplay<00:04:34.810> side<00:04:35.020> we<00:04:35.169> have<00:04:35.200> very<00:04:35.530> little

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
on the gameplay side we have very little

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.469 
on the gameplay side we have very little
at<00:04:35.919> this<00:04:36.070> point<00:04:36.340> we'll<00:04:36.610> have<00:04:36.820> essentially

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
at this point we'll have essentially

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.570 
at this point we'll have essentially
these<00:04:38.080> test<00:04:38.530> environments<00:04:39.130> where<00:04:39.280> you<00:04:39.400> have

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
these test environments where you have

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.460 
these test environments where you have
for<00:04:39.910> us<00:04:39.940> it's<00:04:40.180> just<00:04:40.240> like<00:04:40.510> an<00:04:40.660> orange<00:04:40.870> ground

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
for us it's just like an orange ground

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.680 
for us it's just like an orange ground
texture<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.250> has<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.400> black<00:04:42.880> grid<00:04:43.180> on<00:04:43.360> it<00:04:43.510> but

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
texture that has a black grid on it but

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.689 
texture that has a black grid on it but
tells<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.050> how<00:04:44.320> far<00:04:44.710> apart<00:04:44.860> things<00:04:45.280> are<00:04:45.460> and

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
tells you how far apart things are and

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.820 
tells you how far apart things are and
then<00:04:45.910> inside<00:04:46.300> that<00:04:46.630> will<00:04:46.930> test<00:04:47.139> absolutely

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
then inside that will test absolutely

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.560 
then inside that will test absolutely
everything<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.550> quick<00:04:48.849> prototypes<00:04:49.360> to

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
everything and do quick prototypes to

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.390 
everything and do quick prototypes to
try<00:04:49.810> out<00:04:49.930> some<00:04:50.139> ideas<00:04:50.229> see<00:04:50.710> what<00:04:50.889> works<00:04:51.160> see

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
try out some ideas see what works see

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.100 
try out some ideas see what works see
what<00:04:51.520> doesn't<00:04:51.820> work<00:04:51.970> decide<00:04:52.690> whether<00:04:53.020> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
what doesn't work decide whether a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.320 
what doesn't work decide whether a
feature<00:04:53.410> is<00:04:53.650> good<00:04:53.949> enough<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.430> use<00:04:54.729> and<00:04:55.090> good

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
feature is good enough to use and good

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.700 
feature is good enough to use and good
enough<00:04:55.510> to<00:04:55.630> build<00:04:55.840> and<00:04:56.050> it's<00:04:56.139> going<00:04:56.229> to<00:04:56.289> be<00:04:56.410> fun

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
enough to build and it's going to be fun

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.110 
enough to build and it's going to be fun
before<00:04:57.340> we<00:04:57.520> commit

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
before we commit

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.570 
before we commit
the<00:04:58.510> full<00:04:58.900> on<00:04:59.050> development<00:04:59.680> so<00:05:00.340> with<00:05:00.490> that

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
the full on development so with that

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.640 
the full on development so with that
came<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:01.150> lot<00:05:01.449> of<00:05:01.630> new<00:05:01.750> engine<00:05:02.050> technologies

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
came a lot of new engine technologies

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.890 
came a lot of new engine technologies
and<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.639> extent<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.030> we<00:05:04.240> consider<00:05:04.840> it

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
and to the extent that we consider it

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.780 
and to the extent that we consider it
essentially<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.470> completely<00:05:06.010> new<00:05:06.130> engine<00:05:06.400> we

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
essentially a completely new engine we

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.760 
essentially a completely new engine we
decided<00:05:07.270> to<00:05:07.389> build<00:05:08.139> a<00:05:08.290> new<00:05:08.320> engine<00:05:08.710> for

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
decided to build a new engine for

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.740 
decided to build a new engine for
Assassin's<00:05:09.610> Creed<00:05:09.760> 3<00:05:09.880> based<00:05:10.150> purely<00:05:10.570> on

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
Assassin's Creed 3 based purely on

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.140 
Assassin's Creed 3 based purely on
gameplay<00:05:11.290> so<00:05:12.010> obviously<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.790> hardware

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
gameplay so obviously the hardware

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.520 
gameplay so obviously the hardware
hasn't<00:05:13.419> changed<00:05:13.750> we<00:05:13.840> didn't<00:05:14.080> suddenly<00:05:14.199> find

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
hasn't changed we didn't suddenly find

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.500 
hasn't changed we didn't suddenly find
you<00:05:14.919> know<00:05:15.070> 80<00:05:15.370> mega<00:05:15.610> RAM<00:05:15.850> that<00:05:16.210> was<00:05:16.300> hidden

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
you know 80 mega RAM that was hidden

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.830 
you know 80 mega RAM that was hidden
away<00:05:16.630> in<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.530> 360<00:05:18.130> or<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.340> ps3<00:05:18.850> but<00:05:19.449> we're

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
away in the 360 or the ps3 but we're

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.409 
away in the 360 or the ps3 but we're
able<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.320> say<00:05:20.530> if<00:05:21.280> we<00:05:21.520> were<00:05:21.610> going<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:21.880> build<00:05:22.090> an

able to say if we were going to build an
engine<00:05:22.600> that<00:05:22.750> enabled<00:05:23.260> us<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.380> create<00:05:23.650> new

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
engine that enabled us to create new

content what would happen so nville next

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.900 
content what would happen so nville next
is<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.260> next<00:05:26.650> major<00:05:26.919> iteration<00:05:27.550> of<00:05:27.729> the

assassins creed engine the frontier is

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.370 
assassins creed engine the frontier is
the<00:05:30.280> number<00:05:30.820> one<00:05:30.970> motivation<00:05:31.330> to<00:05:31.660> do<00:05:31.840> until

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
the number one motivation to do until

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.689 
the number one motivation to do until
next<00:05:32.560> in<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.740> beginning<00:05:33.039> so<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.400> first<00:05:33.639> thing

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
next in the beginning so the first thing

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.060 
next in the beginning so the first thing
we<00:05:33.880> tried<00:05:34.120> was<00:05:34.389> can<00:05:35.110> we<00:05:35.289> make<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.620> forest<00:05:36.039> that

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
we tried was can we make a forest that

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.779 
we tried was can we make a forest that
looks<00:05:36.340> good<00:05:36.520> but<00:05:36.940> still<00:05:37.169> works<00:05:38.520> with<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> decent

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
looks good but still works with a decent

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.930 
looks good but still works with a decent
framerate<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.740> it<00:05:41.740> still<00:05:42.010> readable<00:05:42.280> from

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
framerate and it still readable from

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.550 
framerate and it still readable from
game<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:43.330> point<00:05:43.630> of<00:05:43.690> view<00:05:43.810> we<00:05:44.199> also<00:05:44.320> put<00:05:44.500> the

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
game to point of view we also put the

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.279 
game to point of view we also put the
type<00:05:44.710> stuff<00:05:44.949> like<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.699> deep<00:05:45.850> snow<00:05:45.970> came<00:05:46.449> with

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
type stuff like the deep snow came with

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:49.740 
type stuff like the deep snow came with
deformable<00:05:47.860> tracks<00:05:48.580> in<00:05:48.820> previous<00:05:49.330> games<00:05:49.479> we

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
deformable tracks in previous games we

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.779 
deformable tracks in previous games we
had<00:05:49.900> water<00:05:50.080> but<00:05:50.500> it<00:05:50.710> was<00:05:50.889> always<00:05:51.039> like<00:05:51.490> a

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
had water but it was always like a

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.370 
had water but it was always like a
straight<00:05:52.330> delimitation<00:05:52.870> between<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.199> water

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
straight delimitation between the water

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.980 
straight delimitation between the water
and<00:05:53.530> ground<00:05:54.280> now<00:05:54.550> it's<00:05:55.030> progressive<00:05:55.539> beaches

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
and ground now it's progressive beaches

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.490 
and ground now it's progressive beaches
so<00:05:56.940> what<00:05:57.940> do<00:05:58.000> we<00:05:58.090> do<00:05:58.210> with<00:05:58.389> fighting<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:59.229> that

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
so what do we do with fighting in that

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.560 
so what do we do with fighting in that
thing<00:05:59.740> with<00:05:59.919> with<00:06:00.100> knee-deep<00:06:00.340> snow<00:06:00.729> knee-deep

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
thing with with knee-deep snow knee-deep

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.710 
thing with with knee-deep snow knee-deep
water<00:06:02.220> animals<00:06:03.220> mixed<00:06:03.700> with<00:06:04.000> that<00:06:04.030> so<00:06:04.330> it<00:06:04.450> all

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
water animals mixed with that so it all

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.450 
water animals mixed with that so it all
came<00:06:04.960> from<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.620> first<00:06:05.830> prototypes<00:06:06.220> so

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
came from the first prototypes so

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.129 
came from the first prototypes so
another<00:06:06.729> big<00:06:06.970> challenge<00:06:07.150> that<00:06:07.450> came<00:06:07.660> pretty

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
another big challenge that came pretty

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.500 
another big challenge that came pretty
quickly<00:06:08.410> was<00:06:08.830> the<00:06:09.280> number<00:06:09.550> of<00:06:09.639> NPCs<00:06:10.060> on<00:06:10.210> screen

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
quickly was the number of NPCs on screen

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.339 
quickly was the number of NPCs on screen
both<00:06:11.470> for<00:06:11.800> battlefields<00:06:12.550> and<00:06:12.580> from<00:06:13.349> cities

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
both for battlefields and from cities

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.379 
both for battlefields and from cities
like<00:06:14.500> New<00:06:14.650> York<00:06:14.889> we<00:06:15.460> thought<00:06:15.729> we<00:06:15.880> can<00:06:16.090> cheat

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
like New York we thought we can cheat

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.409 
like New York we thought we can cheat
and<00:06:16.660> block<00:06:17.289> people's<00:06:18.130> line<00:06:18.370> of<00:06:18.460> sight<00:06:18.669> so<00:06:19.000> they

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
and block people's line of sight so they

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.589 
and block people's line of sight so they
don't<00:06:19.870> see<00:06:20.050> as<00:06:20.349> far<00:06:20.849> but<00:06:21.849> in<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.000> end<00:06:22.120> because

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 
don't see as far but in the end because

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.810 
don't see as far but in the end because
of<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:22.930> battlefields<00:06:23.650> we<00:06:23.770> also<00:06:23.919> had<00:06:24.340> another

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
of the battlefields we also had another

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.939 
of the battlefields we also had another
reason<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.479> develop<00:06:25.750> a<00:06:25.870> new<00:06:26.020> tech<00:06:26.289> that<00:06:26.770> now

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
reason to develop a new tech that now

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.879 
reason to develop a new tech that now
enables<00:06:27.430> us<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:27.610> render<00:06:28.030> over<00:06:28.330> 2,000<00:06:29.080> NPCs<00:06:29.800> at

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:29.889 
enables us to render over 2,000 NPCs at

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.219 
enables us to render over 2,000 NPCs at
once<00:06:30.099> and<00:06:31.000> we<00:06:31.150> use<00:06:31.270> the<00:06:31.360> same<00:06:31.539> tech<00:06:31.780> to<00:06:31.990> solve

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
once and we use the same tech to solve

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:34.350 
once and we use the same tech to solve
both<00:06:32.470> problems<00:06:32.580> we<00:06:33.580> didn't<00:06:33.940> find<00:06:34.090> all<00:06:34.240> the

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
both problems we didn't find all the

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.390 
both problems we didn't find all the
answers<00:06:34.479> back<00:06:34.840> then<00:06:35.110> but<00:06:35.380> we<00:06:35.919> have<00:06:36.220> a<00:06:36.250> lot<00:06:36.370> of

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
answers back then but we have a lot of

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.640 
answers back then but we have a lot of
questions<00:06:36.880> that<00:06:37.000> we<00:06:37.210> had<00:06:37.389> to<00:06:37.660> teach<00:06:37.930> answer<00:06:38.410> it

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
questions that we had to teach answer it

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.159 
questions that we had to teach answer it
took<00:06:38.860> maybe<00:06:39.010> a<00:06:39.190> year<00:06:39.370> and<00:06:39.490> a<00:06:39.550> half<00:06:39.729> to<00:06:40.180> finally

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
took maybe a year and a half to finally

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.339 
took maybe a year and a half to finally
say<00:06:41.590> yeah<00:06:41.949> I<00:06:41.979> think<00:06:42.310> we<00:06:42.550> have<00:06:42.789> a<00:06:42.940> recipe<00:06:43.120> or<00:06:43.810> the

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
say yeah I think we have a recipe or the

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:45.390 
say yeah I think we have a recipe or the
good<00:06:44.440> idea

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
good idea

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.900 
good idea
think<00:06:45.669> we're<00:06:45.850> gonna<00:06:45.940> make<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:50.699> coming<00:06:51.699> up<00:06:51.790> with

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
think we're gonna make it coming up with

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.700 
think we're gonna make it coming up with
how<00:06:52.030> kind<00:06:52.330> of<00:06:52.419> looked<00:06:52.690> i<00:06:52.900> think<00:06:53.229> was<00:06:53.380> one<00:06:53.650> of

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
how kind of looked i think was one of

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.469 
how kind of looked i think was one of
the<00:06:53.770> hardest<00:06:53.889> things<00:06:54.340> we<00:06:54.759> had<00:06:54.970> to<00:06:55.000> do<00:06:55.240> in<00:06:55.389> the

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:55.479 
the hardest things we had to do in the

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:57.900 
the hardest things we had to do in the
game<00:06:55.630> connor<00:06:56.020> is<00:06:56.350> our<00:06:56.680> main<00:06:56.830> hero<00:06:57.070> is<00:06:57.310> a<00:06:57.699> half

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
game connor is our main hero is a half

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.730 
game connor is our main hero is a half
Native<00:06:58.240> American<00:06:58.270> half<00:06:58.630> British<00:06:59.110> he<00:06:59.590> was

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
Native American half British he was

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.680
