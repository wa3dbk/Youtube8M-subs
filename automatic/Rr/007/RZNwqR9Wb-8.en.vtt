although it now is kind of old seeing as
how<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:27.789> this<00:01:27.970> played<00:01:28.240> through<00:01:28.450> pretty<00:01:28.599> much

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
how you this played through pretty much

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.510

the<00:01:28.899> exact<00:01:29.170> same<00:01:29.259> atmosphere<00:01:30.069> in<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.310> first

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
the exact same atmosphere in the first

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:58.750 
the exact same atmosphere in the first
game<00:01:30.819> but<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.690> still<00:01:32.020> works

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.330

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
make a lot of sense now in the first

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.760 
make a lot of sense now in the first
game<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.070> sub<00:02:04.550> boss<00:02:04.880> was<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.660> man<00:02:05.960> named<00:02:06.260> paxton
