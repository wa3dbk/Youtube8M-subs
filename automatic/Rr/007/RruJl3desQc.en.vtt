 Yes Today is urgent, but I will explain 2 blocks of serif maintenance 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:17.110
 It's a little long like this, but I have a question and if I'm short I just want to 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.460
 like this 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.460
 When sandwiching 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.490
 stop 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.280

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.660

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.210

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.140

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.110
 While short 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.110
 No way 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.860
 Look carefully 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.570
 There is a misunderstanding 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.530

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.569

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.400

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.630
 Dispensed this good woman is in high school clippers 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.650
 First of all 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.250
 then 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.250
 Polite and good 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.980
 The opposite is also true 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.560
 Kana drunk

 So as not to know 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.180
 If you can do it yourself 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.020
