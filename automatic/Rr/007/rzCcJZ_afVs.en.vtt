jams<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.049> make<00:01:16.229> sure<00:01:16.380> that's

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
jams you can just make sure that's

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.870 
jams you can just make sure that's
properly<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> place<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.470> clean<00:01:19.880> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
properly in place and do so clean and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.359 
properly in place and do so clean and
then<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> door<00:01:21.830> corresponding<00:01:22.830> area<00:01:23.130> just

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
then in the door corresponding area just

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.749 
then in the door corresponding area just
to<00:01:23.460> look<00:01:23.670> at<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> make<00:01:24.869> sure<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:26.430> just

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
to look at just to make sure is just

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.330 
to look at just to make sure is just
below<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:28.049> runners<00:01:28.950> you'll<00:01:29.130> see

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
below the other runners you'll see

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.210 
below the other runners you'll see
there's<00:01:29.549> an<00:01:29.810> optical<00:01:31.729> sensors<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.119> here<00:01:34.220> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
there's an optical sensors just here the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
there's an optical sensors just here the
three<00:01:35.490> rollers<00:01:35.700> here<00:01:36.770> one<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:38.750> three<00:01:39.750> if<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
three rollers here one two three if you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.560 
three rollers here one two three if you
can<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:40.799> between<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:42.000> underneath<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
can just on between just underneath the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.819 
can just on between just underneath the
second<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.649> this<00:01:49.649> actually

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
second one just this here this actually

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
second one just this here this actually
works<00:01:50.310> along<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.229> this<00:01:52.229> black<00:01:52.530> box<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.509> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
works along with this black box here and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.200 
works along with this black box here and
just<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> user<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.770> quite<00:01:56.100> easily

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
just as a user you can quite easily

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.160 
just as a user you can quite easily
double<00:01:57.210> check<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.659> sure<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:57.930> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
double check to make sure that's in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.060 
double check to make sure that's in
position<00:01:58.320> and<00:02:00.290> I'll<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.439> call<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> bit

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
position and I'll just call back a bit

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.700 
position and I'll just call back a bit
you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.509> where<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you can see where that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.050 
you can see where that
well<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.860> sensor<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:08.500> here<00:02:09.060> so

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
well that sensor is is this here so

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.300 
well that sensor is is this here so
double<00:02:10.420> check<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:10.750> if<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.230> do<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.890> e<00:02:11.920> 0

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
double check this if you do have the e 0

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.880 
double check this if you do have the e 0
4<00:02:12.730> 5<00:02:12.910> code<00:02:13.500> obviously<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:14.560> you're<00:02:14.680> not<00:02:14.800> an

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.750 
engineer and they call it doesn't go
away<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.140> have<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.530> call<00:02:18.250> your<00:02:18.400> service

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
away you have to call your service

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.840 
away you have to call your service
representative<00:02:19.890> what<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.100> should<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.610> do

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
representative what you should then do

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.400 
representative what you should then do
is<00:02:22.060> turn<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.990> Machine<00:02:23.290> off<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.800> then<00:02:24.520> on<00:02:25.410> just

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
is turn the Machine off and then on just

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.670 
is turn the Machine off and then on just
to<00:02:26.740> see<00:02:27.160> if<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.460> resets<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.780> code<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.530> may

to see if it resets the code you may

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.280 
to see if it resets the code you may
have<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:31.140> service<00:02:33.240> code<00:02:34.240> reset<00:02:34.780> if<00:02:35.140> you

have to do a service code reset if you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.350 
have to do a service code reset if you
do<00:02:35.730> this<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:36.970> process<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.910> code<00:02:40.120> doesn't

do this is the process the code doesn't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.240 
do this is the process the code doesn't
go<00:02:40.600> away<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.810> can't<00:02:41.200> rise<00:02:41.410> star<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:43.060> an<00:02:43.209> 8<00:02:43.360> star
