00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.159 
learn how to do this very fast they are
only<00:06:09.550> range<00:06:10.060> you<00:06:10.240> cannot<00:06:10.450> use<00:06:10.600> majors<00:06:11.020> I've

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
only range you cannot use majors I've

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.100 
only range you cannot use majors I've
mentioned<00:06:11.350> already<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.150> I<00:06:13.150> think<00:06:13.479> that<00:06:13.660> is<00:06:13.690> it

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
mentioned already and I think that is it

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.420 
mentioned already and I think that is it
or<00:06:14.560> the<00:06:15.010> experience<00:06:15.550> is<00:06:15.700> 150<00:06:16.600> k<00:06:16.810> in<00:06:17.110> range<00:06:18.070> and

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
or the experience is 150 k in range and

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.570 
or the experience is 150 k in range and
around<00:06:19.060> 40k<00:06:19.600> in<00:06:20.280> constitution<00:06:21.280> so<00:06:21.460> it's

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
around 40k in constitution so it's

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.150 
around 40k in constitution so it's
around<00:06:21.760> 200<00:06:22.330> k<00:06:22.510> experience<00:06:23.200> per<00:06:23.290> hour<00:06:23.470> or<00:06:23.800> so

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
around 200 k experience per hour or so

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.090 
around 200 k experience per hour or so
so<00:06:24.760> this<00:06:24.880> method<00:06:25.090> is<00:06:25.510> also<00:06:26.010> quite<00:06:27.010> good

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
so this method is also quite good

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.710 
so this method is also quite good
