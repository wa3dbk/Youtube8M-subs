00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
that I designed and it's a little

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.460 
that I designed and it's a little
smaller<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.270> standard<00:00:21.779> Chinese<00:00:22.230> knife

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
smaller than a standard Chinese knife

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.519 
smaller than a standard Chinese knife

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
you'll notice that generally I really

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.269 
you'll notice that generally I really
try<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.810> call<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> knife<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
try to call it a knife because it is a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.749 
try to call it a knife because it is a
chef's<00:00:29.670> knife<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.510> cutting<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.460> dicing<00:00:32.460> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
not for chopping bones the proper way to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.610 
not for chopping bones the proper way to
hold<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.300> knife<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.780> actually<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
hold a knife is actually here at the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
hold a knife is actually here at the
bolster<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.969> your<00:00:39.149> thumb<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.390> one

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
bolster so you have your thumb on one

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
bolster so you have your thumb on one
side<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.559> finger<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.579> other<00:00:41.790> side<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
side and the finger on the other side of

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.330 
side and the finger on the other side of
the<00:00:42.420> knife<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.160> knife

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the knife and this is because the knife

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
the knife and this is because the knife
is<00:00:44.610> squared<00:00:44.969> off<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:45.930> bit

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is squared off so it's a little bit

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.200 
is squared off so it's a little bit
heavier<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.739> front<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.250> by<00:00:47.670> moving<00:00:48.030> your

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
heavier in the front and by moving your

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.990 
heavier in the front and by moving your
hand<00:00:48.450> forward<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.469> gives<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> more<00:00:50.789> balance

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hand forward it gives you more balance

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.380 
hand forward it gives you more balance
and<00:00:51.449> more<00:00:51.629> strength<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:53.010> sharp

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
and more strength it's very sharp

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.380 
and more strength it's very sharp
stainless<00:00:54.390> steel<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.960> don't<00:00:55.620> recommend

handle that's brushed so it's not

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.210 
handle that's brushed so it's not
slippery<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.299> not<00:01:06.510> absorb<00:01:06.689> odors<00:01:07.590> or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a spatula pick up the pieces and then

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.990 
a spatula pick up the pieces and then
move<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.780> dish<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.740> bowl<00:01:44.100> whatever<00:01:44.790> you're

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
going to be using and then of course we

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.630 
going to be using and then of course we
can<00:01:50.670> cut<00:01:50.820> vegetables<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> zucchini<00:01:52.680> with

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
can cut vegetables like a zucchini with

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
can cut vegetables like a zucchini with
the<00:01:53.759> zucchini<00:01:54.119> we're<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> take<00:01:55.530> off

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the zucchini we're going to take off

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.859 
the zucchini we're going to take off
both<00:01:56.490> ends<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:58.430> then<00:01:59.430> what<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
both ends and then what I like to do is

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.719 
both ends and then what I like to do is
split<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.979> half

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.149 

and<00:02:04.990> then<00:02:05.990> we're<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.500> cut<00:02:06.710> them<00:02:06.920> in

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
and then we're going to cut them in

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.979 
and then we're going to cut them in
pieces<00:02:07.220> now<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.090> left<00:02:08.420> hand<00:02:08.660> should<00:02:08.810> always

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
pieces now the left hand should always

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.290 
pieces now the left hand should always
be<00:02:09.289> slightly<00:02:10.039> curved<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.789> fingertips

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
be slightly curved with the fingertips

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.640 
be slightly curved with the fingertips
under<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:11.840> knuckle<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.660> there's<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
under your knuckle and there's the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.530 
under your knuckle and there's the
zucchini<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.780> think<00:02:20.780> you'll<00:02:20.900> find<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
zucchini I think you'll find that the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.370 
zucchini I think you'll find that the
the<00:02:24.140> Chinese<00:02:24.590> knife<00:02:24.890> will<00:02:25.730> really<00:02:26.209> be<00:02:26.510> easy<00:02:27.020> to
