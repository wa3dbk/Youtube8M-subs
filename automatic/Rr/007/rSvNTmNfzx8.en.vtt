we'll<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> run<00:02:15.249> on<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.489> outside<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:17.140> this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
we'll do a run on the outside for this

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.340 
we'll do a run on the outside for this
one<00:02:17.499> here<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:19.510> just<00:02:20.019> continue<00:02:20.439> it<00:02:20.560> around

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
one here and just continue it around

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.970 
one here and just continue it around
oh<00:02:22.600> that<00:02:23.600> one<00:02:23.720> there<00:02:23.870> right<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.650> what

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
oh that one there right so what

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.100 
oh that one there right so what
classifier<00:02:25.790> be<00:02:25.880> cable<00:02:26.150> going<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.540> all<00:02:26.960> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
classifier be cable going to all the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.530 
classifier be cable going to all the
engines<00:02:28.090> already<00:02:29.090> got<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.210> power<00:02:29.390> supply

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
engines already got a power supply

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.850 
engines already got a power supply
hooked<00:02:29.990> up<00:02:30.140> here<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:32.390> mfsu<00:02:32.840> hooked<00:02:33.500> up<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:33.830> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
hooked up here and mfsu hooked up to a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.580 
hooked up here and mfsu hooked up to a
solar<00:02:34.100> panel<00:02:34.690> now<00:02:35.690> I'll<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:35.900> run<00:02:36.230> out<00:02:36.410> of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
solar panel now I'll just run out of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:45.790 
solar panel now I'll just run out of
here<00:02:40.690> Thank<00:02:41.690> You<00:02:41.750> farthing<00:02:44.410> yeah<00:02:45.410> what<00:02:45.590> Denis

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
here Thank You farthing yeah what Denis

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.420 
here Thank You farthing yeah what Denis
ah<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> we've<00:02:47.840> got<00:02:48.020> power

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
ah so we've got power

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.890 
ah so we've got power
obviously<00:02:50.209> it's<00:02:50.300> time<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.480> be<00:02:50.540> kicking<00:02:50.780> out

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
obviously it's time to be kicking out

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.310 
obviously it's time to be kicking out
everywhere<00:02:51.430> some<00:02:52.430> servers<00:02:53.080> disabled<00:02:54.080> pipes

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
everywhere some servers disabled pipes

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.830 
everywhere some servers disabled pipes
so<00:02:55.070> you<00:02:55.160> can<00:02:55.280> use<00:02:55.430> phenomics<00:02:56.209> tubes

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
so you can use phenomics tubes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.890 
so you can use phenomics tubes
I<00:02:56.870> believe<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:57.410> cool<00:02:58.270> if<00:02:59.270> your<00:02:59.480> pipes<00:02:59.660> have

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
I believe it's cool if your pipes have

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.020 
I believe it's cool if your pipes have
been<00:03:00.050> disabled<00:03:00.530> cutting<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.670> standard

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
been disabled cutting that the standard

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.740 
been disabled cutting that the standard
feed<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.330> beast<00:03:03.459> client<00:03:04.459> will<00:03:04.850> run<00:03:05.000> this<00:03:07.750> yeah

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
feed the beast client will run this yeah

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.199 
feed the beast client will run this yeah
put<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.230> few<00:03:09.440> out<00:03:09.560> here<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:13.459> can<00:03:13.610> use<00:03:13.730> chess

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
put a few out here so you can use chess

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.160 
put a few out here so you can use chess
on<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.600> site<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.910> want<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.150> run<00:03:17.330> your

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
on the site but if you want to run your

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.820 
on the site but if you want to run your
storage<00:03:18.560> back<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.340> your<00:03:20.300> main<00:03:20.450> base<00:03:20.830> obviously

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
storage back to your main base obviously

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.590 
storage back to your main base obviously
you<00:03:21.890> can<00:03:22.010> use<00:03:22.040> ender<00:03:22.430> chests<00:03:22.760> took<00:03:23.209> them<00:03:23.450> up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.120 

over<00:03:26.600> yeah<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.170> think<00:03:27.230> this<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.470> easy<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.980> stay

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
over yeah I think this is easy to stay

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.880 
over yeah I think this is easy to stay
like<00:03:28.340> this<00:03:29.049> just<00:03:30.049> just<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.470> show<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:30.680> guys<00:03:30.830> how

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
like this just just to show you guys how

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.250 
like this just just to show you guys how
it's<00:03:31.280> running<00:03:31.489> all<00:03:32.209> right<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:32.630> now<00:03:32.810> this<00:03:33.200> is

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
it's running all right so now this is

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.530 
it's running all right so now this is
the<00:03:33.410> basic<00:03:33.830> setup<00:03:34.130> right<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.239> about<00:03:35.299> full

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
the basic setup right so about full

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.759 
the basic setup right so about full

electric Bruce - you need two of them in
here<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:21.100> then<00:04:22.100> we<00:04:22.220> just<00:04:22.250> put<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.550> circuit

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
here and then we just put a circuit

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270 
here and then we just put a circuit
board<00:04:23.030> there<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.720> we<00:04:24.560> can<00:04:24.710> see<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.919> makes<00:04:25.100> it

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
board there and we can see it makes it

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.339 
board there and we can see it makes it
so<00:04:26.180> um<00:04:26.479> go<00:04:27.350> ahead<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.680> we<00:04:28.160> need<00:04:28.310> for<00:04:28.850> all<00:04:29.090> up<00:04:29.349> so

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
so um go ahead and we need for all up so

so um go ahead and we need for all up so
I'll<00:04:30.500> put<00:04:31.220> another<00:04:31.340> one<00:04:31.610> there<00:04:32.000> you<00:04:32.660> have<00:04:32.780> to

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
I'll put another one there you have to

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.180 
I'll put another one there you have to
take<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.200> one<00:04:33.320> out

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
take that one out

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.540 
take that one out
on<00:04:35.150> there<00:04:35.390> take<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.110> one<00:04:36.260> out<00:04:36.290> two<00:04:37.190> three

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
on there take that one out two three

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.900 
on there take that one out two three
and<00:04:40.550> there's<00:04:41.090> our<00:04:41.210> fourth<00:04:41.830> all<00:04:42.830> right<00:04:43.040> so

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
and there's our fourth all right so

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.280 
and there's our fourth all right so
while<00:04:44.120> we<00:04:44.240> don't<00:04:44.360> need<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:45.800> anymore

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
while we don't need that anymore

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.540 
while we don't need that anymore
we'll<00:04:48.290> just<00:04:48.410> put<00:04:48.620> that<00:04:48.650> there

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
we'll just put that there

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.090 
we'll just put that there
move<00:04:49.970> over<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.390> our<00:04:50.590> electrical<00:04:51.590> engines<00:04:51.860> and

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
move over to our electrical engines and

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.950 
move over to our electrical engines and
one<00:04:52.670> of<00:04:52.760> these<00:04:52.880> enhanced<00:04:53.360> circuit<00:04:53.660> boards

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
one of these enhanced circuit boards

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.920 
one of these enhanced circuit boards
basically<00:04:54.350> this<00:04:54.500> increases<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.360> input<00:04:56.360> and

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
basically this increases the input and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.960 
basically this increases the input and
output<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:58.520> power<00:04:58.880> that<00:04:59.270> it<00:04:59.420> generates<00:05:00.100> on<00:05:01.100> its

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
output of power that it generates on its

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.060 
output of power that it generates on its
a<00:05:02.060> second<00:05:02.360> level<00:05:02.600> so<00:05:02.780> you<00:05:02.870> can<00:05:02.990> see<00:05:03.200> it

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
a second level so you can see it

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.820 
a second level so you can see it
increases<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.780> intake<00:05:06.110> and<00:05:06.140> our<00:05:06.350> take<00:05:06.560> twice

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
increases the intake and our take twice

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:13.630 
increases the intake and our take twice
over<00:05:07.040> so<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.030> put<00:05:08.510> one<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.110> there<00:05:12.040> and<00:05:13.040> I<00:05:13.400> think<00:05:13.580> I

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
over so I put one in there and I think I

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.510 
over so I put one in there and I think I
just<00:05:13.670> don't<00:05:13.940> go<00:05:14.120> for<00:05:14.180> in<00:05:14.420> there<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:16.360> creative

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
just don't go for in there and creative

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.060 
just don't go for in there and creative
yeah<00:05:19.610> Maxima<00:05:20.560> obviously<00:05:21.560> because<00:05:21.830> I'm<00:05:21.920> in

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
yeah Maxima obviously because I'm in

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.040 
yeah Maxima obviously because I'm in
creative<00:05:22.460> mode<00:05:22.490> I<00:05:22.820> just<00:05:23.120> lost<00:05:23.300> all<00:05:23.480> four<00:05:24.020> of

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
creative mode I just lost all four of

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.910 
creative mode I just lost all four of
them<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:26.710> I'll<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:27.890> make<00:05:28.040> a<00:05:28.100> few<00:05:28.220> more<00:05:29.920> keep

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
them so I'll just make a few more keep

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.100 
them so I'll just make a few more keep
them<00:05:31.100> separate<00:05:31.460> this<00:05:31.610> time<00:05:37.210> right<00:05:38.210> so<00:05:38.960> now<00:05:39.050> we

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
them separate this time right so now we

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:49.010 
them separate this time right so now we
have<00:05:39.700> another<00:05:40.700> three

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:06:00.379 

so<00:05:50.020> we<00:05:50.110> go<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:50.199> our<00:05:50.350> next<00:05:50.590> one<00:05:50.910> put<00:05:51.910> in<00:05:52.060> there

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.450 

all<00:06:01.389> right<00:06:01.509> so<00:06:02.440> now<00:06:02.800> they've<00:06:02.979> all<00:06:03.130> got<00:06:03.310> an

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
all right so now they've all got an

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.740 
all right so now they've all got an
enhanced<00:06:04.000> circuit<00:06:04.960> board<00:06:05.139> in<00:06:05.320> each<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.680> them

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
enhanced circuit board in each of them

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.800 
enhanced circuit board in each of them
to<00:06:07.750> basically<00:06:08.380> increase<00:06:09.009> the<00:06:09.220> power<00:06:09.400> outage

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
to basically increase the power outage

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.279 
to basically increase the power outage
our<00:06:11.100> input<00:06:12.100> and<00:06:12.310> output<00:06:12.699> for<00:06:12.880> each<00:06:13.180> one<00:06:13.389> I'll

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
our input and output for each one I'll

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.510 
our input and output for each one I'll
go<00:06:14.440> ahead<00:06:14.500> and<00:06:14.710> start<00:06:14.919> them<00:06:15.100> because<00:06:15.430> they

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
go ahead and start them because they

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.270 
go ahead and start them because they
need<00:06:15.639> a<00:06:15.699> little<00:06:15.970> bit<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:16.180> time<00:06:16.330> to<00:06:16.539> warm<00:06:16.780> up<00:06:17.070> now

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.850 

the<00:06:21.280> engines<00:06:21.580> will<00:06:21.759> start<00:06:22.000> off<00:06:22.090> blue<00:06:22.990> then<00:06:23.740> go

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
the engines will start off blue then go

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.029 
the engines will start off blue then go
to<00:06:23.919> yellow<00:06:24.250> then<00:06:25.060> finally<00:06:25.509> to<00:06:25.660> red<00:06:25.870> now<00:06:26.770> it

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
to yellow then finally to red now it

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.689 
to yellow then finally to red now it
will<00:06:27.250> run<00:06:27.490> on<00:06:27.610> red<00:06:28.710> but<00:06:29.710> not<00:06:30.220> overheat

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
will run on red but not overheat

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:32.070 
will run on red but not overheat
obviously<00:06:31.240> electrical<00:06:31.570> engines<00:06:31.810> when<00:06:31.990> they

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
obviously electrical engines when they

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.700 
obviously electrical engines when they
overheat<00:06:32.440> will<00:06:32.620> shut<00:06:32.830> down<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:35.020> core<00:06:35.259> uses

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
overheat will shut down the core uses

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.670 
overheat will shut down the core uses
enough<00:06:35.949> power<00:06:36.479> while<00:06:37.479> it's<00:06:37.660> running<00:06:37.840> to<00:06:38.470> keep

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
enough power while it's running to keep

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.170 
enough power while it's running to keep
it<00:06:38.830> at<00:06:39.789> a<00:06:39.900> maximum<00:06:40.900> of<00:06:41.099> 255<00:06:42.180> degrees

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
it at a maximum of 255 degrees

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.540 
it at a maximum of 255 degrees
centigrade<00:06:43.889> you<00:06:44.889> can<00:06:45.009> see<00:06:45.130> it<00:06:45.220> starting<00:06:45.520> to

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
centigrade you can see it starting to

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.439 
centigrade you can see it starting to
warm<00:06:45.820> up<00:06:45.940> now<00:06:47.669> it's<00:06:48.669> already<00:06:48.820> made<00:06:49.060> its<00:06:49.210> frame

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449 
warm up now it's already made its frame

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.439 
warm up now it's already made its frame
and<00:06:51.030> even<00:06:52.030> without<00:06:52.180> it<00:06:52.830> fully<00:06:53.830> operating<00:06:54.449> you

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:55.449 
and even without it fully operating you

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:57.300 
and even without it fully operating you
can<00:06:55.599> only<00:06:55.750> start<00:06:56.110> to<00:06:56.260> see<00:06:56.440> how<00:06:56.889> quick<00:06:57.159> it

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
can only start to see how quick it

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.070 
can only start to see how quick it
actually<00:06:57.669> is<00:06:59.400> compared<00:07:00.400> to<00:07:00.580> just<00:07:00.729> just

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
actually is compared to just just

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.250 
actually is compared to just just
standard<00:07:02.080> build<00:07:02.349> I<00:07:02.530> suppose<00:07:03.870> we'll<00:07:04.870> just<00:07:05.020> wait

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
standard build I suppose we'll just wait

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.060 
standard build I suppose we'll just wait
just<00:07:05.289> a<00:07:05.590> little<00:07:05.979> bit<00:07:06.099> longer<00:07:06.520> for<00:07:07.889> this<00:07:08.889> to

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
just a little bit longer for this to

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.529 
just a little bit longer for this to
warm<00:07:09.250> up<00:07:11.099> see<00:07:12.099> the<00:07:12.130> output<00:07:12.520> is<00:07:12.669> actually<00:07:12.849> at<00:07:13.180> 10

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
warm up see the output is actually at 10

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.219 
warm up see the output is actually at 10
MJ<00:07:14.050> per<00:07:14.260> tick<00:07:15.690> let's<00:07:16.690> do<00:07:16.810> it<00:07:16.930> a<00:07:16.960> little<00:07:17.050> bit

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
MJ per tick let's do it a little bit

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:20.010 
MJ per tick let's do it a little bit
while<00:07:17.440> to<00:07:17.590> go<00:07:18.150> you<00:07:19.150> can<00:07:19.270> see<00:07:19.419> it's<00:07:19.539> using<00:07:19.750> up

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020 
while to go you can see it's using up

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.779 
while to go you can see it's using up
all<00:07:20.680> of<00:07:21.159> its<00:07:21.250> stored<00:07:21.699> energy<00:07:23.460> that's<00:07:24.460> what<00:07:24.699> you

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:24.789 
all of its stored energy that's what you

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.080 
all of its stored energy that's what you
want<00:07:24.970> basically<00:07:25.449> is<00:07:25.659> it<00:07:25.870> to<00:07:25.990> use<00:07:26.169> as<00:07:26.380> much<00:07:26.680> or

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
want basically is it to use as much or

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.339 
want basically is it to use as much or
pretty<00:07:28.090> much<00:07:28.120> all<00:07:28.389> of<00:07:28.419> the<00:07:28.659> energy<00:07:29.050> that<00:07:29.080> it's

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:29.349 
pretty much all of the energy that it's

00:07:29.349 --> 00:07:34.490 
pretty much all of the energy that it's
creating<00:07:29.970> so<00:07:30.970> it<00:07:31.090> doesn't<00:07:31.300> overheat

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.589 

well<00:07:35.789> yes<00:07:36.789> pretty<00:07:37.060> much<00:07:37.150> guys

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 
well yes pretty much guys

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.320 
well yes pretty much guys
that's<00:07:37.960> um<00:07:38.320> that's<00:07:38.789> pretty<00:07:39.789> much<00:07:39.970> how<00:07:40.090> you<00:07:40.120> do

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:40.330 
that's um that's pretty much how you do

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.350 
that's um that's pretty much how you do
it<00:07:40.449> so<00:07:40.599> I've<00:07:41.320> got<00:07:41.440> four<00:07:41.620> illogical<00:07:41.979> in<00:07:42.099> it

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
it so I've got four illogical in it

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.890 
it so I've got four illogical in it
engines<00:07:43.360> all<00:07:44.349> within<00:07:44.620> hence<00:07:44.919> circuit<00:07:45.280> boards

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
engines all within hence circuit boards

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:53.879 
engines all within hence circuit boards
-<00:07:48.630> and<00:07:49.630> yeah<00:07:50.139> that's<00:07:50.979> pretty<00:07:51.159> much<00:07:51.280> it<00:07:52.889> now

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:53.889 
- and yeah that's pretty much it now
