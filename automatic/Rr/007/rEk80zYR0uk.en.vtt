just like this really really really

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.980 
just like this really really really
complicated<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> medium-sized

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
complicated so this is the medium-sized

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.200 
complicated so this is the medium-sized
flag<00:01:43.320> um<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.070> should<00:01:44.280> use<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.820> smaller

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210

ones then red white and red then to do
curving<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.759> basically<00:02:03.259> yeah<00:02:04.259> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
curving you can just basically yeah just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.459 
curving you can just basically yeah just
one<00:02:05.219> tip<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:06.240> flag<00:02:06.479> should<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.840> facing<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
one tip the flag should be facing the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.930 
one tip the flag should be facing the
direction<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:08.129> clouds<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.610> because

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
direction the clouds are going because

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.100 
direction the clouds are going because
that<00:02:09.209> looks<00:02:09.390> realistic<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.760> then

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that looks realistic and then

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.340 
that looks realistic and then
like<00:02:14.110> again<00:02:16.380> then<00:02:17.380> one<00:02:18.220> up<00:02:18.460> with<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.350> next
