00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 Zdarova Gleb with you and a few weeks 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.990
 back I purchased a new device 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:15.059
 This is ipad mini with retina display version 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 32 gigabytes without a 3g module 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.600
 wonderful device purchased on 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.900
 replace your ipod touch fifth 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 generation fifth sensor sold and and fag 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 mini with retina and bought and let's in this 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.510
 I will tell the video how relevant 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.329
 take this device now and is it worth 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.190
 take it at all 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.829
 ipad mini retina was released at the end 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.010
 2013 installed in it the same 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.270
 processor like in iphone 5s apple a7 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.670
 on 64-bit architecture 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.039
 which is still quite relevant and will be 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 relevant in the next three years 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.129
 I had another choice in front of me thinking to buy 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.500
 The usual ipad mini that is by visually 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 of the display, but considered that the device is already 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.970
 not entirely new as I drag 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 The fifth generation was a processor by again 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.390
 and in the first generation ipads not 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.970
 builder 1000 processor and I counted 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.310
 what not to assemble the device then remove it 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.909
 on prospect so she was there not on 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.200
 year how much more will be relevant approximately 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.360
 apple a5 processor 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 it's some more time 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.509
 so we decided to take a newer 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.790
 the device will now talk about volume 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.740
 memory, many can not decide on 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.170
 that is 16 32 or 64 gigabytes 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 all this is very individual that is you 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 need to understand how you will use 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 device if you want to just sit 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240
 on the Internet, then you are quite enough 16 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.020
 gigabyte 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.659
 if you want to install some 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.299
 application powerful games like real 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.250
 racing 3 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.020
 info speed most wanted gide san andreas 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.270
 there 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 haldir about and everybody and so on there 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.050
 download the program ibooks jacket 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.239
 garageband throw us throw and so on 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.250
 then of course you will need more 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.879
 places and so i would recommend 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.739
 32 gigabyte version since it 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.129
 there will be more 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.430
 you fit and you will not worry 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:28.040
 there is not enough space 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.580
 places for the new application a in the old 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.590
 still want to use well 64 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.690
 gigabyte of course i recommended 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.500
 those people who often travel they 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.599
 want to be on the road full 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.450
 multimedia harvester that will 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.840
 contain both movies and a lot of music and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 many applications and and will entertain them 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.190
 on the road but version 128 gigabytes do not know 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.140
 Of course who needs but there are people who 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.290
 use such versions 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.180
 and of course if you are sure that 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.090
 do you want to download your tablet by 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.829
 the maximum is about the same as 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.910
 computer I'm exaggerating a little less 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:13.100
 then maybe you should take 128 gigabytes 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.420
 however, I can confidently tell you 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.720
 say i was driving 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.690
 your fifth generation ipod touch almost 2 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.930
 years and I have 32 gigabytes enough for the eyes 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.090
 and on ipade blowjob still the same picture i 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.100
 considered that 16 gigabytes is still 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.720
 little if you take the device on 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.489
 perspective if took 32 gigabytes then 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.340
 you have to be all at your fingertips the most 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.060
 necessary social network application and so 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.750
 Further, now we decide on whether 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.109
 2g version to buy or Wi fi it if I 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.480
 still decided to abandon the version 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:52.310
 3g because it costs more I 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.940
 I usually use the Internet only 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.500
 at home and at home I have Wi-Fi and, as it were, 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.280
 home internet we are only for him 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.970
 disburse 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.829
 and all and additionally pay more 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.349
 for one internet I see no point 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.940
 since I will use well, purely in 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.460
 transport can be in transport 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.380
 play toys after 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.100
 music to watch some programs and 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.570
 so on well if of course you often donâ€™t 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.630
 staying at home and you need to have 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.910
 constant internet access at hand 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.090
 I recommend to look at the 3g version 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.580
 if you have an iphone or some 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.270
 I recommend another smartphone 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.550
 3g version and using your smartphone 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.680
 distribute Wi-Fi on a tablet like this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.480
 way you will save another 130 dollars 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.250
 on the purchase version but at the same time you have 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.090
 the internet will always be at hand but it 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.060
 in the presence of 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.320
 if you have a smartphone that supports 3g 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.540
 module well, and if it's worth choosing to take 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.150
 or ipad mini with retina where to wait 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.850
 When will the new ipad be released in November 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.520
 then I recommend to take now mini retina 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.860
 because the device is very advanced 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:07.480
 very functional when ipad comes out 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.690
 mini 3 generations first pass 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.370
 two months before his presentation later 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.590
 a certain amount of time will pass 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.050
 after it gets cheaper and about 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.350
 in seven or eight months you can 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.990
 buy this device so i'm all type 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.250
 I recommend to take things now he is great 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.790
 he will make you happy 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.680
 All the charms of Ayu are here and not a tablet 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.560
 just super so I recommend to everyone 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.930
 This tablet Well, you subscribe to
