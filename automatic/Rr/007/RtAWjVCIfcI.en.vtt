00:00:00.679 --> 00:00:04.770
 waste is everywhere in the riverbed in the inmates of the 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.530
 large houses in the water mailboxes in the homes the small are many 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.169
 amounts the truth is that they are there messing up the city 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
 Arequipa Galician and lie even though he 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.569
 this World Cup took away the parade ground as can be seen 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.640
 we would follow the market 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.169
 to all places 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.980
 Arequipa are not 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.039
 It always has places where garbage is thrown 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.590
 the one that did not want to go into consciousness 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.750
 why 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.730
 a right depends on the future 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.080
 but this you take away a clean city 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.180
 Radio 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.899
 Such data is going on here, there are people who vote trash in Tetouan street 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.910
 it is not to keep clean 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 you work in the square and many people who vote people 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.569
 the atlante 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.870
 I feel like efe / tpc have 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.110
 for the room he fills his mouth i 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.210
 the nation 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.050
 I think that team will not be clean 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.350
 good yes miss america caribbean but after 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.470
 of news is going to be like before right now for independent I think it is quito 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.980
 it's a clean city 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.860
 p if it is a very clean city it is very white clarified it is a very beautiful city 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.509
 do not 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.590
 opposite opinions and is that many streets may look clean but more 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.110
 beyond the center of the city 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.030
 some dirty reality crap for heaps that does not get treated 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.180
 any 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.260
 Every day in Arequipa 700 tons of garbage are generated, most of it goes to 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.670
 stop to open dumps the districts that produce the most garbage are 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 cerro colorado fenced josé luis bustamante and rivero taína ito potato 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.240
 it is estimated that up to 120 tons are produced in the senate today 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.329
 of garbage 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.560
 that mostly collected by the cleaning workers they have the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.790
 titanic work to keep the city as dirty as possible 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.110
 we have already passed in two are twice power 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.460
 generally they say everything to the population the antros abasolo removed 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.870
 it was always from the fingers that those who have been suffering from 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.960
 the fingers to constantly see all four of the morning four-monthly 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.580
 I started to go out 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.970
 until six in the morning and I hope that he is also present delivery 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.879
 but what I know of what 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.639
 when six and a half remain would be again against the mounds of 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.099
 alcohol among other characters attended store is in that they open late 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.059
 that's what he gets most of all 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.119
 so, in the end, I count as acid 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.469
 good to have to suffer an accident sd 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.669
 tell me who the knee part 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:43.749
 the success 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.889
 At night and early morning, the streets turn into real dumps and 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.639
 of course there are areas where the situation is more complicated 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:55.609
 which are the dirtiest areas of the city, most of all the arena of the arena 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.459
 high mendoza juan de dios or calle de figuerola paro or heavy 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.449
 If he sells all that place, we're faced 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.749
 the Aragonese 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:07.809
 as well as the products on those in the streets 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:12.329
 the cleaning staff is not able to cope with so much garbage even though the service 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.959
 It is operational 24 hours 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.749
 or in large cities published for lack of mobility those machines 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:22.529
 It gives me that discount leaving Korea 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:25.399
 2 - no 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:30.719
 but previously the drivers who do not respect anything less than 2 4 times and 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.839
 it's much bigger in the world in the city 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:34.980
 nowadays 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.780
 there is a temporary sanitary landfill that is in hard where they are 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.069
 buried 100 tons of garbage and given other treatments in addition to 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.819
 fenced from next Monday this landfill will also be used 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.879
 by other districts 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.459
 case no longer saves 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.459
 much more chará cardboard 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.839
 vuoso hut also 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:01.939
 this way they're going to start and do the final diffusion in the fill 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.129
 sanitary is not from Monday that is a good 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.199
 it may sound like a big breakthrough 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.499
 there has been no I would like to indicate that 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.939
 for the most part the mayors 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.819
 have really become aware 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.819
 that the conservation of the environment is fundamental 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.990
 the formal landfill project is still in the profile stage 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.990
 in the technical file ready it will take several months for now this morning 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.800
 two compactors were delivered by civil society green hill 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.719
 that will serve for this project 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.199
 what we need is 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.810
 this and equip it with greater equity greater a pool of special machinery and we are 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:46.240
 in a new front loader 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.289
 tractors a tank car because you have to 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.620
 We also want to buy a piece of equipment to generate electric power for greater 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.620
 security and also the tree planting campaign 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.469
 in the sanitary landfill preserve that according to the authorities the day to a large extent 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.059
 the solution to the problem of garbage in Arequipa 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:10.519
 there are also opposing positions such as the refusal of the yura commune 

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:13.650
 that is installed in your jurisdiction 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.639
 the drawbacks culture 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.059
 good leather you can have thousands of problems with them you can ask 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.889
 the highest authority according to the law that is the honorable provincial council 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:27.539
 and the provincial ordinances have 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.449
 and superiority against a district ordinance the landfill 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.349
 of this year 2000 2002 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.300
 is assigned more than 240 hectares for a sanitary landfill 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.490
 patient 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.310
 politically they wanted to do some problem but it does not proceed because the fault 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.240
 has come out in favor of the municipality 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.880
 but as citizens 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.800
 we do not do much to help, we throw garbage, we generate and measure ourselves 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:59.339
 recycling béticos 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:00.800
 mrs 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.779
 know what recycling is imminent 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.289
 the geopolitical framework with a trash can some kind of engine like honda 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.789
 co motor 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.360
 in practice sr 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.539
 good time and with serious work and 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.710
 I repeat until the recycling 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.710
 we do not 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.560
 it has been given because 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.569
 I do not have I do not know I do not have time 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.310
 others 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.930
 however they have seen in the garbage a possibility to obtain some income 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.529
 our goal exceeds has learned is there is doing not also 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.089
 press aside the bottles on the other side and the papers on the other side and so on 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.089
 successively that's why when it separates us 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.490
 when the bottles sometimes when a gift is presented but also to 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.270
 the junk dealers and I sell it by kilo 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.830
 recycling practices 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.249
 the one of san juan 

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:52.599
 how is that 

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:54.030
 that to gain speed 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.720
 Bethlehem what you are doing now you are also working in my house so that 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.369
 these patients 

00:07:00.369 --> 00:07:03.159
 apart from the classic bags 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:04.809
 with that material 

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:06.550
 guarani armed beni 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.180
 and others like this one kids in the job of classifying it 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.759
 but in the end his work is in vain because everyone goes to the same bin 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:19.620
 in your home with organic and inorganic material 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.440
 the organized by the eleven in a special bin 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.659
 inorganic also 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:27.520
 jail 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.389
 I saw dumpster truck already 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.939
 like any environmental problem that of garbage is a subject that must be resolved 

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:37.050
 with the contribution of all 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.690
 as well
