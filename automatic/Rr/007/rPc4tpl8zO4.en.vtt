00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello my name is nadia and today we 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.690
 will do without and 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.469
 for making bize we need 6 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.450
 proteins 300 grams of tea and tea sugar 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.870
 spoon of lemon for the right 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.359
 visa preparation must always be respected 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.720
 The following rules need tricks as well 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.449
 get to not a drop of yolk fall 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.630
 rule number two all the dishes that we 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.800
 will use should be dry neither 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:35.070
 somehow you because rule number three 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.840
 squirrels need to shoot down in 3 stages start 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.809
 now I will separate 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 yolks from proteins and for this us 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.510
 need 2 cups and a small one 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:52.280
 capacity where we will throw off the squirrels 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.280
 one egg and separate the yolk from the protein 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.609
 neatly because if you exercise 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:07.890
 the yolk may get to the squirrel and on 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:11.060
 this protein is no longer needed 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.060
 from the yolk 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:23.900
 very carefully to the yolk did not get there 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 into the clan stuffed squirrel and after that already 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:33.750
 pure protein we send to the big 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:36.740
 cup of whites whip until foaming 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.740
 at medium speed 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.020
 This is the first foam that we have 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.490
 was formed when after the shot down of proteins it 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 was the first stage now go to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.780
 the second one is now on tear out a teaspoon 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.570
 lemon add it 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:02.310
 our general trouble now need to break 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:05.909
 to fight faster speed while developing 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.500
 our baby hands have to heat the oven on 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.830
 120 degrees step by step we added lemon 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:19.200
 protein consistency changed it became 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.660
 tougher increased several times 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.579
 in the third stage, you need to add sugar but 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.980
 will do it very slowly 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.239
 develop at the highest speed and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.239
 while on the wheel of sugar 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.930
 squirrels are already ready consistency did not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:47.890
 much bigger and she became a tuba 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 should emergency heads and arms squirrels 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.690
 ready for baking and they are drawn for 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.610
 convenient to fill out 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.599
 pastry package we have it on the couch 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:03.159
 cup and after that my fill it 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:05.549
 impose squeeze out nicely on 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.549
 paper 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.719
 already laid out both for we remove the oven 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:33.799
 for an hour and a half hours at a temperature of 120 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:36.799
 degrees for baking we should 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.709
 open a little oven to extra 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:45.560
 the moisture evaporated and the needles we put in 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:50.930
 wooden spoon without ready and now mine 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.790
 he left to determine in 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.439
 are you ready for or not? 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.980
 try to move them if they are easy 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:03.470
 move on baking sheet and that means that 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.980
 they are ready now almost two 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.159
 o'clock in the morning and just now ended
