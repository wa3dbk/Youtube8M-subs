00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.990
 according to numbers 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.620
 and Property Red everything is a bit bigger than usual on the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.619
 Construction sites of Cornyn DAX 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.269
 Winehouse very condescending 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.030
 In the huge shell of the youth house, even the site manager needs

 Herbert Markert 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.590
 therefore fall 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 For example, I think that here is a quick Fehlerteufel a great

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.450
 so it is about when it is still out 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.300
 Studer it was something very special 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.740
 in terms of quality, the men become underground 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.640
 Herten playful and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340
 we are seeing, for example 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.429
 Nadal knows from Holger Alich 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:37.430
 the yes-word 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 Quality stood 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 is largely and powerful 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.150
 for the largest brewery plant in the world they originate in hand 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.499
 usually they let you such containers in a row 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.429
 import from Germany but what is needed here is just too big 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.580
 two meters high is every single care stands 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.800
 The finished storage tanks are the size of single-family homes 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.400
 Lieschen do not remember ever 16 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.010
 That's exactly what the airline is 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.739
 and that brings us extremely visited and pull us company spokesman JÃ¼rg Rositzki 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.010
 even with 150 years of industry experience, the major order from Mexico is a 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.050
 especially prestigious 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.450
 for the Swabian specialists you always want one year 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.480
 Reason a logistical challenge is scarce as well 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 because the project has a special schedule 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.450
 here you can find a bit one quite well the expansion level euro 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:51.879
 here are moment in phase one so see ten million hectoliters - 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.459
 and out in the Call VOC area the first beer brewed while we were at the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.499
 then build second stage 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.779
 this is phase 2 with 20 million hectoliters so they are the brewhouse 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.689
 is now twice the number of times the Times has doubled and then 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.309
 have the final expansion stage with 30 million hectoliters per year 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.209
 and then she then the big breasts peasant of the world the kitas never that if we 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.739
 done with it 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.330
 2x Trockel and it was pretty quiet so far 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.700
 at the northern end of the Mexican state of Coahuila 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.740
 from the construction site of the brewery 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.269
 It is only 15 km to Bredl leave Edersee 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.269

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.729
 Grupo Modelo with its top brand Coronado pursued 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.009
 that the brewing water is brought by pipeline from 60 kilometers away 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:59.189
 just having to be one of many challenges Armin is there for and is 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.909
 his mexican kulik dat ass he is the dr 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.719
 he is so tall that over 90 percent of all projects 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:12.049
 Hayley 17 you abroad relations here in Mexico but that's special 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.150
 closely in the way Reichwein in other countries but I think already for twelve years 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.769
 one can say he Rosendahl he will there an operation of 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.950
 other brewers maintain facilities in many countries Gruner but we have to go out 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.969
 Mexico come that is business policy and the reason 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.240
 why the greatest painters of the los the world 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240

 it goes under previous ones 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.159
 and I think so well 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.599
 also experienced site managers and are sometimes impressed 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.580
 if everything is a little bigger 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.379
 as possible
