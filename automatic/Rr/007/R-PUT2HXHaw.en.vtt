00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes it was

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.360 
375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes it was
like<00:05:36.150> 20<00:05:36.510> minutes<00:05:36.660> then<00:05:37.410> I<00:05:37.530> uncovered<00:05:38.190> it<00:05:38.250> and

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
like 20 minutes then I uncovered it and

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.189 
like 20 minutes then I uncovered it and
I<00:05:38.490> saw<00:05:38.699> that<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.120> had<00:05:39.240> kind<00:05:39.419> of<00:05:39.539> absorbed<00:05:40.050> most

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
I saw that it had kind of absorbed most

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.680 
I saw that it had kind of absorbed most
of<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.440> sauce<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.430> added<00:05:41.639> another<00:05:41.880> cup<00:05:42.510> of

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
of the sauce so I added another cup of

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.320 
of the sauce so I added another cup of
boiling<00:05:43.590> hot<00:05:43.860> water<00:05:43.919> that<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.460> had<00:05:44.639> boiled<00:05:44.909> I

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
boiling hot water that I had boiled I

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.360 
boiling hot water that I had boiled I
just<00:05:46.020> put<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.409> on<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.590> stove<00:05:46.800> really<00:05:47.010> quickly

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
just put it on the stove really quickly

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.860 
just put it on the stove really quickly
and<00:05:47.490> once<00:05:47.639> it<00:05:47.789> came<00:05:47.909> to<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.120> boil<00:05:48.270> I<00:05:48.300> added<00:05:48.720> it

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
and once it came to a boil I added it

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.920 
and once it came to a boil I added it
and<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.349> let<00:05:49.530> it<00:05:49.560> cook<00:05:49.860> at<00:05:50.099> 400<00:05:50.909> for<00:05:51.060> 15<00:05:51.570> minutes

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
and I let it cook at 400 for 15 minutes

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.129 
and I let it cook at 400 for 15 minutes
so<00:05:52.560> what<00:05:52.889> you<00:05:53.070> do<00:05:53.310> now<00:05:53.610> is<00:05:54.060> take<00:05:54.539> your<00:05:54.720> cup<00:05:54.960> of

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
so what you do now is take your cup of

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.430 
so what you do now is take your cup of
ice<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:56.039> just<00:05:56.659> kind<00:05:57.659> of<00:05:57.720> put<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:57.990> in<00:05:58.080> there<00:05:58.260> so

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
ice and just kind of put it in there so

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.760 
ice and just kind of put it in there so
it<00:05:58.590> slows<00:05:59.220> down<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.520> cooking<00:06:00.060> time<00:06:00.330> and

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
it slows down the cooking time and

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.469 
it slows down the cooking time and
creates<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:02.099> little<00:06:02.340> more<00:06:02.460> of<00:06:02.760> a<00:06:02.849> sauce<00:06:03.120> also

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
creates a little more of a sauce also

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.469 
creates a little more of a sauce also
