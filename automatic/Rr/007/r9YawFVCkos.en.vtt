00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
stuff general general strategy of this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.510 
stuff general general strategy of this
of<00:00:59.820> these<00:01:00.780> first<00:01:01.199> introduction<00:01:01.890> rounds<00:01:02.340> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of these first introduction rounds are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880 
of these first introduction rounds are
basically<00:01:02.969> knife<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.530> possibly

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
basically knife as much as you possibly

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.890 
basically knife as much as you possibly
can<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.790> order<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> most<00:01:06.570> points

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
can in order to get the most points

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.100 
can in order to get the most points
possible<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.280> course<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:09.000> want<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> buy<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
possible and of course you want to buy a

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.359 
possible and of course you want to buy a
revived<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.280> soon<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.420> because

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
revived as soon as you can because

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.780 
revived as soon as you can because
obviously<00:01:14.689> playing<00:01:15.689> solo<00:01:16.650> revive<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
obviously playing solo revive is the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.370 
obviously playing solo revive is the
most<00:01:17.970> important<00:01:18.420> perk<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
most important perk because if you go

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920 
most important perk because if you go
down<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> only<00:01:20.580> way<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> come<00:01:21.900> back

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
down well it's the only way to come back

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.580 
down well it's the only way to come back
to<00:01:22.200> life<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.939> revived<00:01:24.590> perk

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to life so you need the revived perk

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.580 
to life so you need the revived perk
that<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.460> absolute<00:01:26.850> must<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.080> soon<00:01:28.350> as

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that is an absolute must so as soon as

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.399 
that is an absolute must so as soon as
you<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.950> enough<00:01:29.759> money<00:01:30.000> I'd<00:01:30.329> say<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:31.110> when

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
you get enough money I'd say right when

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.280 
you get enough money I'd say right when
it<00:01:31.530> hit<00:01:31.770> gets<00:01:32.250> around<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.030> gets<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.509> Round<00:01:33.750> four

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
it hit gets around it gets to Round four

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.179 
it hit gets around it gets to Round four
then<00:01:35.250> unlock<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.420> ship<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.799> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> go

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
then unlock the ship and you want to go

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
then unlock the ship and you want to go

possible<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.540> there<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.259> turn<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:01.950> on

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
possible so there you see it turn it on

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.290 
possible so there you see it turn it on
the<00:02:02.159> power<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:05.030> juggernog<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:07.069> solo

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the power and we juggernog is solo

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.430 
the power and we juggernog is solo
playing<00:02:09.300> solo<00:02:09.899> juggernog<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
playing solo juggernog is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.200 
playing solo juggernog is
the<00:02:11.650> second<00:02:12.010> best<00:02:12.190> perk<00:02:12.520> because<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> keeps

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
the second best perk because it keeps

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.740 
the second best perk because it keeps
you<00:02:13.810> alive<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:15.070> longest<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.210> instead<00:02:16.690> of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
you alive the longest so instead of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.490 
you alive the longest so instead of
getting<00:02:16.990> one<00:02:17.530> hit<00:02:17.830> by<00:02:18.270> or<00:02:19.270> excuse<00:02:20.050> me<00:02:20.110> instead

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
of getting to hit by a zombie you can

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.740 
of getting to hit by a zombie you can
actually<00:02:23.140> take<00:02:23.410> for<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.910> believe<00:02:25.030> three<00:02:25.630> to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
actually take for I believe three to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.110 
actually take for I believe three to
four<00:02:25.990> hits<00:02:26.290> from<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.680> zombie<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.850> will

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
four hits from a zombie so that will

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.350 
four hits from a zombie so that will
save<00:02:28.390> your<00:02:28.600> life<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.800> ton<00:02:30.250> of<00:02:30.280> situations<00:02:31.150> I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
save your life in a ton of situations I

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.270 
save your life in a ton of situations I
lucked<00:02:31.810> out<00:02:31.960> here<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> little<00:02:32.500> bit<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.070> got

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
lucked out here a little bit and I got

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.880 
lucked out here a little bit and I got
insta-kill<00:02:34.240> so<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.570> was<00:02:34.810> able<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.080> just<00:02:35.230> knife<00:02:35.680> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
insta-kill so I was able to just knife a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.270 
insta-kill so I was able to just knife a
bunch<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.190> zombies<00:02:36.340> down<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:38.280> regardless

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
bunch of zombies down but regardless

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.180 
bunch of zombies down but regardless
even<00:02:39.730> if<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.420> don't<00:02:40.690> get<00:02:40.960> you<00:02:41.200> know<00:02:41.320> good

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
even if you don't get you know good

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
even if you don't get you know good
power<00:02:42.430> up<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.880> even<00:02:43.000> if<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.270> don't<00:02:43.450> get<00:02:43.600> in

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
power up so even if you don't get in

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.740 
power up so even if you don't get in
skill<00:02:44.140> things<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:45.310> can<00:02:45.460> still<00:02:45.790> do

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
skill things like that you can still do

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.680 
skill things like that you can still do
this<00:02:46.930> strategy<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.740> same<00:02:48.010> way<00:02:48.220> so

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
this strategy in the same way so

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.590 
this strategy in the same way so
basically<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:50.340> unlocking<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.670> ship<00:02:51.970> going

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
basically on unlocking the ship going

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.570 
basically on unlocking the ship going
the<00:02:52.690> ship<00:02:52.900> route<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.440> turning<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> power

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
the ship route and turning on the power

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.640 
the ship route and turning on the power
is<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.210> first<00:02:55.480> thing<00:02:55.660> you<00:02:55.780> must<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.500> then

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
is the first thing you must do and then

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.000 
is the first thing you must do and then
as<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.130> can<00:02:57.280> see<00:02:57.580> i<00:02:57.840> took<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:58.990> they<00:02:59.380> unlock

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
as you can see i took out they unlock

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.460 
as you can see i took out they unlock
this<00:03:00.190> boat<00:03:00.460> right<00:03:00.730> here<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.240> that<00:03:02.050> will<00:03:02.260> be

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
this boat right here and that will be

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.710 
this boat right here and that will be
that<00:03:02.860> just<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.610> path<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.180> leads<00:03:04.390> to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
that just is a path that leads to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.480 
that just is a path that leads to
Juggernog<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:05.590> don't<00:03:05.800> already<00:03:06.340> know

Juggernog if you don't already know

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.700 
Juggernog if you don't already know
where<00:03:06.790> Juggernog<00:03:07.240> is<00:03:07.480> I'll<00:03:07.900> show<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.380> kind<00:03:08.650> of

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
where Juggernog is I'll show you kind of

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.890 
where Juggernog is I'll show you kind of
the<00:03:08.770> path<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.040> here<00:03:09.670> later<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.120> this<00:03:10.300> video

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
the path that here later in this video

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.940 
the path that here later in this video
but<00:03:11.800> if<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.760> already<00:03:12.970> do<00:03:13.240> know<00:03:13.450> then<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:14.620> you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
but if you already do know then you you

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.340 
but if you already do know then you you
know<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.310> path<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.150> I'm<00:03:16.540> talking<00:03:16.959> about<00:03:17.020> to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
know the path that I'm talking about to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.250 
know the path that I'm talking about to
unlock<00:03:17.770> so<00:03:18.190> as<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.209> can<00:03:19.360> see<00:03:19.570> right<00:03:19.600> now<00:03:19.870> I'm

unlock so as you can see right now I'm
just<00:03:20.410> going<00:03:20.530> back<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.130> starting<00:03:21.550> area<00:03:21.730> and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
just going back to the starting area and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.260 
just going back to the starting area and
I'm<00:03:22.270> actually<00:03:22.540> gonna<00:03:23.020> just<00:03:23.820> skip<00:03:24.820> ahead<00:03:24.880> here

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
I'm actually gonna just skip ahead here

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.240 
I'm actually gonna just skip ahead here
a<00:03:25.660> little<00:03:25.989> bit<00:03:26.170> because<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.709> just<00:03:26.950> end<00:03:27.130> up

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
a little bit because I just end up

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.190 
a little bit because I just end up
hanging<00:03:27.520> out<00:03:27.760> in<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.000> starting<00:03:28.450> area<00:03:28.810> some

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
hanging out in the starting area some

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.360 
hanging out in the starting area some
and<00:03:29.910> yeah<00:03:30.910> basically<00:03:31.060> just<00:03:32.100> getting<00:03:33.100> through

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
and yeah basically just getting through

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.220 
and yeah basically just getting through
some<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.239> rounds<00:03:34.690> getting<00:03:34.930> through<00:03:35.110> the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
some of the rounds getting through the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.220 
some of the rounds getting through the
fifth<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.830> I<00:03:36.160> believe<00:03:36.300> get<00:03:37.300> going<00:03:37.780> into<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
fifth and I believe get going into the

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.890 
fifth and I believe get going into the
sixth<00:03:38.590> round<00:03:38.709> here<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.550> as<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.420> can<00:03:40.630> see<00:03:40.660> I

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
sixth round here and as you can see I

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.580 
sixth round here and as you can see I
did<00:03:41.560> skip<00:03:41.980> ahead<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.280> little<00:03:42.370> bit<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.910> I<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
did skip ahead a little bit and I the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.250 
did skip ahead a little bit and I the
increase<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.400> points<00:03:46.030> right<00:03:46.239> there<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.720> gotta

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
increase in points right there I gotta

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.610 
increase in points right there I gotta
have<00:03:48.000> 4,000<00:03:49.000> points<00:03:49.150> or<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.450> little<00:03:49.660> over<00:03:49.870> 4,000

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
have 4,000 points or a little over 4,000

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.820 
have 4,000 points or a little over 4,000
points<00:03:50.739> at<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.010> moment<00:03:51.340> which<00:03:51.700> means<00:03:52.030> i<00:03:52.269> can

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
points at the moment which means i can

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.430 
points at the moment which means i can
in<00:03:53.830> fact<00:03:53.890> unlock<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.940> rest<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.420> path<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
in fact unlock the rest of the path to

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.759 
in fact unlock the rest of the path to
Juggernog<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.430> by<00:03:58.239> Juggernog<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.530> is

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
Juggernog and by Juggernog so that is

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.990 
Juggernog and by Juggernog so that is
that<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.360> first<00:04:01.390> part<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:03.040> solo

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
that is the first part of this solo

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.220 
that is the first part of this solo
strategy<00:04:04.390> is<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.050> get<00:04:05.890> juggernog<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.730> is

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
strategy is to get juggernog that is

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.960 
strategy is to get juggernog that is
basically<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.530> most<00:04:08.769> important<00:04:09.310> step<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.880> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
basically the most important step in the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.330 
basically the most important step in the
first<00:04:10.269> most<00:04:10.600> important<00:04:11.050> step<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.500> do<00:04:11.680> so<00:04:12.040> as

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
first most important step to do so as

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.210 
first most important step to do so as
you<00:04:12.850> can<00:04:12.940> see<00:04:13.180> i'm<00:04:13.420> going<00:04:13.720> to<00:04:14.110> juggernog<00:04:15.010> and

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
you can see i'm going to juggernog and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.550 
you can see i'm going to juggernog and
this<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.760> easiest<00:04:16.299> path<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> take<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:17.410> can

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
this is the easiest path to take you can

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.680 
this is the easiest path to take you can
unlock<00:04:17.709> that<00:04:18.100> door<00:04:18.160> up<00:04:18.640> above<00:04:19.060> on<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.450> top

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
unlock that door up above on the top

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.290 
unlock that door up above on the top
deck<00:04:19.720> of<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.260> ship<00:04:20.289> but<00:04:20.830> this<00:04:21.280> is<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.640> fastest

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
deck of the ship but this is the fastest

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.110 
deck of the ship but this is the fastest
and<00:04:22.479> cheapest<00:04:23.110> way<00:04:23.200> of<00:04:23.620> getting<00:04:24.220> juggernog<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
and cheapest way of getting juggernog so

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240 
and cheapest way of getting juggernog so
I go<00:04:25.419> down<00:04:25.600> here<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:25.990> I'm<00:04:26.740> going<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.070> buy<00:04:27.220> that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
I go down here and I'm going to buy that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.790 
I go down here and I'm going to buy that
and<00:04:27.850> now<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:29.370> I<00:04:30.370> believe<00:04:31.240> I<00:04:31.419> only<00:04:31.570> i<00:04:32.020> believe<00:04:32.620> i

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
and now I I believe I only i believe i

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800 
and now I I believe I only i believe i
was<00:04:32.949> able<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.400> just<00:04:33.430> go<00:04:33.760> through<00:04:33.790> two<00:04:34.419> rounds

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
was able to just go through two rounds

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.969 
was able to just go through two rounds
of<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.350> MPL<00:04:36.010> ammo<00:04:36.400> i<00:04:37.139> ended<00:04:38.139> up<00:04:38.260> using<00:04:38.530> more

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
of the MPL ammo i ended up using more

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.820 
of the MPL ammo i ended up using more
than<00:04:39.220> i<00:04:39.610> usually<00:04:40.030> do<00:04:40.479> but<00:04:40.840> that's<00:04:41.410> okay

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
than i usually do but that's okay

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.379 
than i usually do but that's okay
because<00:04:41.860> uh<00:04:42.810> really<00:04:43.810> once<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:45.010> start<00:04:45.389> doing

I unfortunately got a nuke and so that

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.659 
I unfortunately got a nuke and so that
made<00:05:23.080> it<00:05:23.110> so<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:23.860> needed<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.310> get<00:05:24.490> some

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
made it so that I needed to get some

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.430 
made it so that I needed to get some
ammo<00:05:24.850> fast<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.510> be<00:05:25.600> ready<00:05:25.780> for<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.169> next

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
ammo fast and be ready for the next

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.029 
ammo fast and be ready for the next
round<00:05:26.770> of<00:05:27.520> zombies<00:05:27.580> so<00:05:28.180> as<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:29.349> can<00:05:29.470> see<00:05:29.710> here

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
round of zombies so as you can see here

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.930 
round of zombies so as you can see here
the<00:05:30.729> goal<00:05:31.060> is<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.780> basically<00:05:32.169> have<00:05:32.940> revived

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
the goal is to basically have revived

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.310 
the goal is to basically have revived
and<00:05:34.800> Juggernog<00:05:35.800> by<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:37.270> end<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.050> fifth

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
and Juggernog by the end of the fifth

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.650 
and Juggernog by the end of the fifth
into<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.770> sixth<00:05:39.280> round<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.910> if<00:05:40.210> you've<00:05:40.389> done

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
into the sixth round and if you've done

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.610 
into the sixth round and if you've done
that<00:05:40.900> then<00:05:41.139> you're<00:05:42.539> pretty<00:05:43.539> much<00:05:43.660> set<00:05:44.169> into

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
that then you're pretty much set into

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.310 
that then you're pretty much set into
this<00:05:44.740> strategy<00:05:45.430> and<00:05:45.760> as<00:05:46.000> you<00:05:46.599> will<00:05:46.720> see<00:05:46.930> here

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
this strategy and as you will see here

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.980 
this strategy and as you will see here
now<00:05:48.099> I'm<00:05:48.460> going<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:48.789> go<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.660> lighthouse

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
now I'm going to go to the lighthouse

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.120 
now I'm going to go to the lighthouse
side<00:05:50.590> so<00:05:51.570> the<00:05:52.570> loop<00:05:53.229> that<00:05:53.530> i'm<00:05:53.680> going<00:05:53.860> to<00:05:53.919> show

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
over here by the lighthouse so I'm just

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.159 
over here by the lighthouse so I'm just
basically<00:06:09.039> unlocking<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.090> doors<00:06:10.300> as<00:06:10.570> I<00:06:10.720> go<00:06:10.930> as

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
basically unlocking the doors as I go as

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.870 
basically unlocking the doors as I go as
soon<00:06:11.320> as<00:06:11.470> I<00:06:11.560> get<00:06:11.620> enough<00:06:11.949> money<00:06:12.160> because<00:06:12.669> I

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
soon as I get enough money because I

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.029 
soon as I get enough money because I
want<00:06:13.419> to<00:06:13.479> get<00:06:13.570> to<00:06:13.690> that<00:06:13.810> loop<00:06:14.050> as<00:06:14.289> quick<00:06:14.830> as

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
want to get to that loop as quick as

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.710 
want to get to that loop as quick as
possible<00:06:15.340> because<00:06:15.760> once<00:06:16.180> you're<00:06:16.389> at<00:06:16.539> that

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
possible because once you're at that

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.850 
possible because once you're at that
loop<00:06:17.160> it<00:06:18.160> you<00:06:19.090> just<00:06:19.330> keep<00:06:19.539> running<00:06:20.110> around<00:06:20.620> it

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
loop it you just keep running around it

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.400 
loop it you just keep running around it
and<00:06:21.120> then<00:06:22.120> it<00:06:22.300> really<00:06:22.479> just<00:06:22.720> all<00:06:22.960> comes<00:06:23.260> down

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
and then it really just all comes down

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.029 
and then it really just all comes down
to<00:06:24.000> knowing<00:06:25.000> when<00:06:25.300> to<00:06:25.330> get<00:06:25.660> by<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.380> zombies

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
to knowing when to get by the zombies

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:30.570 
to knowing when to get by the zombies
and<00:06:27.460> having<00:06:28.240> the<00:06:29.070> basically<00:06:30.070> having<00:06:30.370> the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
and having the basically having the

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.230 
and having the basically having the
accuracy<00:06:31.240> in<00:06:31.449> the<00:06:31.690> skill<00:06:32.440> to<00:06:33.090> continue<00:06:34.090> the

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
accuracy in the skill to continue the

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.870 
accuracy in the skill to continue the
loop<00:06:34.479> so<00:06:34.840> as<00:06:35.020> you<00:06:35.349> can<00:06:35.469> see<00:06:35.650> right<00:06:35.680> here<00:06:36.039> I<00:06:36.190> have

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
loop so as you can see right here I have

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.970 
loop so as you can see right here I have
unlocked<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.360> doors<00:06:37.810> to<00:06:37.930> go<00:06:38.200> down<00:06:38.590> to

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
unlocked the doors to go down to

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.800 
unlocked the doors to go down to
the<00:06:39.070> bottom<00:06:39.460> of<00:06:39.610> the<00:06:39.700> lighthouse<00:06:39.910> and<00:06:40.420> the

the bottom of the lighthouse and the

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.290 
the bottom of the lighthouse and the
next<00:06:41.530> step<00:06:41.770> is<00:06:42.010> that<00:06:42.370> I'm<00:06:42.580> going<00:06:43.060> to<00:06:43.120> be

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
next step is that I'm going to be

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.900 
next step is that I'm going to be
unlocking<00:06:44.140> the<00:06:44.440> doors<00:06:44.710> at<00:06:45.010> the<00:06:45.130> bottom<00:06:45.550> of<00:06:45.730> the

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
unlocking the doors at the bottom of the

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.330 
unlocking the doors at the bottom of the
lighthouse<00:06:46.150> and<00:06:46.690> if<00:06:47.380> you<00:06:47.950> didn't<00:06:48.250> already
