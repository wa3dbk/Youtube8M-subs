is any different the leg turnover which

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.429 
is any different the leg turnover which
is<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.580> gate<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.449> sort<00:00:18.720> of<00:00:18.779> thing<00:00:18.990> okay<00:00:19.230> and

is you gate that sort of thing okay and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.660 
is you gate that sort of thing okay and
the<00:00:19.710> three<00:00:19.920> shoes<00:00:20.160> we're<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> be

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
minimus okay zero drop very minimal

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.319 
minimus okay zero drop very minimal
padding<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.380> minimalist<00:00:37.860> shoe<00:00:38.329> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
we also going to be looking at the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.959 
we also going to be looking at the
Newton<00:00:42.180> MV<00:00:42.690> squared<00:00:43.079> okay<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.980> minimal<00:00:44.489> ultra

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Newton MV squared okay so minimal ultra

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
Newton MV squared okay so minimal ultra
light<00:00:45.180> weight<00:00:45.210> however<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.230> has<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> log

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
light weight however it has the log

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.529 
light weight however it has the log
system<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> front<00:00:47.700> which<00:00:47.910> propels<00:00:48.390> you

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
system on the front which propels you

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.450 
system on the front which propels you
forward<00:00:48.590> okay<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.680> three<00:00:50.039> very<00:00:50.250> different

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
forward okay so three very different

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.970 
forward okay so three very different
shoes<00:00:50.969> we've<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.690> barefoot<00:00:52.199> we've<00:00:52.770> got

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
shoes we've got barefoot we've got

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
shoes we've got barefoot we've got
minimalist<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> we've<00:00:53.940> got<00:00:54.090> minimalist<00:00:54.570> with

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
minimalist and we've got minimalist with

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.000 
minimalist and we've got minimalist with
the<00:00:54.809> lugs<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.920> be

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the lugs so it's just gonna be

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
the lugs so it's just gonna be
interesting<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.760> there<00:00:57.030> how<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> impact

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
interesting to see there how the impact

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.040 
interesting to see there how the impact
differs<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> gait<00:00:59.370> differs<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.050> just

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
differs how the gait differs and just

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.799 
differs how the gait differs and just
any<00:01:01.199> any<00:01:01.590> other<00:01:01.859> general<00:01:02.780> generalities<00:01:03.780> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
any any other general generalities that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
any any other general generalities that
we<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.140> pick<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:05.129> without<00:01:05.309> further

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
we can pick up really so without further

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
we can pick up really so without further
ado<00:01:05.880> let's<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.510> outside<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> shed<00:01:07.290> let's

narrow you don't have the feets playing

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.530 
narrow you don't have the feets playing
like<00:01:55.920> you're<00:01:56.040> doing<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> Vibrams<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.969> feel<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
like you're doing the Vibrams I feel the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.300 
like you're doing the Vibrams I feel the

impact on the ground is slightly
slightly<00:02:00.060> harder<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.969> then<00:02:02.969> finally<00:02:03.450> the

are<00:02:11.220> very<00:02:11.250> fast<00:02:12.030> okay<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.930> I'm<00:02:13.020> putting<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.470> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
are very fast okay so I'm putting in a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.760 
are very fast okay so I'm putting in a
row

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
row

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470

the<00:02:13.890> same<00:02:14.160> amount<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.610> effort<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.030> all<00:02:15.180> shows

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the same amount of effort in all shows

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.860 
the same amount of effort in all shows
around<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:16.100> 10k<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.160> half<00:02:17.580> miles<00:02:17.820> on<00:02:18.030> effort<00:02:18.360> but

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
around a 10k to half miles on effort but

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.170 
around a 10k to half miles on effort but
the<00:02:19.020> Newtons<00:02:19.500> are<00:02:19.710> just<00:02:20.010> faster<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.850> less

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the Newtons are just faster so less

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.390 
the Newtons are just faster so less
effort<00:02:21.570> for<00:02:21.780> faster<00:02:22.260> speed<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.130> what<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
effort for faster speed but what that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
effort for faster speed but what that
means<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.760> more<00:02:24.000> impact<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.900> impact

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
means is more impact because the impact

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.990 
means is more impact because the impact
is<00:02:25.410> quickly<00:02:25.830> being<00:02:25.980> shocked<00:02:26.340> up<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.760> back

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
is quickly being shocked up and back

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.690 
is quickly being shocked up and back
through<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.290> again<00:02:28.470> okay<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.610> we

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
through and out again okay so here we

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.390 
through and out again okay so here we

Balance<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.640> lot<00:02:51.240> lot<00:02:51.630> quicker

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
effort but what that means is it's

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.110 
effort but what that means is it's
because<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.980> force<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.580> ground<00:02:56.790> strike

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
because the force of the ground strike

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.360 
because the force of the ground strike
is<00:02:57.300> harder<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.290> am<00:02:58.560> using<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> force<00:02:59.220> to

is harder and it's am using the force to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.460 
is harder and it's am using the force to
push<00:02:59.580> back<00:02:59.790> but<00:03:00.150> you're<00:03:00.780> not<00:03:00.900> absorbing<00:03:01.020> the

push back but you're not absorbing the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.640 
push back but you're not absorbing the
the<00:03:01.950> strike<00:03:02.940> as<00:03:03.090> well<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:03.630> then<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> Newtons

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the strike as well and then the Newtons

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.570 
the strike as well and then the Newtons
are<00:03:04.890> more<00:03:05.220> padded<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.330> lugs<00:03:06.630> a<00:03:07.340> design<00:03:08.340> to

are more padded and the lugs a design to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.330 
are more padded and the lugs a design to
push<00:03:08.790> back<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> force<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.750> would<00:03:10.320> say<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
push back the force I would say that the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.730 
push back the force I would say that the
Newtons<00:03:11.910> have<00:03:12.270> a<00:03:12.300> softer<00:03:12.840> strike<00:03:13.170> than<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
Newtons have a softer strike than the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
that in that instance but the Newtons

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.940 
that in that instance but the Newtons
are<00:03:19.620> incredibly<00:03:20.430> fast<00:03:21.110> okay<00:03:22.110> that's<00:03:22.440> why<00:03:22.709> I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
are incredibly fast okay that's why I

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.980 
are incredibly fast okay that's why I
say<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.580> I'm<00:03:23.730> competing<00:03:24.150> I'll<00:03:24.570> run<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:24.900> the

tops<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:47.100> terms<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.610> this<00:03:48.110> comparison

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
tops of in terms of this comparison

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.490 
tops of in terms of this comparison
because<00:03:50.010> they<00:03:50.130> do<00:03:50.190> absorb<00:03:50.520> more<00:03:50.790> impact

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
because they do absorb more impact

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.050 
because they do absorb more impact
they're<00:03:52.500> not<00:03:52.650> as<00:03:52.770> quick<00:03:52.920> as<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.190> Newton's<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
they're not as quick as the Newton's the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.970 
they're not as quick as the Newton's the
Newton's<00:03:54.480> isn't<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.080> true<00:03:55.320> barefoot<00:03:55.800> shoe

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
Newton's isn't a true barefoot shoe

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.410 
Newton's isn't a true barefoot shoe
because<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.370> changes<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.180> run

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
because it changes the way you run

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.910 
because it changes the way you run
slightly<00:03:57.720> puts<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.290> more<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.560> your<00:03:58.680> toes

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
slightly puts you more on your toes

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.350 
slightly puts you more on your toes
which<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.370> great<00:03:59.580> if<00:03:59.700> you're<00:03:59.850> not<00:03:59.970> an<00:04:00.090> actual

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
which is great if you're not an actual

which is great if you're not an actual
