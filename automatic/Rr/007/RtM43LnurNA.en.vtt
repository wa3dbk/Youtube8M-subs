that first and now I'm going to go

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.610 
that first and now I'm going to go
through<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.040> areas<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:52.180> my<00:02:52.930> roots<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.410> you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
through the areas of my roots that you

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.160 
through the areas of my roots that you
can<00:02:53.830> usually<00:02:54.040> see<00:02:54.430> most<00:02:54.700> such<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.570> front

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
can usually see most such as the front

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.070 
can usually see most such as the front
hairline<00:02:56.820> around<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:58.120> face<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.750> areas<00:02:59.050> like

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
hairline around the face and areas like

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.530 
hairline around the face and areas like
that<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.739> then<00:02:59.920> we'll<00:03:00.070> get<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.540> actually

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
that and then we'll get on to actually

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.890 
that and then we'll get on to actually
bleaching<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:03.190> rest<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.760> roots

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.330 

you<00:03:08.470> want<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.709> leave<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:08.890> tiny<00:03:09.220> gap<00:03:09.750> between

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
you want to leave a tiny gap between

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.160 
you want to leave a tiny gap between
your<00:03:12.340> scalp<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.890> bit<00:03:15.129> leaky<00:03:15.250> bleaching<00:03:15.760> and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
your scalp and a bit leaky bleaching and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.410 
your scalp and a bit leaky bleaching and
between<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.379> original<00:03:17.560> hair<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.819> what<00:03:19.329> you

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
between the original hair and what you

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.640 
between the original hair and what you
bleed<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:20.099> because<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:22.480> way<00:03:22.659> they'll<00:03:23.560> be

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
bleed you because that way they'll be

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.910 
bleed you because that way they'll be
less<00:03:23.829> damaged

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.520 

I'll<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.030> do<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.300> front

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.200 

because<00:03:34.370> bleach<00:03:34.610> expands<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.890> if<00:03:37.400> you've<00:03:38.000> left

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
because bleach expands so if you've left

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.750 
because bleach expands so if you've left
little<00:03:38.510> gaps<00:03:38.720> such<00:03:39.020> as<00:03:39.230> run<00:03:39.860> here<00:03:40.190> it'll

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
little gaps such as run here it'll

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.960 
little gaps such as run here it'll
expand<00:03:41.270> to<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.690> area<00:03:42.170> anyway<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.490> bleach<00:03:43.730> it

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
expand to that area anyway and bleach it

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:55.350 
expand to that area anyway and bleach it
so<00:03:44.210> don't<00:03:44.810> worry<00:03:44.960> about<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.470> if<00:03:45.740> you<00:03:45.860> think<00:03:46.040> ups

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
about 45 minutes so as you can see I've

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.650 
about 45 minutes so as you can see I've
washed<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.440> beach<00:05:10.620> out<00:05:10.890> of<00:05:10.980> my<00:05:11.130> hair<00:05:11.340> and<00:05:11.660> my

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
washed the beach out of my hair and my

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.760 
washed the beach out of my hair and my
roots<00:05:12.900> are<00:05:13.550> done<00:05:14.550> obviously<00:05:15.710> there's<00:05:16.710> a

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
roots are done obviously there's a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.890 
roots are done obviously there's a
slight<00:05:17.100> orange<00:05:17.340> tint<00:05:17.790> to<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:17.970> which<00:05:18.510> is<00:05:18.720> what<00:05:18.870> I

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
slight orange tint to it which is what I

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.680 
slight orange tint to it which is what I
expected<00:05:19.470> that's<00:05:20.090> because<00:05:21.090> my<00:05:21.210> hair's<00:05:21.420> dark

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
expected that's because my hair's dark

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.050 
expected that's because my hair's dark
so<00:05:22.080> I'm<00:05:22.440> gonna<00:05:22.680> be<00:05:22.860> putting<00:05:23.070> it<00:05:23.280> ash<00:05:23.670> tone

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
so I'm gonna be putting it ash tone

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.920 
so I'm gonna be putting it ash tone
permanent<00:05:24.750> dye<00:05:24.900> over<00:05:25.890> this<00:05:26.010> to<00:05:26.580> like<00:05:27.480> even<00:05:27.690> out

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
permanent dye over this to like even out

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.540 
permanent dye over this to like even out
the<00:05:28.080> color<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.710> match<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:29.010> rest<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.280> my<00:05:29.370> hair

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
the color to match the rest of my hair

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.780 
the color to match the rest of my hair

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
you'll be seeing the process of doing

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.490 
you'll be seeing the process of doing
your<00:05:32.910> roots<00:05:33.120> essentially<00:05:33.870> with<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.020> box<00:05:34.230> story

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
your roots essentially with a box story

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.160 
your roots essentially with a box story
as<00:05:34.830> well<00:05:35.010> as<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:35.940> said<00:05:36.120> before<00:05:36.240> i'm<00:05:36.810> gonna<00:05:37.050> be

usually you get the developer and the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.030 
usually you get the developer and the
activator<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:41.790> you<00:05:42.420> get<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.810> conditioner<00:05:43.380> you

activator and you get a conditioner you

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.210 
activator and you get a conditioner you
just<00:05:44.250> mix<00:05:45.020> in<00:05:46.020> this<00:05:46.170> case<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.740> color<00:05:46.950> blending

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
just mix in this case the color blending

you

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.730 

so<00:06:30.370> if<00:06:30.460> applied<00:06:30.760> the<00:06:30.970> dye<00:06:31.120> to<00:06:31.390> the<00:06:31.420> roots<00:06:31.720> and<00:06:32.050> a

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
so if applied the dye to the roots and a

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.610 
so if applied the dye to the roots and a
little<00:06:33.280> bit<00:06:33.460> of<00:06:33.700> the<00:06:33.880> ends<00:06:34.180> and<00:06:34.440> I'll<00:06:35.440> leave

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
little bit of the ends and I'll leave

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.410 
little bit of the ends and I'll leave
that<00:06:35.650> to<00:06:35.890> develop<00:06:36.190> as<00:06:36.550> long<00:06:36.670> as<00:06:36.850> the<00:06:36.970> box<00:06:37.150> phase

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:37.420 
that to develop as long as the box phase

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.780 
that to develop as long as the box phase
which<00:06:37.750> is<00:06:37.780> usually<00:06:38.290> about<00:06:38.500> 20-25<00:06:39.400> minutes

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
which is usually about 20-25 minutes

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.150 
which is usually about 20-25 minutes
when<00:06:40.480> it<00:06:40.630> comes<00:06:40.900> to<00:06:41.140> putting<00:06:41.410> in<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.770> rest<00:06:41.980> of

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
when it comes to putting in the rest of

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.650 
when it comes to putting in the rest of
the<00:06:42.280> head<00:06:42.460> I'm<00:06:42.670> gonna<00:06:42.850> use<00:06:43.060> a<00:06:43.090> spray<00:06:43.450> bottle

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:57.760 
light in you can see that the roots are

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.210 
light in you can see that the roots are
very<00:06:58.510> very<00:06:58.930> slightly<00:06:59.290> different<00:06:59.500> to<00:07:00.070> the<00:07:00.190> rest

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
very very slightly different to the rest

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.790 
very very slightly different to the rest
of<00:07:00.520> my<00:07:00.640> hair<00:07:00.850> but<00:07:01.540> that's<00:07:01.720> because<00:07:01.930> blonde<00:07:02.350> is

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
of my hair but that's because blonde is

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.100 
of my hair but that's because blonde is
very<00:07:03.400> hard<00:07:03.640> to<00:07:03.730> match<00:07:04.000> back<00:07:04.270> up<00:07:04.480> obviously<00:07:04.750> if

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
very hard to match back up obviously if

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.810 
very hard to match back up obviously if

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
you use in a normal hair dye and you're

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.760 
you use in a normal hair dye and you're
just<00:07:06.970> doing<00:07:07.210> the<00:07:07.300> reeds<00:07:07.510> with<00:07:07.720> that<00:07:07.900> it<00:07:08.500> should

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770
