from Costa Rica explains why zirconium
implants<00:00:05.370> are<00:00:05.490> preferred<00:00:05.910> over<00:00:06.060> traditional

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
implants are preferred over traditional

dental<00:00:07.230> implants<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> two-part<00:00:08.880> video

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
dental implants this is a two-part video

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.749 
dental implants this is a two-part video
series

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.929 

this<00:00:15.759> is<00:00:15.969> uh<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:17.710> is<00:00:17.770> uh<00:00:18.039> in<00:00:18.250> a<00:00:18.340> larger<00:00:18.759> scale

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
this is uh this is uh in a larger scale

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.620 
this is uh this is uh in a larger scale
this<00:00:19.840> is<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.849> traditional<00:00:21.849> dental<00:00:22.240> implant

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
this is a traditional dental implant

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.839 
this is a traditional dental implant
this<00:00:23.289> is<00:00:23.470> bigger<00:00:23.770> than<00:00:23.890> normal<00:00:24.400> because<00:00:24.520> this

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
this is bigger than normal because this

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.050 
this is bigger than normal because this
is<00:00:25.000> just<00:00:25.270> work<00:00:25.480> for<00:00:26.259> show<00:00:26.529> one<00:00:27.130> we<00:00:27.640> explain<00:00:28.029> our

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
is just work for show one we explain our

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.540 
is just work for show one we explain our
patients<00:00:28.689> what<00:00:28.930> an<00:00:29.079> implant<00:00:29.380> looks<00:00:29.470> like<00:00:29.829> how

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
patients what an implant looks like how

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.510 
patients what an implant looks like how
it<00:00:30.759> works<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.779> see<00:00:31.809> that<00:00:32.140> it<00:00:32.259> works<00:00:32.529> similar

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
it works you see that it works similar

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.700 
it works you see that it works similar
to<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:34.270> screw<00:00:34.690> we<00:00:35.379> were<00:00:35.530> using<00:00:35.739> in<00:00:36.579> construction

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
to a screw we were using in construction

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.810 
to a screw we were using in construction
it<00:00:38.710> has<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.570> has<00:00:40.840> two<00:00:41.110> types<00:00:41.379> of<00:00:41.590> ways<00:00:42.489> in<00:00:42.789> which

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
it has it has two types of ways in which

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.510 
it has it has two types of ways in which
it<00:00:43.239> works<00:00:43.870> within<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.680> bone<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.039> patient

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
it works within the bone of the patient

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.380 
it works within the bone of the patient
the<00:00:46.000> first<00:00:46.300> one<00:00:46.540> is<00:00:47.020> going<00:00:47.290> to<00:00:47.380> create<00:00:47.829> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the first one is going to create a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.120 
the first one is going to create a
mechanical<00:00:49.390> retention<00:00:49.810> because<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:51.010> the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
mechanical retention because of the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.920 
mechanical retention because of the
screws<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:51.880> it<00:00:52.000> has<00:00:52.180> is<00:00:52.420> going<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.660> create<00:00:52.870> a

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
screws that it has is going to create a

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.080 
screws that it has is going to create a
mechanical<00:00:53.530> retention<00:00:53.790> against<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:54.910> bone

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
mechanical retention against the bone

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.620 
mechanical retention against the bone
but<00:00:55.750> secondly<00:00:56.230> and<00:00:56.320> most<00:00:56.649> important<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.390> bone

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
but secondly and most important the bone

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.220 
but secondly and most important the bone
cells<00:00:59.020> would<00:00:59.860> actually<00:01:00.370> react<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.480> a<00:01:01.570> positive

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
cells would actually react on a positive

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.499 
cells would actually react on a positive
way<00:01:02.460> alongside<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.850> surface<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:04.390> the

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
way alongside the surface of the

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.600 
way alongside the surface of the
titanium<00:01:05.159> making<00:01:06.159> it<00:01:06.310> almost<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.360> biological

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
titanium making it almost a biological

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.520 
titanium making it almost a biological
contact<00:01:09.610> between<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.270> two<00:01:10.479> so<00:01:11.049> then<00:01:11.229> we<00:01:11.350> have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
contact between the two so then we have

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.130 
contact between the two so then we have
a<00:01:11.560> micro<00:01:12.280> retention<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.000> then<00:01:13.810> we<00:01:13.930> have<00:01:14.110> a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
a micro retention and then we have a

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.800 
a micro retention and then we have a
biological<00:01:14.820> retention<00:01:15.820> which<00:01:16.299> actually

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
biological retention which actually

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.480 
biological retention which actually
creates<00:01:18.539> an<00:01:19.539> ankylosis<00:01:20.380> process<00:01:20.859> which

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
creates an ankylosis process which

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.550 
creates an ankylosis process which
produces<00:01:21.520> that<00:01:22.209> the<00:01:22.359> implant<00:01:22.869> is<00:01:23.139> going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.439> be

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
produces that the implant is going to be

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.699 
produces that the implant is going to be
completely<00:01:24.399> set<00:01:24.789> in<00:01:25.719> beneath<00:01:26.079> the<00:01:26.259> bone<00:01:26.439> and

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:26.709 
completely set in beneath the bone and

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.179 
completely set in beneath the bone and
it<00:01:27.369> will<00:01:27.490> work<00:01:27.729> just<00:01:28.030> as<00:01:28.899> close<00:01:29.139> as<00:01:29.529> a<00:01:29.619> natural

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
it will work just as close as a natural

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.629 
it will work just as close as a natural
root<00:01:30.549> of<00:01:30.819> a<00:01:31.749> tooth<00:01:31.959> would<00:01:35.189> typically<00:01:36.189> the

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
root of a tooth would typically the

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.760 
root of a tooth would typically the
implants<00:01:37.090> are<00:01:37.209> made<00:01:37.240> of<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.689> titanium<00:01:37.959> material

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
implants are made of a titanium material

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.379 
implants are made of a titanium material
which<00:01:38.979> is<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.310> one<00:01:39.759> that<00:01:39.909> I<00:01:39.939> showed<00:01:40.179> you

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:40.389 
which is the one that I showed you

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:44.069 
which is the one that I showed you
before<00:01:41.219> now<00:01:42.219> again<00:01:42.729> this<00:01:42.849> is<00:01:42.909> just<00:01:43.329> up<00:01:43.539> this<00:01:43.899> is

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
before now again this is just up this is

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.589 
before now again this is just up this is
just<00:01:44.319> a<00:01:44.409> model<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.700> newer<00:01:45.880> influence<00:01:46.420> that

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:46.599 
just a model of the newer influence that

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.449 
just a model of the newer influence that
we<00:01:46.719> use<00:01:46.929> in<00:01:47.109> right<00:01:47.289> now<00:01:47.439> that<00:01:47.709> are<00:01:48.159> made<00:01:48.310> of

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
we use in right now that are made of

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.059 
we use in right now that are made of
zirconia<00:01:48.639> as<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.810> told<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.170> before<00:01:50.289> selenium

00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:51.069 
zirconia as I told you before selenium

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.429 
zirconia as I told you before selenium
was<00:01:51.189> a<00:01:51.219> material<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:52.149> typically<00:01:52.599> we<00:01:53.289> were

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
was a material that typically we were

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.219 
was a material that typically we were
using<00:01:53.889> for<00:01:53.950> for<00:01:54.880> crowns<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.689> this<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:55.929> just<00:01:56.109> a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
using for for crowns and this is just a

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.719 
using for for crowns and this is just a
model<00:01:56.409> this<00:01:56.679> is<00:01:56.829> made<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.099> plastic<00:01:57.219> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
model this is made of plastic the

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.279 
model this is made of plastic the
zirconium<00:01:58.060> implants<00:01:58.539> look<00:01:58.719> exactly<00:01:59.079> like

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
zirconium implants look exactly like

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.230 
zirconium implants look exactly like
this<00:01:59.590> but<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.429> made<00:02:00.609> of<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.819> total<00:02:01.149> material

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
this but it's made of a total material

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.599 
this but it's made of a total material
because<00:02:01.719> you<00:02:01.749> corneum<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.499> touch<00:02:02.740> it's

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
because you corneum to the touch it's

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.449 
because you corneum to the touch it's
like<00:02:03.729> touching<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.329> rough<00:02:04.539> metal<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:06.130> with<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
like touching a rough metal but with the

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.969 
like touching a rough metal but with the
advantage<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:06.849> is<00:02:07.090> white<00:02:07.349> the<00:02:08.349> zirconium<00:02:08.709> is

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
advantage that is white the zirconium is

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.540 
advantage that is white the zirconium is
a<00:02:09.009> newer<00:02:09.340> material<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:11.380> been<00:02:11.709> recently

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
a newer material it's been recently

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.720 
a newer material it's been recently
released<00:02:13.150> by<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.630> FDA<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.860> proof<00:02:15.099> for

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
released by the FDA so it's a proof for

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.370 
released by the FDA so it's a proof for
