00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
starting to face the end is Lily in the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.720 
starting to face the end is Lily in the
material<00:00:03.990> connected<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.680> top<00:00:04.920> blogs<00:00:05.279> and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
material connected to the top blogs and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.280 
material connected to the top blogs and
there<00:00:05.970> are<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.150> reasons<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.930> first

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
there are two reasons for that first

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.440 
there are two reasons for that first
it's<00:00:08.069> easier<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.400> keep<00:00:08.550> track<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.330> can

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
it's easier to keep track of it you can

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.299 
it's easier to keep track of it you can
connect<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.019> your<00:00:10.230> vest<00:00:10.500> or<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.010> your<00:00:11.130> bag

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
connect it to your vest or to your bag

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.360 
connect it to your vest or to your bag
and<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> know<00:00:12.240> where<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.660> top<00:00:13.230> plug<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.769> but

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
and you know where the top plug is but

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.180 
and you know where the top plug is but
second<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.120> Lily<00:00:15.360> material<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:17.070> is

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
second this is Lily material and this is

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.920 
second this is Lily material and this is
what<00:00:17.369> connects<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.029> tip<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> rod<00:00:18.690> so

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
what connects to the tip of the rod so

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.480 
what connects to the tip of the rod so
in<00:00:19.140> case<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.439> ever<00:00:19.560> break<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:20.100> out<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.369> the

done in person and I know it happens
every<00:00:39.360> now<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> person<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.320> gonna

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410

be tying the line to the tie to the tip
of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> rod<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.719> really

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
of the rod and this here is really

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.540 
of the rod and this here is really
fragile<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> don't<00:00:46.829> put<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.100> inside<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
fragile if you don't put it inside and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.240 
fragile if you don't put it inside and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
protect it very easy to snap so the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.930 
protect it very easy to snap so the
person's<00:00:50.610> tying<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> knot<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.530> you'll<00:00:52.530> break

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
person's tying the knot and you'll break

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
person's tying the knot and you'll break
and<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.329> could<00:00:54.570> be<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.079> end<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.410> day<00:00:55.559> for

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and that could be the end of the day for

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.959 
and that could be the end of the day for
some<00:00:56.370> fishing<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.149> what<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.780> here

into certain amount hold it and pull it
to<00:02:43.560> essentially<00:02:44.040> stretch<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:45.240> lilium

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
to essentially stretch the lilium

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.750 
to essentially stretch the lilium
material<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.470> kind<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.770> make<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> cinch<00:02:47.640> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
material and kind of make a cinch a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.330 
material and kind of make a cinch a
little<00:02:48.030> bit<00:02:48.150> more<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.110> then<00:02:49.860> with<00:02:50.220> your

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
little bit more and then with your

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
little bit more and then with your
lighter<00:02:50.640> you're<00:02:51.000> just<00:02:51.180> gonna<00:02:51.300> cinch<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.960> a

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
lighter you're just gonna cinch it a

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.340 
lighter you're just gonna cinch it a
little<00:02:52.890> bit<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.390> be<00:02:54.510> very<00:02:54.750> careful

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
little bit you have to be very careful

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.740 
little bit you have to be very careful
not<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.130> burn<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.180> he<00:02:57.300> could<00:02:57.480> mouch

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
not to burn this because he could mouch

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.570 
not to burn this because he could mouch
and<00:02:58.050> it<00:02:58.110> could<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:58.320> fall<00:02:58.500> off<00:03:01.460> so<00:03:02.460> you're

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
and it could just fall off so you're

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.830 
and it could just fall off so you're
gonna<00:03:02.670> cinch<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:04.580> just<00:03:05.580> until<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.540> kind<00:03:06.780> of

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
gonna cinch it just until you kind of

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.550 
gonna cinch it just until you kind of
kind<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> traps<00:03:08.280> in<00:03:08.640> there<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:09.990> a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
kind of traps in there so this is a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.290 
kind of traps in there so this is a
little<00:03:11.520> bit<00:03:11.790> more<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:13.710> know<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:14.130> good<00:03:14.459> if

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
little bit more you know it's good if

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.810 
little bit more you know it's good if
you<00:03:15.570> have<00:03:15.750> tip<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.709> in<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> field

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
you have tip it with you in the field

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.449 
you have tip it with you in the field
just<00:03:18.110> make<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> few<00:03:19.410> wraps<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.860> tip<00:03:20.040> it<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.370> make

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
just make a few wraps of tip it and make

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.000 
just make a few wraps of tip it and make
a<00:03:20.489> knot<00:03:20.760> just<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.330> reinforce<00:03:21.660> it<00:03:22.170> if<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.890> have

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
a knot just to reinforce it if you have

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.190 
a knot just to reinforce it if you have
super<00:03:23.250> super<00:03:23.850> glue<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.300> something<00:03:24.540> though<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
super super glue or something though you

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.810 
super super glue or something though you
can<00:03:25.350> put<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.590> top<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:26.130> put<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.489> drop<00:03:26.700> of

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
can put on top of it just put a drop of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.970 
can put on top of it just put a drop of
it<00:03:27.120> or<00:03:27.300> when<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.540> get<00:03:27.750> home<00:03:27.959> put<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.709> drop<00:03:28.950> of

it or when you get home put a drop of
super<00:03:29.400> glue<00:03:29.430> right<00:03:29.820> here<00:03:29.870> but<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:32.150> is<00:03:33.150> enough

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
super glue right here but this is enough

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.660 
super glue right here but this is enough
for<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.140> quick<00:03:34.440> field<00:03:34.800> repair<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.459> you<00:03:35.520> can

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
for a quick field repair and you can

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.660 
for a quick field repair and you can
continue<00:03:36.090> using<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.480> rod
