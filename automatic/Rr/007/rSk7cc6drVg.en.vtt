Hellinger<00:00:01.800> motor<00:00:02.159> we<00:00:02.400> just<00:00:02.670> got<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.149> we<00:00:03.659> want

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
Hellinger motor we just got in we want

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.450 
Hellinger motor we just got in we want
to<00:00:03.960> show<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:04.230> some<00:00:04.590> of<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.800> differences

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
to show you some of the differences

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.330 
to show you some of the differences
they've<00:00:06.269> made<00:00:06.479> a<00:00:06.510> lot<00:00:06.689> of<00:00:06.720> changes<00:00:07.050> in<00:00:07.590> o.9

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
they've made a lot of changes in o.9

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.310 
they've made a lot of changes in o.9
one<00:00:09.089> of<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.299> things<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.809> they<00:00:09.960> went<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
one of the things is they went to a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.220 
one of the things is they went to a
smaller<00:00:10.769> alma<00:00:11.219> mater<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.820> notice<00:00:12.749> that<00:00:12.990> they

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
smaller alma mater and notice that they

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.799 
smaller alma mater and notice that they
changed<00:00:14.039> the<00:00:14.160> balancer<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.599> got<00:00:15.749> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
changed the balancer on it it's got a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.240 
changed the balancer on it it's got a
different<00:00:16.020> water<00:00:16.350> pump<00:00:16.680> pulley<00:00:16.950> they've

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
different water pump pulley they've

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
different water pump pulley they've
changed<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.789> power<00:00:18.029> steering<00:00:18.390> pump<00:00:18.529> so

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
changed the power steering pump so

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
changed the power steering pump so
there's<00:00:19.769> been<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.160> changes<00:00:20.429> that<00:00:20.880> don't

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
there's been some changes that don't

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.029 
there's been some changes that don't
have<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.269> self-contained<00:00:21.900> reservoir<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.890> no

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
have a self-contained reservoir on it no

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:23.509 
have a self-contained reservoir on it no
more

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
more

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.460 
more
well<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.300> there's<00:00:24.539> been<00:00:24.689> some<00:00:24.900> changes<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
well so there's been some changes of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.980 
well so there's been some changes of
course<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.279> intake<00:00:26.759> has<00:00:27.089> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.480> looks<00:00:27.839> like

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
course the intake has a lot looks like

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.140 
course the intake has a lot looks like
an<00:00:28.140> ls1<00:00:28.500> intake<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.220> notice<00:00:29.580> how<00:00:29.730> Staller

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
an ls1 intake but notice how Staller

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.980 
an ls1 intake but notice how Staller
this<00:00:30.779> motor<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.199> rated<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.769> 375<00:00:32.250> horse<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.360> if

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 
this motor is rated at 375 horse and if

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.240 
this motor is rated at 375 horse and if
you<00:00:34.110> notice<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.710> back

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you notice on the back

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310 
you notice on the back
since<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> o9<00:00:36.210> challenging<00:00:36.840> get<00:00:37.080> it<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
since the o9 challenging get it with a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
since the o9 challenging get it with a
six-speed<00:00:37.790> it's<00:00:38.790> got<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.390> dual<00:00:39.570> diaphragm

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
six-speed it's got the dual diaphragm

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
six-speed it's got the dual diaphragm
clutch<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> real<00:00:41.250> heavy<00:00:41.490> clutch<00:00:41.820> use<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
clutch on a real heavy clutch use the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.050 
clutch on a real heavy clutch use the
same<00:00:42.630> type<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:42.960> clutch<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:44.070> used<00:00:44.460> like<00:00:44.760> on

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
same type of clutch that's used like on

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.250 
same type of clutch that's used like on
a<00:00:45.170> LS<00:00:46.170> 9<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.160> new<00:00:47.310> Camaro<00:00:48.050> 2010<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
a LS 9 or the new Camaro 2010 with the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.620 
a LS 9 or the new Camaro 2010 with the
ls3<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> six-speed<00:00:50.550> has<00:00:51.150> a<00:00:51.180> clutch<00:00:51.600> very

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
ls3 with a six-speed has a clutch very

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.140 
ls3 with a six-speed has a clutch very
similar<00:00:52.470> to<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.740> here<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.760> there's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> lot<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
similar to this here so there's a lot of

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.240 
similar to this here so there's a lot of
differences<00:00:54.840> they've<00:00:55.110> changed<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.680> shape<00:00:55.920> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
differences they've changed the shape of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.160 
differences they've changed the shape of
the<00:00:56.670> exhaust<00:00:56.970> manifolds<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.780> went<00:00:57.990> to<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the exhaust manifolds and went to a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.550 
the exhaust manifolds and went to a
cast-iron<00:00:58.800> manifold<00:00:59.690> on<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.110> with<00:01:01.350> some

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:01.560 
cast-iron manifold on this with some

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.130 
cast-iron manifold on this with some
heat<00:01:01.740> tapers<00:01:02.340> but<00:01:03.060> this<00:01:03.300> motor<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.750> rated<00:01:03.930> at

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
heat tapers but this motor is rated at

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.099 
heat tapers but this motor is rated at
375<00:01:04.619> horse<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:06.000> fuel<00:01:06.299> line<00:01:06.539> they've<00:01:06.840> changed

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:07.109 
375 horse the fuel line they've changed

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.440 
375 horse the fuel line they've changed
the<00:01:07.289> fuel<00:01:07.560> rails<00:01:07.770> some<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.700> course<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.179> has<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the fuel rails some of course it has the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.529 
the fuel rails some of course it has the
pins<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.979> put<00:01:11.189> adding<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> tap<00:01:11.909> top

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and your PCV hose but it's basically the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.859 
and your PCV hose but it's basically the
same<00:01:17.820> motor<00:01:18.179> as<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:19.109> the<00:01:19.259> past<00:01:19.469> you<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.460> see

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
same motor as in the past you can see

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
same motor as in the past you can see
they've<00:01:21.869> changed<00:01:21.899> a<00:01:22.350> few<00:01:22.530> things<00:01:22.829> with<00:01:23.130> this

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
they've changed a few things with this

they've changed a few things with this
they<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.270> does<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.990> variable<00:01:25.499> cam<00:01:25.740> timing

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
they this does have variable cam timing

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.980 
they this does have variable cam timing

just like their notice it has an intake
more<00:02:03.959> like<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.530> Challenger<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.819> little

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
more like the Challenger it's a little

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.980 
more like the Challenger it's a little
taller<00:02:06.270> intake<00:02:06.959> but<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.540> going<00:02:09.540> to<00:02:09.630> make<00:02:09.780> more

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
taller intake but it going to make more

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.570 
taller intake but it going to make more
this<00:02:10.350> engine<00:02:10.830> actually<00:02:11.010> makes<00:02:11.510> 390<00:02:12.510> horse<00:02:12.750> now

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
this engine actually makes 390 horse now

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.730 
this engine actually makes 390 horse now
so<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.150> going<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.390> be<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.510> real<00:02:14.810> bear<00:02:15.080> so

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so this is going to be a real bear so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.070 
so this is going to be a real bear so
with<00:02:15.920> headers<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.460> programming<00:02:17.210> but<00:02:17.690> notice

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
with headers and programming but notice

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.230 
with headers and programming but notice
for<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.830> guys<00:02:19.040> that's<00:02:19.400> really<00:02:19.520> close<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.940> the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
for the guys that's really close to the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.330 
for the guys that's really close to the
radiator<00:02:20.660> these<00:02:21.230> come<00:02:21.620> out<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:21.980> throttle

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
radiator these come out and the throttle

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.730 
radiator these come out and the throttle
body<00:02:22.430> turns<00:02:22.850> straight<00:02:23.240> up<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.560> going

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
body turns straight up so this is going

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.170 
body turns straight up so this is going
to<00:02:24.800> make<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.130> lot<00:02:25.280> easier<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.970> lot<00:02:26.150> of

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to make it a lot easier and a lot of

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.970 
to make it a lot easier and a lot of
applications<00:02:26.930> even<00:02:27.110> putting<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.740> street

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
applications even putting it in street

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.530 
applications even putting it in street
rods<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.760> course<00:02:28.970> they<00:02:29.150> come<00:02:29.360> with<00:02:29.510> a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
rods of course they come with a

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.930 
rods of course they come with a
mechanical<00:02:30.140> fan<00:02:30.380> which<00:02:30.650> can<00:02:30.860> come<00:02:31.130> off<00:02:31.340> but

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
mechanical fan which can come off but

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.540 
mechanical fan which can come off but
notice<00:02:32.330> now<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.990> alternator<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.740> Paris

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
notice now that the alternator the Paris

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.950 
notice now that the alternator the Paris
tier<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.880> Larry<00:02:35.090> took<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.450> power<00:02:35.600> steering

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
tier and Larry took the power steering

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.130 
tier and Larry took the power steering
off<00:02:36.200> because<00:02:36.520> he's<00:02:37.520> changing<00:02:38.390> over<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> GM

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
off because he's changing over to a GM

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.590 
off because he's changing over to a GM
pump<00:02:39.440> because<00:02:39.650> this<00:02:39.830> is<00:02:39.920> going<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.460> Jeep<00:02:41.300> and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
pump because this is going in a Jeep and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.840 
pump because this is going in a Jeep and
the<00:02:42.080> compressor<00:02:42.590> everything's<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.250> side

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
the compressor everything's on one side

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.260 
the compressor everything's on one side
now<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.080> they're<00:02:45.350> back<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.980> where<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.700> top

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
now and so they're back to where the top

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
where the older ones had at a different

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.360 
where the older ones had at a different
location<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.410> small<00:02:57.740> one<00:02:57.980> here's<00:02:58.220> the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
location and the small one here's the

pressure to the heater and the bigger
one<00:03:00.709> here<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> suction<00:03:01.400> side<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.910> pump

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
one here on the suction side of the pump

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.480 
one here on the suction side of the pump
return<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.530> there's<00:03:03.800> going<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.010> be<00:03:04.070> some<00:03:04.340> neat

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
return so there's going to be some neat

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.940 
return so there's going to be some neat
things<00:03:04.790> with<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.150> motor<00:03:05.480> it's<00:03:06.260> got<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.680> six

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
things with this motor it's got the six

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.330 
things with this motor it's got the six
one<00:03:07.130> style<00:03:07.490> heads<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.840> know<00:03:09.170> nine<00:03:09.470> just

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
one style heads on it you know nine just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.250 
one style heads on it you know nine just
like<00:03:10.490> that<00:03:10.760> five<00:03:11.150> seven<00:03:11.660> you've<00:03:11.810> seen<00:03:12.020> that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
like that five seven you've seen that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.770 
like that five seven you've seen that
was<00:03:12.380> next<00:03:12.620> door<00:03:12.830> that's<00:03:13.670> out<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.630> new

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
was next door that's out of the new

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.930 
was next door that's out of the new
challenger<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.470> has<00:03:15.680> six<00:03:15.980> one<00:03:16.190> heads<00:03:16.550> on<00:03:16.790> it

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
challenger it has six one heads on it

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.759 
challenger it has six one heads on it
that's<00:03:17.360> one<00:03:17.660> of<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.840> reason<00:03:18.230> they're<00:03:18.380> making

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
that's one of the reason they're making

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.910 
that's one of the reason they're making
the<00:03:18.860> horsepower<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.200> will<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.650> real

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
the horsepower so this will be a real

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.330 
the horsepower so this will be a real
neat<00:03:22.239> application<00:03:23.830> especially<00:03:24.830> if<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.130> want

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
neat application especially if you want

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.870 
neat application especially if you want
to<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.580> an<00:03:25.760> automatic<00:03:27.220> Larry's<00:03:28.220> putting<00:03:28.580> flex

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
to do an automatic Larry's putting flex

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.150 
to do an automatic Larry's putting flex
plate<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.480> back<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:29.930> because<00:03:30.709> this<00:03:30.920> one's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
plate on the back now because this one's

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.210 
plate on the back now because this one's
going<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.370> get<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:32.440> different<00:03:33.440> transmission<00:03:34.130> I

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
going to get a different transmission I

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.940 
going to get a different transmission I
think<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.519> 518<00:03:35.300> behind<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.290> since<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:36.739> going

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
think a 518 behind it since it's going

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.970

the only one the one on the right might
be<00:03:48.769> a<00:03:48.950> problem<00:03:49.430> because<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.760> comes<00:03:50.030> straight

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
be a problem because it comes straight
