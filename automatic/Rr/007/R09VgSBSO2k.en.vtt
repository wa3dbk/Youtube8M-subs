so what i do is i select the tree i want
which<00:01:10.160> generally<00:01:10.729> is<00:01:10.880> nice<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.899> tall<00:01:12.140> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
not a difficult process but it's a lot

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.249 
not a difficult process but it's a lot
of<00:01:22.729> physical<00:01:23.119> work<00:01:23.420> especially<00:01:23.750> when<00:01:24.140> you're

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
of physical work especially when you're

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.170 
of physical work especially when you're
doing<00:01:24.380> several<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:25.009> them<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.729> just<00:01:25.940> grab

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
doing several of them and you just grab

doing several of them and you just grab
it<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.420> with<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.229> bark<00:01:27.440> on<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.770> log<00:01:27.950> you<00:01:28.220> just

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
it and with the bark on the log you just

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.529 
it and with the bark on the log you just
in<00:01:29.030> long<00:01:29.899> strokes<00:01:30.830> like<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.399> you<00:01:31.820> peel<00:01:32.270> that

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
in long strokes like so you peel that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.380 
in long strokes like so you peel that
log<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.190> peel<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.610> bark<00:01:34.759> off<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.270> then

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
log and you peel the bark off and then

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.590 
log and you peel the bark off and then
you're<00:01:35.540> at<00:01:35.720> you're<00:01:36.049> really<00:01:36.409> left<00:01:36.680> with<00:01:36.890> a

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
beautiful straight relatively smooth log

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.560 
beautiful straight relatively smooth log
and<00:01:45.829> you<00:01:46.460> can<00:01:46.610> use<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.880> to<00:01:46.970> build<00:01:47.119> with<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.540> I

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
and you can use it to build with it I

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.480 
and you can use it to build with it I
could<00:01:47.869> use<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.350> place<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.560> say<00:01:48.860> a<00:01:48.890> beam

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
could use it in the place of say a beam

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.910 
could use it in the place of say a beam
that<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.909> buy<00:01:50.090> at<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.270> store<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.770> should

that you buy at the store and it should

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.560 
that you buy at the store and it should
last<00:01:52.100> forever<00:01:52.340> because<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.180> off<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
last forever because it's up off the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.679 
last forever because it's up off the
ground<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:54.380> appealed<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:55.579> it<00:01:55.729> can<00:01:55.909> dry<00:01:56.240> and

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
ground it's appealed so it can dry and

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.260 
ground it's appealed so it can dry and
cure<00:01:56.990> out<00:01:57.229> what<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.799> have<00:01:58.009> here<00:01:58.460> is<00:01:58.579> this<00:01:59.090> is

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
cure out what we have here is this is

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.120 
cure out what we have here is this is
where<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.509> limb<00:01:59.899> was<00:02:00.380> sticking<00:02:00.770> out<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.040> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
where a limb was sticking out of the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.819 
where a limb was sticking out of the
tree<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.700> even<00:02:02.390> though<00:02:02.509> I<00:02:02.540> I<00:02:02.990> chopped<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.680> off

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
tree and even though I I chopped it off

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.800 
tree and even though I I chopped it off
smooth<00:02:04.159> say<00:02:04.460> with<00:02:04.610> an<00:02:04.759> axe<00:02:04.939> or<00:02:05.240> probably<00:02:05.689> a

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
smooth say with an axe or probably a

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.469 
smooth say with an axe or probably a
chainsaw<00:02:06.759> when<00:02:07.759> you're<00:02:07.909> barking<00:02:08.390> up

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
chainsaw when you're barking up

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.090 
chainsaw when you're barking up
sometimes<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:09.049> bite<00:02:09.290> into<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.590> hardwood

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
sometimes you bite into that hardwood

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.620 
sometimes you bite into that hardwood
because<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.610> grains<00:02:10.850> run<00:02:11.090> in<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.269> different

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
because the grains run in a different

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.300 
because the grains run in a different
direction<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.200> it's<00:02:12.320> pretty<00:02:12.560> dense<00:02:12.799> so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
direction and it's pretty dense so

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.250 
direction and it's pretty dense so
sometimes<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.850> really<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.690> fight<00:02:15.019> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
sometimes you really have to fight to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.069 
sometimes you really have to fight to
get<00:02:15.410> through<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.040> then<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.390> was<00:02:17.750> us<00:02:17.930> of

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
get through it and then it was us of

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.050 
get through it and then it was us of
doing<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.860> bite<00:02:19.220> into<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.820> wood<00:02:20.030> a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
doing that you can bite into your wood a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.390 
doing that you can bite into your wood a
little<00:02:20.269> bit<00:02:20.570> and<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.260> guess<00:02:21.829> it<00:02:21.980> gives<00:02:22.070> us<00:02:22.250> some

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
little bit and I guess it gives us some

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.330 
little bit and I guess it gives us some
character<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.290> kind<00:02:24.829> of<00:02:24.920> run<00:02:25.040> into<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
situation on all those knots like that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.199 
situation on all those knots like that
some<00:02:27.920> are<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.310> little<00:02:28.519> bit<00:02:28.640> more<00:02:28.790> stubborn
