 euros 2 6 euros or easy cash 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.540
 I have to renegotiate a little bit 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.700
 benefited must say that as I am 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.590
 as if the second time I went there 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.650
 to this one hides hard enjoy gesture and 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.560
 price trading 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.250
 and besides the happy cash there is the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.769
 happy cash 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.159
 I saw this game is a fact to manic 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.540
 shoot a port so a match author 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.250
 Japanese have never left me in France 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.340
 good you surprise me and manic shooter they 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.720
 are not really translated is out on 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.609
 our territory yet they are 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 great games little dedication to your 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.459
 kings to my twin yellow brother who him in 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.319
 is a big fan of the manic shooter 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.170
 Besides, I wonder if he knows 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:07.709
 on and so he was at 20 euros I 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.260
 noticed that dared that was shit I fired 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.359
 the label of the cash plaid which he is 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.579
 still there and I noticed he had 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:18.989
 put on the shelf since May 2012 when that 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.090
 was a little while almost two years 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.829
 and I want it is put at 20 euros I say 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.849
 I'm just going to kids at half price 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.040
 from for 10 euros 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.989
 I finally bought myself to this is 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.609
 pretty unfair games that such water and 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.049
 264 in box and more then I'm listening 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.209
 it's still funny this 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.739
 anecdote since I had seen empty 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.909
 attics bah just right there was 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.199
 also that I had bought in a vacuum 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.190
 attics of the last Sunday the 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:46.530
 it was like his name was Michel 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.299
 fighters now that I had to 12 euros to 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.160
 place of 20 euros in negotiation and 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.480
 it was last game of 100 kg 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.970
 had missed helping other young people are 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.290
 four in a box and even had two for 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.329
 20 euros and suddenly I was able to recover 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.060
 in easy cash for 20 euros 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.629
 plus a super good and bow so a bad 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.409
 for a good 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:08.370
 and I had one last one in games at 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:10.280
 easycash doom and there good the box there is 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.440
 complete but the box is smashed to 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.139
 in this part at the level of the callus 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.109
 Barrès broke down on that side but 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.820
 good I say the full so but I saw 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.169
 what I think is a little bit 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.580
 shit is a little bit expensive anyway 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.780
 after some discussions with the 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.639
 frozen seller could have hen 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.330
 I cried I could negotiate for 10 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.860
 euros because I said but it damaged 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.659
 crush after it is a super good condition 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.680
 I see it ready willingly for 15 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.150
 euro but I think the framework we 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.740
 get used to a little too much of the state I could 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.120
 to have for 10 euros so here it is 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.360
 all for shopping this week with 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.379
 three retro games in a box 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.990
 two young people are four unfair by 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:48.689
 tendo a game xbox compared to june games 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.419

 and especially a briefcase feel at 3 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.259

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.310

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.080

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.189
 in front of the cover 2010 by the way 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.479
 you recommend it by beating 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:20.310
 precisely because there are games 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.189
 sochi olympics 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.259
 if I read well said and until a 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.669
 official game will go out or I do not know 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.139
 if there is one that came out ben I you 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.849
 would advise playing vancouver 2010 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.860
 which is still pretty good not 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.289
 pretty good even very good I did the 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.599
 platinum trophy on 102 other games 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.219
 here they are so I finished the 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.710
 darkness 2 I made the platinum trophy 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.240

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.939

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.180
 I continued a second part for 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.830
 do the rest of the trophies is 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.469
 frankly the atmosphere is 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.560
 anyway and still superb in this 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.659
 game that respects the atmosphere very well 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.129
 unhealthy beyond the movie this one a good 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:00.569
 it's really a good care then a 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:02.099
 good surprise at the forum where you from there 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.629

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:04.860
 fixed do a big fixette on the 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.229
 graphics that are frankly enough 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.969
 old and suddenly it makes three 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:11.219
 trophies then I continued 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:12.389
