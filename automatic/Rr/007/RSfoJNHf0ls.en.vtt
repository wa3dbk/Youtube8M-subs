00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.769
 hello and welcome back to the 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.510
 tunes we are not busy today 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.730
 with a song but with one 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.059
 scale and the duathlon conductor 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.560
 or also known as a young conductor 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 so the very first which one it now 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 employ is almost the finger 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.010
 attitude or finger set and that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
 It is important that you join four 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.810
 choose the concrete weather 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.609
 takes place and survive is now 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 a finger lift bunch is a finger 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.140
 assigned that means who now is the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.630
 My first point is then there is the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.970
 index finger of the middle finger from 59 46 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.490
 and the little ones sit and if 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.040
 now a scale does not matter 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.660
 which which faces in use 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.900
 So in which many just the side 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.160
 the other fingers have to push over 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.930
 their stay colorful 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.220
 that is, I'll show you the short time in 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.220
 I the gamut player 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.299
 that has quite simply in the background and 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.299
 though he does everytime you go to 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.579
 example the middle finger plays and with 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.289
 the whole hand is reflected by rib 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.750
 will almost make the way with the 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.009
 little finger away from power red and for 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.229
 the next day back to printing 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.710
 trends completely unnecessary way you have to even 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.439
 not do 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.049
 That's why it's important that you just 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.490
 always with his movie about the bunch 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.560
 stay that is a bit at the beginning 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.000
 difficult but with a bit of exercise 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 you get that presentation 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.259
 In addition there is the finger like you 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.119
 I 'm sure that's the first one 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.799
 Second third and fourth mistake 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.819
 thumb is no longer temporarily with the 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.619
 Strictly speaking, the power plant is not like that 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.720
 let's start with the scale I 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.689
 Show them now on the basis of this 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.299
 So filmes is index finger in the fourth 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.649
 point means in the fifth sixth and 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.119
 small fourth to seventh point and it 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.170
 gives the pages from bottom to top so 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.959
 from the deep eva bitzer highest you 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.350
 starts with the middle finger so the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.980
 second finger then comes the little one 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.720
 finger in manners and then it goes to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.720
 next page with the index finger 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.060
 then comes the middle finger 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.290
 2 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.420
 the filter of the index finger on the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.420
 next page 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.260
 So the 3 and then would be smaller 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.950
 so I'll do the first three pages 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:04.740
 with the numbering is relatively easy 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.740
 to remember by simply saying 212 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.400
 13 here 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.920
 so is in the first three pages on the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 next 3 it goes on if it is you 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.040
 if it is not already in it 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.660
 no problem, I was looking at it just yet 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.040
 time and again I want 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.860
 do not fool anything anymore 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.720
 but 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.190
 For that the cell fell back 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.780
 together 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.690
 on the next page there are 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.650
 employee with 1 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.650
 3 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.640
 then on the next with 2 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.980
 4 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.360
 on the side 1 and 2 you could now 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.740
 make the little finger take it 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.680
 but here's the tone in principle 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.470
 also already to the end because it is the same 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.569
 ton I is I am there again slowly 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.569
 in front 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.569
 2 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.080
 12 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.360
 when 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.800
 9 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.730
 here 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.730
 1 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.510
 2 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.560
 12 and which is now an exercise that 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.210
 should always do something 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.680
 I do not demotivate that in the beginning 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.960
 very unfamiliar you need a time 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.689
 long until you come in 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.759
 Of course, that's it in the beginning 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:38.069
 very slowly , so you everything moves 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.639
 can understand he is doing that is 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:48.000
 it better to play slow and clean 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:51.620
 when fast sounds defiant and that means 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.620
 could start very slowly 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.900
 my speed comes with the time 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.900
 anyway 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.310
 b 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.230
 more 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.230
 so and so that was fine 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.700
 and so on 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.140
 which, of course, then the next one 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.620
 Exercise it would be the scale again 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.620
 to go down 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.719
 his story of how high he'll be in the beginning 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.430
 m 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:50.030
 what in the principle of the scale if 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.770
 you still have to pluck then you have 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.360
 I would weather the same weather 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.310
 window fades in there now 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.850
 a tutorial where i gamble with the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.380
 explain plectrum again so that 's it 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.420
 again for today if the back-up 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.490
 on even more scale or on his 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.920
 tutorials will click on the channel 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.780
 the buttons write comments that 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.110
 wishes otherwise until next time 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.110
 Yes
