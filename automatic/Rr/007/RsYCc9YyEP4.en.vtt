00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
rely on one person teeth or fun like a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:28.660 
rely on one person teeth or fun like a
mayonnaise<00:01:25.939> at<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.539> time<00:01:26.840> though<00:01:27.079> that<00:01:27.979> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
mayonnaise at a time though that the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.510 
mayonnaise at a time though that the
mentorian<00:01:29.420> thing<00:01:29.719> I<00:01:30.140> think<00:01:30.799> one<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.310> them

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
mentorian thing I think one of them

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.109 
mentorian thing I think one of them
would<00:01:31.670> be<00:01:31.850> when<00:01:32.350> your<00:01:33.429> family<00:01:34.429> or<00:01:34.909> your

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
would be when your family or your

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.109 
would be when your family or your
friends<00:01:35.149> are<00:01:35.890> talking<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.280> while<00:01:37.700> having

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
friends are talking to you while having

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.539 
friends are talking to you while having
food<00:01:38.299> in<00:01:38.360> their<00:01:38.539> mouth<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:38.869> it's<00:01:39.110> kind<00:01:39.439> of

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
food in their mouth and it's kind of

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.590 
food in their mouth and it's kind of
horrible<00:01:40.549> because<00:01:40.880> you<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:41.149> to<00:01:41.299> lick<00:01:41.450> weight

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
horrible because you have to lick weight

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.980 
horrible because you have to lick weight
them<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.929> stuff<00:01:42.079> for<00:01:42.259> me<00:01:42.380> yeah<00:01:43.750> one<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
them and stuff for me yeah one of the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.389 
them and stuff for me yeah one of the
things<00:01:45.049> I<00:01:45.409> find<00:01:45.649> most<00:01:45.770> annoying<00:01:46.100> is<00:01:46.369> when

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
things I find most annoying is when

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.359 
things I find most annoying is when
everybody<00:01:47.209> talks<00:01:47.659> at<00:01:47.899> once<00:01:47.979> because<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.189> is

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
everybody talks at once because it is

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.039 
everybody talks at once because it is
I've<00:01:49.610> got<00:01:49.819> a<00:01:49.849> big<00:01:50.030> family<00:01:50.239> anyway<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:50.929> was

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
I've got a big family anyway but was

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.210 
I've got a big family anyway but was
extended<00:01:51.590> family<00:01:52.009> it's<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:52.369> it's<00:01:52.909> chaotic<00:01:54.220> I

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
extended family it's just it's chaotic I

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.789 
extended family it's just it's chaotic I
think<00:01:55.970> probably<00:01:56.289> one<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:57.439> most<00:01:57.560> fun

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
think probably one of the most fun

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.859 
think probably one of the most fun
things<00:01:58.099> is<00:01:58.310> sometimes<00:01:58.789> my<00:01:59.149> parents<00:01:59.299> or<00:01:59.750> my

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
things is sometimes my parents or my

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.440 
things is sometimes my parents or my
family<00:02:00.349> they<00:02:00.439> play<00:02:00.619> music<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.310> then<00:02:01.520> it's<00:02:02.239> all

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
family they play music and then it's all

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:12.309 
family they play music and then it's all
can<00:02:02.720> icon<00:02:02.959> here<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.489> just<00:02:04.489> candy<00:02:04.819> I<00:02:11.200> think<00:02:12.200> it

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
can icon here and just candy I think it

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.530 
can icon here and just candy I think it
would<00:02:12.440> be<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:13.459> everyone<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.879> take<00:02:14.000> time<00:02:14.269> when

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
would be for everyone to take time when

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.729 
would be for everyone to take time when
they're<00:02:14.660> speaking<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.349> might<00:02:15.739> not<00:02:15.920> be<00:02:16.069> a

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
they're speaking I might not be a

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.539 
they're speaking I might not be a
message<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.989> maybe<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.319> we<00:02:22.040> sometimes<00:02:22.250> have

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
message and maybe like we sometimes have

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.800 
message and maybe like we sometimes have
music<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.239> background<00:02:23.329> like

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
music on in the background like

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.660 
music on in the background like
Christmas<00:02:24.230> colors<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.980> stuff<00:02:25.100> I'm<00:02:25.609> not

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
Christmas colors and stuff I'm not

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.080 
Christmas colors and stuff I'm not
having<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.720> well<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.760> think<00:02:28.760> you'd

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
having that one so well I think you'd

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.690 
having that one so well I think you'd
better<00:02:29.299> just<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.780> sit<00:02:30.440> down<00:02:30.650> speaks<00:02:31.340> about

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
better just to sit down speaks about

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:42.520 
better just to sit down speaks about
maybe<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.359> jolly<00:02:32.540> business<00:02:41.290> when<00:02:42.290> there

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
maybe just a jolly business when there

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.449

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
things better for I think me and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.099 
things better for I think me and
everyone<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:53.269> it's<00:02:53.540> just<00:02:53.750> by<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:53.989> time

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
everyone really it's just by the time

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.809 
everyone really it's just by the time
where<00:02:54.530> everyone<00:02:54.829> can<00:02:55.040> say<00:02:55.250> what<00:02:55.430> they<00:02:55.519> want<00:02:55.549> to

where everyone can say what they want to

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.520 
where everyone can say what they want to
say<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.389> there's<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.660> sense<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:57.019> family<00:02:57.410> and

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
say in there's a sense of family and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.559 
say in there's a sense of family and
everyone<00:02:57.859> can<00:02:58.040> everyone<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.910> talk<00:02:59.090> in<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.419> way

everyone can everyone can talk in a way

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.479 
everyone can everyone can talk in a way
where<00:03:00.019> they<00:03:00.530> can<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:00.829> hear<00:03:00.980> each<00:03:01.130> other<00:03:01.400> and

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
where they can all hear each other and

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.550 
where they can all hear each other and
it's<00:03:01.700> not<00:03:01.910> kind<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.540> a<00:03:02.630> flurry<00:03:02.959> of<00:03:03.079> excitement

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
it's not kind of a flurry of excitement

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.379 
it's not kind of a flurry of excitement
and<00:03:04.250> more<00:03:04.459> it's<00:03:04.579> good<00:03:04.730> although<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:05.060> buzz<00:03:05.239> is

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
and more it's good although that buzz is

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.420 
and more it's good although that buzz is
nice<00:03:05.599> I<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.620> think<00:03:06.829> it'd<00:03:06.919> be<00:03:07.040> better<00:03:07.220> if

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
nice I just think it'd be better if

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.930 
nice I just think it'd be better if
there's<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.480> way<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:09.139> make<00:03:09.950> sure<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.459> everyone

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.000 
there's a way to make sure that everyone
can<00:03:11.480> hear<00:03:11.630> each<00:03:11.780> other<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.769> just

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
can hear each other and it's it's just

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.729 
can hear each other and it's it's just
not<00:03:13.849> as<00:03:13.970> not<00:03:14.299> as<00:03:14.329> slow<00:03:14.660> as<00:03:14.900> having<00:03:15.319> my<00:03:15.440> person
