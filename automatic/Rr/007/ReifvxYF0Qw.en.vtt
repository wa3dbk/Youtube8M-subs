00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 alexander hello i have a few 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.799
 meter videos completed and I am 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.599
 always so excited about it 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.639
 a few gigs have to be uploaded 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.630
 where I say that and that does not like in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.700
 this video 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.680
 the payment in the second part of this 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.900
 You are still doing well here too 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.670
 not like just say why ding 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.840
 is just great yes it is this 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.180
 this samsung bridge 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.810
 you can do that I have you now 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.900
 now believes you two weeks in use 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.969
 unconditionally absolutely get the stell 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.390
 you also look at as and calculator 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.370
 from pc just installed a thing 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 was only I had a few misprints 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 Grimberg Ruble 4 update made 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.010
 afterwards the little head was there 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.100
 in it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 It was so that everything shows man's picture 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.059
 a strange story was postponed 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.570
 Rather, update made too great 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.980
 easy 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 now he is even a tick 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 faster he is super fast 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.559
 no secret matured is one 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.979
 It operates in an ultra-fast way 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.020
 Immediately felt as you hear 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.540
 none of it 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 the loner points once free me 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.119
 would say it is not now, of course 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.950
 So a 30 pages per minute train cellar 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.380
 but five times a sentence on us 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.720
 long is this single in any case 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 a very cool device is easy 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.180
 establish 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.340
 I still like it very much 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.600
 hope only because I have until now 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 still very satisfied 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.640
 a thing is only he has no 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 physical on off switch 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.049
 you have all sorts of power saving 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.869
 buttons or off but he 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.229
 consumes some power in standby 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.360
 whether now the measured 9 volts 9 watts 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.549
 I could fit an ammeter 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.860
 do not say because these gauges 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.180
 tend to be in the lower range 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 a bit inaccurate 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 but it consumes in standby power, the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.490
 you realize about that I have 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 noticed 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.990
 he has no externally are just 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.220
 noticed 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.200
 turned it has a little 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.610
 worth 9 watts I think 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.410
 not that much, but he 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.330
 consumed in standby play that is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.760
 a so far the only critic in the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.930
 disadvantage I found in the but 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.750
 I'm running really satisfied could 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.709
 he already 30 150 euro you have scanner 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.680
 fax first printer and scanner fax and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.739
 Copier in one went lightning fast 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.489
 Immediately , you 're a great animal 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:50.549
 still bite from me for you there is one 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:53.250
 eco saving mode eco eco saving mode yes ok 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.610
 lets you create your bad but then goes 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.970
 he goes and does and prints in the writing 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:05.700
 small scope the couple two toners 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.980
 Sparrow 5 percent or 1 I find one 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.680
 good idea makes the typeface something 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.200
 Keller I have saved it with toner and 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.150
 Most things do not need in high 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.100
 End quality could be printed out 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.549
 Set's easy as 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.670
 printer driver adjust that the great 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.209
 is it quietly heard nothing is it immediately 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.130
 the expression flashes very quickly 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.130
 That's why it fits cool
