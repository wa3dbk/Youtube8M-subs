00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 Today I'm going to spit fire using 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.550
 corn and it's this pyrotechnics that you go 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:21.810
 see in our special series 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:23.490
 I praise this experience was one of the most 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 legal I recorded in the world manual 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 but we've never had a super camera 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.199
 who could get the details of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.290
 spit fire using cornstarch 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:49.670
 so now you can see an explosion of dust 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:49.670
 and thousands of frames per second of the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.759
 a cool thing from various experiences 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.100
 Today's goal is that we can understand 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.240
 a little better what happens to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.399
 firing we need a 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.860
 fuel because the maize is 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.600
 that is the oxygen in the air and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.200
 some initial energy that is given 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 funk what I put in front of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.729
 fire happens much faster and much 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.619
 better if the fuel is well 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.880
 mixed with oxygen from the air 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.399
 that's why this maize so 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.440
 compact is very difficult to catch fire 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.110
 so let's look at the experience again 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.600
 you will notice that the maize just grabs 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.030
 fire from a certain distance or 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.550
 from a certain point where 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.550
 it is already well mixed with oxygen 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 but viruses with this one you find in 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.630
 mon album 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.170
 this video was recorded with the support of 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080
 language in dialogue this super camera says 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.300
 cool wolf to see how slow motion is that 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.680
 It's not just the cute summer with a 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300
 if you can get one for example 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.040
 happens inside the car engine 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.070
 show burst how it happens 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.540
 with the car engine you 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.060
 Can you understand how the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.850
 mixing of fuel with oxygen 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.920
 also lecturer prof with the maisena 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.620
 understand how it burned and with that the 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.370
 promoters who 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.590
 five 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.420
 I'll leave here both the two 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.420
 neighbors in our special series
