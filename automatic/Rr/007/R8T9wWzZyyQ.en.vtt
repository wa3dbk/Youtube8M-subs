with solutions of Khem and today we're
outside<00:00:13.120> and<00:00:13.450> we're<00:00:14.200> using<00:00:14.349> our<00:00:14.559> bng<00:00:15.400> sprayer

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
outside and we're using our bng sprayer

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.600 
outside and we're using our bng sprayer
and<00:00:16.000> the<00:00:16.059> actual<00:00:17.020> nozzle<00:00:17.560> is<00:00:17.680> starting<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.250> to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
and the actual nozzle is starting to to

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.180 
and the actual nozzle is starting to to
have<00:00:18.760> a<00:00:18.790> small<00:00:19.210> drip<00:00:19.710> product<00:00:20.710> and<00:00:20.920> if<00:00:21.070> you

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
have a small drip product and if you

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.480 
have a small drip product and if you
could<00:00:21.340> look<00:00:21.430> here<00:00:21.670> when<00:00:21.820> we<00:00:21.940> spray<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:24.340> it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
could look here when we spray when it

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.160 
could look here when we spray when it
shuts<00:00:24.730> down<00:00:24.820> it<00:00:25.090> continues<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.600> drip<00:00:25.810> a<00:00:25.900> pretty

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
shuts down it continues to drip a pretty

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.380 
shuts down it continues to drip a pretty
heavy<00:00:26.380> flow<00:00:26.770> so<00:00:27.400> how<00:00:27.760> about<00:00:27.850> we<00:00:28.060> take<00:00:28.240> this

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
heavy flow so how about we take this

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.690 
heavy flow so how about we take this

but just if you're out on the field

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.410 
but just if you're out on the field
that's<00:01:12.370> what<00:01:12.550> probably<00:01:12.730> you'll<00:01:13.000> have<00:01:13.030> with

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420

you so first things first we're gonna
diagnose<00:01:16.180> the<00:01:16.360> front<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:16.780> tip<00:01:17.050> here

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
diagnose the front of this tip here

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.870 
diagnose the front of this tip here
we're<00:01:17.800> going<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.980> take<00:01:18.190> off<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.520> retainer

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
we're going to take off the retainer

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.810 
we're going to take off the retainer
ring<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.350> typically<00:01:20.830> that's<00:01:21.070> a<00:01:21.280> hand<00:01:21.550> tight

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
ring and typically that's a hand tight

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.540 
ring and typically that's a hand tight
piece<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.900> equipment<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.380> really<00:01:24.160> no<00:01:24.310> tow

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
piece of equipment so really no tow

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.220 
piece of equipment so really no tow
there<00:01:24.790> other<00:01:25.120> than<00:01:25.360> just<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.750> little<00:01:25.900> bit<00:01:26.110> of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
there other than just a little bit of

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.100 
there other than just a little bit of
force<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.740> muscle<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.270> get<00:01:28.480> that<00:01:28.660> off<00:01:28.840> and

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
force and muscle so get that off and

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.250 
force and muscle so get that off and
then<00:01:29.350> your<00:01:29.530> your<00:01:29.950> tip<00:01:30.190> will<00:01:30.370> also<00:01:30.640> come<00:01:30.820> off

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
then your your tip will also come off

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.320 
then your your tip will also come off
now<00:01:32.260> once<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.920> have<00:01:32.950> remove<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:34.120> want

problem<00:01:52.780> now<00:01:53.290> if<00:01:53.650> this<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.190> perfectly<00:01:54.880> good

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
problem now if this is a perfectly good

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.450 
problem now if this is a perfectly good
condition<00:01:55.540> like<00:01:55.720> this<00:01:55.930> one<00:01:56.170> here<00:01:56.500> we're<00:01:57.370> going

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
condition like this one here we're going

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.310 
condition like this one here we're going
to<00:01:57.520> bypass<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:58.030> let's<00:01:58.540> take<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> look<00:01:59.050> at<00:01:59.200> the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
to bypass that let's take a look at the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.890 
to bypass that let's take a look at the
soft<00:01:59.590> seat<00:01:59.800> gasket<00:02:00.280> now<00:02:00.850> for<00:02:01.120> this<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.870> are

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
soft seat gasket now for this you are

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.930 
soft seat gasket now for this you are
going<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.260> require<00:02:02.530> like<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.280> said<00:02:03.520> two

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
going to require like I said two

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.030 
going to require like I said two
crescent<00:02:04.480> wants<00:02:04.960> to<00:02:05.050> support<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.710> actual

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
crescent wants to support the actual

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.819 
crescent wants to support the actual
wand<00:02:06.340> so<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.700> don't<00:02:06.910> bend<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:07.720> break<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.229> the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
wand so you don't bend and break and the

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:11.610 
wand so you don't bend and break and the
other<00:02:08.950> two<00:02:09.159> actually<00:02:09.429> remove<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.620> assembly

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
other two actually remove the assembly

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.960 
other two actually remove the assembly
here<00:02:11.859> so

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
here so

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.750 
here so
go<00:02:13.090> ahead<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.360> remove<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.620> once<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.520> get

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
go ahead and remove that so once you get

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870 
go ahead and remove that so once you get
that<00:02:15.820> broken<00:02:16.420> loose<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.280> come<00:02:18.520> back<00:02:18.670> and

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
that broken loose you come back and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.490 
that broken loose you come back and
actually<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:19.570> your<00:02:19.720> hands<00:02:20.050> now<00:02:20.470> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
actually do this with your hands now a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.190 
actually do this with your hands now a
tip<00:02:20.920> for<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.280> when<00:02:21.730> removing<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.360> section

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
tip for this when removing this section

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.190 
tip for this when removing this section
it's<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.980> good<00:02:24.250> thing<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.760> actually<00:02:24.960> hold<00:02:25.960> down

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it's a good thing to actually hold down

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.000 
it's a good thing to actually hold down
the<00:02:26.410> trigger<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.360> wand<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.010> what

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
the trigger of the of the wand and what

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.260 
the trigger of the of the wand and what
that<00:02:30.220> does<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.640> takes<00:02:30.820> some<00:02:31.060> of<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.240> pressure

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
that does it takes some of the pressure

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.750 
that does it takes some of the pressure
off<00:02:31.690> from<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.230> soft<00:02:32.530> seat<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.400> makes<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.640> lot

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
off from the soft seat so it makes a lot

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.840 
off from the soft seat so it makes a lot
easier<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.150> unscrew<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.830> I<00:02:36.100> am<00:02:36.490> actually

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
easier to unscrew this so I am actually

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.810 
easier to unscrew this so I am actually
pressing<00:02:37.270> down<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:38.080> trigger<00:02:38.760> right<00:02:39.760> now

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
pressing down on the trigger right now

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.120 
pressing down on the trigger right now
and<00:02:40.360> I'll<00:02:40.540> show<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.990> difference<00:02:41.410> once

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
and I'll show you the difference once

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.070 
and I'll show you the difference once
you<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:42.460> this<00:02:42.610> off<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.120> also<00:02:43.270> have<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> soft

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
you get this off you also have the soft

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.130 
you get this off you also have the soft
seat<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:45.010> between<00:02:45.520> those<00:02:45.760> two<00:02:45.940> items<00:02:46.300> if<00:02:46.630> I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
seat in between those two items if I

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.650 
seat in between those two items if I
release<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.740> trigger<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.700> can<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:49.030> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
release the trigger you can see the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.530 
release the trigger you can see the
actual<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.980> valve<00:02:51.250> comes<00:02:51.640> out<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.240> squeeze

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
actual the valve comes out if I squeeze

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.770 
actual the valve comes out if I squeeze
it<00:02:52.780> goes<00:02:53.260> right<00:02:53.530> back<00:02:54.010> in<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.910> that's<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:55.750> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
it goes right back in so that's so a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.600 
it goes right back in so that's so a
reason<00:02:56.170> for<00:02:56.290> squeezing<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.709> trigger<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.490> we

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
reason for squeezing the trigger so we

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.100 
reason for squeezing the trigger so we
take<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> pressure<00:02:58.120> off<00:02:58.360> our<00:02:58.600> soft<00:02:58.930> seat

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
take the pressure off our soft seat

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.640 
take the pressure off our soft seat
gasket<00:02:59.670> now<00:03:00.670> with<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.660> soft<00:03:01.930> seat<00:03:02.110> gasket

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
gasket now with the soft seat gasket

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.260 
gasket now with the soft seat gasket
you're<00:03:02.950> gonna<00:03:03.100> have<00:03:03.400> an<00:03:03.580> actual<00:03:03.850> built-in

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
you're gonna have an actual built-in

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.030 
you're gonna have an actual built-in
o-ring<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.840> that's<00:03:05.080> typically<00:03:05.590> what's<00:03:05.830> going

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
o-ring and that's typically what's going

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.370 
o-ring and that's typically what's going
to<00:03:06.070> go<00:03:06.220> wrong<00:03:06.450> another<00:03:07.450> reason<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.200> may

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
to go wrong another reason that this may

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.120 
to go wrong another reason that this may
fail<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.070> it's<00:03:09.220> put<00:03:09.820> in<00:03:10.170> backwards

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
fail is if it's put in backwards

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.370 
fail is if it's put in backwards
most<00:03:12.640> people<00:03:12.940> are<00:03:13.030> going<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.209> want<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.480> put<00:03:14.170> it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
most people are going to want to put it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.890 
most people are going to want to put it
with<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> cone<00:03:14.860> facing<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.510> actually

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
with the cone facing up that is actually

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.960 
with the cone facing up that is actually
incorrect<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.709> want<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:18.070> put<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.489> facing

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
incorrect you want to put it facing

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.720 
incorrect you want to put it facing
towards<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.300> actual<00:03:20.019> valve<00:03:20.320> as<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.519> see

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
towards the actual valve as you can see

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.009 
towards the actual valve as you can see
it<00:03:21.820> looks<00:03:21.940> like<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.269> doesn't<00:03:22.450> sit<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.840> there

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
it looks like it doesn't sit in there

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.620 
it looks like it doesn't sit in there
but<00:03:23.170> when<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.320> squeeze<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:24.070> goes<00:03:24.280> right<00:03:24.519> down

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
but when you squeeze it goes right down

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.630 
but when you squeeze it goes right down
so<00:03:25.630> these<00:03:26.200> are<00:03:26.440> typically<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.100> reasons<00:03:27.489> that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
so these are typically the reasons that

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.100 
so these are typically the reasons that
you<00:03:28.600> may<00:03:29.100> acquire<00:03:30.100> leak<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.850> last<00:03:31.660> one<00:03:31.930> though

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
you may acquire leak the last one though

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.380 
you may acquire leak the last one though
there's<00:03:32.800> a<00:03:32.920> spring<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.519> goes<00:03:33.760> right<00:03:34.000> inside

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
there's a spring that goes right inside

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.540 
there's a spring that goes right inside
of<00:03:34.420> here<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.440> have<00:03:35.680> one<00:03:35.950> too<00:03:36.190> to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
of here and I have one too to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.449 
of here and I have one too to
demonstrate<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.750> actually<00:03:38.200> sits<00:03:38.890> inside<00:03:39.100> of

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
demonstrate it actually sits inside of

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.330 
demonstrate it actually sits inside of
here<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.959> typically<00:03:40.959> if<00:03:41.080> this<00:03:41.290> guy<00:03:41.530> has<00:03:41.769> has<00:03:42.310> a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
here and typically if this guy has has a

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.449 
here and typically if this guy has has a
break<00:03:42.730> in<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.230> when<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.320> squeeze<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.950> doesn't

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
break in it when you squeeze it doesn't

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.580 
break in it when you squeeze it doesn't
go<00:03:45.549> back<00:03:45.760> into<00:03:46.060> its<00:03:46.180> proper<00:03:46.480> position<00:03:46.660> so

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
that's a quick and easy way to figure

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.370 
that's a quick and easy way to figure
this<00:03:49.060> guys<00:03:49.480> wrong<00:03:50.350> now<00:03:51.840> once<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:53.019> figure<00:03:53.350> out

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
this guys wrong now once we figure out

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.620 
this guys wrong now once we figure out
what<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.799> is<00:03:53.830> then<00:03:54.640> let's<00:03:55.060> put<00:03:55.299> this<00:03:55.420> guy<00:03:55.600> back

you're going to get this soft seat
gasket<00:04:01.420> you're<00:04:01.989> gonna<00:04:02.140> go<00:04:02.380> right<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:03.130> it

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
gasket you're gonna go right on to it

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.520 
gasket you're gonna go right on to it
remember<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:04.209> o-ring<00:04:04.600> side<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.290> valve

and just squeeze the trigger and that

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.110 
and just squeeze the trigger and that
will<00:04:08.650> actually<00:04:08.799> help<00:04:09.010> support<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:09.970> you

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
then get the actual assembly and you're

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.110 
then get the actual assembly and you're
gonna<00:04:13.150> go<00:04:13.420> ahead<00:04:13.480> and

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
gonna go ahead and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.490 
gonna go ahead and
attach<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.420> back<00:04:15.660> now<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.109> could<00:04:16.320> get<00:04:16.440> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
attach that back now this could get a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.920 
attach that back now this could get a
little<00:04:16.530> tricky<00:04:17.209> with<00:04:18.209> this<00:04:18.450> guy<00:04:18.630> here<00:04:18.840> because

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
little tricky with this guy here because

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.830 
little tricky with this guy here because
it<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.470> low<00:04:19.890> loose<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:20.940> typically<00:04:21.570> keep

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
it it is low loose so I typically keep

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.340 
it it is low loose so I typically keep
it<00:04:22.019> about<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.320> quarter<00:04:23.240> of<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.390> turn<00:04:24.600> back<00:04:24.960> on<00:04:25.230> the

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
it about a quarter of a turn back on the

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.570 
it about a quarter of a turn back on the
direction<00:04:25.710> you're<00:04:25.800> tightening<00:04:26.010> which<00:04:26.280> is<00:04:26.460> to

direction you're tightening which is to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.150 
direction you're tightening which is to
the<00:04:26.610> right<00:04:27.170> what<00:04:28.170> that<00:04:28.380> will<00:04:28.500> do<00:04:28.650> sometimes

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
the right what that will do sometimes

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.500
