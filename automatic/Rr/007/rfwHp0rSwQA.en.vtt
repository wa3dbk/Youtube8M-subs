00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
even though it was chunkier and kind of

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.180 
even though it was chunkier and kind of
less<00:04:00.990> updated<00:04:02.240> more<00:04:03.240> outdated<00:04:03.750> I<00:04:04.500> liked<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.130> a

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
less updated more outdated I liked it a

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.970 
less updated more outdated I liked it a
lot<00:04:05.370> more<00:04:05.550> than<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.880> wildcard<00:04:06.800> even<00:04:07.800> though

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
lot more than this wildcard even though

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.630 
lot more than this wildcard even though
my<00:04:08.630> this<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.810> thinner<00:04:10.170> than<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.620> Switchback<00:04:11.430> I

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
my this is thinner than the Switchback I

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.210 
my this is thinner than the Switchback I
this<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.690> still<00:04:13.170> pretty<00:04:13.290> chunky<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.890> really

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
I think it's really thick and it kind of

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.289 
I think it's really thick and it kind of
bulges<00:04:17.130> out<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.370> your<00:04:17.489> pocket<00:04:17.880> if<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.000> kind<00:04:18.239> of

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
bulges out in your pocket if you kind of

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.760 
bulges out in your pocket if you kind of
put<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.570> in<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:18.900> but<00:04:19.650> um<00:04:20.780> yeah<00:04:21.780> overall<00:04:22.440> this

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
put it in there but um yeah overall this

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.219 
put it in there but um yeah overall this
was<00:04:23.040> not<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.700> good<00:04:24.000> phone<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.540> was<00:04:24.810> not<00:04:25.020> worth

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229
