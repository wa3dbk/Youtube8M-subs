it's got the best of the new because
there's<00:01:34.140> new<00:01:34.350> modern<00:01:34.770> mechanics<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
there's new modern mechanics that are

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850 
there's new modern mechanics that are
that<00:01:36.600> saxophones<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.439> days<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.829> are

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that saxophones have these days that are

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
that saxophones have these days that are
better<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> my<00:01:39.000> saxophone

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
better than what I have on my saxophone

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960 
better than what I have on my saxophone
but<00:01:40.229> I've<00:01:40.350> created<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.860> best<00:01:41.070> combination<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
but I've created the best combination of

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
but I've created the best combination of
old<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> new<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> shape<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> gives

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
old and new with the shape that gives

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.130 
old and new with the shape that gives
you<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.460> sound<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> particularly

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you the sound that that I particularly

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.740 
you the sound that that I particularly
