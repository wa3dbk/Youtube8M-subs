00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:13.740
 Hello, I decided to make a video review over 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:19.830
 Bukin cost from Samsung sold and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:23.900
 the box of the box is actually charging 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.080
 and battery like almost any laptop 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.240
 during the video I will compare it with 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.450
 other lenovo netbooks and 110 of this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 The price range is a laptop I bought 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.309
 in fact by chance I needed 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.870
 urgently netbook I chose a pig for 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.610
 filtering by rating and first was 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.860
 taken away 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.559
 He goes with freedos 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.890
 that is, you do not overpay for the gods win 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.629
 7 starter 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.989
 can not initially initially put that 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.239
 the system you need for me is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.890
 there was some plus that win 7 starter 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.470
 i still deleted and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.900
 and it just was a little longer than 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.380
 I will immediately become 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:18.119
 outwardly it looks like this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.770
 it is matte money and therefore remain 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.720
 fingerprints it's not very pretty and 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 so if you want to wipe often 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.220
 more often its some kind of rag 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.490
 outwardly it looks like this Saturday 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:45.080
 he has plus what battery he has 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:47.270
 Does it stick out like the same lenovo and 110 I donâ€™t 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.630
 I know that there is certainly operational 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.040
 memory or something else on this here 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:59.930
 this compartment it creaks in it two usb 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.030
 the port is near them and it is big 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.619
 minus for the reason that here I have 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.929
 now there is a 3g megaphone modem and 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.590
 let's insert the flash drive to me is unrealistic 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.440
 because here look see you see she 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.239
 just such a corner in the connector 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.360
 crammed, that is, you can leave it 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 only using brute force 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.700
 Well then you have the opportunity to spoil 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:31.040
 USB flash drive and modems and the ports themselves 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:34.489
 make curves and this is complete trouble yet 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.959
 Here it has a connector in ja which goes 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.239
 monitor or on some computers 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.060
 Now the key here is such a button 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.880
 switch to the side and press there 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.720
 This is a minus because I need to 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.140
 go nails always stub sheared 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.060
 for this reason not 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.760
 it is not very inconvenient to do in contrast 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.640
 from the same wine you where I click on 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:09.019
 The button all includes this country connector 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:15.820
 for power connector 10 for network 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.820
 cable here when you open it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.500
 actually it looks like this right away 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.430
 I will say that it has the bluetooth 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.020
 real and camera 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.380
 but there is no difference from the same lenovo 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:35.950
 the microphone that is to me is some 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:38.770
 minus if you sit sky screen it 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.020
 Matt gets dirty it is less but the difference 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.090
 from the same lenovo and 110 acanthus which 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.360
 I compare on lenovo 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.120
 the screen is more juicy and therefore colors are more 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.730
 juicy and length though not go and 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.430
 get dirty more but brighter 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.450
 colors and this for me let's say it's pluses 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.450
 it's more familiar to me 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.330
 what else can i say touchpad touchpad u 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.980
 him actually laptops almost everywhere 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:13.989
 same keyboard keyboard here 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:18.299
 such and this such a lot of the same lenovo and 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:21.220
 110 and that is a minus for the reason that 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.979
 hair or other small garbage that 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.810
 can fly there he will fly there 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.710
 you will remain under these keys 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.130
 and stuff that too again not very 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:38.140
 perhaps not very beautiful before 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:41.020
 This I will complete such a short overview of all 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:46.360
 thank you please do n't scold me much 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:49.060
 was my first review I started with this 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.479
 laptop it seemed to me to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.479
 date
