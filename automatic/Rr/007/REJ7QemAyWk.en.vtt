 waiting for me to listen to the lion's tracing 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.720
 angers is quite special it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 think of a straight line of 400 meters 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.190
 it is true that we can do anything 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.899
 tactical however the horses then 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.579
 before the fate a little favored agree 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.469
 so we're going to favor horses that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.879
 like to go ahead we will have great price 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.530

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.890

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.160
 las milka win the bohemian 8 rhapsody 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.760
 the set mr bah yes the 3 uranus monterde 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.710
 the 12 qg list and the ice later ok 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.910
 then your factory is a factory 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 for the occasion the number 9 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 alou arm she has already placed three 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.510
 times at this level 3 third place that's 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.530
 the training of andré fabre we have the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 feeling like it's a little day 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.520
 for her I feel 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 she is a mare who quickly made her 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.970
 evidence at this level it does not matter 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.500
 not the doomed on her last out 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.000
 the distance was too short 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 the ground much too heavy for its 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.390
 aptitudes it's a girl of whom there is so 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.970
 we will be much better this time on a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.439
 good potting act is clear the opposition 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.420
 is largely within reach if it has to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.740
 win the interviewee for me this is what 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.390
 Wednesday is this Wednesday including 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.040
 so we can even have fun playing 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.530
 existing winner here we go the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 contrast the number 5 stamkos that comes from 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.479
 prove his form to castlebriant on his 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.579
 launched 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 exactly snap logic that comes from 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.490
 finish second excellent 2nd of the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.649
 race reference to castlebriant was coming 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.180
 to say it for me with the best 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.799
 course they could have won so there 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.030
 find black joel so the winner 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.680
 with a clear advantage over weight 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.549
 his coach told us that the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.740
 choice had remained in the best 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.259
 provisions all the lights are green 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.020
 okay take a stand CAG vzw 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.850
 to win at this level in February 2014 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.560
 it was in cagnes-sur-mer the horse remains 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.670
 a little bit loaded now 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.380
 it is kneaded quality so we will 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 beware exactly beta win it's a 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.689
 player who won as we had 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.970
 said his quente to cagnes-sur-mer this 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.410
 winter he was able to prove himself 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.400
 it is true that he is charged he fired the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.590
 number 14 may the lot I do not see who 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.069
 appears on the arm a good base beat 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.750
 cagan is a hardened horse so for 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.060
 a place he can quite have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.440
 go a 4 5th place quite in 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.290
 his strings short we can not dismiss him on 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.040
 comes fourth in number 8 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.410
 bohemian rhapsody irreproachable but who 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.870
 start at this level there too it seems 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 logical to be wary yes for me they 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.480
 now mature 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.769
 it's a choice that never stops 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.819
 progress he stays on two wins 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.760
 at the level of handicaps 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.290
 obviously he was penalized but he 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.819
 arrives as Thursday at maturity and the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.530
 horse is in full possession of his 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.299
 means he forced to climb category 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.040
 he has a very good commitment it's a 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.810
 possible remain sacred revelation forgiveness to 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.160
 this level well we'll see if his 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.069
 coach agrees since emmanuel 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.630
 rivron and played on the fabrice phone 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.190
 bother his coach who is going to us 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.030
 speak but also fabrice 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.160
 archambault who was the meeting 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.019
 of antoine hamelin who will speak to us about 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.190
 pugilist who will be his jockey since 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.930
 you have moved to seventh position 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.470
 it's the moment of the minute terrain on 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.329
 listen to me well my rhapsody sir 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.890
 foucher is in excellent shape and the 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.329
 takes time to win his race but has 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.329
 priori there he takes taste 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.650
 and sloping to May 8 in good shape 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.650
 I really 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:39.520
 really killed and the four kilos 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.660
 side of the penalty that you 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.660
 worried or not necessarily 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.080
 antoine you are again associated with 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.240
 dominique horse sepulcher at home 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.570
 gie list for this quinté lion 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.400
 angers 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.780
 how does it look this presents itself 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.090
 not too bad it's a horse a little 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.680
 uncomplicated so everything must be 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.330
 really goes well with him but since 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.299
 that he aggrieved yesterday and behaves himself and 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.830
 rather pretty well so for with 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.780
 a very good race I think it's 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.769
 a regular chance gets by 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.330
 taxes in all lands i have 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.010
 the impression yes yes I unroll a little 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.780
 little the surrounded ground rope left 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.980
 after a problem is in danger this is a 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.820
 little bit particular but it's a shock 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.740
 for what should please him 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.480
 exactly you said ok angel of angers 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.420
 there is a particular tactic to put 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.190
 up the tactics not really after 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.650
 everything depends as always on the rhythm of 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.540
 the race but we're sure we're better 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.770
 with a good rope number be rather 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.940
 riders it's really the place 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.140
 ideal but it's also the place that 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.600
 everyone wants so it's not 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.130
 always obvious to learn it 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.600
 the will understood is rather the confidence 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.300
 in the ranks of number 8 but 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.740
 also number 12 even more 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.120

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.890
 mr bah yes distance specialists 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.790
 a win three years and quote I think 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.810
 that's why you 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.009
 have it in fifth place 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.259

 I give him one last credit 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.379
 a choice that has disappointed 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.279
 but as he disappoints his value is 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.990
 definitely exactly so it's a student 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:31.639
