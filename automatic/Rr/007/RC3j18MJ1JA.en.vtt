slick up here it came with like a little

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360 
slick up here it came with like a little
sponge<00:00:33.030> which<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.809> did<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.260> like<00:00:34.530> for<00:00:34.920> applying

sponge which I did not like for applying
the<00:00:36.120> foundation<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.719> think<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> applied<00:00:37.350> too

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the foundation I think it applied too

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.069 
the foundation I think it applied too
much<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:39.090> didn't<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.899> good

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
much and it just it didn't look as good

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.459 
much and it just it didn't look as good
as<00:00:40.140> other<00:00:40.620> methods<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:42.600> foundation<00:00:43.140> itself

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
as other methods the foundation itself

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
as other methods the foundation itself
kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> twists<00:00:44.460> off<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:45.539> looks<00:00:45.719> like
