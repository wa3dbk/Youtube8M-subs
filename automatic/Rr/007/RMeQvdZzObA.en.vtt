00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.609
 moby dick let's see loading way must 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 let's see we are going to build 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:39.629
 then I just see it 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.230
 so how can you log even I have to 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.300
 someone 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 add i see you where are you working 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.859
 so it's exactly behind this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.199
 but why do you have to check 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.199
 actually yes that for logo 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 ok but I have to take a look with it 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.390
 Ronald because environment also this is it 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 castle so yes kind of a race yes 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.710
 here what i have about it 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 the castle must be surrounded 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.899
 by water 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.579
 I don't know if you're going to do that but 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.710
 it actually ca n't be fun just it 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.950
 is a bit baled that there is snow 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.960
 yes yes reason why we need you so 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.909
 just fix with two with low or so 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.719
 you are going to do the water around and or 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.690
 you want the castle here 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.500
 put down 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.500
 here 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.100
 you can do that here i can 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.870
 ask why it should all be 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.910
 well this is his connection with the with 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.740
 construction measure because here is another 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.840
 the server's project becomes oil and me 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.280
 just have to check if he wanted to 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.630
 build a bridge over no here 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.880
 but we have the castle here 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.400
 that's why I ask if you will be here for a while 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.920
 so that poverty come back because here comes 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.630
 the bridge of outbreak just on here 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.820
 over and behind it comes a big one 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.460
 project 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.690
 so actually lie in the way 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.690
 yes their ways can actually go 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.860
 yes i want that from gmail yahoo okay 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.679
 he said i was nine to you he must 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.670
 even lower when building so I did 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.650
 yes yes that I understand a haha yes yes only 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.420
 but i want this from neo in game or 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 thrones 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.960
 it is such a shame that this castle is going 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.300
 to just over where the bridge goes 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.030
 and that is in fact here as if your life 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.060
 want k but listen to me 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.209
 I don't really get it but I want to get over it 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.730
 first hear himself a gin or so should 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 and secondly I know she was very good 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.739
 so then I can arrange it 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.950
 yes but this is hardly uittrekstaat 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.090
 then in the church be able to be alone quickly 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.739
 part telework or 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 watch as you see here as i place here 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.150
 so this has to be next to the new wall 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.920
 and this must go to here just goes bridge 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.980
 I start with a whole lot already 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.980
 destroy the wall no 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.170
 actually I don't really understand why 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.630
 you say stop 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.310

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.870
