guys which one you decided alright

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.190 
guys which one you decided alright
so<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> first<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> be

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so the first thing that I'm going to be

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
so the first thing that I'm going to be
reviewing<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> elf<00:00:44.670> clear<00:00:45.180> mascara<00:00:45.750> one

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
reviewing is the elf clear mascara one

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.160 
reviewing is the elf clear mascara one
reason<00:00:46.770> why<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.809> because<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
reason why I like it is because it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.299 
reason why I like it is because it
doesn't<00:00:49.440> flake<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> lot<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.920> if<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.129> gets

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
doesn't flake a lot and if if it gets

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
doesn't flake a lot and if if it gets
anywhere<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:53.730> your<00:00:53.879> face<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.420> clear<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.989> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
anywhere on your face it's clear so it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
anywhere on your face it's clear so it
won't<00:00:55.230> show<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.829> don't<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> redo

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
won't show up so you don't have to redo

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
won't show up so you don't have to redo
your<00:00:56.820> makeup<00:00:56.899> one<00:00:57.899> reason<00:00:58.260> why<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.710> bad

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
your makeup one reason why this is bad

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
your makeup one reason why this is bad
is<00:00:59.570> the<00:01:00.570> brush<00:01:01.020> size<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.780> isn't<00:01:03.780> very

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
is the brush size on this isn't very

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.730 
is the brush size on this isn't very
large<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:06.030> looks<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:06.600> large<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
large and it looks pretty large but it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.550 
large and it looks pretty large but it
doesn't<00:01:08.070> give<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.460> really<00:01:09.390> full<00:01:09.869> lashes<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
doesn't give you really full lashes and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.250 
doesn't give you really full lashes and
really<00:01:10.619> long<00:01:11.010> lashes<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:12.510> that's<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.930> only

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
really long lashes so that's the only

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.070 
really long lashes so that's the only
problem<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> really<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.080> so

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
problem that I really have with this so

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
problem that I really have with this so
moving<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.040> regular<00:01:17.460> mascara<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.210> am

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
moving on to the regular mascara I am

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.550 
moving on to the regular mascara I am
going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.900> using<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> Maybelline

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
going to be using the Maybelline

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.760 
going to be using the Maybelline
colossal<00:01:20.369> volume<00:01:21.030> express<00:01:21.509> mascara<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.590> looks

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
colossal volume express mascara it looks

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.850 
colossal volume express mascara it looks
like<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.360> reasons<00:01:24.360> why<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> like<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like this reasons why I like this is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
like this reasons why I like this is
because<00:01:25.970> of<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.390> brush<00:01:27.750> size<00:01:29.600> looks<00:01:30.600> like

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
because of the brush size looks like

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
because of the brush size looks like
that<00:01:31.079> gives<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> very<00:01:31.680> voluminous<00:01:34.430> reasons

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
that gives you very voluminous reasons

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.580 
that gives you very voluminous reasons
why<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.610> do<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> very

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
why I do not like this this is a very

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.149 
why I do not like this this is a very
dark<00:01:38.009> color<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.170> I'm<00:01:40.320> applying<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.979> on

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
dark color and so if I'm applying it on

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.880 
dark color and so if I'm applying it on
and<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.810> gets<00:01:43.049> on

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and it gets on

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310 
and it gets on
my<00:01:44.310> shadow's<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.240> something<00:01:45.510> like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.659> then

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
my shadow's or something like that then

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.020 
my shadow's or something like that then
I<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.440> to<00:01:46.710> totally<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.490> off<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
I have to totally take it off and

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.610 
I have to totally take it off and
restart<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.110> put<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.440> at<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
restart but if I put it on at the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.969 
restart but if I put it on at the
beginning<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.090> pull<00:01:51.330> my<00:01:51.540> eyes<00:01:52.200> down<00:01:52.680> like

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
beginning and I pull my eyes down like

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:53.690 
beginning and I pull my eyes down like
that

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.640 
that
I'll<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.330> see<00:01:54.540> look<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.900> just<00:01:55.110> did<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.590> I

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
I'll go see look I just did that and I

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.200 
I'll go see look I just did that and I
got<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:55.950> over<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.159> hand

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
got it all over my hand

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
got it all over my hand
and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.720> actually<00:01:57.869> let<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.350> dry<00:01:58.650> then<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.460> gets

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and I actually let that dry then it gets

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.700 
and I actually let that dry then it gets
kind<00:01:59.940> of<00:02:00.000> all<00:02:00.210> flaky<00:02:00.720> down<00:02:01.080> here<00:02:01.410> so<00:02:01.560> that's

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
kind of all flaky down here so that's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.219 
kind of all flaky down here so that's
