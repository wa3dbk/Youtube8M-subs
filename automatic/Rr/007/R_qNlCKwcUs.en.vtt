reacting and I'm gonna say it again i

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.380

think<00:00:38.340> Madden<00:00:38.910> 08<00:00:39.000> was<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.200> best<00:00:41.239> Madden<00:00:42.239> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
think Madden 08 was the best Madden that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.869 
think Madden 08 was the best Madden that
we've<00:00:42.540> seen<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> next-gen<00:00:43.649> console<00:00:44.219> up

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
we've seen on the next-gen console up

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.630 
we've seen on the next-gen console up
till<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.410> believe<00:00:46.710> Madden<00:00:47.129> 12<00:00:47.370> will

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
till now not I believe Madden 12 will

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
till now not I believe Madden 12 will
surpass<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:49.260> know<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.680> i<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> use

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
surpass that you know and i like to use

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760 
surpass that you know and i like to use
Madden<00:00:50.789> 08<00:00:50.910> has<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.690> example<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.410> I've

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
Madden 08 has an example because I've

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
Madden 08 has an example because I've
said<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> before<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.789> I'll<00:00:54.239> continue<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.719> say

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
said it before and I'll continue to say

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.709 
said it before and I'll continue to say
it<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.160> madden<00:00:56.640> 12<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
it and I think that madden 12 is

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
it and I think that madden 12 is
definitely<00:00:58.379> built<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.430> idea<00:01:00.000> in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
definitely built off of the idea in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
definitely built off of the idea in
which<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.079> had<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> mind<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:01.829> Madden<00:01:02.219> 08<00:01:02.280> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
which they had in mind for Madden 08 you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 
which they had in mind for Madden 08 you
know<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> lot<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> same<00:01:03.899> elements<00:01:04.470> being

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
know a lot of the same elements being

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.820 
know a lot of the same elements being
displayed<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.700> Madden<00:01:06.299> 12<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.260> saw<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> mad
