Stevo<00:00:08.880> here<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.240> another<00:00:09.420> video<00:00:09.600> and<00:00:09.930> today

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
Stevo here with another video and today

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.140 
Stevo here with another video and today
and<00:00:10.980> talk<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> little<00:00:11.280> bit<00:00:11.430> about<00:00:11.580> animal

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and talk a little bit about animal

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.940 
and talk a little bit about animal
cannons<00:00:12.480> now<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.930> saw<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:13.260> video<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.740> other<00:00:13.830> day

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
cannons now I saw a video the other day

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.420 
cannons now I saw a video the other day
which<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.000> design<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> from

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
which is what this design here is from

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.030 
which is what this design here is from
about<00:00:17.430> an<00:00:17.820> animal<00:00:17.939> cannon<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:19.680> guy<00:00:19.890> was

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
about an animal cannon and the guy was

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.429 
about an animal cannon and the guy was
talking<00:00:20.220> I'm<00:00:20.520> worried<00:00:20.730> about<00:00:20.820> his<00:00:21.599> design<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
talking I'm worried about his design and

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.519 
talking I'm worried about his design and
showing<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.009> off<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:24.169> this<00:00:25.169> is<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
showing it off and and this is a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.679 
showing it off and and this is a
basically<00:00:26.040> the<00:00:26.189> range<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:26.939> 30<00:00:27.360> blocks

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
basically the range it's about 30 blocks

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.440 
basically the range it's about 30 blocks
so<00:00:28.399> having<00:00:29.399> watched<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.880> thought<00:00:30.149> well

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
so having watched that I thought well

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.569 
so having watched that I thought well
that's<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:31.950> I<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> lot

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that's you know I think I can do a lot

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.220 
that's you know I think I can do a lot
better<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.329> potential<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:33.989> us<00:00:34.050> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
better this is this potential for us so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
better this is this potential for us so
much<00:00:34.350> more<00:00:34.820> those<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> who<00:00:36.120> aren't

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
much more those of you who aren't

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
much more those of you who aren't
familiar<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.290> concept<00:00:37.530> pretty<00:00:38.370> much

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
familiar with the concept pretty much

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.910 
familiar with the concept pretty much
animals<00:00:39.210> won't<00:00:39.449> you<00:00:39.809> can't<00:00:40.050> push<00:00:40.289> anvils<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
animals won't you can't push anvils you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.319 
animals won't you can't push anvils you
can't<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> anything<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.670> animals<00:00:42.000> unless

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
can't do anything with animals unless

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.939 
can't do anything with animals unless
they<00:00:42.960> already<00:00:43.019> in<00:00:43.320> motion<00:00:43.469> if<00:00:43.800> they're

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
they already in motion if they're

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.160 
they already in motion if they're
already<00:00:44.070> falling<00:00:44.519> then<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.449> shoot<00:00:45.899> them

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
already falling then you can shoot them

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.099 
already falling then you can shoot them
or<00:00:46.350> move<00:00:46.530> them<00:00:46.710> or<00:00:46.859> whatever<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.969> that's<00:00:48.780> what

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
or move them or whatever so that's what

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.500 
or move them or whatever so that's what
this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.289> based<00:00:49.679> on<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.910> we're<00:00:51.179> going<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
this is based on so what we're going to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680 
this is based on so what we're going to
do<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.410> basically<00:00:52.890> did<00:00:53.429> was<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:54.480> took

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
do now what I basically did was I took

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520 
do now what I basically did was I took
the<00:00:55.079> concept<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.629> added<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.809> own<00:00:57.839> spin<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the concept and added my own spin to it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.180 
the concept and added my own spin to it
fairly<00:00:59.399> compact<00:00:59.909> really<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.739> what<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> does

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
fairly compact really for what it does

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.750 
fairly compact really for what it does
and<00:01:02.489> added<00:01:03.269> another<00:01:03.839> or<00:01:04.409> more<00:01:05.250> than<00:01:05.370> doubled

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
and added another or more than doubled

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.920 
and added another or more than doubled
the<00:01:05.790> range<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:07.050> let's<00:01:07.290> give<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.680> shot<00:01:07.710> boom

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
the range so let's give it a shot boom

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.149 
the range so let's give it a shot boom
and<00:01:10.850> as<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.409> 70<00:01:13.409> blocks<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:14.570> 7465<00:01:16.159> 61

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and as you can see 70 blocks out 7465 61

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.830 
and as you can see 70 blocks out 7465 61
and<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.880> other<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.149> didn't<00:01:18.420> quite<00:01:18.509> make<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
and the other one didn't quite make it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.530 
and the other one didn't quite make it
as<00:01:19.259> far<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.220> other<00:01:20.399> ones<00:01:20.579> Oh<00:01:20.790> another

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
as far as it it's other ones Oh another

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.469 
as far as it it's other ones Oh another
one<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:21.869> 68<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:24.180> yeah<00:01:24.420> you

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
one at 68 I think that is but yeah you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.420 
one at 68 I think that is but yeah you
can<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.810> range<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.439> dramatically

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
can see the range is dramatically

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.969 
can see the range is dramatically
increased<00:01:26.969> like<00:01:27.450> there's<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> huge<00:01:28.350> shift<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
increased like there's a huge shift in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.730 
increased like there's a huge shift in
the<00:01:29.040> range<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:30.180> um<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.259> other<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
the range it's um the other one the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.530 
the range it's um the other one the
struggles<00:01:32.219> to<00:01:32.280> hit<00:01:32.460> 30<00:01:32.729> blocks<00:01:33.000> in<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.329> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
struggles to hit 30 blocks in this one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.289 
struggles to hit 30 blocks in this one
more<00:01:33.990> than<00:01:34.170> doubles<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> range<00:01:35.299> granted

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
more than doubles that range granted

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.730 
more than doubles that range granted
like<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.539> said<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:36.899> of<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.259> about<00:01:37.409> 50

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
like I said one of them had about 50

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.279 
like I said one of them had about 50
blocks<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.030> know<00:01:39.149> it<00:01:39.509> happens<00:01:39.539> every<00:01:40.170> now

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
blocks but you know it happens every now

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.260 
blocks but you know it happens every now
and<00:01:40.380> then<00:01:40.500> there's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> straggler<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and then there's a straggler but for the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
and then there's a straggler but for the
most<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:42.539> they're<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.229> fairly<00:01:43.500> good

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
most part they're all it's fairly good

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.709 
most part they're all it's fairly good
range<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.820> makes<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.210> different<00:01:45.390> than

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
range now what makes it different than

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.760 
range now what makes it different than
its<00:01:45.930> its<00:01:46.920> predecessor<00:01:48.439> isn't<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.649> these

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
its its predecessor isn't just these

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.649 
its its predecessor isn't just these
Pistons<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.460> tried<00:01:50.729> adding<00:01:51.270> something

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
Pistons here I tried adding something

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.560 
Pistons here I tried adding something
similar<00:01:52.170> over<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.789> water<00:01:54.090> moving

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
similar over here but the water moving

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.539 
similar over here but the water moving
forward<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.259> water<00:01:55.469> is<00:01:55.680> flowing<00:01:56.009> forward

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
forward the water is flowing forward

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.330 
forward the water is flowing forward
towards<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.590> August<00:01:58.590> word<00:01:58.770> shooting<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
towards the August word shooting and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.090 
towards the August word shooting and
that<00:02:00.000> allows<00:02:00.299> for<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> bit<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.259> extra<00:02:01.560> push<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that allows for a bit of extra push I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.029 
that allows for a bit of extra push I
think<00:02:02.340> for<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> TNT<00:02:03.469> because<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> TMT<00:02:04.859> is

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
think for the TNT because the TMT is

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.760 
think for the TNT because the TMT is
then<00:02:05.280> sitting<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.759> against<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:06.149> questions

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
then sitting up against these questions

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.420 
then sitting up against these questions
rather<00:02:07.770> than<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:09.240> chillin<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:09.929> and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
rather than just just chillin here and

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.580 
rather than just just chillin here and
that<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:12.150> these<00:02:12.270> push<00:02:12.660> down<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.170> adds<00:02:13.380> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
that when these push down it adds that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.930 
that when these push down it adds that
last<00:02:13.860> bit<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.210> push<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:16.550> that's<00:02:17.550> my<00:02:17.700> theory

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
last bit of push so that's my theory

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.790 
last bit of push so that's my theory
anyway<00:02:18.060> hell<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> know<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> works<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.710> it

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
anyway hell I know that it works and it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.020 
anyway hell I know that it works and it
work

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
work

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.699 
work
the<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:20.990> want<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.410> talk<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> little

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the right so I want to talk a little

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.550 
the right so I want to talk a little
about<00:02:21.830> how<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.550> build<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.060> thing<00:02:23.319> just<00:02:24.319> fire

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
about how to build the thing just fire

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.190 
about how to build the thing just fire
it<00:02:24.590> one<00:02:24.770> more<00:02:24.890> time<00:02:25.040> doesn't<00:02:26.030> always<00:02:26.360> go<00:02:26.690> right

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
it one more time doesn't always go right

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.770 
it one more time doesn't always go right
to<00:02:27.380> 70<00:02:27.860> blocks<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.610> for<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.209> most<00:02:29.360> part<00:02:29.480> it

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
to 70 blocks but for the most part it

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.190 
to 70 blocks but for the most part it
goes<00:02:29.930> pretty<00:02:30.350> damn<00:02:30.620> far<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:32.330> look<00:02:32.480> yeah<00:02:33.050> that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
goes pretty damn far see look yeah that

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.580 
goes pretty damn far see look yeah that
one<00:02:33.319> hit<00:02:33.530> 60<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.280> one<00:02:34.400> hit<00:02:34.490> 70<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:34.910> go<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
one hit 60 that one hit 70 they go and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.630 
one hit 60 that one hit 70 they go and
there's<00:02:36.590> no<00:02:36.709> 150<00:02:37.250> no<00:02:38.030> idea<00:02:38.360> why<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.780> just

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
there's no 150 no idea why it just

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.900 
there's no 150 no idea why it just
struggled<00:02:40.640> struggled<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:42.040> yeah<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.520> let's

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
struggled struggled and yeah so let's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.940 
struggled struggled and yeah so let's
have<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.060> look<00:02:44.090> at<00:02:44.270> I'd<00:02:44.330> build<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.660> alrighty<00:02:45.620> so

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
have a look at I'd build it alrighty so

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.800 
have a look at I'd build it alrighty so
let's<00:02:46.130> get<00:02:46.220> started<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.120> first<00:02:47.420> thing<00:02:47.600> we<00:02:47.720> want

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
let's get started so first thing we want

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.729 
let's get started so first thing we want
to<00:02:47.930> do<00:02:48.050> with<00:02:48.200> place<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:49.720> bunch<00:02:50.720> of<00:02:50.900> blocks<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.410> 5

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
to do with place a bunch of blocks so 5

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.390 
to do with place a bunch of blocks so 5
by<00:02:52.100> 2<00:02:52.160> of<00:02:53.320> stone<00:02:54.320> or<00:02:54.350> whatever<00:02:54.890> your<00:02:55.010> resource

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
by 2 of stone or whatever your resource

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.840 
by 2 of stone or whatever your resource
moment<00:02:55.730> might<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.750> row<00:02:57.110> of<00:02:57.250> 5<00:02:58.250> next<00:02:58.790> to

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
moment might be with a row of 5 next to

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.570 
moment might be with a row of 5 next to
that<00:02:59.260> you<00:03:00.260> can<00:03:00.440> also<00:03:00.560> add<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.010> aesthetic

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
that you can also add the aesthetic

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.479 
that you can also add the aesthetic
lines<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:02.030> I've<00:03:02.120> got<00:03:02.330> here<00:03:03.400> they're<00:03:04.400> not

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
lines that I've got here they're not

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.210 
lines that I've got here they're not
important<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.510> like<00:03:06.200> them<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.620> makes<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.040> I

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
important but I like them it makes it I

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.800 
important but I like them it makes it I
don't<00:03:07.640> know<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.819> kind<00:03:08.030> of<00:03:08.090> fills<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:08.450> some<00:03:08.569> gaps

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
don't know it kind of fills in some gaps

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.290 
don't know it kind of fills in some gaps
that<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:10.340> know<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.580> looks<00:03:11.090> a<00:03:11.180> little

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
that you know it just looks a little

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.750 
that you know it just looks a little
better<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.019> yes<00:03:12.560> 3<00:03:12.800> like<00:03:12.950> that<00:03:13.160> put<00:03:13.610> some

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
better so yes 3 like that put some

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.340 
better so yes 3 like that put some
sticky<00:03:14.090> pistons<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.600> top<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.870> those<00:03:14.989> blocks

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
sticky pistons on top of those blocks

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.460 
sticky pistons on top of those blocks
and<00:03:16.450> some<00:03:17.450> repeaters<00:03:17.930> going<00:03:18.170> into<00:03:18.380> those

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
and some repeaters going into those

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.460 
and some repeaters going into those
blocks<00:03:18.800> all<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.220> them<00:03:19.340> on<00:03:19.519> maximum<00:03:20.269> delay<00:03:20.470> it's

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
blocks all of them on maximum delay it's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.350 
blocks all of them on maximum delay it's
going<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.680> be<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.800> common<00:03:22.160> trend<00:03:22.489> among<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.180> our

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
going to be a common trend among all our

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.150 
going to be a common trend among all our
repeaters<00:03:23.750> except<00:03:24.079> for<00:03:24.320> one<00:03:24.680> that<00:03:24.890> we<00:03:24.980> put

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
repeaters except for one that we put

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.979 
repeaters except for one that we put
down<00:03:25.340> for<00:03:25.970> watch<00:03:26.120> every<00:03:26.450> other<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.690> Peter

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
down for watch every other a Peter

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.229 
down for watch every other a Peter
except<00:03:27.290> for<00:03:27.500> one<00:03:27.739> will<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.459> maximum<00:03:28.820> delay

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
except for one will have maximum delay

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.420 
except for one will have maximum delay
so<00:03:29.390> remember<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.350> case<00:03:30.410> i<00:03:30.769> forgot<00:03:31.070> forget

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
so remember that in case i forgot forget

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.979 
so remember that in case i forgot forget
to<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.640> one<00:03:31.820> that's<00:03:32.269> just<00:03:32.570> something<00:03:32.750> to

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
to do one that's just something to

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.479 
to do one that's just something to
remember<00:03:33.310> place<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.549> bit<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.970> diagonal<00:03:35.450> here

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
remember place a bit of a diagonal here

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:43.449 
remember place a bit of a diagonal here
with<00:03:38.230> another<00:03:39.230> one<00:03:39.890> here<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.829> that<00:03:43.130> kind<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
with another one here so that kind of a

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.620 
with another one here so that kind of a
shape<00:03:43.750> then<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.900> want<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.079> place<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.560> torch<00:03:45.890> on

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
shape then you want to place a torch on

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.960 
shape then you want to place a torch on
this<00:03:47.630> one<00:03:47.840> with<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> repeater<00:03:49.280> going<00:03:49.609> here<00:03:49.880> on

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
this one with a repeater going here on

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.680 
this one with a repeater going here on
maximum<00:03:50.390> delay<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.930> a<00:03:51.859> repeater<00:03:52.250> here<00:03:52.660> with<00:03:53.660> a

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
maximum delay and a repeater here with a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.930 
maximum delay and a repeater here with a
piece<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.870> redstone<00:03:54.140> on<00:03:54.410> there<00:03:54.590> now<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.760> want

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
piece of redstone on there now we want

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.710 
piece of redstone on there now we want
to<00:03:56.000> put<00:03:56.090> half<00:03:56.299> slabs<00:03:56.600> on<00:03:56.750> top<00:03:56.900> of<00:03:57.019> these<00:03:57.109> and

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
to put half slabs on top of these and

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.660 
to put half slabs on top of these and
place<00:03:59.720> a<00:04:01.840> bunch<00:04:02.840> of<00:04:02.989> blocks<00:04:03.170> on<00:04:03.530> this<00:04:04.400> layer

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
place a bunch of blocks on this layer

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:12.759 
place a bunch of blocks on this layer
here<00:04:07.510> next<00:04:08.510> I<00:04:08.600> want<00:04:08.750> you<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.459> put<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.519> row<00:04:11.769> behind

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
here next I want you to put a row behind

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.750 
here next I want you to put a row behind
it<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.870> on<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:15.019> side<00:04:15.260> of<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.640> this<00:04:16.640> is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
it and on the side of it this is

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.319 
it and on the side of it this is
essentially<00:04:17.269> where<00:04:17.390> I<00:04:17.450> water<00:04:17.690> compartment<00:04:17.989> is

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
essentially where I water compartment is

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.430 
essentially where I water compartment is
black<00:04:20.329> on<00:04:20.479> block<00:04:20.720> on<00:04:20.840> top<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:21.079> there<00:04:21.169> as<00:04:21.260> well

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.560 
black on block on top of there as well
you<00:04:22.010> can<00:04:22.160> do<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.340> later<00:04:22.460> or<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.270> do<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.450> now

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
you can do it later or you can do it now

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.480 
you can do it later or you can do it now
it<00:04:23.630> doesn't<00:04:23.900> really<00:04:24.169> matter<00:04:24.470> so<00:04:25.070> if<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.250> do<00:04:25.400> it

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it doesn't really matter so if you do it

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.000 
it doesn't really matter so if you do it
and<00:04:25.669> we've<00:04:26.300> done<00:04:26.390> off<00:04:26.539> the<00:04:26.660> water<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.530> next<00:04:27.770> you

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
and we've done off the water so next you

and we've done off the water so next you
want<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.430> place<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.450> block<00:04:29.840> on<00:04:29.990> their<00:04:30.760> start

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
want to place a block on their start

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.070 
want to place a block on their start

this<00:04:53.540> is<00:04:53.720> where<00:04:53.900> I<00:04:53.930> button<00:04:54.230> will<00:04:54.380> be<00:04:54.500> I've<00:04:54.680> got

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
this is where I button will be I've got

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.380 
this is where I button will be I've got
a<00:04:54.920> wooden<00:04:55.160> button<00:04:55.460> at<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.580> moment<00:04:55.970> just<00:04:56.210> so

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
a wooden button at the moment just so

a wooden button at the moment just so
that<00:04:56.540> we<00:04:56.630> can<00:04:57.700> we<00:04:58.700> can<00:04:58.820> see<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.120> on<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.540> stone

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
that we can we can see it on the stone

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.910 
that we can we can see it on the stone
and<00:05:00.290> we<00:05:01.100> can<00:05:01.220> get<00:05:01.280> rid<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.490> now<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:02.920> we

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
and we can get rid of that now and we

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.080 
and we can get rid of that now and we
can<00:05:04.040> also<00:05:04.160> your<00:05:04.340> advice<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.550> keep<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:04.910> smoother

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
can also your advice to keep it smoother

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.240 
can also your advice to keep it smoother
than<00:05:05.210> that<00:05:05.360> anymore<00:05:05.510> either<00:05:05.780> so<00:05:06.500> next<00:05:06.920> we<00:05:07.130> want

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
than that anymore either so next we want

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.840 
than that anymore either so next we want
to<00:05:07.390> do<00:05:08.390> it<00:05:08.540> up<00:05:08.660> so<00:05:09.170> we<00:05:09.260> go<00:05:09.410> one<00:05:09.710> two<00:05:09.980> three<00:05:10.370> four

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
to do it up so we go one two three four

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.210 
to do it up so we go one two three four
and<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:13.190> think<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:13.550> five<00:05:13.850> actually<00:05:14.030> so<00:05:14.780> five

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
and I think it's five actually so five

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.570 
and I think it's five actually so five
yeah<00:05:16.220> 5<00:05:16.460> blocks<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.090> then<00:05:17.590> 5<00:05:18.590> so<00:05:18.800> 5<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.220> 5<00:05:19.370> like

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
yeah 5 blocks and then 5 so 5 and 5 like

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.330 
yeah 5 blocks and then 5 so 5 and 5 like
that<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.300> it's<00:05:20.420> a<00:05:20.480> bit<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.780> gap<00:05:21.290> there<00:05:21.340> then

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
that so it's a bit of a gap there then

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.910 
that so it's a bit of a gap there then
placed<00:05:22.670> some<00:05:23.000> normal<00:05:23.630> pistons<00:05:24.170> on<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.680> side

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
placed some normal pistons on the side

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.360 
placed some normal pistons on the side
there<00:05:25.900> want<00:05:26.900> to<00:05:26.960> play<00:05:27.110> some<00:05:27.140> redstone<00:05:27.590> here

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
there want to play some redstone here

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.980 
there want to play some redstone here
and<00:05:29.320> here<00:05:30.320> with<00:05:30.560> three<00:05:31.160> repeaters<00:05:31.780> this<00:05:32.780> one

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
and here with three repeaters this one

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.960 
and here with three repeaters this one
on<00:05:33.140> these<00:05:33.530> two<00:05:33.680> on<00:05:33.800> four<00:05:34.100> and<00:05:34.310> this<00:05:34.520> one<00:05:34.760> on

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
on these two on four and this one on

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.120 
on these two on four and this one on
three<00:05:35.450> very<00:05:36.080> important<00:05:36.560> that<00:05:36.680> has<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:36.950> be<00:05:36.980> on

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.600 
here is an important either but it start
to<00:05:59.510> I<00:05:59.960> guess<00:06:00.620> can<00:06:00.830> see<00:06:00.980> all<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.100> red<00:06:01.280> stoning

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
to I guess can see all the red stoning

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.410 
to I guess can see all the red stoning
it<00:06:01.670> because<00:06:01.820> if<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.030> don't<00:06:02.150> place<00:06:02.390> it

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
it because if you don't place it

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.260 
it because if you don't place it
properly<00:06:03.040> there<00:06:04.040> is<00:06:04.130> potential<00:06:04.700> for<00:06:04.730> you<00:06:05.030> to

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
properly there is potential for you to

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.000 
properly there is potential for you to
accidentally<00:06:06.050> placed<00:06:06.350> into<00:06:06.740> in<00:06:06.800> the<00:06:06.890> wrong

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
accidentally placed into in the wrong

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.580 
accidentally placed into in the wrong
place<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:07.430> blow<00:06:07.760> up<00:06:07.790> the<00:06:08.150> cannon<00:06:08.810> so<00:06:09.470> yeah

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
place and blow up the cannon so yeah

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
it and the launchers don't have the

do<00:06:51.660> the<00:06:51.810> same<00:06:52.140> destruction<00:06:52.770> as<00:06:52.950> TNT<00:06:53.360> but<00:06:54.360> you

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930
