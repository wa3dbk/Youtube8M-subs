always<00:02:15.640> adding<00:02:15.910> more<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:17.290> one<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.590> major

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
always adding more so one of the major

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.260 
always adding more so one of the major
into<00:02:18.040> things<00:02:18.220> we've<00:02:18.370> had<00:02:18.520> is<00:02:18.790> ambient

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
into things we've had is ambient

into things we've had is ambient
occlusion<00:02:19.480> technology<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:21.430> technology

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
occlusion technology this technology

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.300 
occlusion technology this technology
enables<00:02:22.510> us<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.720> add<00:02:23.230> much<00:02:23.800> more<00:02:24.010> realistic

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
enables us to add much more realistic

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.600

dynamic shadows to Cian's using a pixel
shader<00:02:27.790> technique<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.990> pixel<00:02:29.350> shader

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
shader technique so a pixel shader

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.140 
shader technique so a pixel shader
traverses<00:02:30.100> every<00:02:30.370> single<00:02:30.700> pixel<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.060> the

traverses every single pixel on the

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.520 
traverses every single pixel on the
scene<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.360> looks<00:02:31.660> at<00:02:31.780> how<00:02:31.900> light<00:02:32.140> reflects

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
scene and looks at how light reflects

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.260 
scene and looks at how light reflects
around<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.220> use<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> to<00:02:33.640> generate<00:02:34.090> much

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
around and use that to generate much

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.240

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
more realistic shadow highlight on the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.370 
more realistic shadow highlight on the
objects<00:02:36.670> in<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.850> scene<00:02:37.060> you<00:02:37.900> know<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.170> see

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
objects in the scene you know so you see

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.050 
objects in the scene you know so you see
much<00:02:38.530> more<00:02:38.709> definition<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.550> individual

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
much more definition and individual

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.340 
much more definition and individual
objects<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.540> they<00:02:40.630> pop<00:02:40.810> out<00:02:40.989> from<00:02:41.260> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350

well I'd like to build using Unreal

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.240 
well I'd like to build using Unreal
Engine<00:04:02.239> 3<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:03.319> engine<00:04:03.590> nail<00:04:03.739> scale<00:04:04.010> is<00:04:04.129> too

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
Engine 3 the engine nail scale is too

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.650 
Engine 3 the engine nail scale is too
much<00:04:04.459> larger<00:04:04.849> seems<00:04:05.209> like<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:07.910> matinee

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
much larger seems like that now matinee

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.479 
much larger seems like that now matinee
is<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.989> system<00:04:09.349> we<00:04:09.379> use<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.829> build<00:04:09.950> all<00:04:10.250> the

to simulate objects that are

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.880 
to simulate objects that are
realistically<00:04:46.030> elastic<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.230> fluid<00:04:47.590> II<00:04:47.680> like

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
realistically elastic and fluid II like

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.530 
realistically elastic and fluid II like
you<00:04:47.980> see<00:04:48.130> what<00:04:48.310> this<00:04:48.400> cube<00:04:48.790> of<00:04:48.880> meat<00:04:49.120> we<00:04:49.300> built

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
you see what this cube of meat we built

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.570 
you see what this cube of meat we built
here<00:04:52.260> you<00:04:53.260> can<00:04:53.410> see<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.680> player<00:04:53.980> can<00:04:54.160> interact

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
here you can see the player can interact

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.010 
here you can see the player can interact
with<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:54.880> push<00:04:55.150> little<00:04:55.480> pieces<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.930> it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
with that push little pieces of it

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.810 
with that push little pieces of it
around<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.530> all<00:04:56.620> very<00:04:56.890> elastic<00:04:57.400> and

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
around and it's all very elastic and

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.090 
around and it's all very elastic and
buoyant<00:04:58.210> this<00:04:58.960> also<00:04:59.170> scale<00:04:59.530> thought<00:04:59.800> of<00:04:59.950> food

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
buoyant this also scale thought of food

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.650 
buoyant this also scale thought of food
so<00:05:00.430> here<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:00.730> have<00:05:00.790> fluids<00:05:01.270> moving<00:05:01.510> around

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
so here you have fluids moving around

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.420 
so here you have fluids moving around
with<00:05:01.840> viscosity<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.620> surface<00:05:02.680> tension

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
with viscosity and surface tension

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.400 
with viscosity and surface tension
retaining<00:05:03.850> their<00:05:04.000> shape<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.960> enables

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
retaining their shape this enables

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:06.930 
retaining their shape this enables
artists<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.830> build<00:05:06.010> environments<00:05:06.790> they're

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
artists to build environments they're

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.700 
artists to build environments they're
much<00:05:07.150> more<00:05:07.360> organic<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:08.680> real-world<00:05:08.860> ish<00:05:10.710> you

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
much more organic and real-world ish you

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.950 
much more organic and real-world ish you
can<00:05:11.830> also<00:05:11.980> destroy<00:05:12.520> them<00:05:12.760> thing<00:05:13.570> that<00:05:13.720> we<00:05:13.810> do

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
can also destroy them thing that we do

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.140 
can also destroy them thing that we do
after<00:05:14.320> every<00:05:14.890> we<00:05:15.040> spent<00:05:15.280> a<00:05:15.340> few<00:05:15.490> years<00:05:15.550> voting

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
after every we spent a few years voting

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.640 
after every we spent a few years voting
a<00:05:16.240> beautiful<00:05:16.630> game<00:05:16.780> world<00:05:17.020> the<00:05:17.290> first<00:05:17.500> thing

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
a beautiful game world the first thing

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.740 
a beautiful game world the first thing
gamers<00:05:17.980> want<00:05:18.160> to<00:05:18.250> do<00:05:18.370> is<00:05:18.580> blow<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:18.970> up<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.300> now

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
gamers want to do is blow it up and now

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.800 
gamers want to do is blow it up and now
they<00:05:19.930> can<00:05:20.110> do<00:05:20.230> that<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:21.790> we've<00:05:21.970> implanted<00:05:22.540> some

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
they can do that so we've implanted some

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.750 
they can do that so we've implanted some

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
objects break apart and the pieces give

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.840 
objects break apart and the pieces give
them<00:05:28.750> stresses<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.470> strains<00:05:29.770> and<00:05:30.130> here<00:05:30.820> we

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
them stresses and strains and here we

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.010 
them stresses and strains and here we
have<00:05:30.970> applied<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.450> so<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.840> we<00:05:31.900> have<00:05:31.990> a
