now<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:22.459> particular<00:02:22.670> charger<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.660> rated<00:02:24.230> for

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
now this particular charger is rated for

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.850 
now this particular charger is rated for
doesn't<00:02:26.690> really<00:02:26.840> see<00:02:27.200> what<00:02:27.380> it's<00:02:27.530> rated<00:02:27.829> for

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
doesn't really see what it's rated for

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.410 
doesn't really see what it's rated for
but<00:02:29.650> ok<00:02:30.650> yes<00:02:30.829> so<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.489> particular<00:02:31.700> charger<00:02:32.269> is

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
but ok yes so this particular charger is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.140 
but ok yes so this particular charger is
rated<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:32.930> one<00:02:33.260> amp<00:02:33.530> which<00:02:34.160> given<00:02:34.849> the<00:02:34.940> specs

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
rated for one amp which given the specs

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.940 
rated for one amp which given the specs
of<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.390> phone<00:02:35.599> I'm<00:02:36.019> guessing<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> battery

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
of the phone I'm guessing the battery

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.059 
of the phone I'm guessing the battery
itself<00:02:37.370> is<00:02:37.579> not<00:02:37.880> particularly<00:02:38.680> massive<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:39.920> it

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
itself is not particularly massive so it

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.039 
itself is not particularly massive so it
should<00:02:40.340> be<00:02:40.489> decent<00:02:40.730> enough<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> charge<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
should be decent enough to charge the

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.170 
should be decent enough to charge the
phone<00:02:42.230> had<00:02:42.380> a<00:02:42.410> quick<00:02:42.650> enough<00:02:42.920> piece<00:02:43.190> I<00:02:43.459> don't

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
phone had a quick enough piece I don't

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.759 
phone had a quick enough piece I don't
think<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.660> particular<00:02:45.079> food<00:02:45.290> supports

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
think this particular food supports

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.009 
think this particular food supports
quick<00:02:45.980> charge<00:02:46.280> either<00:02:46.549> in<00:02:47.420> addition<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.900> the

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
quick charge either in addition to the

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.319 
quick charge either in addition to the
charger<00:02:48.379> you've<00:02:48.590> got<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:48.920> micro<00:02:49.400> USB<00:02:49.430> cable<00:02:49.760> as

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
charger you've got a micro USB cable as

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.690 
charger you've got a micro USB cable as
you<00:02:50.720> would<00:02:50.870> expect<00:02:50.989> there<00:02:51.859> are<00:02:52.010> no<00:02:52.220> earphones

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
you would expect there are no earphones

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.490 
you would expect there are no earphones
here<00:02:52.910> which<00:02:53.269> is<00:02:53.389> a<00:02:53.420> bit<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> shame<00:02:54.019> but<00:02:54.049> then

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
here which is a bit of a shame but then

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.670 
here which is a bit of a shame but then
again<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:55.400> probably<00:02:55.609> don't<00:02:56.150> want<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> use

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
again you probably don't want to use

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.840 
again you probably don't want to use
bundled<00:02:57.680> earphones<00:02:58.069> anyway<00:02:58.519> cause<00:02:58.730> they

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
bundled earphones anyway cause they

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.240 
bundled earphones anyway cause they
don't<00:02:59.030> sound<00:02:59.209> very<00:02:59.389> good<00:02:59.829> now<00:03:00.829> let's<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.190> to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.569 
don't sound very good now let's get to

assisted<00:04:19.359> focus<00:04:19.959> unit<00:04:20.320> now<00:04:20.949> this<00:04:21.100> means<00:04:21.340> that

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
assisted focus unit now this means that

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.610 
assisted focus unit now this means that
you'll<00:04:21.790> be<00:04:21.850> able<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.300> get<00:04:22.930> your<00:04:23.199> low-light

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
shots and get low-light shots in focus

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.189 
shots and get low-light shots in focus
much<00:04:27.040> faster<00:04:27.580> than<00:04:28.090> usual<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.750> laser<00:04:28.960> assisted

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
much faster than usual a laser assisted

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.710 
much faster than usual a laser assisted
focus<00:04:29.770> unit<00:04:30.070> is<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:30.880> better<00:04:31.060> at<00:04:31.330> getting<00:04:31.510> a

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
focus unit is much better at getting a

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.740 
focus unit is much better at getting a
focus<00:04:32.050> lock<00:04:32.380> and<00:04:33.150> yeah<00:04:34.150> so<00:04:34.419> this<00:04:34.570> should<00:04:34.720> be

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
focus lock and yeah so this should be

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.550 
focus lock and yeah so this should be
very<00:04:35.020> beneficial<00:04:35.880> let's<00:04:36.880> open<00:04:37.360> up<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.780> rear

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
very beneficial let's open up the rear

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.590 
very beneficial let's open up the rear
panel<00:04:38.800> of<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.040> device<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.639> see<00:04:39.910> what<00:04:40.419> we've

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
panel of the device and see what we've

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.920 
panel of the device and see what we've
got<00:04:40.810> under<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.169> hood<00:04:41.440> there<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:46.330> you'll<00:04:46.750> see

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
got under the hood there so you'll see

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.780 
got under the hood there so you'll see
that<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.169> spoon<00:04:47.440> supports<00:04:47.950> two<00:04:48.340> SIM<00:04:48.550> card

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
that the spoon supports two SIM card

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.600 
that the spoon supports two SIM card
slots<00:04:49.090> there<00:04:49.750> is<00:04:49.870> also<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.320> micro<00:04:50.800> SD<00:04:51.070> card<00:04:51.310> slot

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
battery here is 3000 mAh which is

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.409 
battery here is 3000 mAh which is
surprisingly<00:04:57.400> decent<00:04:57.610> for<00:04:57.970> a<00:04:58.000> phone<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.300> this

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
surprisingly decent for a phone of this

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.510 
surprisingly decent for a phone of this
category<00:04:58.780> and<00:04:59.199> this<00:04:59.830> also<00:05:00.039> means<00:05:00.280> that<00:05:00.430> the

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
category and this also means that the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.980 
category and this also means that the
one<00:05:00.729> amp<00:05:00.910> charger<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.419> probably<00:05:01.780> going<00:05:01.930> to

one amp charger is probably going to

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.600 
one amp charger is probably going to
take<00:05:02.050> a<00:05:02.350> lot<00:05:02.620> of<00:05:02.650> time<00:05:02.979> to<00:05:03.190> charge<00:05:03.430> up<00:05:03.580> your
