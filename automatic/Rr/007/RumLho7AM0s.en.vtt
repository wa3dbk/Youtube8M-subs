00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:22.270
 the face of the earth becomes one 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.270
 creative force characterized climate 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.559
 It creates a variety of fascinating 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.559
 habitats 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.910
 but the climate can be also destroyer 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.010
 through long-term changes but also 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.010
 now fast by weather luck 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.620
 weather is what i mean about ours 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.690
 heads off in the sky and they play by 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.330
 can change one moment to another 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.010
 In contrast, climate describes the typical 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.920
 weather conditions over longer 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.479
 periods 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 Seen globally, they show themselves from the equator 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.210
 to the poles extreme climate 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.210
 Differences how do they come about? 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.150
 the sun is in comparison to the earth 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.150
 colossus 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.229
 to dominate on their surface 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.229
 temperatures of 5500 degrees 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.480
 she is the energy provider of the earth 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.880
 and a crucial climate factor 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.350
 while the earth revolves around the sun 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 warming sun rays the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 earth's surface 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.650
 but not the same everywhere 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.720
 through the spherical shape of the earth hit the 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.540
 sunbeams in different 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.100
 Angling on the surface of the earth 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.800
 the flatter the radiation swinkels 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.450
 the less energy this one gets 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.950
 region 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:25.590
 that's why it's so cold and recommended on 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.690
 on the equator, the earth is hot and hot 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.000
 not only revolves around the sun she turns 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.490
 at the same time about your own axis 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.340
 because this axel is crooked to the orbit 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.880
 is the day length changes in the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.880
 years running 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.269
 In this country we take the change 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:57.269
 The seasons were with long days in the 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:59.579
 summer and short days in winter 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.180
 Equator, on the other hand, is like a day 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.610
 other 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 it's always l and twelve hours long 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.290
 always moist warm 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.690
 already in the morning rise from the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.860
 sun heated air masses on and 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.780
 form dense clouds 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.299
 around noon, it comes to violent 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.830
 Rainfall the water in the circle 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.930
 to run ongoing 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.930
 and start the game from scratch 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.480
 After the air masses have rained off 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.560
 and removed from the equator 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.900
 they barely have any moisture 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.420
 Beyond the turning circles they sink to 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.670
 soil surface and provide thereby 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.989
 in the subtropics for permanent 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.989
 high pressure and drought 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.580
 Here are the big deserts 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.580
 the earth 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.990
 At the same time, these air streams hit 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.600
 more wind machines to the warm 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.380
 subtropical air into our wide 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.380
 transport 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.019
 but also on other roads heat gets 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.569
 to us full of tropical 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.879
 solar energy sees surface water 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:18.949
 from the caribbean to the gulf of mexico 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:21.139
 and from there into the Atlantic 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.930
 Gulf Stream warms the European coast 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.979
 and ensures high in width 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.979
 ice-free help 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.660
 Palm trees grow in this country anyway 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.330
 that does not prevent polar cold 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.310
 from north to us penetrates local 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.389
 Weather always depends on the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.389
 global climate 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.290
 Today we are watching a rapid 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.000
 change of climate as its cause 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.000
 the human being himself is valid 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.580
 with all open questions we know 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.580
 one for sure 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.780
 The climate is creator and destroyer 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.780
 equally
