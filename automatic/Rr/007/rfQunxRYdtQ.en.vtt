00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
the way to kind of come back a bit

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.580 
the way to kind of come back a bit
when<00:04:43.070> I<00:04:43.100> first<00:04:43.400> installed<00:04:43.790> it<00:04:44.120> anyway<00:04:44.560> so<00:04:45.560> I

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
when I first installed it anyway so I

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.380 
when I first installed it anyway so I
washed<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.010> conditioned<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:46.640> and<00:04:46.820> I<00:04:46.940> plopped

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
washed and conditioned it and I plopped

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.170 
washed and conditioned it and I plopped
it<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.140> if<00:04:48.410> you<00:04:48.500> don't<00:04:48.680> know<00:04:48.800> by<00:04:48.830> now<00:04:49.180> flopping

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
it so if you don't know by now flopping

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.090 
it so if you don't know by now flopping
is<00:04:50.300> basically<00:04:50.930> when<00:04:51.110> you<00:04:51.230> take<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.620> hair<00:04:51.830> and

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
is basically when you take the hair and

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.960 
is basically when you take the hair and
say<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.210> is<00:04:53.360> my<00:04:53.540> towel<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:54.320> just<00:04:54.790> plop<00:04:55.790> it

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
say this is my towel and I just plop it

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.250 
say this is my towel and I just plop it
and<00:04:56.120> leave<00:04:56.300> it<00:04:56.450> to<00:04:56.540> dry<00:04:56.660> like<00:04:56.990> that

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
and leave it to dry like that

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.600 
and leave it to dry like that
leave<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.620> air<00:04:57.770> dry<00:04:57.980> like<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.430> left

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
leave it to air dry like that so I left

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.360 
leave it to air dry like that so I left
it<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.790> air<00:04:58.940> dry<00:04:59.120> like<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.530> overnight<00:05:00.530> near

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
it to air dry like that overnight near

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.090 
it to air dry like that overnight near
the<00:05:01.460> radiator<00:05:01.910> as<00:05:02.330> opposed<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.140> hanging<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:04.010> on

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
the radiator as opposed to hanging it on

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.950 
the radiator as opposed to hanging it on
something<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.610> letting<00:05:04.880> it<00:05:05.030> drip<00:05:05.570> dry

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
something and letting it drip dry

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.140 
something and letting it drip dry
because<00:05:06.860> those<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.340> elongate<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:07.940> curls

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
because those kind of elongate the curls

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.600 
because those kind of elongate the curls
always<00:05:08.870> so<00:05:09.260> yeah<00:05:09.470> anyway<00:05:09.830> that's<00:05:09.980> what<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.400> did

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
always so yeah anyway that's what I did

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.910 
always so yeah anyway that's what I did
to<00:05:10.700> get<00:05:10.790> the<00:05:10.910> curls<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.930> waves<00:05:12.140> to<00:05:12.500> kind<00:05:12.800> of

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
to get the curls to the waves to kind of

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.220 
to get the curls to the waves to kind of
come<00:05:13.130> out<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> bit<00:05:13.460> more<00:05:13.810> this<00:05:14.810> hair<00:05:15.020> is<00:05:15.140> very

come out a bit more this hair is very
lightweight<00:05:15.740> like<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.610> feel<00:05:16.730> like<00:05:16.790> I'm<00:05:16.970> not

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
lightweight like I feel like I'm not

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.880

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.670 
even what yeah I can feel the hair but

it feels very lightweight the strands
are<00:05:21.860> very<00:05:22.010> lightweight<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.610> I<00:05:23.360> don't<00:05:23.600> think<00:05:23.750> I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
are very lightweight and I don't think I

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.450 
are very lightweight and I don't think I
would<00:05:23.960> have<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.170> problem<00:05:24.410> straightening<00:05:25.250> this

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
would have a problem straightening this

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.540 
would have a problem straightening this
hair<00:05:25.700> at<00:05:25.880> all<00:05:26.260> so<00:05:27.260> as<00:05:27.500> I<00:05:27.680> said<00:05:27.860> before<00:05:27.980> when<00:05:28.520> I

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
hair at all so as I said before when I

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.860 
hair at all so as I said before when I
straighten<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:29.030> hair<00:05:29.180> then<00:05:29.390> I'll<00:05:29.510> layer<00:05:29.720> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.590 
hair properly but for now I'm just going
to<00:05:31.460> leave<00:05:31.580> it<00:05:31.820> as<00:05:32.630> it<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.080> I<00:05:33.560> was<00:05:34.010> worried

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
to leave it as it is I was worried

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.270 
to leave it as it is I was worried
because<00:05:35.600> I<00:05:35.780> don't<00:05:36.020> have<00:05:36.170> a<00:05:36.200> closure<00:05:36.560> I'm<00:05:36.980> so

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
because I don't have a closure I'm so

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.220 
because I don't have a closure I'm so
used<00:05:37.670> to<00:05:37.850> closures<00:05:38.600> but<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.780> thought<00:05:38.930> I'm<00:05:39.080> going

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
used to closures but I thought I'm going

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.490 
used to closures but I thought I'm going
to<00:05:39.290> take<00:05:39.410> a<00:05:39.440> break<00:05:39.680> from<00:05:39.830> them<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:41.500> blending

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
to take a break from them and blending

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.200 
to take a break from them and blending
has<00:05:42.890> been<00:05:43.070> okay<00:05:45.280> only<00:05:46.280> thing<00:05:46.490> that<00:05:46.610> I'm<00:05:46.910> really

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
has been okay only thing that I'm really

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.310 
has been okay only thing that I'm really
worried<00:05:47.630> about<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:48.050> it<00:05:48.200> reverting<00:05:48.800> as<00:05:49.040> it<00:05:49.220> did

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
worried about is it reverting as it did

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.270 
worried about is it reverting as it did
either<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.590> or<00:05:51.620> I<00:05:51.710> just<00:05:51.740> didn't<00:05:52.100> straighten

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
either that or I just didn't straighten

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.120 
either that or I just didn't straighten
it<00:05:52.460> properly<00:05:52.760> so<00:05:53.120> what<00:05:53.360> I<00:05:53.390> used<00:05:53.750> was<00:05:54.050> this<00:05:54.650> but

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
it properly so what I used was this but

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.590 
it properly so what I used was this but
I<00:05:55.160> need<00:05:55.400> to<00:05:55.490> find<00:05:55.730> a<00:05:55.940> different<00:05:56.060> one<00:05:56.300> because<00:05:56.390> I

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
I need to find a different one because I

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.540 
I need to find a different one because I
now<00:05:57.020> I<00:05:57.050> realize<00:05:57.620> why<00:05:58.450> this<00:05:59.450> bottle<00:05:59.780> is<00:05:59.900> like

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
now I realize why this bottle is like

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.460 
now I realize why this bottle is like
full<00:06:01.550> it's<00:06:02.210> because<00:06:02.480> it<00:06:02.690> makes<00:06:02.840> my<00:06:02.930> eyes<00:06:02.960> sting

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
full it's because it makes my eyes sting
