00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
this is like my third game using a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.960 
this is like my third game using a
weapon<00:03:33.270> so<00:03:33.510> only<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.990> is<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:35.010> laser<00:03:35.520> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
weapon so only have is is a laser and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.060 
weapon so only have is is a laser and
the<00:03:36.570> red<00:03:36.750> dot<00:03:36.900> sight<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.530> that's<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.860> pretty

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the red dot sight and that's a pretty

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.500 
the red dot sight and that's a pretty
good<00:03:38.220> gun<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.400> wouldn't<00:03:38.760> really<00:03:38.910> use<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.480> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
good gun I wouldn't really use it on a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.630 
good gun I wouldn't really use it on a
more<00:03:39.810> open<00:03:40.140> map<00:03:40.290> obviously<00:03:40.860> because<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.190> SMG

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
more open map obviously because it's SMG

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.000 
more open map obviously because it's SMG
you<00:03:42.270> know<00:03:42.420> like<00:03:42.630> open<00:03:43.140> maps<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.440> turbine<00:03:43.860> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you know like open maps like turbine you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.380 
you know like open maps like turbine you
can<00:03:44.160> use<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> USMC<00:03:45.300> or<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.610> PDW<00:03:47.610> those<00:03:47.790> guns<00:03:48.090> I

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
can use a USMC or the PDW those guns I

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.240 
can use a USMC or the PDW those guns I
think<00:03:48.450> those<00:03:48.840> are<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:49.110> all-around<00:03:49.710> guns<00:03:49.950> but

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
think those are like all-around guns but

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.650 
think those are like all-around guns but
this<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.790> kind<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.970> seems<00:03:51.210> that<00:03:51.330> it's<00:03:51.510> just

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
this one it kind of seems that it's just

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.600 
this one it kind of seems that it's just
like<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.780> really<00:03:51.990> close<00:03:52.320> range<00:03:52.590> man<00:03:53.340> because

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
like a really close range man because

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.920 
like a really close range man because
it's<00:03:53.790> through<00:03:54.030> round<00:03:54.180> burst<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.720> shoots

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
it's through round burst and it shoots

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.810 
it's through round burst and it shoots
incredibly<00:03:55.590> fast<00:03:55.860> depending<00:03:56.370> on<00:03:56.460> how<00:03:56.580> fast

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
incredibly fast depending on how fast

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.340 
incredibly fast depending on how fast
your<00:03:56.970> trigger<00:03:57.210> finger<00:03:57.300> is<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:58.140> can<00:03:58.260> take

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
your trigger finger is you can take

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.780 
your trigger finger is you can take
advantage<00:03:58.740> of<00:03:58.830> that<00:03:58.890> what<00:03:59.250> were<00:03:59.460> you<00:03:59.640> going

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
advantage of that what were you going

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.540 
advantage of that what were you going

with the victim man
vector<00:04:04.590> man<00:04:04.710> was<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.920> good<00:04:05.040> game<00:04:05.390> see<00:04:06.390> ya

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
vector man was a good game see ya

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.570 
vector man was a good game see ya
another<00:04:07.410> thing<00:04:07.650> I<00:04:07.740> want<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.010> say<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.280> this<00:04:08.370> game

before it's over is that I'm not using a

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.150 
before it's over is that I'm not using a
really<00:04:11.670> high<00:04:11.850> streaks<00:04:12.300> because<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:13.050> reset<00:04:14.040> in
