00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.279
 this is really enjoying 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.719
 sometime tropical in your garden if you want that too 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.939
 great because it is really crazy 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.479
 but we do not 9 whole garden in this atmosphere band somers this is 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.210
 and in the winter months accountant don't take it that much narcotic alone 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.210
 all the planting that naturally has to be swinters inside 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.360
 what is the basis of the piece is this is no more than 2 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.890
 at 3 meters and a good see what you can do in your garden 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.640
 You do have to think about the color in this case it is UK quasim you can too 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.830
 reminiscent of soft blue soft yellow 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.260
 In this case, the plastered and landed in such a country must have hundreds of pieces 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.010
 measuring work or there must be at a window or whatever barrels tiles three 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.400
 incorporated 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.920
 but planting of course you should think of tropical species as a nickname 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.140
 agaves 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.140
 palm species I have very many varieties 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.130
 it must be the moment that I, like them, are protected in the winter months 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.120
 m main fact put away keep that in mind if you have such a corner 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.620
 but 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.300
 base where is of course a lot of color blue green hues and do it 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.470
 fantastic, especially if you tune into the band you have 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.270
 that pavement 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.040
 you should think of, for example, a semi-hardening in this case that yellow 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.030
 trend is the graph through 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.539
 that just disturbs you, it vibrates and you're done, but what's so nice there? 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.780
 will make accents in that pavement 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.210
 in this case laveist is 20 by 20 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.360
 these are blue tint you can also think of portuguese state being too soft 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.590
 against heavier ones 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.590
 or this for example that are scored year breaks 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.860
 do not need a very large surface just process your own what accents in that 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.030
 semi-hardening that can therefore also be a green type, which can be shells 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.840
 mother up 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 you determine it a bit, but the accent in the pavement hall 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.550
 they experience me
