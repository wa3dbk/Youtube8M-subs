three hours before needs to be recharged
and<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.250> just<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.149> maybe<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and you can get just about that maybe a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
and you can get just about that maybe a
little<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:04.250> recording<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
little more on the recording on the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.219 
little more on the recording on the
memory<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.689> typically<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:09.869> not<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
memory so typically you're not going to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.190 
memory so typically you're not going to
run<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.530> space<00:01:10.850> much<00:01:11.850> sooner<00:01:12.780> than<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
run out of space much sooner than you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.330 
run out of space much sooner than you
run<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> battery<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.250> vice<00:01:14.460> versa<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
run out of battery or vice versa this is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
run out of battery or vice versa this is
the<00:01:17.430> second<00:01:17.759> pair<00:01:17.880> I've<00:01:18.030> had<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:21.110> like<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the second pair I've had I I like the

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.810 
the second pair I've had I I like the
glasses<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:23.040> come<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> interchangeable

glasses they come with interchangeable

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
glasses they come with interchangeable
lenses<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.840> shoot<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.470> good<00:01:25.650> video

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
lenses they shoot really good video

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
lenses they shoot really good video
which<00:01:26.159> i'm<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> show<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.640> here<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.060> just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
which i'm going to show you here in just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.020 
which i'm going to show you here in just
a<00:01:27.270> few<00:01:27.390> moments<00:01:28.400> as<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> matter<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.670> fact<00:01:29.759> i'll

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
a few moments as a matter of fact i'll

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.460 
a few moments as a matter of fact i'll
probably<00:01:30.270> insert<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.110> here<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.380> I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
probably insert that right here if I

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.710 
probably insert that right here if I
edit<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.369> edit<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.210> we'll

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
probably be doing some video here if not

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.810 
probably be doing some video here if not
it'll<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.470> toward<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> end<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.729> the
