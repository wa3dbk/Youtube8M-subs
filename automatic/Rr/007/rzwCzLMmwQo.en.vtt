00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.910
 hello everyone I'm going to teach you to recreate 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.250
 This complete look that you have given me so much 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.110
 asked in order not to make a video 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.570
 too long and then you get angry 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.000
 with me I thought about dividing this look 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.060
 in two parts today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.640
 make this voluminous disheveled monkey 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.220
 in two minutes and in a next video 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.700
 I will teach you how to do makeup 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 the idea seems good because we are going there 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.110
 this hairstyle the truth is very easy to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.270
 do however to me at the beginning of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 Trying it did not work out the way I like it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.860
 voluminous and disheveled but found 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.080
 a way that helps me a lot and today the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.550
 I wanted to share with you since I 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.890
 you have asked so much the most 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.790
 important to start is to give a lot 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.739
 volume to the hair 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.080
 we can do it using a shampoo in 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.020
 dry or well loading in our hair 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.900
 then what we are going to do is hold everything 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 hair in a high tail does not 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.030
 missing that is perfect but here is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 in the key and is that instead of holding it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.560
 with a rubber band what we are going to do is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.530
 hold the tail well with one hand 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.020
 you see here and with the other turn it of that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.680
 way the bun will be with much more 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.810
 volume not being held with a rubber band 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.490
 let's say what is the tail what we do 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 it's spinning around until we get 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.330
 more or less the way we want a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.160
 donut or like that way if we have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.530
 a little bit of hair there are rebels what 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.300
 we are going to do is put them in their place and 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.180
 when we have it there is when we go to 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.100
 hold that monkey with a rubber but the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.790
 root will be very loose what will give us 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.530
 much 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.690
 I do what I do after giving a couple 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.300
 of laps to put it in the way that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.040
 I want and voilà we already have our 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.690
 collected done what we will do to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.000
 then hold it with some 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.240
 how many hairpins of these that are for 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.490
 muñoz and when we have it collected 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.300
 what I do also is give a couple of 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.150
 turns like that to allocate a little and 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.040
 let him give it more volume and this is already 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.940
 optional but I like to release some 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.710
 how many hairs or hair from the sides 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.929
 also from behind do it a little more 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.750
 more casual informal give you more volume 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.980
 still in the roots but if you like 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.870
 a more perfect bun and more combed by 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.140
 course you do not need to do this 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.850
 you can completely pass this step to 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.220
 then I apply a little gel 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.220
 fixative only in the bow not in the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.830
 root puts in place and I open 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.920
 a little more if I need it and we're already 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.440
 we already have our bun disheveled done 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.680
 in less than two minutes and super easy 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680
 true 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.440
 Well, we have finished, I hope I have 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.879
