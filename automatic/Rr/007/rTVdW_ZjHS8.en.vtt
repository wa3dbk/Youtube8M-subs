to stay up with everybody else and maybe

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.440 
to stay up with everybody else and maybe
take<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:54.319> more<00:02:54.530> leap<00:02:54.829> in<00:02:55.250> front<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.209> everybody

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450

take one more leap in front of everybody
else<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:56.989> sometimes<00:02:57.410> we<00:02:57.590> did<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:59.180> know<00:02:59.299> we

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
else and sometimes we did you know we

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.240 
else and sometimes we did you know we
use<00:02:59.630> some<00:02:59.930> different<00:03:00.079> kind<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.560> systems<00:03:00.980> and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
use some different kind of systems and

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.220 
use some different kind of systems and
we<00:03:01.370> definitely<00:03:01.910> were<00:03:02.209> better<00:03:02.690> defensive

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
we definitely were better defensive

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.830 
we definitely were better defensive
players<00:03:03.470> then<00:03:04.430> most<00:03:04.849> of<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.030> country<00:03:05.090> back<00:03:05.599> in

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
players then most of the country back in

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.830 
players then most of the country back in
the<00:03:05.930> day<00:03:06.109> but<00:03:06.880> yeah<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:07.910> think<00:03:08.030> that's<00:03:08.359> what

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the day but yeah I think that's what

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.620 
the day but yeah I think that's what
it's<00:03:09.440> still<00:03:09.799> excites<00:03:10.190> me<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.549> go<00:03:11.299> into<00:03:11.480> every

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it's still excites me we go into every

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.050 
it's still excites me we go into every
season<00:03:11.930> trying<00:03:12.319> to<00:03:12.410> stay<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.459> step<00:03:13.519> ahead<00:03:13.910> of

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
season trying to stay one step ahead of

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.270 
season trying to stay one step ahead of
the<00:03:14.239> opponent<00:03:15.310> when<00:03:16.310> you<00:03:16.810> look<00:03:17.810> back<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.620> I

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
the opponent when you look back and I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.729 
the opponent when you look back and I
think<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.669> have<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:19.849> take<00:03:20.180> some<00:03:20.480> time<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:21.590> look

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
think you have to take some time to look

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.470 
think you have to take some time to look
back<00:03:21.799> once<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.400> once<00:03:22.730> you've<00:03:22.970> achieved<00:03:23.090> this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
back once you once you've achieved this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.199 
back once you once you've achieved this
I<00:03:23.660> mean<00:03:23.780> this<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:25.370> farthest<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
I mean this is the the farthest the

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.949 
I mean this is the the farthest the
furthest<00:03:27.139> that<00:03:28.010> coaches<00:03:28.700> have<00:03:28.880> gone<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.690> the

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
furthest that coaches have gone in the

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.479 
furthest that coaches have gone in the
world<00:03:30.169> of<00:03:30.500> women's<00:03:31.040> inter<00:03:31.340> collegiate

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:16.640 
to reflect on this over the course of
the<00:04:15.420> last<00:04:15.599> few<00:04:15.780> years<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.229> never<00:04:16.289> really

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
the last few years I never really

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.849 
the last few years I never really
thought<00:04:16.680> about<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.690> back<00:04:18.690> when<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:19.079> had<00:04:19.229> 800

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
thought about it back when we had 800

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.920 
thought about it back when we had 800
wins<00:04:20.039> or<00:04:20.250> 900<00:04:20.760> what<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.329> wasn't

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
wins or 900 what it just wasn't

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.430 
wins or 900 what it just wasn't
important<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.560> me<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.060> but<00:04:24.060> lately<00:04:24.440> everybody

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
important to me and but lately everybody

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.920 
important to me and but lately everybody
seems<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.919> be<00:04:26.010> on<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.400> theme<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.539> breaking

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
seems to be on this theme of breaking

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.529 
seems to be on this theme of breaking
the<00:04:27.960> record<00:04:28.199> and<00:04:28.650> obviously<00:04:29.639> I've<00:04:30.120> had<00:04:30.449> to

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
the record and obviously I've had to

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.779 
the record and obviously I've had to
think<00:04:30.690> about<00:04:30.840> it<00:04:31.169> and<00:04:31.320> it's<00:04:32.190> still<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.550> same

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789 
think about it and it's still the same

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.330 
think about it and it's still the same
it's<00:04:33.030> like<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:34.020> just<00:04:34.289> wasn't<00:04:34.650> me<00:04:34.800> it<00:04:35.130> wasn't

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
it's like it just wasn't me it wasn't

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.760 
it's like it just wasn't me it wasn't

you<00:06:01.349> know<00:06:01.470> I<00:06:01.500> think<00:06:01.590> for<00:06:02.340> 39<00:06:02.819> years<00:06:03.030> were

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
you know I think for 39 years were

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.570 
you know I think for 39 years were
something<00:06:03.840> like<00:06:03.990> 500<00:06:04.319> against<00:06:04.949> each<00:06:05.069> other<00:06:05.310> so

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
something like 500 against each other so

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.879 
something like 500 against each other so
it<00:06:06.330> wasn't<00:06:06.660> where<00:06:06.750> I<00:06:06.810> got<00:06:07.139> you<00:06:07.169> know<00:06:07.349> I<00:06:07.470> got<00:06:07.680> you

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
that time it's not hardly any of that in

kind of started it like a cult sport

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.050 
kind of started it like a cult sport
we're<00:06:16.560> hauling<00:06:16.889> it<00:06:17.009> together<00:06:17.400> no<00:06:17.729> one<00:06:17.910> else

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
we're hauling it together no one else

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.900 
we're hauling it together no one else
knew<00:06:18.270> about<00:06:18.300> it<00:06:18.720> and<00:06:18.810> we<00:06:19.020> we<00:06:19.349> felt<00:06:19.620> like<00:06:19.910> we're

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 
knew about it and we we felt like we're

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.330 
knew about it and we we felt like we're
so<00:06:21.240> cool<00:06:21.509> we<00:06:21.780> play<00:06:22.020> we<00:06:22.380> coach<00:06:22.680> volleyball<00:06:22.919> we

play<00:06:23.580> volleyball<00:06:24.150> so<00:06:24.389> I<00:06:25.169> think<00:06:25.410> that<00:06:25.560> would

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
play volleyball so I think that would

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.980 
play volleyball so I think that would
it's<00:06:25.979> still<00:06:26.340> kind<00:06:26.880> of<00:06:26.940> that<00:06:27.090> feeling<00:06:27.509> it's<00:06:27.660> not

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
it's still kind of that feeling it's not

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.879 
it's still kind of that feeling it's not
as<00:06:28.259> much<00:06:28.590> as<00:06:29.280> it<00:06:29.669> was<00:06:29.820> back<00:06:30.199> 10<00:06:31.199> 20<00:06:31.410> years<00:06:31.590> ago
