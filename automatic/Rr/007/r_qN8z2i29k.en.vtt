kind of the expert on he was a visionary
behind<00:01:40.079> all<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.070> really<00:01:41.729> came<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.119> with

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
behind all this and really came up with

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.200 
behind all this and really came up with
that<00:01:42.479> concept<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.100> janet<00:01:44.759> value

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that concept well and janet value

cycling is taking something and creating
a<00:01:47.880> higher<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.450> better<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:49.020> than<00:01:49.439> its<00:01:49.770> initial

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a higher and better use than its initial

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.340 
a higher and better use than its initial
use<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.180> intended<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> for

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
and do the kind of engineering that it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.180 
and do the kind of engineering that it
takes<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.540> use<00:03:18.780> these<00:03:19.620> as<00:03:19.650> real

what<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:23.609> we're<00:03:23.819> about<00:03:23.940> yeah<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.569> would<00:03:24.810> think

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
what what we're about yeah I would think

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.289 
what what we're about yeah I would think
they<00:03:25.139> would<00:03:25.319> using<00:03:25.760> they<00:03:26.760> would<00:03:26.940> work<00:03:27.090> really

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
they would using they would work really

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.030 
they would using they would work really

idea to officials in Key West for

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.580 
idea to officials in Key West for
affordable<00:03:37.500> housing<00:03:37.560> true<00:03:38.989> that<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.349> is

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
affordable housing true that that is

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.250 
affordable housing true that that is
true<00:03:40.979> I<00:03:41.359> fielded<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.449> initial<00:03:42.780> phone<00:03:42.959> calls

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
true I fielded the initial phone calls

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.890 
true I fielded the initial phone calls
but<00:03:43.500> Bruce<00:03:43.799> was<00:03:44.459> fortunate<00:03:45.389> enough<00:03:45.479> to<00:03:45.659> make

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
but Bruce was fortunate enough to make

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.399 
but Bruce was fortunate enough to make
the<00:03:46.049> trip<00:03:46.260> down<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.590> Key<00:03:46.739> West<00:03:46.769> he<00:03:47.190> had<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.549> go

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409 
the trip down in Key West he had to go

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.469 
the trip down in Key West he had to go
the<00:03:49.409> whole<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.859> whole<00:03:49.979> issue<00:03:50.370> there<00:03:50.849> again<00:03:51.239> is

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
the whole the whole issue there again is

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.110 
the whole the whole issue there again is
if<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.870> if<00:03:52.169> you<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> hurricane<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.370> lot<00:03:53.940> of

to<00:03:56.519> stand<00:03:56.819> what<00:03:57.239> we're<00:03:57.389> trying<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.689> do<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:57.900> come

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
to stand what we're trying to do is come

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.569 
to stand what we're trying to do is come
up<00:03:58.139> with<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.379> system<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:59.010> is<00:03:59.250> sustainable

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
up with a system that is sustainable

up with a system that is sustainable
both<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:00.510> front<00:04:00.780> side<00:04:00.989> but<00:04:01.680> then<00:04:01.829> on<00:04:01.979> the

and<00:04:06.989> we<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.229> some<00:04:07.439> systems<00:04:07.979> that<00:04:08.340> we're

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
and we have some systems that we're

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.869 
and we have some systems that we're
researching<00:04:10.199> and<00:04:10.769> developing<00:04:10.919> that<00:04:11.639> will

researching and developing that will

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.089 
researching and developing that will
just<00:04:12.449> help<00:04:12.599> solve<00:04:13.139> some<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.530> those<00:04:13.680> long-term

every<00:04:38.330> new<00:04:38.510> part<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:38.990> building<00:04:39.200> but<00:04:39.860> we're

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
every new part of building but we're

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.510 
every new part of building but we're
creating<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.640> block<00:04:40.940> as<00:04:41.270> a<00:04:41.330> block<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.080> the

reception<00:04:47.120> okay<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.080> you've<00:04:48.260> talked<00:04:48.530> about

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
reception okay and you've talked about

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.590 
reception okay and you've talked about
the<00:04:49.130> fact<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.400> they're<00:04:49.580> affordable<00:04:49.910> what

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
the fact that they're affordable what

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.380 
the fact that they're affordable what
kinds<00:04:51.050> of<00:04:51.140> prices<00:04:51.380> are<00:04:51.800> we<00:04:51.980> looking<00:04:52.010> at<00:04:52.640> for<00:04:52.700> a

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
kinds of prices are we looking at for a

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.420 
kinds of prices are we looking at for a
single-family<00:04:54.290> home<00:04:54.560> say<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:56.980> think<00:04:57.980> that<00:04:58.190> I

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
single-family home say I think that I

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.700 
single-family home say I think that I
think<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.910> issue<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.420> affordability<00:04:59.900> stands

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
think the issue of affordability stands

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.340 
think the issue of affordability stands
on<00:05:00.800> both<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.160> front<00:05:01.190> side<00:05:01.700> going<00:05:02.480> out<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:03.050> we

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
on both the front side going out to we

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.350 
on both the front side going out to we
you<00:05:03.740> know<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:04.070> twenty<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.640> thirty<00:05:04.880> dollar<00:05:05.150> a

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
you know a twenty to thirty dollar a

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.020 
you know a twenty to thirty dollar a
square<00:05:05.780> foot<00:05:05.990> for<00:05:06.380> a<00:05:06.440> for<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.460> structural

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
square foot for a for the structural

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.720 
square foot for a for the structural
part<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.750> of<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.260> building<00:05:09.700> you<00:05:10.700> can

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
part of the of the building you can

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.940 
part of the of the building you can
probably<00:05:11.090> stick<00:05:11.600> frame<00:05:11.900> in<00:05:12.170> the<00:05:12.260> Midwest<00:05:12.680> and

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
probably stick frame in the Midwest and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.490 
probably stick frame in the Midwest and
do<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.400> cheaper<00:05:13.850> than<00:05:13.970> that<00:05:14.180> but<00:05:14.750> for<00:05:15.020> coastal

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
do it cheaper than that but for coastal

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.620 
do it cheaper than that but for coastal
areas<00:05:15.830> for<00:05:16.010> expensive<00:05:16.640> areas<00:05:17.000> that<00:05:17.180> it's<00:05:17.330> hard

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
areas for expensive areas that it's hard

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.870 
areas for expensive areas that it's hard
to<00:05:17.810> build<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:18.380> then<00:05:18.530> expect<00:05:18.980> it<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.370> be<00:05:19.550> there

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
to build and then expect it to be there

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.330 
to build and then expect it to be there
and<00:05:20.150> have<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.200> have<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.650> there<00:05:21.830> for<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:22.100> long

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
and have and have it there for a long

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.090 
and have and have it there for a long
time<00:05:22.850> a<00:05:22.880> fifty-year<00:05:23.870> kind<00:05:24.230> of<00:05:24.410> kind<00:05:24.950> of

time a fifty-year kind of kind of

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.340 
time a fifty-year kind of kind of
proposition<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:26.120> really<00:05:26.600> what<00:05:26.840> we're<00:05:27.230> about

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
proposition is really what we're about

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.500 
proposition is really what we're about
and<00:05:27.530> that<00:05:27.830> affordability<00:05:28.430> comes<00:05:28.940> on<00:05:29.150> both<00:05:29.360> the

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
and that affordability comes on both the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.630 
and that affordability comes on both the
front<00:05:29.750> side<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.440> back<00:05:30.620> side<00:05:30.950> of<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.400> of

anything they just stand at home and I

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.050 
anything they just stand at home and I
know<00:06:39.560> that<00:06:39.770> the<00:06:39.889> companies<00:06:40.400> are<00:06:40.580> trying<00:06:40.789> to

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
know that the companies are trying to

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.809 
know that the companies are trying to
recycle<00:06:41.449> different<00:06:42.080> metals<00:06:42.469> more<00:06:42.830> these<00:06:43.759> days

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:43.819 
recycle different metals more these days

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:46.330 
recycle different metals more these days
and<00:06:44.389> this<00:06:44.509> may<00:06:44.689> be<00:06:44.749> the<00:06:44.990> way<00:06:45.080> to<00:06:45.110> go<00:06:45.279> with<00:06:46.279> that

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
and this may be the way to go with that

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.369 
and this may be the way to go with that
the<00:06:46.849> affordability<00:06:47.389> though<00:06:47.779> and<00:06:47.960> that<00:06:48.020> that's

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
the affordability though and that that's

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:49.839 
the affordability though and that that's
another<00:06:48.590> issue<00:06:48.800> twenty<00:06:49.159> to<00:06:49.279> thirty<00:06:49.490> dollars<00:06:49.819> a

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
another issue twenty to thirty dollars a

another issue twenty to thirty dollars a
square<00:06:50.180> feet<00:06:50.449> a<00:06:50.659> square<00:06:51.050> foot<00:06:51.259> and<00:06:51.800> you<00:06:52.430> know

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
square feet a square foot and you know

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.790 
square feet a square foot and you know
they're<00:06:53.270> me<00:06:53.810> they're<00:06:54.110> making<00:06:54.229> it<00:06:54.439> more<00:06:54.590> like

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
they're me they're making it more like

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.369 
they're me they're making it more like
long-term<00:06:55.069> but<00:06:55.699> I<00:06:55.729> think<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:56.330> he<00:06:56.870> said<00:06:57.139> that

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:57.379 
long-term but I think that he said that

00:06:57.379 --> 00:06:59.830 
long-term but I think that he said that
you<00:06:57.529> can<00:06:57.710> build<00:06:57.949> cheaper<00:06:58.520> than<00:06:58.639> yeah<00:06:58.999> yeah<00:06:59.479> and

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
you can build cheaper than yeah yeah and

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.330 
you can build cheaper than yeah yeah and
you<00:06:59.990> know<00:07:00.020> what<00:07:00.139> it<00:07:00.469> seems<00:07:00.740> like<00:07:00.860> it's<00:07:01.129> going

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
you know what it seems like it's going

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.309 
you know what it seems like it's going
to<00:07:01.460> be<00:07:01.639> something<00:07:02.240> that's<00:07:02.419> going<00:07:02.689> to<00:07:02.840> have<00:07:03.110> to

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 
to be something that's going to have to

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.369 
to be something that's going to have to
take<00:07:03.469> off<00:07:03.710> if<00:07:04.550> for<00:07:05.029> nothing<00:07:05.150> else<00:07:05.569> then<00:07:06.199> the

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:06.379 
take off if for nothing else then the

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.080 
take off if for nothing else then the
environment<00:07:07.009> the<00:07:07.189> fact<00:07:07.400> that<00:07:07.460> they're<00:07:07.699> green

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.090 
environment the fact that they're green

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.510 
environment the fact that they're green
and<00:07:08.120> that<00:07:08.599> they're<00:07:08.870> trying<00:07:09.020> to<00:07:09.409> conserve<00:07:10.340> in

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
and that they're trying to conserve in

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.279 
and that they're trying to conserve in
so<00:07:10.669> many<00:07:10.789> different<00:07:11.029> ways<00:07:11.240> that<00:07:11.689> speaks

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:12.289 
so many different ways that speaks

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:13.839 
so many different ways that speaks
volumes<00:07:12.740> with<00:07:13.009> a<00:07:13.039> lot<00:07:13.310> of<00:07:13.340> people<00:07:13.729> i<00:07:13.789> don't

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849 
volumes with a lot of people i don't

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:14.890 
volumes with a lot of people i don't
think<00:07:14.090> you'd<00:07:14.180> have<00:07:14.300> to<00:07:14.419> worry<00:07:14.569> too<00:07:14.629> much<00:07:14.750> about

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:14.900 
think you'd have to worry too much about

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.860 
think you'd have to worry too much about
maintenance<00:07:15.439> with<00:07:15.800> that<00:07:15.949> license<00:07:16.310> said

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.559 
maintenance with that license said
termites<00:07:17.870> and<00:07:18.319> you<00:07:19.129> know<00:07:19.279> the<00:07:19.550> wood<00:07:19.819> ball<00:07:20.090> game

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:22.839 
termites and you know the wood ball game
holding<00:07:21.500> on<00:07:21.590> that<00:07:21.800> so<00:07:22.039> you<00:07:22.310> know<00:07:22.430> it<00:07:22.580> could<00:07:22.729> be

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:22.849 
holding on that so you know it could be

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.850
