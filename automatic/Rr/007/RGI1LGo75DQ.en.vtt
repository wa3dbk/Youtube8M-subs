00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.020
 the 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:37.310
 that's how it first fell in the classic surround 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.530
 as far as you can speak of it and 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.059
 Now I'll just give you one 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.390
 step forward I had announced 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.809
 hang up now players are the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.489
 batteries for german atmos 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.670
 So we have our presentation 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.430
 previously mentioned 7.2 system and use 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.410
 now also 54 at the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.830
 we barely cover up here 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.690
 So we're gonna hang it 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.909
 now just the third dimension, so to speak 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.560
 conquer 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.020
 together with the boys of dolby games 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.290
 Here are two demonstration moves 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.630
 which we received from the gentlemen 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.060
 at first maybe very exciting this 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.560
 piece here that shows the change 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.150
 small car piece but you can see 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.220
 screen in each variant 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.010
 are mixed is traditionally the 5.1 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.920
 or then just mixed in Tolkien so 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.430
 that one here in difference directly 121 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.430
 can experience 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.500
 Here you can already see the the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.280
 difference may emerge the order 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 should according to the will of the quasi dolby 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.250
 you just get involved in more 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:37.790
 whole action is involved and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:40.069
 this place is still coming by hand 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.290
 So say another demo piece 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.750
 I would ask her this short one 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.430
 times we Germans had to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.989
 sorry is the story the 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.330
 hangs together with the copy protection of 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.980
 blu-ray at dolby atmos and ours 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.090
 mediaserver there was shortly before 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.890
 at the beginning of the trade fair an update 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.750
 but there we have a day before 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.799
 eat after we have everything on it 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.330
 what we want to show 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.640
 the update no longer dares that if 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.310
 we should afterwards divide that up 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.860
 then fix history 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.049
 otherwise as I said that I ask briefly 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.530
 sorry and cleverer to know 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.530
 ignore 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.780
 I think that is pretty impressive 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.739
 notes the guys at thermal like 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.739
 always with a bit more bass
