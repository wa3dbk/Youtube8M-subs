00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you probably break the wire and what I'm

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.539 
you probably break the wire and what I'm
going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.900> I'm<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> heat<00:01:38.189> just

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that edge that I want to break off by

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.450 
that edge that I want to break off by
rotating<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.509> like<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.979> I'm<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.220> going

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to stick it in that water and because of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.490 
to stick it in that water and because of
the<00:01:46.470> heat<00:01:46.710> being<00:01:47.610> applied<00:01:48.060> into<00:01:48.299> one<00:01:48.750> spot<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the heat being applied into one spot and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.670 
the heat being applied into one spot and
not<00:01:49.799> evenly<00:01:50.399> across<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:51.030> entire<00:01:51.390> thing<00:01:51.810> if<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
not evenly across this entire thing if I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.679 
not evenly across this entire thing if I
do<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.490> should<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.390> able<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.540> break

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
do it right I should be able to break

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.230 
do it right I should be able to break
the<00:01:54.840> bottom<00:01:55.170> off<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:56.450> so

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
the bottom off that so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.270 
the bottom off that so
no<00:02:00.020> idea<00:02:00.320> if<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:00.530> going<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:00.710> work<00:02:00.890> I've<00:02:01.070> never

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
no idea if it's going to work I've never

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.910 
no idea if it's going to work I've never
actually<00:02:01.430> done<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:01.790> before<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.829> about<00:02:03.829> to

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920

I'm<00:02:21.939> actually<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.390> should<00:02:22.629> work<00:02:22.810> even<00:02:23.200> without

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.120

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.830 
I hope you learned something again if
you<00:05:57.830> don't<00:05:57.920> think<00:05:58.190> it's<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.970> right<00:05:59.000> stuff<00:05:59.540> to

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
you don't think it's the right stuff to

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.820 
you don't think it's the right stuff to
do<00:06:00.590> such<00:06:00.890> a<00:06:00.920> thing<00:06:01.720> I<00:06:02.720> don't<00:06:03.110> know<00:06:03.380> what<00:06:03.560> type

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
do such a thing I don't know what type

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.130 
do such a thing I don't know what type
of<00:06:04.010> type<00:06:04.190> of<00:06:04.220> wire<00:06:04.550> this<00:06:04.820> is<00:06:05.060> but<00:06:05.480> stainless

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
of type of wire this is but stainless

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.300 
of type of wire this is but stainless
steel<00:06:06.380> would<00:06:06.590> be<00:06:06.740> much<00:06:06.950> better<00:06:07.250> a<00:06:07.340> choice<00:06:09.310> as

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
steel would be much better a choice as

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.660 
steel would be much better a choice as
far<00:06:10.580> as<00:06:10.700> transformer<00:06:11.540> this<00:06:11.840> is<00:06:12.050> just<00:06:12.350> a<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.830> mean

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
far as transformer this is just a I mean

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.130 
far as transformer this is just a I mean
that's<00:06:13.850> that's<00:06:14.120> pretty<00:06:14.300> hot<00:06:14.510> I<00:06:14.540> kind<00:06:14.840> of<00:06:14.870> smelt

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
that's that's pretty hot I kind of smelt

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.870 
that's that's pretty hot I kind of smelt
the<00:06:15.260> rubber<00:06:15.470> so<00:06:15.740> it<00:06:15.950> definitely<00:06:16.310> got<00:06:16.430> hot<00:06:16.670> so

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
the rubber so it definitely got hot so

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.680 
the rubber so it definitely got hot so
you<00:06:16.940> don't<00:06:16.970> want<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.240> do<00:06:17.300> it<00:06:17.390> for<00:06:17.450> very<00:06:17.510> long

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
you don't want to do it for very long

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.160 
you don't want to do it for very long
unless<00:06:18.620> you<00:06:18.800> have<00:06:18.890> a<00:06:18.920> big<00:06:19.130> big<00:06:19.670> transformer<00:06:20.300> AC

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
unless you have a big big transformer AC

what's up I'll tell you what I do I want
to<00:06:25.970> check<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.300> voltage<00:06:26.450> on<00:06:26.870> here<00:06:27.080> just<00:06:27.320> for

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
to check the voltage on here just for

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.460 
to check the voltage on here just for
curiosity<00:06:28.220> purposes<00:06:28.840> so<00:06:30.760> just<00:06:31.760> gotta<00:06:32.380> cut<00:06:33.380> the

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
curiosity purposes so just gotta cut the

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.650 
curiosity purposes so just gotta cut the
wire<00:06:33.620> off<00:06:33.890> and<00:06:34.460> we'll<00:06:34.580> turn<00:06:34.760> it<00:06:34.940> on<00:06:35.030> here<00:06:35.390> let's

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
wire off and we'll turn it on here let's

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:45.180 
wire off and we'll turn it on here let's
see<00:06:35.840> how<00:06:35.960> many<00:06:36.250> AC<00:06:37.250> volts<00:06:37.910> on<00:06:38.060> apply<00:06:40.930> AC<00:06:41.930> volts

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.880 

41<00:06:46.190> AC<00:06:46.490> volts<00:06:47.180> all<00:06:47.780> right<00:06:47.960> so<00:06:48.200> I'm<00:06:48.380> using<00:06:48.560> five

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
41 AC volts all right so I'm using five

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.920 
41 AC volts all right so I'm using five
point<00:06:49.220> five<00:06:49.370> nine<00:06:49.430> volts<00:06:51.280> all<00:06:52.280> right<00:06:52.900> I'm<00:06:53.900> not

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
point five nine volts all right I'm not

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.480 
point five nine volts all right I'm not
thinking<00:06:54.500> through<00:06:54.680> that<00:06:54.800> one<00:06:54.980> that<00:06:55.100> was<00:06:55.190> AC

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
thinking through that one that was AC

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.210 
thinking through that one that was AC
