00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.860 
is what the finished film how close is a
finished<00:01:46.190> films<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.880> envisioned<00:01:47.450> and

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
finished films what you envisioned and

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.140 
finished films what you envisioned and
how<00:01:47.990> much<00:01:48.140> changed<00:01:48.740> based<00:01:49.190> on<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.850> know<00:01:49.940> what

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
how much changed based on you know what

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.180 
how much changed based on you know what
happened<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.540> set<00:01:50.900> and<00:01:51.110> people<00:01:51.770> altering

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
happened on set and people altering

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.100 
happened on set and people altering
dialogue<00:01:52.670> or<00:01:53.030> you<00:01:53.150> know<00:01:53.270> figuring<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.900> out<00:01:53.960> in

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
dialogue or you know figuring it out in

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.150 
dialogue or you know figuring it out in
the<00:01:54.200> moment<00:01:54.910> well<00:01:55.910> I'd<00:01:56.030> say<00:01:56.210> on<00:01:56.930> these<00:01:57.440> movies

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
the moment well I'd say on these movies

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.440 
the moment well I'd say on these movies
probably<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.940> biggest<00:01:59.360> difference<00:01:59.660> is<00:02:00.050> due

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.420 

the<00:02:04.450> script<00:02:04.780> we'd<00:02:05.500> get<00:02:05.650> there<00:02:05.830> for<00:02:06.160> a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the script we'd get there for a

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.800 
the script we'd get there for a
rehearsal<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:07.270> there<00:02:07.420> might<00:02:07.510> be<00:02:07.540> some

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
rehearsal and there might be some

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.390 
rehearsal and there might be some
changes<00:02:08.140> made<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.350> might<00:02:08.800> make<00:02:08.979> something<00:02:09.310> a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.400 
changes made I might make something a

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.620 
changes made I might make something a
writer<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.760> think<00:02:09.970> some<00:02:10.119> changes<00:02:10.510> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
writer and I think some changes the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.510 
writer and I think some changes the
actors<00:02:10.960> might<00:02:11.140> have<00:02:11.290> to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
actors might have to

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.140 
actors might have to
so<00:02:12.990> very<00:02:13.990> rarely<00:02:14.590> does<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.280> entirely<00:02:15.670> change

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
so very rarely does it entirely change

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.080 
so very rarely does it entirely change
the<00:02:16.300> dynamic

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the dynamic

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.580 
the dynamic
that's<00:02:17.480> where<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> biggest<00:02:18.080> change<00:02:18.379> is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
that's where the biggest change is

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.130 
that's where the biggest change is
pacifically<00:02:19.040> happened<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.700> these<00:02:19.819> movies

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
pacifically happened in these movies

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.720 
pacifically happened in these movies
mostly<00:02:21.140> because<00:02:21.349> we're<00:02:21.830> being<00:02:22.010> very<00:02:22.250> faithful

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
mostly because we're being very faithful

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.949 
mostly because we're being very faithful
to<00:02:22.849> folks<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.599> always<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.930> the

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
to folks and so you always have the

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.479 
to folks and so you always have the
books<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.349> guide<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.920> annotations

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
books as the guide and the annotations

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.759 
books as the guide and the annotations
from<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:26.180> know<00:02:26.269> from<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.959> working<00:02:27.739> with

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769

Suzanne so by the time we're in the post

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.870 
Suzanne so by the time we're in the post
you<00:02:30.560> know<00:02:30.680> we<00:02:30.830> don't<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.400> thing<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:31.819> these

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you know we don't do the thing on these

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.690 
you know we don't do the thing on these
test<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.140> then

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
test it and then

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.220 
test it and then
oh<00:02:34.760> well<00:02:35.090> our<00:02:35.390> third<00:02:35.599> act<00:02:35.780> doesn't<00:02:36.140> work

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
oh well our third act doesn't work

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.630 
oh well our third act doesn't work
throw<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.920> let's<00:02:38.069> reshoot<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.610> whole

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
throw down and let's reshoot the whole

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.720 
throw down and let's reshoot the whole
third<00:02:38.940> act<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.390> know<00:02:39.450> it's<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
third act you know it's one of

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.729 
third act you know it's one of
kind<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.180> make<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.720> up<00:02:42.810> like<00:02:43.019> that<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.530> just

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
kind of make it up like that and just

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.920 
kind of make it up like that and just
changed<00:02:44.310> all<00:02:44.459> around<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.239> are<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.840> know

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
changed all around so we are you know

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.540 
changed all around so we are you know
sort<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.230> locked<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.769> books

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
sort of locked to the books

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.030 
sort of locked to the books
great<00:02:48.210> way<00:02:48.420> when<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.530> envision<00:02:49.830> being

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
great way when do you envision being

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.990 
great way when do you envision being
done<00:02:50.700> done<00:02:50.970> with<00:02:51.210> them<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:52.190> think<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.760> movie

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
done done with them I think the movie

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.440 
done done with them I think the movie
will<00:02:54.180> probably<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:54.930> done<00:02:55.200> done

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
will probably be done done

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.100 
will probably be done done
one<00:02:58.450> thing<00:02:58.690> stays<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.170> track<00:02:59.380> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
one thing stays on track and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.650 
one thing stays on track and
why<00:03:01.290> we<00:03:01.650> should<00:03:01.800> be<00:03:01.890> done<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.100> September

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
why we should be done in September

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.190
