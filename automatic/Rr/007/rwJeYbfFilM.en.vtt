00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.000 

so<00:00:01.079> in<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.290> tutorial<00:00:01.650> we're<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.890> be

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
so in this tutorial we're going to be

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.889 
so in this tutorial we're going to be
looking<00:00:02.129> at<00:00:02.399> moving<00:00:02.669> geometry<00:00:03.240> from<00:00:03.449> rhino3d

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
looking at moving geometry from rhino3d

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.880 
looking at moving geometry from rhino3d
into<00:00:04.830> 3d<00:00:05.370> studio<00:00:05.580> max<00:00:06.290> I'm<00:00:07.290> more<00:00:07.649> comfortable

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
into 3d studio max I'm more comfortable

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.270 
into 3d studio max I'm more comfortable
animating<00:00:08.790> in<00:00:09.000> 3d<00:00:09.480> studio<00:00:09.690> max<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:11.160> will

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
animating in 3d studio max and it will

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.240 
animating in 3d studio max and it will
give<00:00:11.460> us<00:00:11.580> an<00:00:11.700> opportunity<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.509> look<00:00:12.719> at

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
give us an opportunity to look at

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.580 
give us an opportunity to look at
material<00:00:14.250> creation<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:15.030> v-ray<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:16.199> 3d<00:00:16.440> studio

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
material creation in v-ray for 3d studio

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.609 
material creation in v-ray for 3d studio
max<00:00:17.359> it's<00:00:18.359> important<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.779> note<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.960> Rhino

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
max it's important to note that Rhino

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.370 
max it's important to note that Rhino
actually<00:00:20.430> has<00:00:20.869> animation<00:00:21.869> plug-in<00:00:22.230> called

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
actually has animation plug-in called

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.130 
actually has animation plug-in called
bongo<00:00:23.150> it's<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.420> something<00:00:24.720> I've<00:00:24.869> never

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
bongo it's just something I've never

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
bongo it's just something I've never
used<00:00:25.470> I've<00:00:25.740> always<00:00:26.099> had<00:00:26.250> better<00:00:26.460> success<00:00:26.939> in

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
used I've always had better success in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.960 
used I've always had better success in
3d<00:00:27.810> studio<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:29.039> feel<00:00:29.279> like<00:00:29.519> kind<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
3d studio and I feel like kind of the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.370 
3d studio and I feel like kind of the
studio<00:00:30.390> lighting<00:00:30.630> environment<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.289> I'm

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
studio lighting environment that I'm

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.610 
studio lighting environment that I'm
able<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.830> there<00:00:32.099> works<00:00:32.850> better<00:00:33.320> for<00:00:34.320> me<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
able to get there works better for me so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.610 
able to get there works better for me so
this<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.550> how<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:36.120> about<00:00:36.149> doing<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.500> will

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this is how I go about doing it it will

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.869 
this is how I go about doing it it will
be<00:00:37.710> broken<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.520> series<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
be broken down into a series of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.790 
be broken down into a series of
tutorials<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> first<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
tutorials but the first one is to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.069 
tutorials but the first one is to
organize<00:00:41.309> material<00:00:41.910> or<00:00:42.180> organize<00:00:42.570> geometry

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
organize material or organize geometry

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.400 
organize material or organize geometry
by<00:00:43.320> material<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.129> Rhino<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.879> send<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> over<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
by material in Rhino and send it over to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.220 
by material in Rhino and send it over to
a<00:00:46.440> 3ds<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.950> DMX<00:00:47.250> file<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> an<00:00:49.020> alarm

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a 3ds do DMX file so this is an alarm

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.520 
a 3ds do DMX file so this is an alarm
clock

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
clock

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.729 
clock
I<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:50.010> modeled<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.670> few<00:00:51.090> years<00:00:51.300> ago<00:00:51.530> we<00:00:52.530> have

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I had modeled a few years ago we have

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
I had modeled a few years ago we have
kind<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> front<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.699> back<00:00:53.789> gaskets<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
kind of the front and back gaskets the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.189 
kind of the front and back gaskets the
body<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.680> bells<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:57.899> move

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
body the bells and I think I just move

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
body the bells and I think I just move
something<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> inner

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
something in and the all the inner

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
something in and the all the inner
workings<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
workings so what I want to do is

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440 
workings so what I want to do is
actually<00:01:03.120> export<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.229> stuff<00:01:04.559> by<00:01:05.040> material<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
actually export the stuff by material I

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.910 
actually export the stuff by material I
feel<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.610> when<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:09.080> bring<00:01:10.080> things<00:01:10.290> into<00:01:10.560> 3d

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
feel like when I bring things into 3d

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
feel like when I bring things into 3d
studio<00:01:11.040> max<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.670> want<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> bring<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.360> by

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
studio max I want to bring it in by

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.810 
studio max I want to bring it in by
material<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.490> group

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
material and that way I can group

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.020 
material and that way I can group
everything<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.600> assign<00:01:16.220> materials<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.939> know

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
everything and assign materials you know

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
everything and assign materials you know
piece<00:01:18.270> by<00:01:18.420> piece<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:19.110> helps<00:01:19.350> me<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.500> keep<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
piece by piece it helps me to keep the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
piece by piece it helps me to keep the
model<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.310> organized<00:01:20.820> where<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> see

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
model very organized where you can see

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.929 
model very organized where you can see
here<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.229> all<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> my<00:01:22.500> layers<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.790> as

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
here with all of my layers it's not as

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.270 
here with all of my layers it's not as
organized<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.479> I'd<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.020> Rhino<00:01:25.280> but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
organized as I'd like in Rhino but

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100 
organized as I'd like in Rhino but
that's<00:01:26.400> not<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> big<00:01:26.759> issue<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.960> going<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that's not a big issue I'm just going to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.620 
that's not a big issue I'm just going to
pull<00:01:28.350> pieces<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.950> by<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.600> just

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
pull pieces one by one so here I'm just

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.539 
pull pieces one by one so here I'm just
going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> select<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.409> plate<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.310> body

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
going to select the back plate the body

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.480 
going to select the back plate the body
and<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.810> front<00:01:34.079> plate<00:01:34.320> which<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.100> all

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and the front plate which I know are all

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.850 
and the front plate which I know are all
black<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.900> believe<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.439> bells

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
black actually they believe that bells

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.670 
black actually they believe that bells
are<00:01:38.100> black<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> black<00:01:40.229> shiny

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
are black also it's just a black shiny

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.139 
are black also it's just a black shiny
metal<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.340> I'm<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> type<00:01:42.060> export<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
metal so I'm going to type export and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.700 
metal so I'm going to type export and
I'm<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> create<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.689> new<00:01:45.810> folder<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.530> on

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I'm going to create a new folder here on

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.389 
I'm going to create a new folder here on
the<00:01:47.130> desktop<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> we'll<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.399> this

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the desktop and we'll go in and this

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.300 
the desktop and we'll go in and this
time<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.270> 3d<00:01:51.810> s<00:01:52.020> file<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.680> exporting<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
time I want a 3d s file I'm exporting a

silver I think let's see we can do the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.030 
silver I think let's see we can do the
the<00:02:42.660> thing<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.870> rings<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.320> bell<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.800> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
the thing that rings the bell and the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.500 
the thing that rings the bell and the
stopper<00:02:44.490> will<00:02:44.790> make<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.120> silver<00:02:45.540> also<00:02:47.510> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
stopper will make that silver also and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
stopper will make that silver also and
why<00:02:48.720> don't<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.020> do<00:02:49.260> these<00:02:50.040> bolts<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.130> these

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
why don't we do these bolts and these

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.910 
why don't we do these bolts and these
washers<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:54.030> these<00:02:54.210> not<00:02:54.810> not<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.470> guy<00:02:55.680> but

thing to do is to export those matte
black<00:03:55.970> there<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.530> all<00:03:58.530> of<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.190> geometry<00:03:59.489> is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
black there and all of my geometry is

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.949 
black there and all of my geometry is
out<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.300> rhino

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
out of rhino

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.840 
out of rhino
I've<00:04:01.080> hit<00:04:01.410> at<00:04:01.560> all<00:04:01.890> so<00:04:02.040> I<00:04:02.070> can<00:04:02.250> type<00:04:02.430> show<00:04:02.670> and

I've hit at all so I can type show and
bring<00:04:03.030> it<00:04:03.180> all<00:04:03.270> back<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.830> with<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.860> lot<00:04:05.100> of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
bring it all back and with a lot of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.280 
bring it all back and with a lot of
other<00:04:05.370> stuff<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.880> had<00:04:06.060> in<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.209> model<00:04:06.480> but

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
other stuff that I had in the model but

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.130 
other stuff that I had in the model but
now<00:04:07.380> we<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.590> jump<00:04:07.770> over<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.070> 3d<00:04:08.340> studio<00:04:08.489> max<00:04:09.140> so

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
now we can jump over to 3d studio max so

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.759 
now we can jump over to 3d studio max so
this<00:04:10.410> is<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.769> 3d<00:04:10.980> studio<00:04:11.160> max<00:04:11.519> engine<00:04:12.739> we<00:04:13.739> have

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
this is the 3d studio max engine we have

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.830 
this is the 3d studio max engine we have
the<00:04:14.070> four<00:04:14.310> viewpoints<00:04:14.880> it's<00:04:15.180> similar<00:04:15.540> like

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
the four viewpoints it's similar like

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.690 
the four viewpoints it's similar like
Rhino<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:17.100> controls<00:04:17.459> are<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.640> little

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
Rhino the controls are a little

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.789 
Rhino the controls are a little
different<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:19.049> it's<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.290> something<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> get

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
different but it's just something to get

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.480 
different but it's just something to get
used<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.989> here<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.020> want<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.410> import<00:04:22.860> each

used to and here I want to import each

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.840 
used to and here I want to import each
of<00:04:23.760> those<00:04:23.880> files<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:24.570> if<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.720> go<00:04:24.840> up<00:04:24.870> to

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
of those files so if I go up to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.290 
of those files so if I go up to

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.940 
the the menu here I can go import that I
have<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.570> browse<00:04:30.340> desktop<00:04:31.340> new<00:04:32.060> folder<00:04:32.950> that

was network new folder and we'll say

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.760 
was network new folder and we'll say
black-metal<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:38.630> want<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.290> merge<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:39.620> with<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
black-metal I want to merge it with the

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.950 
black-metal I want to merge it with the
scene<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.280> will<00:04:40.370> continuously<00:04:40.940> merge<00:04:41.630> into

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
scene and will continuously merge into

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.800 
scene and will continuously merge into
the<00:04:42.080> scene<00:04:42.260> we're<00:04:42.380> not<00:04:42.500> replacing<00:04:42.740> anything

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
the scene we're not replacing anything

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.940 
the scene we're not replacing anything
and<00:04:44.810> now<00:04:44.990> it<00:04:45.140> asked<00:04:45.350> me<00:04:45.410> if<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.650> want<00:04:45.830> the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
and now it asked me if I want the

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.770 
and now it asked me if I want the
animation<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.370> be<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.610> same<00:04:46.790> length<00:04:47.000> that's

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
animation to be the same length that's

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.840 
animation to be the same length that's
fine<00:04:48.020> so<00:04:48.260> let's<00:04:48.410> say<00:04:48.500> yes<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:49.520> can<00:04:49.640> see

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
fine so let's say yes and you can see

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.970 
fine so let's say yes and you can see
here<00:04:50.240> it's<00:04:50.450> made<00:04:50.690> my<00:04:50.930> animation<00:04:51.710> timeline

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
here it's made my animation timeline

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.400 
here it's made my animation timeline
down<00:04:52.280> here<00:04:52.550> 30<00:04:53.000> frames<00:04:53.360> long<00:04:53.630> it<00:04:54.170> doesn't

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
down here 30 frames long it doesn't

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.280 
down here 30 frames long it doesn't
really<00:04:54.590> matter<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.940> here<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:56.720> can<00:04:56.810> see<00:04:56.960> I've

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
really matter so here you can see I've

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
metal and I've actually deselected it by

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.150 
metal and I've actually deselected it by
accident<00:05:02.600> it's<00:05:03.470> not<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.620> big<00:05:03.770> deal<00:05:03.860> I'm<00:05:04.040> going

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
change the prefix so I'm going to untie

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.420 
change the prefix so I'm going to untie
GLE<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.150> base<00:05:26.360> name<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:26.870> toggle<00:05:27.470> prefix<00:05:28.130> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
GLE the base name and toggle prefix and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.990 
GLE the base name and toggle prefix and
now<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.180> can<00:05:29.450> type<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.930> let's<00:05:30.920> call<00:05:31.100> it<00:05:31.480> black

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
now I can type this let's call it black

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.540 
now I can type this let's call it black
underscore<00:05:35.000> s<00:05:35.240> 4<00:05:35.840> black<00:05:36.020> shiny<00:05:36.350> metal<00:05:36.590> so<00:05:37.430> now

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
underscore s 4 black shiny metal so now

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.670 
underscore s 4 black shiny metal so now
it<00:05:37.700> renames<00:05:38.120> all<00:05:38.330> of<00:05:38.450> those<00:05:38.570> things<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.290> if<00:05:39.470> I

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
it renames all of those things and if I

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.320 
it renames all of those things and if I
look<00:05:39.980> up<00:05:40.160> here<00:05:40.340> at<00:05:40.430> these<00:05:40.580> tools<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:41.000> have<00:05:41.030> my

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
look up here at these tools I have my

tool so if I click select by name you
can<00:05:47.060> see<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.270> have<00:05:47.570> black<00:05:47.960> s<00:05:48.260> object<00:05:48.860> 1<00:05:49.040> black<00:05:49.490> s

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
can see I have black s object 1 black s

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760 
can see I have black s object 1 black s
object<00:05:50.240> 2<00:05:50.420> and<00:05:50.690> this<00:05:51.170> will<00:05:51.350> allow<00:05:51.470> me<00:05:51.740> to

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
object 2 and this will allow me to

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.560 
object 2 and this will allow me to
figure<00:05:52.040> out<00:05:52.250> which<00:05:52.580> material<00:05:52.790> I<00:05:53.270> need<00:05:53.450> to
