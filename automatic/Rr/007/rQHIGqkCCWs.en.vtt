I'll<00:03:21.570> tell<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> recoil<00:03:22.709> could<00:03:23.640> be

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
I'll tell you that the recoil could be

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
I'll tell you that the recoil could be
exaggerated<00:03:24.570> a<00:03:24.600> bit<00:03:24.840> more<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.350> that's<00:03:25.800> not

exaggerated a bit more and that's not

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.410 
exaggerated a bit more and that's not

it is correct for the in-game player to

it is correct for the in-game player to

the<00:03:40.590> FAL<00:03:41.010> do<00:03:41.430> have<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.670> ball<00:03:41.880> release<00:03:42.150> button

the FAL do have a ball release button

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.660 
the FAL do have a ball release button
which<00:03:42.750> would<00:03:42.900> make<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.230> reloads<00:03:43.620> even<00:03:44.070> faster

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670

which would make the reloads even faster
sure<00:03:45.180> track<00:03:45.480> could<00:03:45.780> have<00:03:45.900> put<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.410> for

I'll<00:04:00.390> be<00:04:00.630> doing<00:04:00.750> more<00:04:01.080> gun<00:04:01.350> comparisons<00:04:01.950> in

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
I'll be doing more gun comparisons in
