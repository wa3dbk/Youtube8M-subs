00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
with the candy shell style that is made

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.850 
with the candy shell style that is made
by<00:00:36.239> spec<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.989> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.739> going

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
by spec so you can see that it's going

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.830 
by spec so you can see that it's going
to<00:00:37.920> cover<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> front<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.760> back<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.450> iPad

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
to cover the front and back of your iPad

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.830 
to cover the front and back of your iPad
2<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> let's<00:00:41.399> throw<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> case<00:00:42.510> there

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
2 so let's throw it in the case there

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.750 
2 so let's throw it in the case there
and<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.989> rubberized<00:00:46.440> interior<00:00:47.010> kinda<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and that rubberized interior kinda just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.590 
and that rubberized interior kinda just
bubbles<00:00:48.239> over<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.200> iPad<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.129> their

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.330 

psyche<00:00:54.600> we're<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.379> then<00:00:56.070> obviously

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
psyche we're get it and then obviously

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.580 
psyche we're get it and then obviously
this<00:00:56.789> folds<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.690> top<00:00:57.930> covers<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.859> up

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
this folds over the top covers you up

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.650 
this folds over the top covers you up
this<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.850> make<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
this has a make sure that's on all the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.539 
this has a make sure that's on all the
way<00:01:04.610> there<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:07.260> has<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> suction<00:01:08.010> here

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
way there we go this has a suction here

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
way there we go this has a suction here
that<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:08.909> suction<00:01:09.540> across<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.260> top<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.770> it's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that will suction across the top so it's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.960 
that will suction across the top so it's
going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> protect<00:01:11.510> front<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.720> case<00:01:13.970> like

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
going to protect front of your case like

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.640 
going to protect front of your case like
I<00:01:15.119> say<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.659> hard<00:01:15.900> shell<00:01:16.049> plastic

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
I say that's the hard shell plastic

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
I say that's the hard shell plastic
there<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.900> opens<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.110> nicely<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.390> also

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
there and opens up nicely you can also

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.850 
there and opens up nicely you can also
see<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.320> can<00:01:23.189> fold<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:25.740> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
see that this can fold back and then you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.210 
see that this can fold back and then you
can<00:01:26.040> insert<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.270> create<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:28.220> different

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
can insert that to create a different

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.520 
can insert that to create a different
viewing<00:01:29.490> angles<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.600> have<00:01:30.689> typing<00:01:31.350> angle

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
viewing angles so we have typing angle

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.170 
viewing angles so we have typing angle
there<00:01:32.570> then<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.869> course<00:01:35.810> viewing<00:01:36.810> angle<00:01:37.200> there

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
there then of course viewing angle there

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.830 
there then of course viewing angle there
so<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.240> makes<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> nice<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:41.090> can<00:01:42.090> move<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
so that makes it nice I can move that

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.170 
so that makes it nice I can move that
kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.960> straightforward<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.880> also

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
kind of straightforward there this also

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.249 
kind of straightforward there this also
folds<00:01:48.750> out<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.630> charge<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:51.750> iPad<00:01:52.229> or

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
folds out so you can charge your iPad or

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.420 
folds out so you can charge your iPad or
there's<00:01:52.649> different<00:01:53.009> stands<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> iPad

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
there's different stands for the iPad

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.830 
there's different stands for the iPad
different<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.880> that's<00:01:57.060> nice<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> have

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
different so that's nice that you have

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.310 
different so that's nice that you have
that<00:01:58.020> accessible<00:01:58.799> there<00:01:59.990> there's<00:02:00.990> different

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that accessible there there's different

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.480 
that accessible there there's different
things<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.560> come<00:02:01.680> with<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> keyboard<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
things to come with a keyboard and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.209 
things to come with a keyboard and
different<00:02:02.820> uses<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.960> ipad<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.100> that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
different uses for the ipad so that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.010 
different uses for the ipad so that
makes<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> nice<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.270> other<00:02:06.390> ports<00:02:06.869> or

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
makes it nice all the other ports or

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.609 
makes it nice all the other ports or
accessible<00:02:07.619> your<00:02:07.799> headphones<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.580> camera

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
accessible your headphones your camera

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.770 
accessible your headphones your camera
volume<00:02:10.619> everything<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.250> good<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> go

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
volume everything is good to go

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.020 
volume everything is good to go
so<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> pretty<00:02:13.290> nice<00:02:13.470> case<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:14.100> little<00:02:14.670> heavier

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so a pretty nice case a little heavier

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.820 
so a pretty nice case a little heavier
than<00:02:15.270> some<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.750> cases<00:02:16.140> out<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.319> but

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
than some of the cases out there but

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.970 
than some of the cases out there but
definitely<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> lot<00:02:17.430> slimmer<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.030> better<00:02:18.420> than

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
definitely a lot slimmer and better than

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.860 
definitely a lot slimmer and better than
some<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> leather<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.550> cloth<00:02:21.090> cases<00:02:21.780> that
