00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
bit of a tail on the end slowly pull it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.010 
bit of a tail on the end slowly pull it
and<00:02:20.120> as<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.300> slowly<00:02:20.900> pull<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.820> tight<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:23.390> work

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
and as you slowly pull it tight you work

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:31.180 
and as you slowly pull it tight you work
the<00:02:24.350> paper<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.850> right<00:02:29.120> here<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
the paper so that this right here is the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.060 
the paper so that this right here is the
width<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.850> paper<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:36.290> right<00:02:36.650> here

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
width of the paper and this right here

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.950 
width of the paper and this right here
is<00:02:37.250> nice<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.910> tight<00:02:38.090> against<00:02:38.480> these<00:02:38.570> edges

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
is nice and tight against these edges

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.150 
is nice and tight against these edges
and<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:40.160> comes<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.820> nice<00:02:41.180> point<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
and this comes to a nice point and you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.640 
and this comes to a nice point and you
have<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.700> as<00:02:44.000> close<00:02:44.750> as<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.020> can<00:02:45.200> go<00:02:45.560> ahead

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
have that as close as you can go ahead

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.820 
have that as close as you can go ahead
and<00:02:45.860> give<00:02:46.040> it<00:02:46.070> a<00:02:46.190> nice<00:02:46.400> squeeze<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.710> there<00:02:48.710> you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
and give it a nice squeeze and there you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.310 
and give it a nice squeeze and there you
will<00:02:48.950> have<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:50.030> beginnings<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.020> puffy

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
will have the beginnings of the puffy

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.200 
will have the beginnings of the puffy
start<00:02:51.590> where<00:02:52.310> each<00:02:52.870> distance<00:02:53.870> here<00:02:54.740> here<00:02:55.670> here

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
start where each distance here here here

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.110 
start where each distance here here here
and<00:02:56.390> here<00:02:56.740> are<00:02:57.740> all<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.340> same<00:02:58.520> length<00:02:58.820> which

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
and here are all the same length which

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.820 
and here are all the same length which
is<00:02:59.150> important<00:02:59.690> when<00:02:59.870> making<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.350> puffy<00:03:00.620> star

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
is important when making the puffy star

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.310 
is important when making the puffy star
or<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.160> lucky<00:03:01.550> star<00:03:01.810> then<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.930> just<00:03:03.170> go<00:03:03.260> ahead

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
or the lucky star then you just go ahead

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.610 
or the lucky star then you just go ahead
and<00:03:03.440> take<00:03:03.680> this<00:03:03.950> tail<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.960> fold<00:03:05.960> it<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.350> on

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
and take this tail and fold it in on

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.710 
and take this tail and fold it in on
itself<00:03:06.790> now<00:03:07.790> when<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.060> do<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.450> want<00:03:08.570> to

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
itself now when you do it you want to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.890 
itself now when you do it you want to
see<00:03:09.050> how<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.590> open<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:11.330> has<00:03:11.570> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
see how this is open and this has that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
do that and the same thing with this

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.400 
do that and the same thing with this
side<00:03:25.790> then<00:03:26.360> is<00:03:26.570> you<00:03:26.660> want<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.870> tuck<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.170> towards

side then is you want to tuck it towards

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.080 
side then is you want to tuck it towards
the<00:03:27.500> open<00:03:27.739> side<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.430> don't<00:03:28.670> want<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:28.880> wrap<00:03:29.060> it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
the open side you don't want to wrap it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.560 
the open side you don't want to wrap it
this<00:03:29.390> way<00:03:29.630> across<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.790> you<00:03:31.790> see<00:03:32.030> how<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:32.390> is

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
this way across that you see how this is

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.490 
this way across that you see how this is
open<00:03:33.580> that's<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:35.000> way<00:03:35.300> you<00:03:35.360> want<00:03:35.690> to<00:03:36.110> fold<00:03:36.320> it

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
open that's the way you want to fold it

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.490 
open that's the way you want to fold it
and<00:03:36.770> if<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.220> fold<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.640> right<00:03:37.790> along<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.060> edge

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
and if you fold it right along the edge

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.860 
and if you fold it right along the edge
it<00:03:39.500> will<00:03:39.650> follow<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.250> edge<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:42.760> then<00:03:43.870> when

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
it will follow this edge and then when

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.710 
it will follow this edge and then when
you<00:03:45.020> fold<00:03:45.320> it<00:03:45.500> along<00:03:45.800> this<00:03:46.100> edge<00:03:46.720> you'll

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
you fold it along this edge you'll

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.949 
you fold it along this edge you'll
notice<00:03:48.140> that<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.470> follows<00:03:48.910> that<00:03:49.910> edge<00:03:50.239> that's

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
notice that it follows that edge that's

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.960 
notice that it follows that edge that's
why<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.260> need<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.590> make<00:03:51.830> sure<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:52.459> all<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
why you need to make sure that all the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.449 
why you need to make sure that all the
ends<00:03:53.390> are<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.500> same<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:55.040> it's<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.310> nice

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
ends are the same and it's a nice

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.870 
ends are the same and it's a nice
symmetrical<00:03:55.940> shape<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:57.140> way<00:03:57.489> as<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.670> fold

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
symmetrical shape that way as you fold

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.260 
symmetrical shape that way as you fold
it<00:03:59.090> it<00:04:00.020> will<00:04:00.170> follow<00:04:00.320> now<00:04:00.620> sometimes<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.880> you

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
it it will follow now sometimes it you

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.330 
it it will follow now sometimes it you
might<00:04:02.480> wind<00:04:02.690> up<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.959> little<00:04:03.140> bit<00:04:03.380> like<00:04:03.590> this<00:04:03.860> or

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
might wind up a little bit like this or

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.949 
might wind up a little bit like this or
a<00:04:04.370> little<00:04:04.610> bit<00:04:04.700> like<00:04:04.820> this<00:04:05.030> go<00:04:05.660> ahead<00:04:05.780> and

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
a little bit like this go ahead and

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.460 
a little bit like this go ahead and
cheat<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.940> make<00:04:08.239> it<00:04:08.450> even

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
cheat to make it even

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.690 
cheat to make it even
every<00:04:09.980> time<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.460> make<00:04:10.700> that<00:04:11.260> turn<00:04:12.460> make<00:04:13.460> sure

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
every time you make that turn make sure

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.620 
every time you make that turn make sure
that<00:04:13.970> it's<00:04:14.350> even<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:18.580> as<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:19.730> keep<00:04:19.910> going<00:04:20.150> and

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
that it's even and as you keep going and

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.440 
that it's even and as you keep going and
start<00:04:21.110> wrapping<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.650> around<00:04:21.739> nicely<00:04:22.450> you

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
start wrapping it around nicely you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.750 
start wrapping it around nicely you
don't<00:04:23.690> want<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:24.050> cinch<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.470> too<00:04:24.680> tightly<00:04:24.980> just

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
don't want to cinch it too tightly just

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.640 
don't want to cinch it too tightly just
make<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.120> snug<00:04:26.390> make<00:04:26.750> sure<00:04:26.900> your<00:04:27.110> corners<00:04:27.530> and

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
make it snug make sure your corners and

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.740 
make it snug make sure your corners and
then<00:04:28.250> when<00:04:28.670> you<00:04:28.790> get<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.090> end<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.540> lot<00:04:29.690> of

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
then when you get to the end a lot of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.110 
then when you get to the end a lot of
times<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.950> wind<00:04:31.160> up<00:04:31.310> with<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.460> little<00:04:31.730> bit<00:04:31.910> like

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
times you wind up with a little bit like

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.500 
times you wind up with a little bit like
this<00:04:32.420> I<00:04:33.280> just<00:04:34.280> take<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.640> and<00:04:34.730> I<00:04:34.820> just<00:04:35.030> give<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.240> a

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
this I just take it and I just give it a

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.580 
this I just take it and I just give it a
rip<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:36.650> make<00:04:36.800> sure<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.990> it<00:04:39.170> falls<00:04:39.350> nicely

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
rip to make sure that it falls nicely

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.740 
rip to make sure that it falls nicely
and<00:04:40.100> then<00:04:40.970> you<00:04:41.720> just<00:04:41.930> tuck<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.470> in<00:04:42.710> like<00:04:43.130> that

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
and then you just tuck it in like that

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.680 
and then you just tuck it in like that
now<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:44.810> have<00:04:45.200> your<00:04:45.530> basic<00:04:46.310> shape<00:04:46.580> and<00:04:46.790> then

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
now you have your basic shape and then

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.120 
now you have your basic shape and then
you're<00:04:47.870> gonna<00:04:48.080> carefully<00:04:48.470> use<00:04:48.860> your

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
you're gonna carefully use your

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.590 
you're gonna carefully use your
fingernail<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:51.010> begin<00:04:53.440> creating<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:56.090> star

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
fingernail to begin creating the star

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.830 
fingernail to begin creating the star
shape<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.790> I<00:04:58.880> like<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.150> do<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.300> little<00:04:59.660> bit

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
shape and I like to do a little bit

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.470

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
first just to get it going and then go

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.230 
first just to get it going and then go
back<00:05:02.720> around<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:05.110> tidy<00:05:06.110> up<00:05:06.670> make<00:05:07.670> it<00:05:07.700> a<00:05:07.970> little

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.830 
back around and tidy up make it a little
bit<00:05:08.390> more<00:05:09.340> three-dimensional<00:05:10.340> by<00:05:10.720> giving<00:05:11.720> it

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
bit more three-dimensional by giving it

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.750
