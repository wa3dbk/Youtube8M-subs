00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
you see the model of the CT scan awesome

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.160 
you see the model of the CT scan awesome
so<00:00:31.820> let<00:00:32.060> me<00:00:32.210> give<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.540> a<00:00:32.570> little<00:00:32.810> bit<00:00:32.930> of<00:00:32.960> a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
review of what what we are looking at so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.770 
review of what what we are looking at so
we<00:00:35.930> have<00:00:36.310> Nancy<00:00:37.310> CT<00:00:37.970> scan<00:00:40.030> so<00:00:41.030> we<00:00:41.180> have<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.360> CT

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
we have Nancy CT scan so we have a CT

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.049 
we have Nancy CT scan so we have a CT
scan<00:00:42.080> which<00:00:42.290> is<00:00:42.320> a<00:00:42.470> DICOM<00:00:42.950> data<00:00:43.570> then<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:44.600> have

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
scan which is a DICOM data then I have

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.670 
scan which is a DICOM data then I have
basically<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.450> wax<00:00:47.870> up<00:00:48.170> that<00:00:48.830> was<00:00:49.010> done<00:00:49.220> by<00:00:49.400> Sam

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
basically a wax up that was done by Sam

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.610 
basically a wax up that was done by Sam
waxing<00:00:51.680> up<00:00:51.830> all<00:00:52.070> four<00:00:52.400> teeth<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:53.620> that's

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
waxing up all four teeth and that's

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.000 
waxing up all four teeth and that's
stitched<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.690> basically<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.809> model<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.559> you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
stitched to basically a model and you

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.130 
stitched to basically a model and you
could<00:00:58.250> see<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.550> stitching<00:00:58.910> point<00:01:00.520> okay

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
could see the stitching point okay

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.070 
could see the stitching point okay
now<00:01:03.440> this<00:01:03.890> model<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.940> know<00:01:05.059> just<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.449> give<00:01:05.660> Sam

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
now this model you know just to give Sam

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.070 
now this model you know just to give Sam
some<00:01:06.380> some<00:01:07.070> idea<00:01:07.400> about<00:01:07.540> where<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.690> T<00:01:08.869> should

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
some some idea about where the T should

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.100 
some some idea about where the T should
be<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.550> took<00:01:10.610> an<00:01:11.060> alginate<00:01:11.420> impression<00:01:11.600> of

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
be so I took an alginate impression of

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.160 
be so I took an alginate impression of
the<00:01:12.229> partial<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:13.360> send<00:01:14.360> it<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.509> Sam<00:01:14.840> because

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
the partial and send it to Sam because

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.520 
the partial and send it to Sam because
she<00:01:15.229> likes<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.710> position<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.340> teeth<00:01:17.530> okay

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
she likes the position of the teeth okay

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.440 
she likes the position of the teeth okay
so<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.220> what<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.820> know<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.030> helps<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
so so what you know it helps the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.180 
so so what you know it helps the
technician<00:01:21.050> to<00:01:21.080> create<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.560> wax<00:01:21.800> up<00:01:21.950> but<00:01:22.070> we're

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
technician to create a wax up but we're

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.260 
technician to create a wax up but we're
not<00:01:22.280> going<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.460> use<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:22.729> for<00:01:22.759> the<00:01:22.940> planning

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
not going to use it for the planning

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.700 
not going to use it for the planning
process<00:01:23.890> okay<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.729> once<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.300> have<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.750> CT<00:01:27.350> scan

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
process okay so once we have the CT scan

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.630 
process okay so once we have the CT scan
and<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:29.000> model<00:01:29.390> stitched<00:01:29.690> on<00:01:29.899> top<00:01:30.220> we<00:01:31.220> can<00:01:31.460> now

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
and the model stitched on top we can now

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.870 
and the model stitched on top we can now
plan<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.270> position<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.990> implants<00:01:33.880> where

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
plan the position of the implants where

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.999 
plan the position of the implants where
we<00:01:35.569> know<00:01:35.780> where<00:01:35.960> we<00:01:36.080> want<00:01:36.110> them<00:01:36.470> number<00:01:36.800> one

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
we know where we want them number one

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.190 
we know where we want them number one
also<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.970> know<00:01:38.060> where<00:01:38.240> it's<00:01:38.360> doable

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
also you know where it's doable

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.980 
also you know where it's doable
so<00:01:39.679> you<00:01:40.490> see<00:01:40.700> also<00:01:40.970> merge<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.300> photograph

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.020 

okay<00:01:45.100> right<00:01:46.100> here<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:46.340> don't<00:01:46.369> have<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.670> look<00:01:46.850> at

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
okay right here we don't have to look at

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.090 
okay right here we don't have to look at
the<00:01:47.179> at<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.050> bone<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.380> at<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:48.740> but<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.039> is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
the at the bone it at all but this is

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.600 
the at the bone it at all but this is
basically<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:50.110> photograph<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.709> is<00:01:51.770> merged<00:01:52.280> on

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
basically a photograph that is merged on

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.029 
basically a photograph that is merged on
top<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:54.310> model<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.520> dentist's<00:01:55.970> Ridge

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
top of the model of the dentist's Ridge

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.980 
top of the model of the dentist's Ridge
and<00:01:58.039> I<00:01:58.280> have<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.640> from<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.720> know<00:01:59.840> from

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and I have it from you know from

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.359 
and I have it from you know from
different<00:02:00.550> you<00:02:01.550> know<00:02:01.670> different<00:02:01.910> angles<00:02:03.369> but

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
different you know different angles but

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.830 
different you know different angles but
it's<00:02:04.640> all<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.030> same<00:02:05.240> model<00:02:06.280> okay<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:07.340> far<00:02:07.840> okay

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
it's all the same model okay so far okay

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.290 
it's all the same model okay so far okay
perfect<00:02:09.259> okay<00:02:09.890> that's<00:02:10.099> better<00:02:10.220> so<00:02:11.030> now<00:02:11.240> you

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
perfect okay that's better so now you

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.370 
perfect okay that's better so now you
see<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.959> outline<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:14.209> tooth<00:02:14.480> now<00:02:14.959> I

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
see the outline of the tooth now I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.630 
see the outline of the tooth now I
already<00:02:15.530> positioned<00:02:16.160> an<00:02:16.520> implant<00:02:16.819> in<00:02:16.970> there

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
already positioned an implant in there

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.490 
already positioned an implant in there
that<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:19.819> almost<00:02:20.090> coming<00:02:20.840> through<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that is almost coming through the of the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.050 
that is almost coming through the of the
cingulum<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:27.170> did<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> same<00:02:28.459> for<00:02:28.520> number

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
cingulum and I did the same for number

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.490 
cingulum and I did the same for number
seven<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.750> ten<00:02:30.410> both<00:02:31.569> so<00:02:32.569> I<00:02:32.599> just<00:02:33.110> put<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.380> in

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
seven and ten both so I just put it in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.720 
seven and ten both so I just put it in
there<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.709> just<00:02:33.739> didn't<00:02:34.129> do<00:02:34.189> any<00:02:34.310> any

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
there I just didn't do any any

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
there I just didn't do any any
fine-tuning<00:02:35.659> yet

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.640 

but<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.599> probably<00:02:39.840> get<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.319> little<00:02:40.500> bit

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
but I can probably get it a little bit

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.800 
but I can probably get it a little bit
more<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:41.190> know<00:02:41.310> closer<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.880> cingulum<00:02:42.330> by

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
more you know closer to the cingulum by

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.199 
more you know closer to the cingulum by
rotating<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.860> implant<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.489> little<00:02:44.880> bit<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.120> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
rotating the implant a little bit to the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.150 
rotating the implant a little bit to the
palate<00:02:45.569> oh<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.770> see<00:02:46.890> there's<00:02:47.069> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
palate oh but you see there's a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.910 
palate oh but you see there's a
concavity<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> back<00:02:48.060> oh<00:02:48.590> so<00:02:49.590> there's<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
concavity on the back oh so there's a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.250 
concavity on the back oh so there's a
limit<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.459> how<00:02:50.640> much<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.090> do<00:02:51.270> that<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.720> can

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
limit of how much we can do that I can

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.440 
limit of how much we can do that I can
move<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.620> implant<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.160> little<00:02:53.370> bit<00:02:53.489> bodily<00:02:54.270> to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
move the implant a little bit bodily to

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.350 
move the implant a little bit bodily to
the<00:02:54.569> palate<00:02:55.580> okay<00:02:56.580> that's<00:02:56.790> probably<00:02:56.970> better

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
the palate okay that's probably better

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.740 
the palate okay that's probably better
for<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:58.400> but<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.610> pretty<00:02:59.880> pretty<00:03:00.360> much<00:03:00.569> it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
for you but that's pretty pretty much it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.330 
for you but that's pretty pretty much it
but<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:01.170> from<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.410> restorative<00:03:01.830> position

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
but I think from a restorative position

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.009 
but I think from a restorative position
you're<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:03.090> pretty<00:03:03.300> good<00:03:03.450> shape<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.900> what

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
you're in pretty good shape there what

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.100 
you're in pretty good shape there what
do<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.380> about<00:03:04.470> number<00:03:04.860> 10<00:03:08.030> okay<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.780> you

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
do you think about number 10 okay if you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.750 
do you think about number 10 okay if you
have<00:03:10.200> any<00:03:10.350> comments<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.010> let<00:03:11.190> me<00:03:11.370> know<00:03:11.400> okay

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
have any comments you let me know okay

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.670 
have any comments you let me know okay
don't<00:03:11.970> be<00:03:12.120> shy<00:03:12.330> that's<00:03:12.959> that's<00:03:13.350> why<00:03:13.530> we're

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
don't be shy that's that's why we're

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.380 
don't be shy that's that's why we're
doing<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.950> together<00:03:14.130> now<00:03:17.090> meaning<00:03:18.090> make<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
doing this together now meaning make it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.680 
doing this together now meaning make it
more<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.810> seven<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:19.700> can<00:03:20.700> increase<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.510> two

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
more like seven I can increase it in two

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.770 
more like seven I can increase it in two
ways<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.080> either<00:03:22.440> tilt<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.040> implant<00:03:23.780> to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
ways I can either tilt the implant to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.789 
ways I can either tilt the implant to
the<00:03:24.930> palate<00:03:25.350> which<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.760> it<00:03:26.790> was<00:03:27.060> before<00:03:27.799> or

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
the palate which like it was before or

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.100 
the palate which like it was before or
and<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.970> move<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.239> bodily<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> little<00:03:30.989> bit

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
and I can move it bodily a little bit

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.620 
and I can move it bodily a little bit
but<00:03:31.290> we<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> do<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.700> know<00:03:32.819> we<00:03:32.940> we<00:03:33.330> have<00:03:33.480> to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
but we have to do you know we we have to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.150 
but we have to do you know we we have to
place<00:03:33.870> them<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.230> within<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.680> confines<00:03:34.950> of

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
place them and within the confines of

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.960 
place them and within the confines of
the<00:03:35.430> bone<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.860> that's<00:03:38.430> what<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.730> anatomy

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the bone so that's what the anatomy

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.640 
the bone so that's what the anatomy
plays<00:03:39.510> well<00:03:39.750> but<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.959> think<00:03:40.080> that's<00:03:40.410> a<00:03:40.530> little

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
plays well but I think that's a little

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.890 
plays well but I think that's a little
bit<00:03:40.769> better<00:03:41.010> isn't<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:44.239> if<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.450> look<00:03:45.630> at<00:03:45.780> it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
bit better isn't it if you look at it

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.050 
bit better isn't it if you look at it
right<00:03:46.049> now

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.080 

now<00:03:52.060> you<00:03:52.120> can<00:03:52.330> see<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.569> actual<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.940> actual

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
now you can see the actual the actual

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.320 
now you can see the actual the actual
wax<00:03:55.540> up<00:03:56.190> okay<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.519> see<00:03:57.670> it's<00:03:57.940> much<00:03:58.060> much

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
wax up okay you can see it's much much

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.589 
wax up okay you can see it's much much
clearer<00:03:58.690> now<00:03:59.040> what<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.190> think<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:01.390> good

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
clearer now what do you think it's good

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.490 
clearer now what do you think it's good
right<00:04:02.129> okay<00:04:03.129> so<00:04:04.120> both<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.480> these<00:04:04.750> implants<00:04:05.349> are

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
right okay so both of these implants are

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.600 
right okay so both of these implants are
three<00:04:06.370> point<00:04:06.700> five<00:04:07.000> in<00:04:07.540> diameter<00:04:08.610> conical

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
three point five in diameter conical

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.289 
three point five in diameter conical
connection<00:04:10.319> with<00:04:11.319> in<00:04:11.650> thirteen<00:04:12.579> millimeter

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
connection with in thirteen millimeter

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.620 
connection with in thirteen millimeter
length<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:15.069> you<00:04:15.430> see<00:04:15.760> Tomas<00:04:16.060> when<00:04:16.239> we<00:04:16.389> put<00:04:16.600> a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
length so you see Tomas when we put a

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.199 
length so you see Tomas when we put a
4.3<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.530> there<00:04:17.739> there's<00:04:18.669> not<00:04:18.850> going<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.000> be<00:04:19.060> any

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
4.3 in there there's not going to be any

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.210 
4.3 in there there's not going to be any
Ridge<00:04:19.449> left<00:04:19.750> and<00:04:20.049> then<00:04:20.199> you<00:04:20.440> know<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.650> start

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
Ridge left and then you know you start

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.879 
Ridge left and then you know you start
getting<00:04:21.250> failures<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.500> listen<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.590> would<00:04:23.740> love

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
getting failures and listen I would love

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.409 
getting failures and listen I would love
to<00:04:24.039> put<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.220> 4.3<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:24.880> just<00:04:25.030> not<00:04:25.210> possible

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
to put a 4.3 it's just not possible

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.710 
to put a 4.3 it's just not possible
without<00:04:25.780> we<00:04:26.770> can<00:04:26.919> do<00:04:26.979> additional<00:04:27.280> grafting<00:04:27.789> we

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
without we can do additional grafting we

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.850 
without we can do additional grafting we
can<00:04:28.900> we<00:04:29.080> can<00:04:29.229> add<00:04:29.620> but<00:04:30.370> I'm<00:04:30.760> not<00:04:30.880> sure<00:04:31.090> she's

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
can we can add but I'm not sure she's

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.800 
can we can add but I'm not sure she's
she's<00:04:32.860> really<00:04:33.130> into<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.360> I'm<00:04:34.660> gonna

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
she's really into that so so I'm gonna

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.879 
she's really into that so so I'm gonna
put<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.139> back<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:38.940> it'll<00:04:39.940> be<00:04:40.030> like<00:04:40.180> before

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
put it back and it'll be like before

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.409 
put it back and it'll be like before
from<00:04:41.889> from<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.490> restorative<00:04:42.880> position<00:04:43.270> now<00:04:43.389> you

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
from from a restorative position now you

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.140 
from from a restorative position now you
wanted<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.930> see<00:04:44.110> if<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.260> number<00:04:44.800> before<00:04:45.789> we<00:04:46.030> do

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
wanted to see if a number before we do

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.640 
wanted to see if a number before we do
that<00:04:46.180> let's<00:04:46.539> see<00:04:46.720> if<00:04:46.750> they<00:04:47.020> we're<00:04:47.410> not<00:04:47.530> too

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
that let's see if they we're not too

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.330 
that let's see if they we're not too
close<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.280> tooth<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:50.770> see<00:04:50.949> this<00:04:51.070> is<00:04:51.220> the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
close to the tooth you see this is the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.790 
close to the tooth you see this is the
canine<00:04:51.760> here

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
canine here

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.140 
canine here
number<00:04:53.800> six<00:04:54.010> came<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:54.460> an<00:04:54.580> implant<00:04:54.970> or

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
number six came is that an implant or

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.469 
number six came is that an implant or
it's<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.419> tooth<00:04:55.630> I'm<00:04:55.810> not<00:04:55.960> sure<00:04:56.080> let<00:04:56.229> me<00:04:56.349> see<00:04:57.479> she

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
it's a tooth I'm not sure let me see she

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.120 
it's a tooth I'm not sure let me see she
has<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.599> bunch<00:04:58.840> of<00:04:58.990> implants<00:05:01.590> okay<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.979> way

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
has a bunch of implants okay so the way

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.180 
has a bunch of implants okay so the way
we<00:05:03.280> do<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.550> you<00:05:03.669> see<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:03.940> number<00:05:04.180> seven<00:05:05.190> I'm

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
we do it you see the number seven I'm

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.909 
we do it you see the number seven I'm
walking<00:05:06.849> along<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:09.180> seven<00:05:10.180> implant<00:05:10.919> and

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
walking along the seven implant and

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.250 
walking along the seven implant and
around<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.580> platform<00:05:12.849> you<00:05:13.539> almost<00:05:14.050> two

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
around the platform you almost two

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.350 
around the platform you almost two
millimeters<00:05:14.740> in<00:05:14.860> distance<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:16.030> it's<00:05:16.150> pretty

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
millimeters in distance so it's pretty

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.930 
millimeters in distance so it's pretty
close<00:05:16.599> but<00:05:16.960> it's<00:05:17.320> it's<00:05:17.770> still<00:05:18.039> still<00:05:18.700> a<00:05:18.729> safe

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
close but it's it's still still a safe

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.300 
close but it's it's still still a safe
distance<00:05:19.560> let's<00:05:20.560> look<00:05:20.740> at<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:20.889> different

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
distance let's look at the different

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.510 
distance let's look at the different
angles<00:05:21.460> now<00:05:22.500> just<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.620> make<00:05:23.650> sure<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.190> we<00:05:24.370> are

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
angles now just to make sure that we are

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.339 
angles now just to make sure that we are
on<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.880> same<00:05:25.090> page<00:05:27.120> okay<00:05:28.120> kind<00:05:28.330> of<00:05:28.389> clinical

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
on the same page okay kind of clinical

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.960 
on the same page okay kind of clinical
picture<00:05:29.710> in<00:05:29.979> terms<00:05:30.250> of<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.520> let's<00:05:30.789> say<00:05:30.880> you

picture in terms of you let's say you

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.290 
picture in terms of you let's say you
take<00:05:31.120> compressions<00:05:31.810> if<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:33.460> throw<00:05:33.729> on<00:05:34.060> the

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
take compressions if you throw on the

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.260 
take compressions if you throw on the
the<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.910> wax<00:05:37.180> up<00:05:37.449> on<00:05:37.599> top<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:37.930> it<00:05:38.940> that's<00:05:39.940> what

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
the the wax up on top of it that's what

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
the pure wax up and you have the

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.270 
the pure wax up and you have the
trajectory<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.500> implants<00:06:04.770> but<00:06:04.919> do<00:06:05.010> I<00:06:05.100> take

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
trajectory of the implants but do I take

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.129 
trajectory of the implants but do I take
a<00:06:05.310> snapshot<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:05.940> it<00:06:06.210> and<00:06:06.510> we'll<00:06:06.690> see<00:06:06.840> if<00:06:06.900> we<00:06:06.990> can

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
a snapshot of it and we'll see if we can

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:13.940 
a snapshot of it and we'll see if we can
get<00:06:07.290> there<00:06:10.160> here<00:06:12.320> here's<00:06:13.320> your<00:06:13.380> surgical

get there here here's your surgical

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.810 
get there here here's your surgical
guide<00:06:14.130> okay<00:06:14.460> a<00:06:14.900> representation<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:16.350> it<00:06:16.820> okay

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
guide okay a representation of it okay

guide okay a representation of it okay
you<00:06:18.570> see<00:06:18.870> there<00:06:19.110> are<00:06:19.460> windows<00:06:20.460> on<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:21.600> canine

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
you see there are windows on the canine

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.730 
you see there are windows on the canine
because<00:06:23.400> it's<00:06:23.550> pretty<00:06:23.820> close

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
because it's pretty close

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.300 
because it's pretty close
here's<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:25.889> guy<00:06:26.040> here<00:06:27.030> you<00:06:27.180> see<00:06:27.360> it<00:06:27.450> here<00:06:28.310> you

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
here's the guy here you see it here you

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.920 
here's the guy here you see it here you
see<00:06:29.550> it's<00:06:29.700> pretty<00:06:29.790> close<00:06:30.389> there's<00:06:30.660> actually

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
see it's pretty close there's actually

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.930 
see it's pretty close there's actually
no<00:06:31.050> way<00:06:31.200> to<00:06:31.260> put<00:06:31.560> it<00:06:31.650> even<00:06:31.860> closer<00:06:32.160> you<00:06:32.580> see<00:06:32.790> the

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
no way to put it even closer you see the

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.480 
no way to put it even closer you see the
guy<00:06:33.120> the<00:06:33.479> guide<00:06:33.690> has<00:06:33.870> tubes<00:06:34.200> that<00:06:35.190> are<00:06:35.280> almost

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
guy the guide has tubes that are almost

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.820 
guy the guide has tubes that are almost
bordering<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.300> tooth<00:06:36.540> at<00:06:37.110> least<00:06:37.410> on<00:06:37.560> number

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
bordering the tooth at least on number

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.080 
bordering the tooth at least on number
11<00:06:37.860> and<00:06:38.520> also<00:06:39.150> number<00:06:40.010> number<00:06:41.010> six<00:06:41.310> it's

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
11 and also number number six it's

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.750 
11 and also number number six it's
pretty<00:06:42.389> tight<00:06:43.040> and<00:06:44.040> I<00:06:44.160> think<00:06:44.370> we<00:06:44.460> can<00:06:44.610> do<00:06:44.700> it

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
pretty tight and I think we can do it

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.930 
pretty tight and I think we can do it
flapless<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.450> see<00:06:45.660> where<00:06:45.840> the<00:06:46.580> you<00:06:47.580> see<00:06:47.790> where

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
flapless you see where the you see where

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.310 
flapless you see where the you see where
the<00:06:48.030> tissue<00:06:48.240> is<00:06:48.540> all<00:06:48.690> this<00:06:48.840> karate<00:06:49.080> nice

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
the tissue is all this karate nice

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.900 
the tissue is all this karate nice
tissue<00:06:49.560> we<00:06:49.800> don't<00:06:49.979> have<00:06:50.070> to<00:06:50.190> touch<00:06:50.370> it<00:06:50.400> because

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
tissue we don't have to touch it because

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.940 
tissue we don't have to touch it because
the<00:06:51.210> implants<00:06:51.479> are<00:06:51.570> going<00:06:51.780> actually<00:06:51.900> going<00:06:52.740> in

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
the implants are going actually going in

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.890 
the implants are going actually going in
more<00:06:53.190> powerfully<00:06:54.680> right<00:06:55.680> in<00:06:55.800> here<00:06:56.660> so<00:06:57.660> there's

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
more powerfully right in here so there's

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.960 
more powerfully right in here so there's
no<00:06:57.990> issue<00:06:58.260> of<00:06:58.500> MU<00:06:58.710> co-signed<00:06:59.280> stuff<00:06:59.550> like<00:06:59.760> that

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
no issue of MU co-signed stuff like that

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.150 
no issue of MU co-signed stuff like that
okay<00:07:02.479> that's<00:07:03.479> it<00:07:03.690> my<00:07:03.840> friend<00:07:04.169> good<00:07:04.530> so<00:07:04.950> I<00:07:04.979> will
