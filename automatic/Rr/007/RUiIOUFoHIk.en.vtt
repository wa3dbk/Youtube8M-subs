run<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.660> 2004<00:00:57.660> when<00:00:57.930> um<00:00:58.850> who<00:00:59.850> is

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
run I think was in 2004 when um who is

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.380 
run I think was in 2004 when um who is
doing<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.300> back<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:02.789> know<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> can't

technical thing is called because it's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.190

the<00:01:55.979> old<00:01:56.100> cartoon<00:01:57.060> show<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.469> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the old cartoon show and you know that

the old cartoon show and you know that
one's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:01:59.490> better<00:01:59.729> than<00:02:00.030> anything<00:02:00.240> I've

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
one's a lot better than anything I've

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.800 
one's a lot better than anything I've

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
seen since but I figured this makes a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
seen since but I figured this makes a
great<00:02:03.840> desk<00:02:04.380> accessory<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:06.570> wouldn't<00:02:06.810> really

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
great desk accessory it wouldn't really

scarf and sets just painted on which

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.660 
scarf and sets just painted on which
looks<00:04:07.330> kind<00:04:07.600> of<00:04:07.630> cheap<00:04:07.720> um<00:04:08.340> there's<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.430> bit<00:04:09.640> of

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
looks kind of cheap um there's a bit of

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.260 
looks kind of cheap um there's a bit of
sculpting<00:04:10.330> on<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.900> helm<00:04:11.440> here<00:04:12.180> which<00:04:13.180> looks

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
sculpting on the helm here which looks

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.420 
sculpting on the helm here which looks
neat<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:13.870> never<00:04:14.200> even<00:04:14.440> noticed<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.100> on<00:04:15.340> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
neat I never even noticed this on the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.479 
neat I never even noticed this on the
character<00:04:15.880> himself<00:04:16.000> before<00:04:16.540> or<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.109> I<00:04:17.489> don't

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
character himself before or so I don't

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.029 
character himself before or so I don't
know

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
know

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.469 
know
otherwise<00:04:21.039> really<00:04:21.699> looks<00:04:21.880> great<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.360> only

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
otherwise really looks great the only

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.150 
otherwise really looks great the only
problem<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:22.990> doesn't<00:04:23.350> clip<00:04:23.680> all<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.009> way

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
problem is this doesn't clip all the way

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.770 
problem is this doesn't clip all the way
I<00:04:24.900> believe<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.110> yeah<00:04:26.380> here<00:04:26.560> goes<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.039> unsnaps

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
I believe it yeah here goes it unsnaps

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.809 
I believe it yeah here goes it unsnaps
for<00:04:28.780> like<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.930> normal-looking<00:04:29.349> hand<00:04:29.889> but<00:04:30.220> if

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 
for like a normal-looking hand but if

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.790 
for like a normal-looking hand but if
you're<00:04:31.000> familiar<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.770> characters<00:04:32.770> and

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
you're familiar with the characters and

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.430 
you're familiar with the characters and
the<00:04:32.979> games<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.490> so<00:04:33.639> forth<00:04:34.020> their<00:04:35.020> arms

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
the games and so forth their arms

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.830 
the games and so forth their arms
actually<00:04:35.979> go<00:04:36.220> all<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:37.210> way<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.360> Pierce<00:04:37.630> this

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
actually go all the way it Pierce this

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.450 
actually go all the way it Pierce this
is<00:04:37.990> actually<00:04:38.289> like<00:04:38.319> a<00:04:38.440> gauntlet<00:04:38.860> piece<00:04:39.190> as

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
is actually like a gauntlet piece as

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.589 
is actually like a gauntlet piece as
opposed<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.599> an<00:04:41.139> arm<00:04:41.349> piece<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:42.449> like<00:04:43.449> their

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
opposed to an arm piece and like their

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.629 
opposed to an arm piece and like their
arms<00:04:43.870> like<00:04:44.050> slide<00:04:44.410> into<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.860> gauntlet<00:04:45.280> itself

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
arms like slide into the gauntlet itself

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.210 
arms like slide into the gauntlet itself
so<00:04:45.910> this<00:04:46.120> isn't<00:04:46.449> like<00:04:46.569> really<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.220> realistic

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
so this isn't like really a realistic

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.270 
so this isn't like really a realistic
interpretation<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.919> there<00:04:50.919> should<00:04:51.099> actually

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
interpretation and there should actually

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.370 
interpretation and there should actually
be<00:04:51.550> one<00:04:51.819> on<00:04:51.970> each<00:04:52.090> arm<00:04:54.960> let<00:04:55.960> me<00:04:56.080> just<00:04:56.229> quickly

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
be one on each arm let me just quickly

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.610 
be one on each arm let me just quickly
pop<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.949> back<00:04:57.039> on<00:04:57.360> now<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.690> got<00:04:58.990> this<00:04:59.139> guy<00:04:59.349> for

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
pop that back on now I got this guy for

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.710 
pop that back on now I got this guy for
10<00:04:59.830> bucks<00:05:00.160> which<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.610> feel<00:05:00.789> is<00:05:00.849> kind<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.270> rip<00:05:01.539> off
