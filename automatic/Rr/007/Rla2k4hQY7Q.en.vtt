00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.490
 and the beginning of the 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.680
 works to expand the airport 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.110
 international jorge chávez news 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.580
 that the minister of 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.940
 transport and communications carlos 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.940
 walls 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.180
 but get a new terminal terminal 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.910
 is to determine what we grab we move it and 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.810
 we put it on the other side of the track 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.200
 obviously it's going to be built with what 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.220
 latest technology and engineering 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.599
 agreement what is built in the 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.860
 airports today is an airport 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.230
 to be modern and to be 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.670
 projected as I told you to be able to 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.140
 have a sufficient capacity to 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.050
 store 30 million passengers in 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.059
 set not a video that graphs the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.010
 growth of a country and a 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.310
 airport that will grow twice as much 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.350
 capacity 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.870
 the works that will begin in the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.120
 next months will ratify the jorge 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.630
 Chávez as one of the most airports 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.010
 important of this part of the continent 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.710
 when we started the function of the year 2001 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.900
 they will be mobilized for the sake of Chávez 44 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.250
 million passengers this year we go 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.080
 be closing at approximately 15 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.700
 million tickets receives less than 12 years 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.650
 are more than tripled the volume of 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.690
 passengers that were moving and towards the 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.570
 end of the concession from the year 2030 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.860
 We estimate that we analyze no less than 30 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.670
 million passengers per airport 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.290
 because charts 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.610
 it's going to be a modular development 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.050
 17 million meter drum 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.280
 squares is to develop an area for 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.320
 is that doing properly the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.540
 passenger terminal area for party 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.100
 of planes on the north side we think 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.900
 rolling infrastructure area is 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.760
 say this maintenance areas both 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.160
 of aircraft as well as ramp equipment 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.690
 more than an integral development thinking 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.860
 in modern concepts that speak of 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.110
 what is a city of ports and the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.360
 integration of the environment 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.460
 the airport transport node to the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.070
 city either around the hotel of 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.860
 four stars coasts of the sun ramada 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.350
 located inside jorge chávez is 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.530
 will add to the majestic neighborhood and the hotel 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.660
 ibis of the court mark but they will not be 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.490
 only near the airport 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.640
 will build the new hotel Jorge Chávez 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.620
 of accord and the holiday inn airport all 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.530
 with an investment of 100 million 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.520
 dollars and aim to be executed before 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.520
 of 2015
