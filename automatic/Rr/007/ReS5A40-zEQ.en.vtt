call a con form machine and basically
what<00:00:55.420> it<00:00:55.540> does<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.460> place<00:00:57.700> this<00:00:57.880> on<00:00:58.060> an

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
what it does is you place this on an

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.450 
what it does is you place this on an
individual's<00:00:58.660> head<00:00:58.900> and<00:00:59.230> if<00:01:00.040> you<00:01:00.130> look<00:01:00.280> inside

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
individual's head and if you look inside

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.910 
individual's head and if you look inside
you<00:01:00.880> can<00:01:00.910> see<00:01:01.270> that<00:01:01.510> all<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.930> these<00:01:02.050> hard<00:01:02.740> wood

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920

pin on the top which I'll show you in a
second<00:01:08.170> but<00:01:08.290> as<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.560> head<00:01:08.680> goes<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.490> pushes

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
second but as the head goes in it pushes

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.499 
second but as the head goes in it pushes
out<00:01:10.479> on<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.840> spring<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.530> spring<00:01:11.700> holds<00:01:12.700> the

out on a spring the spring holds the

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.660 
out on a spring the spring holds the
fingers<00:01:14.290> in<00:01:14.500> but<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.829> head<00:01:15.009> pushes<00:01:15.369> them<00:01:15.520> out

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
fingers in but the head pushes them out

when<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.479> look<00:01:16.659> at<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.869> top<00:01:17.250> there<00:01:18.250> are<00:01:18.280> a

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
when you look at the top there are a

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.300 
when you look at the top there are a
series<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.479> pins<00:01:19.869> one<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.740> corresponds<00:01:21.280> with

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
series of pins one that corresponds with

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.420 
series of pins one that corresponds with
each<00:01:21.610> one<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.909> these<00:01:22.000> little<00:01:22.210> black<00:01:23.040> legs<00:01:24.040> and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
each one of these little black legs and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.480 
each one of these little black legs and
as<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:26.050> head<00:01:26.230> goes<00:01:26.440> in<00:01:26.710> of<00:01:26.890> course<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.250> pin

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
as the head goes in of course the pin

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.410 
as the head goes in of course the pin
will<00:01:27.730> move<00:01:27.940> in<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.360> corresponding<00:01:28.750> fashion<00:01:29.560> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
will move in a corresponding fashion and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.810 
will move in a corresponding fashion and
it<00:01:31.420> would<00:01:31.659> take<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.170> an<00:01:32.590> oval<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.430> everyone's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it would take a an oval and everyone's

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.380 
it would take a an oval and everyone's
heads<00:01:34.120> are<00:01:34.330> shaped<00:01:34.570> differently

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
heads are shaped differently

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.280 
heads are shaped differently
generally<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.630> back<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.930> the<00:01:37.990> head<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.260> a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
generally the back of the head is a

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.080 
generally the back of the head is a
little<00:01:38.500> wider<00:01:38.950> than<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.400> temple<00:01:39.790> but<00:01:39.970> it

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
little wider than the temple but it

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.399 
little wider than the temple but it
would<00:01:40.180> pick<00:01:40.330> up<00:01:40.450> all<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.200> little

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
would pick up all of the little

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.340 
would pick up all of the little
variations<00:01:42.370> in<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:42.640> head<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.080> once<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.200> had

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
variations in the head and once you had

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.530 
variations in the head and once you had
it<00:01:44.470> properly<00:01:44.860> situated<00:01:45.790> on<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.909> firefighters

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
it properly situated on the firefighters

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.490 
it properly situated on the firefighters
head<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.560> would<00:01:47.710> then<00:01:47.799> insert<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:50.409> we

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
head you would then insert what we

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.560 
head you would then insert what we
called<00:01:50.680> our<00:01:50.799> conformed<00:01:51.370> ticket<00:01:51.729> which<00:01:52.360> had<00:01:52.540> a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
called our conformed ticket which had a

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.240 
called our conformed ticket which had a
serial<00:01:53.110> number<00:01:53.380> on<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:53.770> we<00:01:53.890> could<00:01:54.010> match<00:01:54.220> it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
serial number on it so we could match it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.840 
serial number on it so we could match it
up<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.970> product<00:01:55.720> later<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:02:00.520> place

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
up with the product later and then place

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.750 
up with the product later and then place
it<00:02:00.880> on<00:02:01.270> top<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> firefighters<00:02:02.470> head<00:02:02.860> the

it on top of the firefighters head the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.149 
it on top of the firefighters head the
fingers<00:02:04.150> would<00:02:04.330> open<00:02:04.690> up<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.170> when<00:02:05.740> we<00:02:05.860> had<00:02:06.040> it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
fingers would open up and when we had it

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.389 
fingers would open up and when we had it
done<00:02:06.369> properly<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:07.240> we<00:02:07.810> were<00:02:08.080> even<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.250> both

so to speak let go and flip it up when
you<00:02:18.610> were<00:02:18.730> done<00:02:20.250> you'd<00:02:21.250> end<00:02:21.459> up<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:23.709> con

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
you were done you'd end up with the con

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.420 
you were done you'd end up with the con
form<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:24.610> would<00:02:24.790> be<00:02:24.910> cut<00:02:25.240> out

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
form which would be cut out

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.720 
form which would be cut out
and<00:02:27.390> you'd<00:02:27.629> end<00:02:27.840> up<00:02:28.019> with<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:29.280> little<00:02:29.549> piece

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
and you'd end up with that little piece

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.569 
and you'd end up with that little piece
of<00:02:29.879> paper<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.750> piece<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.290> paper<00:02:31.579> represented

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
of paper that piece of paper represented

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.119 
of paper that piece of paper represented
that<00:02:32.970> specific<00:02:33.599> firefighters<00:02:34.290> head<00:02:34.590> shape

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
that specific firefighters head shape

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.910 
that specific firefighters head shape
that<00:02:36.060> would<00:02:36.420> be<00:02:36.569> then<00:02:36.810> placed<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.590> device

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
that would be then placed in a device

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.860 
that would be then placed in a device
similar<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.909> called<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.450> four-million

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
similar to this called a four-million

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.440 
similar to this called a four-million
and<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.920> drop<00:02:41.189> that<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.329> would

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and you drop that in and then you would

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.839 
and you drop that in and then you would
bring<00:02:42.659> in<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.560> little<00:02:43.829> spikes<00:02:44.099> all<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.730> way

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
bring in the little spikes all the way

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.300 
bring in the little spikes all the way
around<00:02:45.209> until<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:46.650> correspondent<00:02:47.189> to<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
around until it correspondent to the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.490 
around until it correspondent to the
edge<00:02:47.549> tighten<00:02:48.299> them<00:02:48.420> down<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
edge tighten them down and then that

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.190 
edge tighten them down and then that
block<00:02:49.890> was<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.670> actual<00:02:51.150> accurate<00:02:51.780> dimension

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
block was the actual accurate dimension

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.500 
block was the actual accurate dimension
of<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.439> firefighters<00:02:52.980> head<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.700> would<00:02:54.359> then

of the firefighters head that would then

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.740 
of the firefighters head that would then
be<00:02:54.659> placed<00:02:55.099> into<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.280> helmet<00:02:56.489> you'd<00:02:57.359> heat<00:02:57.599> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
be placed into the helmet you'd heat the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.149 
be placed into the helmet you'd heat the
helmet<00:02:58.019> up<00:02:58.140> with<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> torch<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.889> you<00:02:59.010> would

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
helmet up with a torch and you would

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.240 
helmet up with a torch and you would
shape<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.730> helmet<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> make<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.500> take<00:03:02.010> the

shape the helmet and make it take the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.289 
shape the helmet and make it take the
conforms<00:03:02.970> curves<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.109> shapes<00:03:05.180> then<00:03:06.180> you

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
conforms curves and shapes then you

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.670 
conforms curves and shapes then you
would<00:03:06.420> take<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.690> out<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.019> helmet<00:03:07.290> would<00:03:07.409> cool

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
would take it out the helmet would cool

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.129 
would take it out the helmet would cool
and<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.099> that<00:03:08.250> helmet<00:03:08.670> was<00:03:09.359> fitted<00:03:09.989> and
