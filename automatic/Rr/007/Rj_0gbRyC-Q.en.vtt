00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.400
 hello stone bloggers and passionate about 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.400
 cars forever 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.970
 we find a small sports side of 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.109
 pretty lines it's dynamic it's 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.109
 rather nice what 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.220
 I think when with a family 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.720
 many is pretty good 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.970
 you have the children behind who can 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.650
 play that have a lot of room for them 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.170
 and then even in front of the parents they have 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:52.000
 still a little bit of a step back 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 so here it is really comfort I 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.340
 rarely seen from chest as big as that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.920
 I believe that this without dignity that it is 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.000
 rather huge I wonder if it's not 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.050
 one of the biggest in the market 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.610
 so when flap the seats there it's 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.210
 awesome koala time i serve car angels 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.660
 everything with the beautiful days that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.670
 arrive 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.170
 there is the little catch in the trunk there 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.369
 so that's pretty good for them 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.280
 picnics one can plug in his 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.640
 electric cooler so well well 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 thought 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.320
 level of all small 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.220
 storage that inside is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.260
 rather not bad I like 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.510
 transparent weekend to have always 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.970
 the stuff for laying my cane is my 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.860
 sandwich the little stuff for with the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.660
 friends so it's kind of nice 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.980
 there is something for everyone, so 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.480
 even in the back there are small 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:46.580
 storage and all that so it's good 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:49.140
 done at the level of driving that's it 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.190
 healthier we will say good performance 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.590
 road is still a big jig 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.790
 and paws under finally there's no 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.790
 worries it's pretty flexible 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.530
 I often go on weekends with 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.570
 friends at the sea â€‹â€‹but just like that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.650
 there is a fatigue detector this is the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.200
 small option that is still not bad 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.310
 we make big trips there are 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.530
 lots of little things at the 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.069
 security of the good options that are who 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.069
 are smart
