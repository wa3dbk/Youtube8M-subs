00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.769
 hello good welcome to android fusion 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.860
 today we are going to do a small review 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:12.130
 of the nexus 7 in the last tablet taken 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.650
 by google a scant month ago and that is going to 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.230
 To arrive Spain in September we will 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.230
 we imported from britain this 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.170
 is the 8 gb model and the tablet counts 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.380
 with an nvidia tegra 3 to 1 with 3 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.160
 gigahertz the nvidia processor 4 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.289
 cores plus one battery saving 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.920
 has the nvidia graph of 12 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:40.269
 cores a 7-inch screen with 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.249
 resolution 1280 x 800 capacity 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:48.940
 have 8 or 16 GB without micro SD a camera 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:51.809
 front that records in hd and that only 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.069
 It is available for video conferencing 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.730
 then this tablet also has the 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:01:01.480
 bluetooth gps nfc 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.839
 of a battery of 4300 milliamps and 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.090
 of course of living 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.380
 let's light up a bit so that what 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 you see the interface 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.730
 as you can see they move the menus 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.550
 completely fluid 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.480
 This tablet is a teacher in Spain for a 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.530
 price of 200 200 euros the version of 8 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.690
 gigas and 250 the 16 version is a 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.970
 very very good price for the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.520
 features that google has us 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.640
 guarantees about 10 hours of reproduction 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.600
 video 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.640
 and about eight of a sailing and the truth 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.979
 is that we have about ten days with her 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.250
 and it's pretty good at rest 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.250
 to last 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 usually one down every three hours 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 approximately until about 300 hours 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 at rest with the table we have with wifi 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.610
 activated without wifi and would last more good 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.280
 let's put some game so that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.280
 You can see that everything moves smoothly 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 let's put some more like that a bit 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.030
 so that you can see that this tablet 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.690
 it has great potential, that is, everything 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.030
 that we have completely flushed 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.180
 because the web browsing game what 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.180
 be 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.090
 as you can see 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.490
 and remember that these games are 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.580
 teaching they have special graphics 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.370
 nvidia tegra 3 which is the best that in 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.820
 normal ones and the truth is that it shows 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.820
 without noticing 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:58.720
 well also highlight what 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.060
 that google with the tablet gives us the book 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.420
 of the tablet's guide to know 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.150
 use it and such here in Spain will come here 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.470
 in Spain it enters in Spanish but here 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.730
 as we read amount england then in 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.690
 English we also come a couple of 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.820
 books plus the movie of transformers and 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.670
 16 pounds to spend on google place 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.280
 Great Britain and $ 25 on Google Play 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.440
 in Spain it is not yet known how much will be 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.620
 but approximately those conversions 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.870
 They give about 20 euros 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.430
 now let's go to the page of 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.430
 android fusion for you to see 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.129
 who loads everything 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.499
 quickly 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.330
 this is the mobile version now we're going 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.330
 to 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.569
 to load the normal version 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:10.569
 let's do some zoom flash 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.460
 as you can see it moves everything 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.460
 completely fluid 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.419
 let's load a news is by 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.419
 example that this same tablet 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:31.940
 the truth is that to read and all that is 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.940
 a wonder you see of putÃ­sima mother 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.260
 good now let's teach android bean 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.750
 there is the notification table here 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:48.250
 where is the mail and all that how 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.750
 comes vital is not the one that reads well google 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.850
 the 7-inch tablets what they have 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.890
 fact has been to put the interface of 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.510
 mobile in the 10 days and that takes 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.940
 tablet interface but in those of 7 land 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.620
 I wanted to do a little more a little more 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.870
 mobile so we will not see them 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.050
 those of 7 unless we make a small 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.449
 so let's install some rom custom do not 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.520
 we will see the tablet mode well now what 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.460
 what are we going to do is 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:17.430
 with the galaxy nexus what we are going to do 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:20.940
 is to use android bean 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.940
 so you can see that we can do the 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:27.320
 including file sharing 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.730
 we put the table here 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.730
 we put the phone here 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.329
 and put this 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:55.230
 all to share 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.230
 and at this time 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.900
 we can see it there 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.050
 what is happening 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:09.960
 and the novelty with 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:12.000
 in front of acs is that that's not what 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.819
 We could do or simply say 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.949
 that what we could do was pass 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.319
 locate the days of maps web pages 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:23.370
 YouTube links but now we can 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:26.099
 pass both videos and photos well this 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.780
 at the moment it's all for anything 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.780
 in android fusion you have us
