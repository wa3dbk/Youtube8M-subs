so<00:00:51.770> I'm<00:00:52.250> on<00:00:52.430> level<00:00:52.610> two<00:00:52.970> because<00:00:53.360> i<00:00:53.480> already

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
so I'm on level two because i already

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.790 
so I'm on level two because i already
had<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:53.960> go<00:00:54.170> with<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:54.440> game<00:00:55.030> previously<00:00:56.030> and

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
had a go with this game previously and

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.410 
had a go with this game previously and
yeah<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:57.980> about<00:00:58.129> taking<00:00:58.550> these<00:00:58.910> pieces<00:00:59.239> of

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
yeah it's about taking these pieces of

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.860 
yeah it's about taking these pieces of
cloth<00:00:59.809> with<00:01:00.770> different<00:01:01.250> shapes<00:01:01.489> and<00:01:01.870> placing

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
cloth with different shapes and placing

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.920 
cloth with different shapes and placing
them<00:01:02.899> here<00:01:04.659> to<00:01:05.659> fill<00:01:06.020> out<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:08.540> quote<00:01:10.780> keep<00:01:11.780> in

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
them here to fill out the quote keep in

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.510 
them here to fill out the quote keep in
mind<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.259> there's<00:01:12.500> not<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:13.070> there<00:01:13.490> is

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
mind that there's not that there is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.550 
mind that there's not that there is
really<00:01:13.670> not<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.150> strict<00:01:14.570> logic<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.920> the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
really not a strict logic to the the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.969 
really not a strict logic to the the
placement<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.700> pieces<00:01:19.960> so<00:01:20.960> for<00:01:21.920> example

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
placement of the pieces so for example

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.620 
placement of the pieces so for example
if<00:01:22.490> you're<00:01:22.700> looking<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.450> place<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:25.280> same

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
if you're looking to place the same

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.440 
if you're looking to place the same
pattern<00:01:27.130> next<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.280> each<00:01:28.399> other<00:01:28.640> same<00:01:29.180> pieces

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
pattern next to each other same pieces

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.480 
pattern next to each other same pieces
with<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.840> same<00:01:30.050> pattern<00:01:30.470> well<00:01:31.009> that's<00:01:31.310> not

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
with the same pattern well that's not

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.740 
with the same pattern well that's not
really<00:01:31.550> how<00:01:31.970> it<00:01:32.000> works<00:01:32.149> is<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.320> because<00:01:34.750> they

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
really how it works is it because they

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.109 
really how it works is it because they
threw<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> switcheroo<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.610> makes<00:01:37.910> one<00:01:38.090> of

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
threw a switcheroo here and makes one of

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.480 
threw a switcheroo here and makes one of
those<00:01:38.330> old-fashioned<00:01:39.050> quilts<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.679> have

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
those old-fashioned quilts that have

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.870 
those old-fashioned quilts that have
very<00:01:41.360> different<00:01:42.020> shapes<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.130> them<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.640> one<00:01:43.850> I

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
very different shapes to them this one I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.389 
very different shapes to them this one I
think<00:01:44.030> is<00:01:44.360> actually<00:01:44.539> making<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.530> flower<00:01:45.830> if<00:01:46.190> you

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
think is actually making a flower if you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.820 
think is actually making a flower if you
look<00:01:46.580> closely<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.920> it's<00:01:49.369> really<00:01:49.670> about<00:01:50.830> the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
look closely so it's really about the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.270 
look closely so it's really about the
big<00:01:52.580> picture<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:54.170> overall<00:01:54.649> shape<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.039> the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
big picture the the overall shape of the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.340 
big picture the the overall shape of the
quilt<00:01:55.579> once<00:01:55.909> it's<00:01:56.119> finished<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.990> uses

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
quilt once it's finished the uses

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.550 
quilt once it's finished the uses
different<00:01:57.530> patterns<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.810> well<00:01:59.810> you<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.380> need

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
different patterns and well you you need

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.490 
different patterns and well you you need
to<00:02:00.590> act<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.400> instinct<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.060> place<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.079> proper

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
to act on instinct and place the proper

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.759 
to act on instinct and place the proper
pieces<00:02:03.920> in<00:02:04.070> there<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.970> for<00:02:05.600> example<00:02:05.630> if<00:02:06.320> if

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
pieces in there so for example if if

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.640 
pieces in there so for example if if
this<00:02:09.769> looks<00:02:10.160> about<00:02:10.549> right<00:02:11.019> we're<00:02:12.019> trying<00:02:12.380> to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
this looks about right we're trying to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.920 
this looks about right we're trying to
make<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.890> flower<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.910> seems<00:02:14.180> like<00:02:14.510> some

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
make a flower and this seems like some

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.600 
make a flower and this seems like some
part<00:02:15.230> of<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> background<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.160> other<00:02:16.340> half

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
part of the background the other half

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.280 
part of the background the other half
will<00:02:16.850> probably<00:02:17.299> use<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:17.750> as<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:17.989> background

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
will probably use this as a background

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.310 
will probably use this as a background
while<00:02:19.130> these<00:02:19.400> over<00:02:19.730> here<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.090> pedal<00:02:20.450> see<00:02:20.660> so

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
while these over here the pedal see so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.080 
while these over here the pedal see so
you<00:02:21.829> need<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.100> keep<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:22.610> mind<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you need to keep this in mind and

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.850 
you need to keep this in mind and
quickly<00:02:23.450> analyze<00:02:23.600> exactly<00:02:24.170> what's<00:02:24.590> going<00:02:24.860> on

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
quickly analyze exactly what's going on

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.850 
quickly analyze exactly what's going on
