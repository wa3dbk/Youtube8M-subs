i'm making i have made an automated

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.410 
i'm making i have made an automated
wheat<00:00:13.139> farm<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:14.040> really<00:00:14.400> quick<00:00:14.610> minus

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
wheat farm that is really quick minus

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.630 
wheat farm that is really quick minus
twice<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:15.990> fast<00:00:16.170> as<00:00:16.440> most<00:00:16.710> other<00:00:16.949> models<00:00:17.340> could

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
twice as fast as most other models could

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.740 
twice as fast as most other models could
be<00:00:17.880> previously<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.880> here<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> is<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
be previously so here it is this is the

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.990 
be previously so here it is this is the
interface<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.400> just<00:00:23.550> step<00:00:23.820> in

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
interface and to use it you just step in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.960 
interface and to use it you just step in
here<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.420> spam<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.859> seats<00:00:28.580> then<00:00:29.580> you

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
here and spam with your seats then you

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.350 
here and spam with your seats then you
receive<00:00:30.359> meat<00:00:30.560> as<00:00:31.560> i<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.980> show<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.640> but

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
receive meat as i can show you here but

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060 
receive meat as i can show you here but
almost<00:00:33.750> through<00:00:33.960> six<00:00:34.200> feet<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.739> i<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.950> just

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
almost through six feet and i can just

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.740 
almost through six feet and i can just
find<00:00:35.309> more<00:00:35.610> by<00:00:36.510> holding<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> seats<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
find more by holding the seats and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:47.510 
find more by holding the seats and
clicking<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> yeah<00:00:41.149> pro<00:00:42.149> longer<00:00:46.219> that's<00:00:47.219> how

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
clicking it yeah pro longer that's how

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.340 
clicking it yeah pro longer that's how
you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.850> use<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.059> really<00:00:48.690> simple<00:00:48.989> thing<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you can use it really simple thing and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
you can use it really simple thing and
it's<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.280> quick<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> plant

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's really quick because you can plant

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
it's really quick because you can plant
seeds<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> Pistons<00:00:53.160> down<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
seeds when the Pistons down there and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.490 
seeds when the Pistons down there and
when<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.750> both<00:00:55.020> times<00:00:55.230> your

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
when it's up there and both times your

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
when it's up there and both times your
farm<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> fertilized<00:00:57.300> by<00:00:57.420> those

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
farm and it will be fertilized by those

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.009 
farm and it will be fertilized by those
two<00:00:57.840> Spencer's<00:00:58.199> containing<00:00:58.829> bone<00:00:59.219> meal<00:01:01.070> so

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
two Spencer's containing bone meal so

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.329 
two Spencer's containing bone meal so
you've<00:01:04.019> seen<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.710> weak<00:01:04.949> arms<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
you've seen a lot of these weak arms I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.380 
you've seen a lot of these weak arms I
assume<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.619> don't<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.430> any<00:01:08.760> other

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
assume and I don't think that any other

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.100 
assume and I don't think that any other
wheat<00:01:09.720> farm<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.950> faster<00:01:11.930> also<00:01:12.930> note<00:01:13.080> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
wheat farm is faster also note that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
wheat farm is faster also note that
because<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.860> these<00:01:13.950> trip<00:01:14.250> wire<00:01:14.430> hooks<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
because of these trip wire hooks the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
because of these trip wire hooks the
Spencer's<00:01:15.420> here<00:01:15.540> fire<00:01:15.810> randomly<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
Spencer's here fire randomly but that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
Spencer's here fire randomly but that
doesn't<00:01:17.100> matter<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.689> they<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.900> only

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
doesn't matter because they will only

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
doesn't matter because they will only
use<00:01:19.350> bone<00:01:19.650> meal<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
use bone meal if and then there is a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.429 
use bone meal if and then there is a
cropped<00:01:21.960> fertilize<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.220> soil<00:01:23.549> beneath<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
cropped fertilize on the soil beneath it

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.179 
cropped fertilize on the soil beneath it
also<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:28.350> only<00:01:28.590> works<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
also see that in this only works in the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.160 
also see that in this only works in the
snapshots<00:01:29.790> leading<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> Minecraft<00:01:30.990> 1.5

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
snapshots leading up to Minecraft 1.5

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.710 
snapshots leading up to Minecraft 1.5
yeah<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.470> produce<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.890> stack<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> wheat<00:01:35.460> in

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
yeah it can produce a stack of wheat in

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.340 
yeah it can produce a stack of wheat in
let<00:01:36.720> me<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:40.189> couple<00:01:41.189> yeah<00:01:42.200> half<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
let me think here couple yeah half a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.819 
let me think here couple yeah half a
minute<00:01:43.970> so<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.780> quick<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.560> gain

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
minute so it's a quick way to gain

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.359 
minute so it's a quick way to gain
weight<00:01:47.060> only<00:01:48.060> using<00:01:48.329> bone<00:01:48.540> meal<00:01:48.920> now<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.220> this

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
weight only using bone meal now on this

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
weight only using bone meal now on this
pad<00:01:50.610> bones<00:01:50.880> version<00:01:51.240> let<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:51.509> explain<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:52.079> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
pad bones version let me explain to you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.889 
pad bones version let me explain to you
how<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.649> works<00:01:53.390> basically<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
how this works basically we have the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.230 
how this works basically we have the
redstone<00:01:55.290> wire<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.829> hooked<00:01:56.759> up<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
redstone wire that is hooked up to the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.620 
redstone wire that is hooked up to the
strip<00:01:57.570> by<00:01:57.719> alert<00:01:58.110> triggers<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> obviously<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
strip by alert triggers it obviously and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.260 
strip by alert triggers it obviously and
that<00:02:00.630> leads<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.229> piston<00:02:01.710> piston

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
that leads into this piston piston

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.940 
that leads into this piston piston
extends<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
extends and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.969 
extends and
access<00:02:04.219> signal<00:02:04.700> turn<00:02:04.850> limiter<00:02:05.439> by<00:02:06.439> pushing

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
access signal turn limiter by pushing

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.979 
access signal turn limiter by pushing
this<00:02:07.189> block<00:02:07.430> out<00:02:07.640> here<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.420> piston<00:02:08.780> also

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
this block out here the piston also

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.080 
this block out here the piston also
completes<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.619> one<00:02:09.800> clock<00:02:10.160> which<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:10.729> running

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
completes the one clock which is running

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.440 
completes the one clock which is running
around<00:02:11.269> here<00:02:12.190> this<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.370> also<00:02:13.580> hooked<00:02:13.879> up<00:02:14.060> to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
around here this is also hooked up to

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.440 
around here this is also hooked up to
Peter<00:02:14.989> two<00:02:15.590> ticks<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.129> powers<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.060> piston

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
Peter two ticks that powers the piston

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.009 
Peter two ticks that powers the piston
and<00:02:17.530> pushes<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> soil<00:02:18.950> as<00:02:19.269> well<00:02:20.269> we<00:02:20.750> have<00:02:20.870> some

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
and pushes the soil as well we have some

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.770 
and pushes the soil as well we have some
dispenses<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:21.620> here<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.060> they<00:02:23.060> are<00:02:23.090> looked<00:02:23.630> up

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
dispenses up here and they are looked up

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.509 
dispenses up here and they are looked up
as<00:02:23.959> well<00:02:24.140> yeah<00:02:24.500> just<00:02:24.920> like<00:02:25.459> with<00:02:26.000> redstone<00:02:27.519> so

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
as well yeah just like with redstone so

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.900 
as well yeah just like with redstone so
let<00:02:29.480> me<00:02:29.510> fix<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.930> really<00:02:30.380> quick<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.830> get<00:02:31.760> on

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
let me fix that really quick and get on

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.420 
let me fix that really quick and get on
to<00:02:32.150> show<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.720> how<00:02:32.959> to<00:02:33.019> build<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:34.160> not<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
to show you how to build it it's not a

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.130 
to show you how to build it it's not a
hard<00:02:34.670> thing<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.420> does<00:02:35.690> take<00:02:35.930> some

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
hard thing but it does take some

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.009 
hard thing but it does take some
memorization<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:37.640> I<00:02:37.880> have<00:02:38.209> made<00:02:38.450> some<00:02:38.480> steps

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
memorization so I have made some steps

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.780 
memorization so I have made some steps
here<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.470> I'll<00:02:39.680> show<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.890> how<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.130> make<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.549> in

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
here and I'll show you how to make it in

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.520 
here and I'll show you how to make it in
a<00:02:40.910> couple<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.269> steps<00:02:41.480> back<00:02:41.900> here's<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> final

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
a couple of steps back here's the final

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.120 
a couple of steps back here's the final
product<00:02:44.079> right<00:02:45.079> dick<00:02:45.349> down<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> hole<00:02:45.829> too<00:02:46.099> deep

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
product right dick down a hole too deep

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.319 
product right dick down a hole too deep
and<00:02:46.549> 555<00:02:48.160> right<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> center<00:02:49.819> is<00:02:49.849> going<00:02:50.239> to

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
and 555 right in the center is going to

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.069 
and 555 right in the center is going to
be<00:02:50.480> your<00:02:51.110> soil<00:02:51.950> block<00:02:52.329> the<00:02:53.329> farmland<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.930> going

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
be your soil block the farmland is going

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.589 
be your soil block the farmland is going
to<00:02:54.140> be<00:02:54.200> right<00:02:54.349> in<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.560> center<00:02:54.829> of<00:02:54.860> that<00:02:55.599> then

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
to be right in the center of that then

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.640 
to be right in the center of that then
put<00:02:57.079> one<00:02:57.349> block<00:02:57.590> here<00:02:58.690> that's<00:02:59.690> only<00:03:00.019> one<00:03:00.500> deep

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
put one block here that's only one deep

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.410 
put one block here that's only one deep
and<00:03:00.890> one<00:03:01.220> block<00:03:01.400> back<00:03:01.579> there<00:03:01.790> that's<00:03:02.030> only<00:03:02.180> one

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
and one block back there that's only one

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.449 
and one block back there that's only one
deep<00:03:02.599> and<00:03:02.870> make<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.410> l-shape<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:04.250> that's

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
deep and make this l-shape here that's

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.880 
deep and make this l-shape here that's
three<00:03:05.209> deep<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.660> this<00:03:05.870> these<00:03:06.319> two<00:03:06.470> blocks<00:03:06.709> got

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
three deep and this these two blocks got

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.569 
three deep and this these two blocks got
to<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.069> three<00:03:07.310> deep<00:03:08.319> also<00:03:09.319> put<00:03:09.650> half<00:03:10.250> slabs

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
to be three deep also put half slabs

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.559 
to be three deep also put half slabs
right<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:11.329> and<00:03:12.790> another<00:03:13.790> half<00:03:14.060> step<00:03:14.180> there

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
right there and another half step there

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.080 
right there and another half step there
that's<00:03:15.260> two<00:03:15.470> blocks<00:03:15.620> above<00:03:15.859> and<00:03:16.310> another<00:03:16.880> half

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
that's two blocks above and another half

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.539 
that's two blocks above and another half
step<00:03:17.209> there<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.810> then<00:03:18.230> there<00:03:18.769> and<00:03:19.040> they're

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
step there and then there and they're

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.660 
step there and then there and they're
all<00:03:19.670> upset<00:03:20.090> our<00:03:20.269> half<00:03:20.420> slabs<00:03:20.690> next<00:03:21.380> you<00:03:21.620> put

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
all upset our half slabs next you put

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.729 
all upset our half slabs next you put
some<00:03:22.670> slabs<00:03:23.540> around<00:03:23.870> here<00:03:24.079> so<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.560> water

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
some slabs around here so the water

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.229 
some slabs around here so the water
doesn't<00:03:24.829> flow<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.400> break<00:03:25.549> your<00:03:25.670> redstone<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
doesn't flow and break your redstone and

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.319 
doesn't flow and break your redstone and
put<00:03:27.079> some<00:03:27.200> water<00:03:27.350> in<00:03:27.530> here<00:03:27.620> otherwise<00:03:28.329> yeah

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
put some water in here otherwise yeah

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.309 
put some water in here otherwise yeah
you're<00:03:29.569> going<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.780> destroy<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.200> whole

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
you're going to destroy your whole

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.809 
you're going to destroy your whole
redstone<00:03:30.799> because<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.370> world<00:03:31.519> is<00:03:31.639> going<00:03:31.670> to

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
redstone because the world is going to

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.789 
redstone because the world is going to
be<00:03:31.910> flowing<00:03:32.260> then<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.799> simply<00:03:35.350> run<00:03:36.350> redstone

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
be flowing then you simply run redstone

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.979 
be flowing then you simply run redstone
line<00:03:37.040> down<00:03:37.400> here<00:03:37.430> over<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.180> white<00:03:38.389> block<00:03:38.720> to

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
line down here over the white block to

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.809 
line down here over the white block to
the<00:03:39.019> back<00:03:39.319> block<00:03:39.590> and<00:03:41.200> run<00:03:42.200> the<00:03:42.380> l-shape<00:03:42.819> into

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
the back block and run the l-shape into

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.030 
the back block and run the l-shape into
this<00:03:43.940> book<00:03:44.180> from<00:03:45.139> that<00:03:45.350> block<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.799> take<00:03:46.010> a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
this book from that block you take a

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.000 
this book from that block you take a
repeater<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:47.079> run<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.260> redstone<00:03:48.590> signal<00:03:48.739> up

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
repeater and run the redstone signal up

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.120 
repeater and run the redstone signal up
here<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.569> compete<00:03:50.569> with<00:03:51.170> a<00:03:51.200> repeater<00:03:51.680> into

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
here and compete with a repeater into

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.349 
here and compete with a repeater into
that<00:03:52.310> block<00:03:53.049> then<00:03:54.190> put<00:03:55.190> redstone<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:55.940> all

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
that block then put redstone on all

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.740 
that block then put redstone on all
these<00:03:56.690> three<00:03:57.170> blocks<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.359> let<00:03:59.359> me<00:03:59.480> show<00:03:59.720> you

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
these three blocks so let me show you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.780 
these three blocks so let me show you
right<00:04:00.560> here<00:04:00.849> there<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:02.180> there<00:04:02.500> then<00:04:03.500> fill<00:04:04.370> the

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
right here there and there then fill the

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.750 
right here there and there then fill the
l-shape<00:04:05.410> previously<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.620> all<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.609> other

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
l-shape previously and all the other

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.580 
l-shape previously and all the other
half<00:04:07.970> slabs<00:04:08.299> except<00:04:08.959> those<00:04:09.109> holding<00:04:09.500> the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
half slabs except those holding the

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.720 
half slabs except those holding the
water<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.950> don't<00:04:10.069> need<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.340> fill<00:04:10.549> these<00:04:10.669> with

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
water you don't need to fill these with

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.649 
water you don't need to fill these with
redstone<00:04:11.590> right<00:04:12.590> left<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.519> do<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:13.879> to<00:04:14.090> put<00:04:14.390> a

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
redstone right left to do is to put a

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.199 
redstone right left to do is to put a
piston<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.290> here<00:04:15.590> facing<00:04:16.220> towards<00:04:16.940> the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
piston in here facing towards the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.330 
piston in here facing towards the
one<00:04:17.389> clock<00:04:17.660> with<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.049> block<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.590> wool<00:04:18.799> or<00:04:19.100> any

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
one clock with a block of wool or any

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.450 
one clock with a block of wool or any
other<00:04:19.549> non<00:04:19.759> transparent<00:04:20.060> block<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.600> front<00:04:20.630> and

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
other non transparent block in front and

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.909 
other non transparent block in front and
then<00:04:22.460> to<00:04:22.940> put<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.840> piston<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.229> pushes<00:04:24.590> the
