00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.320 
magazines in my lifetime and I've had

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
was thinking about it and I thought this

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.040 
was thinking about it and I thought this
would<00:00:31.970> be<00:00:32.119> great<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.780> kind<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.350> test<00:00:33.710> these<00:00:34.129> out

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
would be great to kind of test these out

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.360 
would be great to kind of test these out
with<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:36.199> all<00:00:36.379> so<00:00:36.830> I<00:00:37.600> decided<00:00:38.600> to<00:00:39.190> put<00:00:40.190> that

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
with you all so I decided to put that

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.630 
with you all so I decided to put that
into<00:00:40.670> action<00:00:41.360> and<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:42.440> video<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.219> going<00:00:43.520> to

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
into action and this video is going to

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.529 
into action and this video is going to
be<00:00:43.790> my<00:00:44.120> first<00:00:44.420> makeup<00:00:44.989> mythbusters'<00:00:46.510> where<00:00:47.510> I

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
be my first makeup mythbusters' where I

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.619 
be my first makeup mythbusters' where I
take<00:00:48.050> a<00:00:48.379> beauty<00:00:49.250> tip<00:00:49.460> that<00:00:49.670> I've<00:00:49.820> seen<00:00:50.120> or<00:00:50.450> read

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
take a beauty tip that I've seen or read

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.580 
take a beauty tip that I've seen or read
and<00:00:51.050> actually<00:00:52.090> put<00:00:53.090> it<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.300> work<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:53.690> see<00:00:54.020> if<00:00:54.289> I

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
and actually put it to work and see if I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.920 
and actually put it to work and see if I
think<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:54.980> works<00:00:55.219> it'll<00:00:55.969> be<00:00:56.270> kind<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.780> a

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
think it works it'll be kind of a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.310 
think it works it'll be kind of a
slightly<00:00:57.800> less<00:00:58.190> scientific<00:00:58.789> version<00:00:59.780> of<00:00:59.989> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.710 
curl this this eye has kind of a harder
to<00:02:32.420> curl<00:02:33.460> truth<00:02:34.460> be<00:02:34.580> told<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:35.060> sleep<00:02:35.420> on<00:02:35.570> this

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
to curl truth be told I sleep on this

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.020 
to curl truth be told I sleep on this
side<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.110> most<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> think<00:02:36.650> these<00:02:37.030> eyelashes

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
side the most so I think these eyelashes

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.250 
side the most so I think these eyelashes
are<00:02:38.180> most<00:02:38.870> often<00:02:39.370> naturally<00:02:40.370> curly<00:02:40.790> so<00:02:41.750> I

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
are most often naturally curly so I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.680 
are most often naturally curly so I
rarely<00:02:42.860> curl<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.460> side<00:02:43.670> it's<00:02:44.330> kind<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:44.540> goofy

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
rarely curl that side it's kind of goofy

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.290 
rarely curl that side it's kind of goofy
huh<00:02:45.020> but<00:02:45.770> that's<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.760> truth

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
huh but that's the truth

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.710 
huh but that's the truth
and<00:02:47.390> this<00:02:47.750> side<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.790> have<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.940> curl<00:02:50.150> quite<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.480> lot

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
and this side I have to curl quite a lot

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.320 
and this side I have to curl quite a lot
and<00:02:50.900> sometimes<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.380> even<00:02:51.410> going<00:02:51.860> after<00:02:52.330> the

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
and sometimes I even going after the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.610 
and sometimes I even going after the
mascara<00:02:53.990> is<00:02:54.230> dried<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.510> apply<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.780> curl<00:02:57.470> it

pretty nice mascara if you don't mind a

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.410 
pretty nice mascara if you don't mind a
rubber<00:04:56.380> brush<00:04:56.710> which<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.310> don't<00:04:58.000> really<00:04:58.120> like<00:04:58.390> a

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
rubber brush which I don't really like a

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.740 
rubber brush which I don't really like a
rubber<00:04:58.690> brush<00:05:00.030> but<00:05:01.030> it's<00:05:01.240> a<00:05:01.330> pretty<00:05:01.510> nice

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
rubber brush but it's a pretty nice

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.240 
rubber brush but it's a pretty nice
mascara<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.410> this<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.680> the<00:05:02.800> waterproof

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
mascara and this is the waterproof

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
mascara and this is the waterproof
version

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.590 

so<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:12.870> don't<00:05:13.020> know<00:05:13.080> if<00:05:13.139> you<00:05:13.229> can<00:05:13.349> see

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
so I don't know if you can see

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.160 
so I don't know if you can see
it<00:05:15.140> definitely<00:05:15.470> works<00:05:16.510> but<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.540> think<00:05:17.840> I<00:05:17.930> over

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
it definitely works but I think I over

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.850 
it definitely works but I think I over
curl<00:05:18.440> cuz<00:05:18.680> can<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:18.980> see<00:05:19.190> they're<00:05:19.370> like<00:05:19.550> in<00:05:20.860> in

my lid so I hope you enjoyed that video
I<00:05:29.270> really<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:30.050> thought<00:05:30.290> it<00:05:30.380> was<00:05:30.500> kind<00:05:30.740> of<00:05:30.800> fun<00:05:31.010> to

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
I really I thought it was kind of fun to

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.990 
I really I thought it was kind of fun to
actually<00:05:31.640> put<00:05:31.970> that<00:05:32.680> tip<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:34.070> work<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.550> test

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
actually put that tip to work and test

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.530 
actually put that tip to work and test
it<00:05:35.210> out<00:05:35.390> I<00:05:35.690> definitely<00:05:36.380> think<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:37.010> works<00:05:37.540> maybe

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
it out I definitely think it works maybe

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.540 
it out I definitely think it works maybe
a<00:05:38.660> little<00:05:38.870> too<00:05:39.110> well<00:05:39.140> I<00:05:39.350> think<00:05:39.950> it's<00:05:40.220> probably

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
a little too well I think it's probably

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.950 
a little too well I think it's probably
something<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.060> requires<00:05:41.540> a<00:05:41.690> little

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
something that requires a little

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.130 
something that requires a little
practice<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.560> get<00:05:42.890> it<00:05:43.070> just<00:05:43.340> right<00:05:43.520> but<00:05:44.060> if<00:05:44.600> you

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
practice to get it just right but if you

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.470 
practice to get it just right but if you
are<00:05:45.620> looking<00:05:46.220> for<00:05:46.520> an<00:05:46.610> inexpensive<00:05:46.850> way<00:05:47.450> to

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500
