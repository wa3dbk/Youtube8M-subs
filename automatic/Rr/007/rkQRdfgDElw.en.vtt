00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.550
 mashka newspaper

 who then has enough 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:22.880
 spoons of gelatin pots begin 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:27.019
 put on the grass mitten mittens 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.019
 pipeman destroys 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:47.140
 and how much all fell down need roots 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:49.960
 I usually stove enters from 8 until 14 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.339
 logs depends on what they are 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.440
 what size and how many logs 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.110
 you put it bored me to this stove 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.899
 I will burn the floor was too expensive now! 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.610
 Well, yes, I began to broadcast 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.090
 put the stove on the glass and we have so much 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.090
 minami 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 at the same time from the super and blew 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.649
 in this stove as already mentioned two 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.350
 open fire mode and mode 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.229
 smoldering open fire mode used 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.289
 in order to kindle the stove right now 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.850
 this and demonstrate the advanced ashpit 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.850
 and open gate and 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:13.060
 It is open combustion process 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.129
 the process is used to ignite for 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.049
 cooking because now 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.060
 the temperature here will be very big and 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.410
 you can cook something or 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.500
 boil the kettle 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.040
 fry eggs with sausage or else 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.329
 anything and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.500
 warming up the room is very 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.750
 quick as has also been said too and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.440
 the most important is the chimney cleaning 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.480
 cleaning soot high temperature plant 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 welded from poured into the stove and there 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:49.260
 tan as it should be here the stove flared 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.910
 This is when it is already warm in the house 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:58.600
 put it into smoldering mode slides in 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.389
 ashpit and cover shutter super 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.030
 covered up 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:08.680
 all the flames there are now extinguished 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:12.010
 the temperature of the stove will drop everything in terms of already 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.650
 not visible and in this mode the oven will be 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.760
 be long long hours in this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.959
 mode, you can put the kettle here 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.700
 the temperature is not very big and the oven itself 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.910
 you can not leave safe 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 but you can not see it because 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.730
 now in the holon smoke there is a lot of smoke 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.829
 in this in this mode therefore the door in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.709
 This mode is best not to open 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:43.989
 open the doors you need to push again 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:46.780
 ashpit open the tire will kindle the flame here 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.530
 now we will very quickly smoke 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.170
 which is inside the firebox then 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.630
 open yet another little move 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:05.870
 But in this mode, and now I will climb 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.870
 someone brought this device all this 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.380
 the maintenance of this furnace is different 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.320
 maintenance is very simple to remove 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.320
 ash ash box
