there's<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> slope<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.160> your<00:00:38.370> car<00:00:38.670> can

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
there's a slope that way your car can

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.209 
there's a slope that way your car can
easily<00:00:39.420> catch<00:00:39.719> speed<00:00:40.230> out<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.500> close<00:00:40.829> range

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
easily catch speed out of close range

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.430 
easily catch speed out of close range
you<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.030> do<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.329> from<00:00:42.540> far<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
you can do this from far you can do this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
you can do this from far you can do this
from<00:00:43.590> close<00:00:43.890> either<00:00:44.129> way<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> works<00:00:44.789> but<00:00:45.030> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
from close either way it works but I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.529 
from close either way it works but I
feel<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> works<00:00:46.050> best<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:47.370> speed<00:00:48.030> from

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
feel like it works best with speed from

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.910 
feel like it works best with speed from
here<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.899> want<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> go<00:00:49.260> ahead<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> grab<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
here you want to go ahead and grab a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040 
here you want to go ahead and grab a
random<00:00:50.399> car<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> recommend<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> car<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.930> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
random car I recommend a car that it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
random car I recommend a car that it's
pretty<00:00:52.410> low<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.489> easy<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.180> on

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
pretty low that way can easy to get on

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
pretty low that way can easy to get on
the<00:00:54.510> tank<00:00:54.989> because<00:00:55.350> part<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> glitch<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the tank because part of the glitch is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.970 
the tank because part of the glitch is
getting<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> tank<00:00:57.930> normally<00:00:58.530> when

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
getting on the tank normally when

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
getting on the tank normally when
getting<00:00:59.219> under<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.550> tank<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.300> blow<00:01:00.510> up

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
getting under the tank you would blow up

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.599 
getting under the tank you would blow up
but<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.649> case<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.039> didn't<00:01:02.430> know
