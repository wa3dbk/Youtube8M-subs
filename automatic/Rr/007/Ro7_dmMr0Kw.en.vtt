up that high it's ok to hold down the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.199 
up that high it's ok to hold down the
pedal<00:02:36.560> because<00:02:36.980> it's<00:02:37.340> gonna<00:02:37.459> sound<00:02:37.730> good

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209

DCB<00:03:05.080> that's<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.590> first<00:03:05.800> phrase<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:06.580> we<00:03:06.760> have

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
DCB that's the first phrase so we have

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.290 
DCB that's the first phrase so we have
one<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:12.310> see<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.550> I'm<00:03:12.640> saying<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:13.000> only<00:03:13.120> want

back up and go gb fight da again and
then<00:03:20.890> I'm<00:03:20.980> gonna<00:03:21.100> go<00:03:21.280> FD<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.769> that's<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.010> little

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
then I'm gonna go FD and that's a little

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.949 
then I'm gonna go FD and that's a little
faster<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.549> up<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.760> little<00:03:24.910> slower<00:03:25.209> there<00:03:25.450> it's

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
faster it up a little slower there it's

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.690 
faster it up a little slower there it's
kind<00:03:26.049> of<00:03:26.140> my<00:03:26.260> weight<00:03:26.590> my<00:03:26.620> way<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.100> notating

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
kind of my weight my way of notating

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.850 
kind of my weight my way of notating
that<00:03:27.819> it's<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.030> little<00:03:28.209> faster<00:03:28.739> they're<00:03:29.739> going

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
that it's a little faster they're going

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.080 
that it's a little faster they're going
to<00:03:30.010> go<00:03:30.130> see<00:03:30.819> DFT<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:33.519> then<00:03:33.670> see<00:03:33.970> B<00:03:34.330> flat<00:03:34.600> C<00:03:34.660> if<00:03:35.319> C

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
to go see DFT and then see B flat C if C

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.390 
to go see DFT and then see B flat C if C
B<00:03:37.090> flat<00:03:37.239> C<00:03:37.299> F<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:38.319> let's<00:03:38.500> play<00:03:38.709> this<00:03:38.920> box<00:03:39.280> right

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
B flat C F so let's play this box right

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.080 
B flat C F so let's play this box right
here<00:03:39.519> one

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.430 

let's<00:03:47.090> tie<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.330> two<00:03:47.540> boxes<00:03:47.720> together<00:03:48.080> because

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
let's tie the two boxes together because

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.900 
let's tie the two boxes together because
that's<00:03:48.620> how<00:03:48.740> you<00:03:48.770> need<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.160> learn<00:03:49.310> learn<00:03:49.880> a

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
that's how you need to learn learn a

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.640 
that's how you need to learn learn a
little<00:03:50.150> piece<00:03:50.420> get<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:50.810> down<00:03:50.990> there's<00:03:51.410> not<00:03:51.530> to

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
little piece get it down there's not to

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.340 
little piece get it down there's not to
be<00:03:51.740> fast<00:03:51.950> but<00:03:52.190> be<00:03:52.310> able<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.580> play<00:03:52.910> it<00:03:53.350> learn

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
be fast but be able to play it learn

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.740 
be fast but be able to play it learn
another<00:03:54.620> little<00:03:54.950> piece<00:03:55.130> get<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.060> down<00:03:56.180> be<00:03:56.600> able

another little piece get it down be able
to<00:03:56.840> plant<00:03:57.020> time<00:03:57.590> together<00:03:57.890> see<00:03:58.340> if<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.460> can<00:03:58.580> do

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
to plant time together see if you can do

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.610 
to plant time together see if you can do
them<00:03:58.730> together<00:03:58.850> then<00:03:59.660> add<00:03:59.990> another<00:04:00.020> little

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
them together then add another little

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.130 
them together then add another little
chunk<00:04:00.950> okay<00:04:01.310> and<00:04:01.580> then<00:04:02.150> eventually<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:03.080> have

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
chunk okay and then eventually you have

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.290 
chunk okay and then eventually you have
to<00:04:03.260> start<00:04:03.560> at<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.710> different<00:04:04.010> place<00:04:04.130> and<00:04:04.550> you

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
to start at a different place and you

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.030 
to start at a different place and you
don't<00:04:05.390> work<00:04:05.600> that<00:04:05.780> section<00:04:06.230> but<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:06.920> good

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
don't work that section but it's a good

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.760 
don't work that section but it's a good
way<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.250> practice<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:09.170> here<00:04:09.380> we<00:04:09.410> go<00:04:09.470> from<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
way to practice so here we go from the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:22.750 
way to practice so here we go from the
beginning<00:04:09.890> one<00:04:14.530> wait<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.560> little<00:04:15.770> bit<00:04:21.760> even

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
beginning one wait a little bit even

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.490 
beginning one wait a little bit even
though<00:04:22.910> this<00:04:23.060> isn't<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.480> rhythm<00:04:24.080> you<00:04:24.260> know<00:04:24.320> it's

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
though this isn't a rhythm you know it's

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.110 
though this isn't a rhythm you know it's
not<00:04:24.590> free<00:04:25.130> tip<00:04:25.400> oh<00:04:25.550> well<00:04:25.700> there's<00:04:25.820> not<00:04:25.970> any
