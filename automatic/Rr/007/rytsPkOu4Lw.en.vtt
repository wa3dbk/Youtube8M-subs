 [Music] 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.300
 very good to all mini postmen how 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.160
 you are hoping that well as you already know 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.259
 if you have gotten into your minecraft 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.889
 this news comes out that has already left 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.960
 minecraft 1.6 and that is available with 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.619
 a new launcher this has affected a lot 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.529
 to those of us who play for pirate because we do not 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.300
 we can download it and play the have done 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.810
 perhaps done so that nothing to play the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.519
 originals but a kid has taken a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.580
 launcher that what he has done is crack 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:36.500
 create and to play us 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.740
 pirates and well that's what I'm going to 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.400
 teach how to how to download install and 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.350
 play minecraft 1.6 and well let's go there 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.870
 we must close our minecraft what 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.340
 you have open we are going to start and 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.290
 we wrote % app data percent 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.760
 and in the point folder minecraft what 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.010
 we erase everything 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.970
 if you want to save some world that 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.300
 keep it safe 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.560
 to this now I will leave you in the description 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.899
 of the video a link 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.149
 you just give it to him and he will lead you 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.149
 mediafire and you download the launcher 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.620
 download it to your desktop 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.770
 the last downloaded I will not download 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.929
 and well let's see here 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.700
 we have it here and what we have to do 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.980
 is to extract it with winrar right click 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.620
 extract here 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.250
 we will have two folders we should not 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.980
 touch this we double click on this one 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 and you get a winrar icon you click 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.860
 right to open with daughter always goes with 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.860
 Java 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.250
 if it will open 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.899
 we must write the route of our 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.229
 point minecraft for that we'll go to 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:56.289
 start we will write % app data by 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.450
 hundred point bain craft we situate ourselves 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.299
 about this folder and we copy 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.429
 we select this and we copy it control 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.890
 or right click copy and now here 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.869
 with we erase everything and we give control 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.220
 more v 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.220
 and we will give you to save 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.359
 it will no longer appear in a new launcher 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.270
 and we'll see if he loads this 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.680
 to this and will begin to download everything 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.020
 we need to play this 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.100
 version and we can already play some 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.920
 points 6.1 the 1.6 snapshot and all 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.250
 that came out for this version 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 of Minecraft 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.040
 here we write our name and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.030
 we will put in my case that the games 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.030
 and good things that the 1.6 adds are to 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.390
 I have them on horses, armor 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.799
 for horses mules carpets cables 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.379
 carbon blocks more items and good is 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.329
 removed but brain and here you also have 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.980
 what is added but in English more or 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.099
 less what I have done is translate it already 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.750
 I will later make a hard review 1.6 and 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.420
 well we just let you download this 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.010
 it takes a long time so I'm going to pause 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.480
 the video when it's already at the end what 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.540
 I'm going to put them now, america 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.269
 zeros good thousand mailmen we are here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.799
 and for what you see it has already been installed and 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.799
 what we should do is give play 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 this if you want you lower it down and 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.270
 you can choose if you want to play which one 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.730
 you want nation ' 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.660
 let's fix when we give to play we are 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.660
 to load all this up here 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.010
 I say it is a pain to install what 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.310
 lasts at least the installation of 10 or 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.310
 15 minutes 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.019
 good and later also upload mods 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.239
 compatible with this version and the same 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.019
 you will have somehow gone up in my 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.019
 channel surely 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.890
 sometimes I load this because of the fabric 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.210
 who has a less powerful computer 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.210
 is going to throw twice as long 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.830
 i 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.920
 while you can 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.480
 some see a thing the way 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.790
 install mod is not like before 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.550
 As you can see what they have done is to do it 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.680
 by folders 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:25.660
 and you do not know how to install it 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.660
 so I'll need more help than ever 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.490
 well we have it, it will not start 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.620
 minecraft and here is already here what 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.620
 we configure we are going to configure it 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.990
 good options in Spanish 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.510
 It's worth affecting and well we'll give you a 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.510
 player that to the world 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:19.310
 and we can enjoy minecraft from 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.570
 new with more bikes more objects and more of 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.160

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.480
