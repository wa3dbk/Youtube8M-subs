00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.820
 today we are going to make beer chicken 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 to make beer chicken I have here 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 for 66 people in thigh and against thigh 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.470
 by people but I have taken and the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.610
 party separates it from what is the thigh 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.140
 of the against thigh then in two pieces 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.990
 then we have here to make a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.210
 food you can say familiar the six 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.010
 thighs with your thighs against 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.199
 we have what is a beer boat 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.860
 blonde these two bay leaves six 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.520
 cloves of garlic with their feet 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.470
 also 6 other small onions are 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.920
 you can put two big ones like what you 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:54.480
 want a pot of preserved mushrooms 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.260
 whole so this one is not laminated 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.260
 pepper the salt and the oil we had 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.500
 to fire because all this goes to the fire 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.960
 in a pan I put oil and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.960
 start by frying in the flesh 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:23.070
 if he takes everything and if not for what I put in the 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.070
 more point 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 LOL 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.240
 you are putting a little salt and you already 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.240
 fry until golden brown 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.510
 they are golden 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.370
 it goes away it's going to stand out 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.370
 and that are placing the 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.350
 then the onions that are 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.350
 they are achieving 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.439
 what you put while pepper 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.439
 chicken 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.670
 because he puts the pasta 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.700
 after that he will try 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.990
 and already they are opening what are the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.400
 onions 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.400
 it is well done 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.060
 and the laurel 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.150
 of onions and cooked 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.560
 and it is also put in the pan 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.569
 now 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.730
 I'm going to pass it 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:59.079
 the big brook pan I'm going to put 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.010
 a little bit to the maximum we are going to put a 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.010
 some oil 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.100
 I 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.890
 let's put the beer 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.060
 and I'm going to put more or less the same 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:24.130
 amount of beer than water 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.130
 it is now left to boil 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.760
 it reads now have it a little bit maximum 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:32.180
 but when it starts to boil it goes down to 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.819
 a medium fire is covered and it is left 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.060
 approximately for 30 or 40 minutes 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:40.549
 it depends on the chicken pieces what 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.890
 no matter how great this can be done with 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.240
 mule against thighs or a chicken 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.610
 whole match in pieces 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.610
 because with this half cooking it is tested 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.610
 to weigh 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.430
 the time as they do 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.500
 all right 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.500
 the color that has 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.530
 Well, it's very good, it needs a little bit 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.860
 of salt 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.250
 little bit 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.250
 and now the mushrooms are incorporated 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.830
 already distributed 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.370
 and already let it be done 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.310
 cover again and leave another 15 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.820
 minutes more or less 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.390
 well spent another 15 or 20 minutes with 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.150
 the mushroom then it looks like 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.080
 that has reduced the broth as it is all 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.050
 tender since it is extinguished from the fire and 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.320
 let stand a few minutes 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.240
 and then it is already planted 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.430
 finished and ready to take this rich 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.040
 chicken dish to beer can be 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.190
 how to accompany if you want some kick 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.190
 fried try it I hope that
