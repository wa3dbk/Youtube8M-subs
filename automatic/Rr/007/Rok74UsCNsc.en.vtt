00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
see you see it you like see little

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070

glimpses<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.150> him<00:01:27.299> every<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.840> again<00:01:27.900> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
glimpses of him every now and again but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.870 
glimpses of him every now and again but
when<00:01:28.500> he<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.650> at<00:01:28.740> Liverpool's<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.670> was

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
when he was at Liverpool's it was

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.350 
when he was at Liverpool's it was
constant<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.079> know<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.400> think<00:01:33.060> it

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
constant you know and so I think it

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
constant you know and so I think it
works<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.840> offering<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.200> maybe<00:01:34.530> refresh

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
works for offering to maybe refresh

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.420 
works for offering to maybe refresh
himself<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.030> try<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.570> again<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:38.340> as

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
himself and try and go again I think as

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.830 
himself and try and go again I think as
classic<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.659> big

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
