00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
are many instances of insurgents not
knowing<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.320> they're<00:01:22.470> using<00:01:22.770> in<00:01:23.100> their<00:01:23.369> IEDs

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
knowing what they're using in their IEDs

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.289 
knowing what they're using in their IEDs
they're<00:01:24.600> using<00:01:25.130> mustard<00:01:26.130> artillery<00:01:26.939> rounds

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299

the ex artillery rounds and their IDs

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.580 
the ex artillery rounds and their IDs

using<00:01:31.860> they<00:01:32.100> didn't<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.520> right<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
using they didn't do it right and so it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
using they didn't do it right and so it
just<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.590> didn't<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:34.920> hurt
