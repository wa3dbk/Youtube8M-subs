00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.000 
think the other thing is and i think
that's<00:03:03.360> really<00:03:03.570> interesting<00:03:04.380> because<00:03:04.860> i

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
that's really interesting because i

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.610 
that's really interesting because i
think<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.960> other<00:03:07.110> part<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.470> is<00:03:07.530> that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
think that the other part of it is that

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.620 
think that the other part of it is that
these<00:03:07.890> days<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.580> television<00:03:09.150> land<00:03:09.420> and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
these days with television land and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.930 
these days with television land and
everything<00:03:09.740> matches<00:03:10.740> have<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.160> almost<00:03:11.310> be<00:03:11.700> on

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
everything matches have to almost be on

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.120 
everything matches have to almost be on
this<00:03:12.210> dot<00:03:12.540> ought<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> second<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
this dot ought to the second in the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.550 
this dot ought to the second in the
length<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.630> can<00:03:15.780> understand<00:03:16.170> whether<00:03:16.380> you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
length so you can understand whether you

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.320 
length so you can understand whether you
plan<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:16.830> because<00:03:17.340> they've<00:03:17.850> got<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.120> get<00:03:18.240> it

plan it because they've got to get it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.880 
plan it because they've got to get it
its<00:03:18.480> core<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.780> could<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:19.020> right<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.620> it's<00:03:19.770> got

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
its core it could be right and it's got

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.170

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
feel and I am one of these people that

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.719 
feel and I am one of these people that
planned<00:04:32.870> stuff<00:04:33.199> so<00:04:33.440> that's<00:04:33.620> why<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.860> hurts<00:04:34.220> me

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
planned stuff so that's why it hurts me

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.300 
planned stuff so that's why it hurts me
more<00:04:34.909> probably<00:04:35.449> so<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.050> take<00:04:36.289> it<00:04:36.319> as<00:04:36.650> personally

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
more probably so I take it as personally

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.480 
more probably so I take it as personally
offensive<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.930> maybe<00:04:39.259> I<00:04:39.379> shouldn't<00:04:39.740> do<00:04:39.889> but<00:04:40.460> I

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
offensive and maybe I shouldn't do but I

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.010 
offensive and maybe I shouldn't do but I
think<00:04:40.819> when<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.210> also<00:04:41.449> I<00:04:41.479> share<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.870> same

used to be victim of it quite a lot

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.779 
used to be victim of it quite a lot
because<00:05:06.229> people<00:05:06.710> go<00:05:06.830> oh<00:05:07.069> yeah<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.490> was<00:05:07.610> only

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
because people go oh yeah it was only

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:08.860 
because people go oh yeah it was only
cause<00:05:07.909> he<00:05:07.940> was<00:05:08.120> friends<00:05:08.330> of<00:05:08.389> Eric<00:05:08.569> Bischoff

which<00:05:09.259> I<00:05:09.380> never<00:05:09.530> believed<00:05:09.830> always<00:05:10.159> what

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
which I never believed always what

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.909 
which I never believed always what
Dallas<00:05:10.909> Page<00:05:11.180> was<00:05:11.240> great<00:05:11.960> right<00:05:12.259> but<00:05:12.770> he

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
Dallas Page was great right but he

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.589 
Dallas Page was great right but he
always<00:05:13.039> he<00:05:13.460> always<00:05:13.699> got<00:05:13.819> a<00:05:13.880> lot<00:05:14.000> of<00:05:14.030> stick<00:05:14.389> from

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
always he always got a lot of stick from

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.990 
always he always got a lot of stick from
workers<00:05:15.080> and<00:05:15.530> inverted<00:05:15.830> commas<00:05:16.159> but<00:05:16.759> when<00:05:16.880> you

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
workers and inverted commas but when you

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.969 
workers and inverted commas but when you
start<00:05:17.270> when<00:05:17.780> savage<00:05:18.080> gets<00:05:18.409> that<00:05:18.590> level<00:05:18.919> of

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
start when savage gets that level of

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:20.170 
start when savage gets that level of
stick<00:05:19.219> as<00:05:19.340> well<00:05:19.490> that's<00:05:19.699> when<00:05:19.849> you<00:05:19.940> go<00:05:20.030> the

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
stick as well that's when you go the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.520 
stick as well that's when you go the
argument<00:05:20.539> doesn't<00:05:20.750> really<00:05:21.050> wash<00:05:21.289> because

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
argument doesn't really wash because

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.439 
argument doesn't really wash because
it's<00:05:21.740> fucking<00:05:22.219> Randy<00:05:22.639> sample<00:05:22.969> I'll<00:05:23.060> take<00:05:23.300> the

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.510 
it's fucking Randy sample I'll take the
I'll<00:05:23.659> take<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:23.990> music<00:05:24.259> argument<00:05:24.800> as<00:05:24.919> well<00:05:25.129> and

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
I'll take the music argument as well and

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.399 
I'll take the music argument as well and
take<00:05:25.699> that<00:05:25.880> to<00:05:26.060> the<00:05:26.090> same<00:05:26.569> sort<00:05:26.870> of<00:05:26.930> level<00:05:27.139> and

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
take that to the same sort of level and

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.920 
take that to the same sort of level and
more<00:05:27.620> maybe<00:05:28.159> closer<00:05:28.669> to<00:05:28.849> what<00:05:29.240> perhaps<00:05:29.810> were

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
more maybe closer to what perhaps were

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.559
