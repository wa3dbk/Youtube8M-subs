00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.799
 htc just introduced the one max with 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.170
 its giant 5.9-inch screen and its 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.780
 rather impressive speakers there 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.920
 looks like an UFO on android it's a 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.650
 very big tablet that passes 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.450
 our 3 for a small smartphone htc is 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.220
 the first android manufacturer to follow 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.439
 design codes also so 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.270
 so strict the whole series get 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.119
 look like the one mini the one 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.829
 obviously and the web max this one as 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.649
 you can see it unlike the 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.589
 two others aroused his frame is not 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.789
 aluminum but it's plastic this 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.649
 that allows to buy it's probably 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:40.850
 save a few grams some 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.649
 buttons that is on the right side 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.539
 have been moved from the top on 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.820
 which we will find a transmitter sensor 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.980
 infrared to use the web max 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.140
 like a remote control for example 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.749
 can disengage the back of the wan max in 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.609
 pulling on that little look and once the 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.960
 back cover remove one realizes 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.140
 that construction is the minimum 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.079
 monobloc one to the sim card the micro sim 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.220
 on the other hand, the battery is irremovable 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.200
 when put next to the htc one 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.310
 includes both in hand apart from the 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.420
 that of course he is much more 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.830
 great we realize that it is 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 much heavier his weight is in 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.100
 effect one and a half times more important 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.660
 than that of htc on those who did 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.060
 the fable is the heaviest on the market 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.340
 the htc one max is obviously a 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.530
 direct competitor to galaxy note 3 as 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.720
 you can see he's passing one 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.050
 this for a little smartphone almost 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.840
 his screen of 5.9 inches lcd 1920 by 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.350
 1080 pixels in full hd and compared to 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.570
 notes 3 amoled almost feeble it's up to 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.220
 to say that it appears less bright on 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.080
 wonders if hcc did not calibrate 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.150
 the screen so as to save the 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.770
 battery is not crippling it's a 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.020
 very good screen anyway 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.130
 the htc one max is delivered by htc under 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.049
 android 4.3 with the overlay 105.5 the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.640
 improvements concern fine bling 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.560
 especially that we can now 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.789
 completely disable some are 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.929
 happy to find the home screen 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.319
 pure android 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.229
 we can also save offline 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.520
 d content on griffin now a 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.560
 key features obviously of 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.850
 this fable is it's the sensor 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.619
 biometric that is not a sensor 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.360
 fingerprint we will see it there 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.870
 slide from top to bottom 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.280
 finger that will be recognized by the htc on it 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.650
 done three times to record a 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.480
 footprint and in case it does not work 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.680
 we still have the password 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.870
 very interesting feature htc 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.950
 integrates the possibility of assigning the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.870
 quick launch of apps to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.340
 different must for example the index for 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.430
 the camera the major for the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.380
 browser etc on the floor one max 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.239
 the ultra-pixel photographic sensor 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.980
 house so lets capture 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.810
 shots in 5 megapixels 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.670
 video capture on the web mac that's 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.160
 do we on full hd we will find the mode 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.420
 the wall and and we will prove a new 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.220
 mode that allows you to take two pictures 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.480
 at the same time with the two sensors that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.639
 allows to integrate his face would have a 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.380
 photo as the scap for example, 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.000
 do not find on the wan max 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.900
 unlike the one the stabilizer 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.239
 image optics 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.040
 we almost have the wan camera in 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.530
 front and web camera min 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.389
 in rear camera the one max to 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.730
 very very good performance 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.769
 it is very fast in navigation we have it 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.600
 also tried with green racing 3 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.840
 so the racing game that you go 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.030
 see 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.709
 the graphics are excellent it's 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.630
 very well there is no slowdown 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.069
 nothing to say on the subject like you 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.209
 can you see it's hard to play at 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.609
 tomorrow because we compare with the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.049
 galaxy note 3 actually on the paper the 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.700
 samsung must be faster there 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.480
 instinct bragon 800 against 1 snap dragon 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.630
 six years on the web max to use 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.280
 it will change almost nothing you 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.859
 advise against basing your choice on a 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.049
 such criterion to conclude the hcc watts 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.700
 max is a good tablet but he has 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.280
 some negatives his roof we have 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.450
 given its size its immovable battery 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.260
 also the fingerprint detector he 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.360
 is a shame to have to activate the screen 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.159
 to use his processor on the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.049
 paper we saw and no stabilizer 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:52.140
 image optics in the positive points 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.819
 we have the design obviously the 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.560
 quality manufacture materials 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.670
 used in particular aluminum and 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.319
 the htc interface 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 wimax is a very good tablet that 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.360
 without revolutionizing the market deserves that 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.360
 we are interested
