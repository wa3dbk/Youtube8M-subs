00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 hi to all of you on ipex is 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.200
 welcome to a little tutorial red stone 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 this time wait I just go down 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.090
 a little bit the sound of the game so I'm going 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 really blue down but it's a 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.369
 little bit of sensitivity also 140 kind 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.550
 it's good and the music or my 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.109
 table that nice I like the snow 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.300
 so we are not there for that 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.180
 is not there to make the settings 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.730
 so it's a red stone tutorial so we're going 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.829
 see from the 1.5 that 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.480
 dispensaries allow you to put 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.700
 a piece of armor directly on you 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.379
 so in fact look at it I have everything prepared 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 so armor donor well what the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 dispensary therefore in the dispensary 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.100
 yavo I put that but it can be 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 I put in search of mesh I will 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.000
 bring a little closer I put in dimension 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.230
 mesh but it does not change anything 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 can put what you want as armor 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.600
 tainted armor so in fact we're going 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.830
 approach well well well we will support 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.439
 on the button we hear this attack 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.659
 and if we come out here we are meshed 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.040
 while we were not ah yes 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.420
 I should have shown before we can see 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.119
 in the clinic that's it nothing 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.630
 so that's how I made a big 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.960
 room 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.000
 but it's nothing at all it's all 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.060
 con like crazy and that's all that te 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.829
 fart like as a system so we will see 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.030
 that I reproduce it next to you 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.079
 it's gone so we go in part 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.320
 experimental or web ref in fact we're going 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.820
 do it 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.630
 so all we need to manage if he 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.600
 will have to put it in our 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.130
 dispensary in a clinic of the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.890
 rade stone of rip it erp and I'm doing a 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.509
 little my market a ch'ti who pistons who 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.490
 will be frankly helpful 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.399
 we will always take a right torch 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.049
 stone also a button and a block at 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.009
 choice I knew that then so 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.649
 all we will start with 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.259
 it's impulse r impul greenhouse that will do 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.870
 turn circuit that return 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.390
 electrical impulse loop a respite 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.599
 in this sense if a reputed pick up in 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.849
 the other sense joined the two then 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.510
 then to put a sweater tightly he 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.730
 must launch the system takes the torch 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.849
 break the torch and quickly m and that's my 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.200
 pull serves effect after level timing 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.879
 no, but that's what it is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.840
 seemed level size but we can not 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.010
 the case is this so here goes here we have 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.750
 you have used the fact that so it will 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.700
 send an impulse all the time 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:50.310
 then we put a torch a dispensary 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.889
 ah yes and a block of doing to put 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.040
 the system so we 'll wait for here 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:59.129
 he will send the system all the time 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.650
 then face to face with the block that's for sure 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.220
 so much of that it gets me drunk gravelly 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.700
 tried killer we put a piston like 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.620
 this then a blog stick like that one 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.489
 will put a red stone button 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.540
 then here where I put like this or at 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:27.419
 second notch then one who will leave 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:32.639
 there at the last notch and like this so we 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:35.069
 will press on it I galley a little bit 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.970
 like this then we can put a 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.260
 torch here we put the armor in 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.310
 expected late tactician faster 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.160
 so I have no armor music 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.449
 so I do not have any armor I'm going 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.440
 to support me against good against the 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:56.569
 dispensary is normally 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.190
 and that's all I have 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.620
 steph so this is a system that is 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.760
 extremely simple a game the games the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.530
 PAEJ will not say I have developed the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.010
 but it's just that logic stops 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.010
 the red stone 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.680
 So then we can do it for as 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.489
 we want to put on 20 clubs admit 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.909
 was waiting yes I'm going to do that I'm going 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.900
 show you 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:23.669
 kind if I want to put in more a stack 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:27.419
 of arrows a sword an arc for me angry 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.710
 no m this all this in and it's going 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.600
 you said by cons it will have to put 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.360
 a little more this delay yeah that's it so 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:43.590
 then I stick myself I have nothing on my 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:47.250
 jean lifts everything i have nothing it's not supposed 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.840
 send me arrows to the mouth ah 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.940
 yeah well it's true the arrows can be 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.090
 not send them if it will take a drop 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:02.090
 hours but otherwise that's it gives me that 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.910
 and I have my arrows down and I have my sword 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.539
 so that's really simple 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.160
 as a system 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.590
 thank you all for watching this video 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.900
 if it helped you, you can put a 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.340
 green thumb you can comment 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.599
 if there are any things I could 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.260
 improve one month it works very well 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.090
 like that my system 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.020
 after I tried to hide but 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.300
 it's absolutely ugly you can 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.130
 subscribe too i have minecraft tutorials 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.200
 good who have remained a little foolish since 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.120
 I did it with draghi but hey 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.340
 guillaume we all know it's 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.910
 guillaume so then here I go 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.300
 avoid going round in circles in my 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.300
 explanation 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.090
 see you later
