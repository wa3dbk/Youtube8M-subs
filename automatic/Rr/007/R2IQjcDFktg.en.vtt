00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.580
 Contact I'm in nine years 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 bathing suit and the sea on a stone 1 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.670
 I have an alcoholic drink right here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.020
 just some 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.060
 there is no separate drink to learn childhood 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.240
 there we all gave peace to drink 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 My parents are the same to me too. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.670
 I do not remember which one was your first 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.460
 first job my first job is 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:40.420
 posting flyers home and I 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:43.110
 ran for two days until then I 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:49.119
 I'm sick of it can't be that crazy hard 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.460
 I earned 700 rubles and that's all 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.460
 first person to you today 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.990
 Wrote the first person who is underway 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.280
 a polynomial table with people at the feast 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.860
 farm it polina 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 1 person and whom he came up with 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.119
 today i don't know it 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.959
 although I know when I woke up I saw 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.270
 key ring torus 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.190
 probably 1 com I thought it was tor Chris 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.060
 hemsworth he is everywhere 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.700
 1 school teacher also often me in 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.180
 school and basically i don't remember all the names 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.480
 but first she held out her youth 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.319
 a month later it changed another was right 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.069
 to first 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.739
 and i don't remember what name but i remember that 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.390
 her name in some way 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.299
 I associate with washing 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.900
 typewriter I do not know why I do not remember already 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.850
 so I can't say anything about it 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.450
 we will continue to assume that washing 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.519
 machine 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.069
 It was written Kazakh and most likely or 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.920
 it was hard for him or somehow 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.920
 It was consonant with the washing machine where 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.730
 traveled 1 1 1 1 I traveled 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.810
 probably you from u to my grandmother and 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.440
 grandpa and if you mean it 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.640
 another country then this is Russia before that 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.340
 I lived in Kazakhstan and 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.020
 and at 9 years old I came to Russia it was 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.440
 right such a big trip to another 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.440
 country 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.490
 1 best friend do you communicate with her 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:36.290
 now my first girlfriend is 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:39.380
 reality not met in the yard yes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.490
 all my childhood I strolled over her 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:48.560
 I remember how we pulled each other's hair 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:51.650
 provided it was fun and I am with her 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.770
 don't communicate well maybe i'm sorry i would 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.170
 I wanted to start communicating but how not 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.000
 opportunities i don't even remember her last name 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.459
 so I can not find it anywhere social 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.709
 networks first night with friends first 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.320
 overnight I will probably start counting 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.140
 how we are better angel girlfriend we were 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:13.519
 very highly we stayed on the magnet was 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.519
 cool and it was in the sixth seemingly 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.079
 class or symbol well about two years ago 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.709
 the first thing that did today 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.250
 in the morning I got on and checked my 700 to 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.510
 square 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.350
 and then went to breakfast but our interest 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.520
 1 end and this summer I went with a friend 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 on a t-shirt and everything and there came on 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.710
 completely fell and it was my first 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.000
 concert first and last 1 fracture 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:48.970
 body when sat in the garden and I was there a little thief 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.720
 and all the big houses and here it is to me so 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.250
 pore so strangely sags but we donâ€™t 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.660
 they talked like a bit of you wrong 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.690
 fused but I didn't think it was because 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:03.190
 this but maybe the first piercing 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.450
 probably when about Kalush 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.280
 I did n't pierce anything anymore 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.280
 gathering the first country in which it was 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.690

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.310
 which watched the cinema 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:19.650

 liked delivered a storm of emotions 1 sport 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.889
