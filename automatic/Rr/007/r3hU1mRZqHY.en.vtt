was<00:01:31.030> one<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.210> those<00:01:31.329> tracks<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:31.750> on<00:01:32.049> once<00:01:32.740> he

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
was one of those tracks that on once he

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.679 
was one of those tracks that on once he
passed<00:01:33.130> me<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.609> almost<00:01:33.789> had<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.090> hard<00:01:34.299> time<00:01:34.359> not

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
passed me I almost had a hard time not

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.599 
passed me I almost had a hard time not
running<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.020> backbone<00:01:35.409> and<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.159> bet<00:01:36.340> he<00:01:36.429> felt

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
running the backbone and I bet he felt

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.459 
running the backbone and I bet he felt
the<00:01:36.729> same<00:01:36.909> way<00:01:37.060> when<00:01:37.090> he<00:01:37.270> was<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.600> Nam<00:01:37.780> when<00:01:38.109> I

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
the same way when he was in Nam when I

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:39.480 
the same way when he was in Nam when I
was<00:01:38.619> in<00:01:38.710> front<00:01:38.890> which<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.219> one<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:39.399> those
