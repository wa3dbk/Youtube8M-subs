fourth<00:00:39.180> stage<00:00:39.829> now<00:00:40.829> i<00:00:41.510> think<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.410> three

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
fourth stage now i think there are three

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670 
fourth stage now i think there are three
things<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.250> scare<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.239> life<00:00:45.680> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
things that really scare me in life the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.389 
things that really scare me in life the
first<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.670> guess<00:00:48.390> drugs<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:50.100> second

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
first is I guess drugs and the second

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
first is I guess drugs and the second
would<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:50.520> sex<00:00:50.910> trafficking<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.140> third

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
would be sex trafficking and the third

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
would be sex trafficking and the third
would<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> health<00:00:53.460> issues<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.660> never

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
would be health issues if I never

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
would be health issues if I never
watched<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.320> movie<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.800> had<00:00:56.160> any<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.879> these

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
watched a movie that had any of these

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.360 
watched a movie that had any of these
three<00:00:57.390> things<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.840> would<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.770> freaked<00:00:59.250> out

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
three things I would be so freaked out

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.709 
three things I would be so freaked out
and<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.670> don't<00:00:59.850> even<00:01:00.030> care<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
and I don't even care about the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
and I don't even care about the
paranormal<00:01:01.170> kind<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> movies<00:01:02.609> because<00:01:02.850> they

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
paranormal kind of movies because they

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.429

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
don't really scare me but really these

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.770 
don't really scare me but really these
three<00:01:04.769> topics<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.909> ever<00:01:06.119> watched<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.540> movie
