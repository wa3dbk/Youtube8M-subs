00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
at mazza before mazza when he was at

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.560 
at mazza before mazza when he was at
linking<00:04:23.580> him<00:04:23.729> in<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.909> forest<00:04:24.120> when<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.390> was

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
linking him in the forest when I was

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.520 
linking him in the forest when I was
there<00:04:24.720> for<00:04:24.780> a<00:04:24.930> couple<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.110> days<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.470> I've

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530

trained<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.830> him<00:04:25.950> before

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
trained to him before

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.520 
trained to him before

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.290 
and so we know a little bit about each
other<00:04:28.800> so<00:04:29.100> it's<00:04:29.880> gonna<00:04:29.970> be<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.150> good

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300
