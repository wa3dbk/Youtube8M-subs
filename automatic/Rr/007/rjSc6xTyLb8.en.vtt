00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.650
 from a distance i can easily be mistaken for his 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.620
 older 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.840
 And brother infiniti fx on near more compact 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.720
 They are much smaller and the body parts 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.490
 still have their own style 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.470
 recently the price difference between these two 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.600
 models did not exceed some 8 thousand 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.550
 dollars but with the advent of the line x 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.950
 version with 2 half liter engine 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.960
 price difference exceeded 20 thousand 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.540
 dollars between base trim and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.910
 now the initial price for infiniti ex 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.910
 starts from 50 8 thousand US dollars 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.870
 understanding of the Japanese is almost all that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.550
 what 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.620
 in the cabin of our car but without 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.960
 certain gadgets for example system 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.210
 circular view including 4 cameras 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.740
 perimeter lack navigator and without 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.170
 active cruise control however 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.450
 paying $ 4,500 you can 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.260
 get exactly that kind of car with 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.080
 such options 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.300
 Salon itself successfully combines comfort and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.280
 luxury is the impression you 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.619
 you are in your home office 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.210
 which unfortunately is not yet available 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.370
 tactile sensations are fantastic 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.350
 hands everywhere find soft skin and inserts 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.840
 under the tree perfectly fit into this 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.060
 beige interior in infinite like nowhere 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.990
 it creates a feeling of careful work 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.880
 every little thing 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.020
 even hidden somewhere below the button 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.060
 mute her sleep 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.890
 as if specially rolled away from 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.990
 amateur eye in order for this system 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.790
 security is not disabled accidentally or 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.770
 by ignorance of the volume of two and a half 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.290
 liters of small crossover is quite 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.580
 what you need three and a half liters for 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.860
 such a ring machine too 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.360
 hard that's why the Germans must be 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.210
 so actively promoted now 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.950
 turbocharging to increase power but in 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.840
 America as they say their tradition 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.450
 after all, it was for this market that it was created 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.620
 this premium brand 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.390
 v-shaped six is â€‹â€‹great 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.800
 balanced torque 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.870
 transmitted from the engine basically 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.970
 rear wheel drive 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.940
 burdock is activated only at the start 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.600
 and heavy traffic conditions 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600
 Paris 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.680
 not much clearance 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.220
 about 150 millimeters and noticeable overhangs 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.560
 bodywork 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.470
 obviously not for our off-road but by 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.050
 less flat surface hynix 25 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.540
 sees quite surely another thing is even 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.280
 country road turning eggs 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.250
 walks in on a rear wheel drive famously 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.020
 throwing for ios under the gas discharge however 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.950
 if you do not turn off the electronic system 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.290
 stabilization 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.970
 a short skid only warns 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.370
 driver and speed too high 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.130
 turning the safety of the crew completely 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.930
 under the control of electronics 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.160
 infinite I lost them a little 25 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.709
 speakers for about two and a half seconds 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.930
 but it became noticeably more economical lighter 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.920
 power unit had a positive effect on 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.019
 manageability 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.630
 but the most important thing in my opinion is 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.720
 that the crossover from infinity has become more 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.720
 is available
