00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.349
 hi to all his excesses of places 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.179
 mobile.fr and we are at the ifa on the stand 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.950
 of acer who presents us his acer liquid 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.630
 s2 therefore the successor of s1 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.910
 what I propose to you today is 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.890
 to discover quite quickly through 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.760
 a little grip so it's a 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.679
 premium terminal in the range the range 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.410
 of das products and we will pass 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:33.650
 quickly on the specs we have a screen 6 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.310
 inches it's a 1920 full hd tile by 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:41.600
 1080 it gives us 368 p country seduced 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.010
 ps it runs under android 4.2.2 with a 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.250
 interface that has pretty much the same as 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.870
 what we currently have on s1 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.820
 we have 13 megapixels on the back 2 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.720
 megapixels in the front with a camera 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.760
 wide frontal one is at 80 8 degrees 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.430
 it's rather interesting me 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.910
 I like angle front cameras 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.070
 large 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.380
 have a little a little originality 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.270
 also if I can show you that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.009
 it's here so that's what they 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.100
 call the ring flash on flashe 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.689
 with strapping in fact it's all 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.070
 simply a technology that actually 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.929
 is used that comes from the 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.159
 photography apparently then me it's 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.030
 the first time I see that but 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.729
 it's because I'm not necessarily 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.070
 very expert photos not even at all but 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.630
 but here it is here I see on a 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.329
 mobile is the first time we see 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.460
 a flash of this type in fact what is it 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.850
 that this is pretty simple these four 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.649
 flash led that are put like that with a 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.450
 circle system it's more aesthetic 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.890
 but in addition apparently it helps to 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.990
 better to diffuse the light then we will see 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.369
 that during a test but me that it me me 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.049
 seems not bad he is available he will be 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.020
 available end of October 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.179
 549 euros in red this red the rule 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.869
 red metal that is really nice 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.700
 and black also we will continue on the 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.560
 raid the rest of the specifications one has a 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.480
 quad core processor 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.120
 it's a Swiss duel in qualcomm 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.890
 of gigahertz we have two gigas of ram 16 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.240
 I won - internally with the possibility 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.150
 to put a microsd to extend 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.690
 up to 64 more we have a battery 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:17.590
 large enough 330 points to 1305 forgiveness 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.660
 is born in loses we will have 8.99 mm 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.930
 thick which is not huge it and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.870
 4g category 4 frequencies bands of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.950
 frequencies 800 mhz 1800 and 2600 so 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.280
 wide enough or nothing, that's fine 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.930
 looked at my daughter ah yes important it 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.330
 films in 1080p but above all it is 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.820
 able to film in 4k is the first 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.800
 is announced to do but at forty 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.920
 eight hours after there was sony there was 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.310
 the notes 293 if I'm wrong so has to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.570
 well here we have a lot of terminals that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.260
 allow to look at but it does 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.210
 part of those there 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.010
 one last elements he turns with a 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.560
 nano sim it's important to the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.450
 mention I think for all 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.430
 people who are on micro sim 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.070
 today that they are going to have to 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.770
 probably changed but hey that's 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.340
 it is normal then in frontal one to the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.050
 camera 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.900
 here some sensors the audio output in 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.459
 down we have some sensitive keys 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.750
 so sorry with the reflections 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.250
 back home and multitasking and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.450
 not only does it provide access with 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.989
 something called fleets 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.350
 as fleet floating ap complications 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.570
 rather nice 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.670
 well we have two microphones and in fact 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.010
 from what I understand 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.780
 there are two pickups behind each pickup 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.650
 so in fact there are four pickups here that 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.959
 allow to undo cancel the the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.010
 ambient noise to improve overall 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.650
 the sound quality we are going to have 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:56.050
 here we have the nano simon to access the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.850
 microsd and we have the volume knob or 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.280
 by their double speakers on the 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.890
 sides I see if I can show myself 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:08.290
 it sounds a little complicated sorry and 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.970
 here we have the jack 3.5 l button on / off 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.970
 lock unlock something that 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.570
 I like of course this screen 6 inches is 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.280
 that it is curved on the sides of the shot 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.989
 it's like on the terminals him 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.100
 mine if you want our cases go 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.840
 your finger and it's completely 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.480
 it's completely smooth so we're going 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.770
 quickly move to the interface but I 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.210
 I will not dwell too much 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.390
 it's actually exactly the same 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.240
 interface that we have on the s1 with blow 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.210
 excuse me I 'm not very good 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.540
 installed with a terminal that turns 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.540
 under android 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:47.950
 maybe points two points 2 that's it and 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.900
 so 4.2.2 cetc so I know more if the 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.010
 s1 and in 4.2 point named in all 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.960
 case here you have something 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.800
 very very very close on it there is 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.690
 a little thing that I wanted you 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.910
 show if that's what they call them 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.050
 streams taps so there for example throw 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.730
 the camera you have a small 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.580
 window that opens with the device 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.880
 photo you can minimize a doctor 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.740
 corner and hop revived right after that kind 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.740
 little tips to stay pressed 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.360
 the multitasking button that packs you 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.720
 have the map 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.390
 apparently 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.910
 so it's not google maps it's the web 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.380
 and you have other elements here by 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.630
 example I can quickly launch from 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.760
 calendar it's also actually it's a 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.950
 shortcut to some applications and 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.560
 it is also the possibility of having these 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.300
 small floating applications the level 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.390
 of the interface we have something that has 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.680
 been customized by acer but which remains 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.580
 pretty classic android 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.170
 so here we have the numbering pad 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.310
 contacts will be able to keep quickly the 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.590
 keyboard what does it look like 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.840
 all that is very very classic then 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.770
 this is swype I do not know if the meadow 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.910
 presented by default as his share - yes 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.870
 sorry yes anyway else you have 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.750
 this basic android keyboard that my faith 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.190
 very honorable that's chrome in the 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.830
 main menu 1 presented so 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.300
 very classic android download and 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.790
 widgets so that's the different 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.440
 filters everything he does not want to go in a 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.640
 other is not serious to go in the 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.860
 budget so here you have all seen 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.560
 widgets the downloaded apps and 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.610
 the applications installed on the 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.530
 terminal with side scroll 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.820
 that's pretty much all that I 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.220
 can say for now I like 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.500
 the screen I like the rendering of the screen 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.990
 then you will not see we are pretty good 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.920
 it is approved l pleasant to use if 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.870
 gorilla ice 3 this is 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.160
 a rather high solution is a screen 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.450
 large size 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.010
 so yes it is a device that makes 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.420
 part of these big terminals 1 that's 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.820
 by the way we can qualify as fable 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.060
 so it's not necessarily easy to 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.830
 take it in hand but but I find 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.180
 that yeah that's kind of nice 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.500
 there is something else to know 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.750
 also at the design level to finish 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.400
 it's actually in level 10 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.250
 does everything else the element it does a 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.150
 piece the back shell is not bad 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.410
 on the other hand it looks like but no and it's up to 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.000
 just about everything - it's a terminal that I 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.250
 find that I find sympathetic 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.490
 it will be proposed end of October that reminds 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.490
 to 549 euros in France see you soon
