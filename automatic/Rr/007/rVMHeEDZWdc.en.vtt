00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
certain extent can be quite bland and

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.490 
certain extent can be quite bland and
they<00:05:08.820> need<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.720> colors<00:05:10.080> they<00:05:10.230> need<00:05:10.380> the

they need the colors they need the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
they need the colors they need the
contrast<00:05:10.920> raising<00:05:11.760> often<00:05:12.590> and<00:05:13.590> so<00:05:13.950> I<00:05:14.250> think<00:05:14.430> it

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
contrast raising often and so I think it

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
contrast raising often and so I think it
would<00:05:14.640> be<00:05:14.730> important<00:05:15.180> to<00:05:15.210> have<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.390> have<00:05:15.510> a
