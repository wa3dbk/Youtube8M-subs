00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
about backing up my computer so I try to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.270

remind myself to do that
and<00:01:44.869> I'm<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:46.170> tried<00:01:46.530> something<00:01:46.890> new<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.159> week

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
and I'm I tried something new this week

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.180 
and I'm I tried something new this week
where<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.119> pre<00:01:48.570> wrote<00:01:48.930> down<00:01:49.530> my<00:01:49.890> bills

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
where I kind of pre wrote down my bills

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.120 
where I kind of pre wrote down my bills
I<00:01:50.610> thought<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.510> just<00:01:51.630> be<00:01:51.869> easier<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:53.040> me

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I thought it would just be easier for me

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
I thought it would just be easier for me
to<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.369> off<00:01:53.640> camera<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:54.690> just<00:01:54.930> put

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to do that off camera and then just put

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
to do that off camera and then just put
them<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.799> would<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.940> bit

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
them in would make it go a little bit

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.380 
them in would make it go a little bit
quicker<00:01:57.330> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.159> stickers<00:01:59.640> are<00:02:00.119> some

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
quicker and then these stickers are some

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.290 
quicker and then these stickers are some
order<00:02:00.690> trackers<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.619> I'm<00:02:01.950> using<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.670> keep

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300
