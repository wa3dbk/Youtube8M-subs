 employ 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.300
 a bootleg is an illegal cut 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.210
 from rock concerts to concerts 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.579
 general and this illegal 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
 Recordings are often on cds 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.680
 pressed or often used to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.899
 come 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.850
 The covers look very professional 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.920
 Made out of it so you bootleg from the outside 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.870
 usually can not distinguish 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.390
 from an original 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.520
 but you can s.der sound quality 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.449
 often already realize that it is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.040
 here no no real cut of the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 copyright owner unless the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.229
 sound engineer has made the bootleg 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.340
 what ever can be so and who 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.220
 so acquired a bootleg yes yes 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 may not have that at first 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.130
 big problem because he just something 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 bought and there is no 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.000
 copyright infringement 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.909
 it becomes more difficult if you have this 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.930
 vinyl records or cds resold 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.040
 from ebay 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.170
 then put that one 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.979
 copyright infringement since the present 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.420
 is cautioned by saas &amp; partner and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.780

 The courts set at 12,500 euros 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.399
 Threshold value per cd is set here 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.840
 so if you have your record collection 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.840
 sells among others such 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.810
 Bootlegs at the fast are very expensive 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.079
 What can it be? 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.979

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.510
 I'll see if I can do this here 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.190
 can read aloud 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.810
 be warned by whom as bootlegs 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.110
 here are warn the companies 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.860

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.840
 Of course these are the original ones 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.030
 Rightsholders are now against it 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.970
 fight back their concerts in this way 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.840
 and wisely become more widespread 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.459
 insofar as if you bought in 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.739
 Old vinyl records the area at the market 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.140
 or old cd is any 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.690
 you may feel a bit strange 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.510
 The opinion that this is here 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.430
 could not act around original then 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.310
 Please do not continue to sell because 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.680
 That's where the market is currently very much 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.660
 watched closely and it is quite 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.300
 simply because you just take this 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.700
 plate names of which I just 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.350
 read or below here 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.390
 videos you see a text to the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.489
 theme there we have all plates again 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.300
 Names written down us at the moment 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.769
 are known and if your plate so 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.680
 means then you can assume that 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.360
 this is an illegal one 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.420
 concert recording acts and may 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.489
 then not sold further 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.290
 if it comes to us we'll see what 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.850
 we can do it legally for you often 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.250
 the disputes are too high you can 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.690
 also try something to trade down and 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.940
 you have to see if there is not much space 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.770
 acted private person 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.840
 that is always a question of 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.030
 but only if the child 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.550
 fallen in the well is best 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.010
 not even with such illegal 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.170
 sell cities and is best of all 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.090
 if we subscribe to this channel then 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.090
 Are you also warned again soon 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.560
 if there are such warning waves you 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.250
 thank you for watching bye and gladly 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.250
