00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 welcome and today we are here to 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.290
 install the raid kraft and good down os 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.559
 I will leave the links of 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.969
 how to install the why and good this 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.250
 it's like you always have to take the 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.700
 dead and put it in here if it's very easy 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.720
 agree and go back to your version of 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.029
 magic launcher for example put some 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.689
 account but 6 premium in this way 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.410
 jump is the protection and here decide 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.410
 which one do you want 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.710
 I'm going to remove the build craft, I do not know if 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.440
 I'm going to need it but I'm going to put it 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.570
 the ride grand pas and see them craft eos very 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.790
 easily good see you inside good 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.130
 we are already here within the plugin and 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.840
 well this contains a lot of ways 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.630
 a beastly amount because it's not going 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.260
 to remove this crap to put 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.079
 this way and another 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.629
 as you can see I kind here the top 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.360
 top and I'll show you what for me is 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.120
 the best 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.420
 Let's go there 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.400
 It's a bit far because he sent me 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.280
 to work but it must have been 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 lifeless without pathways 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.180
 Lets put 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.780
 it is the foolishness of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.440
 the bad habit of the north 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.710
 Do not do that 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.710
 i 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.440
 it's worth a little 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.460
 that this power 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 if I would put this on itself a bit 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.920
 but this does not seem like it can be put 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.920
 Imagine 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.070
 and this would be something like that then 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 you have been doing so more or 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.090
 less and goes 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.610
 doing a little bit, you just have to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.950
 put 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.140
 the type d 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 of thread that we want to expose the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.450
 amount is catching a little 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.890
 I'm loading a then taken and the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.810
 He's doing the rest of the work 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.920
 accepted a l 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.920
 let's make tunnel 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.459
 you have many ways today you know this 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.680
 we merged with the kraft build and you do 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.810
 some great configurations you have 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 detectors 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.730
 what in doing everything 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.930
 this is cool because you put your cart 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.930
 this one here 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.550
 for example be 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.580
 from bilbao 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.600
 and doing is letting go a little 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.180
 materials like crazy 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.370
 I still had an alchemy chest 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.370
 of the graf will make you somehow 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.690
 especially in 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.090
 once 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.240
 I do not know if by the drill but I think that 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.340
 I have put the strongest 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.280
 We have iron and steam diamond 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.720
 I do not know what the diamond will normally be 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.720
 it is the strongest 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:34.310
 better and collides 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.310
 I want to try this 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.310
 and they are going our time 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.519
 Today the tunnel is doing well though 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.440
 I like another plugin another mod better 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.060
 for that but well this has been all already 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.250
