00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:11.870
 we are globally in a phase one 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.870
 uncontrolled monetary development 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:24.619
 we suggest you to be a covert 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.619
 Legal investment available gold 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.690
 rare earths are common in nature 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.690
 but are relatively rarely needed 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.269
 we are globally in a phase one 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.980
 uncontrolled monetary development 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:59.269
 that will be over sooner or later 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.399
 lead to inflation and repression 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.080
 if you can not help it anymore 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.740
 can at the end then one 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.149
 collapse occur the temporal 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.299
 Succession can not be quite accurate 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.000
 establish 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.310
 but I believe that this phase is up to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.770
 a currency reform maybe in five 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.770
 should run until seven years 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.770
 Buy 99 of the physical gold investors 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.750
 store the gold in your own name 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.070
 pass in the cellar or in a banksafe 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.160
 or they buy etf where there is one too 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.940
 physical storage at a bank there 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:53.180
 All these gold investors can be very easy 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.020
 be captured by the state and must 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.850
 after that pretty hard steer and 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.780
 to suffer further repressive measures 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.110
 That's why it's not the right solution 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:16.640
 for gold plants we suggest that 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:20.380
 a covert legal investment 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.300
 in gold it is about one 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.200
 insurance contract or one 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.700
 For example, funds in Liechtenstein 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.160
 Liechtenstein is domiciled 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.209
 State without debt as you can safely 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:38.060
 be that of intact control 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.910
 stay and the investor can say then 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.590
 yes i do not have any physical gold i have 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.680
 before shares 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.840
 although the contents years he has 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.840
 Of course a physical gold plant 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.600
 yes only one word to the strategic 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.870
 metals first you have to delineate them 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.380
 the rare earths inherit the rare earths 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.900
 are common in nature though 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.000
 relatively rarely needed that's the way it is 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.850
 called lantal group 17 metals but 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.600
 After the Chinese have a monopoly 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.640
 have created through cheap prices 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.220
 Now other providers come back in 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.080
 two three years will be the prices 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.980
 rose again in the short term 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.700
 return 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.080
 In contrast, the strategic 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.660
 to put metals 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.910
 these are becoming more and more in the industry 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.300
 but are needed in nature very much 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.200
 seldom the most outstanding one fills or 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.650
 strategic metals is rhenium that 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.150
 is the metal with the second 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.350
 melting point of all metals 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.110
 it is needed for workpieces which 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.420
 high temperatures have to withstand 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.630
 example aircraft engines or at the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.790
 gas liquefaction there are workpieces which 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:11.090
 have to endure very high temperatures 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.170
 we went to have one then 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.110
 founded 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.690
 the practically exclusively in 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:23.200
 invested in physical rhenium and that 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.930
 We buy very carefully that is 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.480
 a market of no great is the one 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.080
 niche market but extraordinary 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.820
 the potential has the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:39.670
 Engine manufacturers have in the last 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:43.690
 year so in 2012 64 tons of rhenium 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.130
 used from mines promotion 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.800
 you can win only 45 tons 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:54.070
 The difference was with recycling 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.590
 that we covered the recycling 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.700
 documents are but soon 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.670
 used up 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:05.770
 and then there is a blatant 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.530
 Lack of the too enormous 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.540
 price increases will lead to such a 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.540
 rhenium plant can be worthwhile
