first I take a section and I actually
take<00:00:46.510> small<00:00:46.900> sections<00:00:47.170> just<00:00:47.980> because<00:00:48.280> it's

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
take small sections just because it's

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.930 
take small sections just because it's
easier<00:00:48.820> for<00:00:48.850> me<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.239> put<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.690> straight<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.760> I'll

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
easier for me to put it straight so I'll

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.090 
easier for me to put it straight so I'll
run<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.269> through<00:00:52.510> with<00:00:52.780> this<00:00:52.930> brush<00:00:53.199> first<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
run it through with this brush first and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.140 
run it through with this brush first and
then<00:00:57.549> I'll<00:00:57.850> take<00:00:58.089> this<00:00:58.269> comb

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.650

fell<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:08.890> happens<00:01:09.310> sometimes<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.530> I'll

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
