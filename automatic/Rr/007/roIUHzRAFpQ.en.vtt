anything related to how to lift weights

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.420 
anything related to how to lift weights
properly<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:19.060> just<00:00:19.420> a<00:00:19.539> few<00:00:20.140> real<00:00:20.619> foundational

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.430 
properly so just a few real foundational

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.300 
properly so just a few real foundational
things<00:00:22.300> to<00:00:22.420> just<00:00:22.570> think<00:00:22.810> about<00:00:23.039> obviously<00:00:24.039> I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
things to just think about obviously I

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.609 
things to just think about obviously I
can't<00:00:24.490> cover<00:00:24.670> every<00:00:25.000> lift<00:00:25.269> but<00:00:26.080> just<00:00:26.500> in

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
can't cover every lift but just in

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.870 
can't cover every lift but just in
general<00:00:26.710> that's<00:00:27.189> gonna<00:00:27.340> help<00:00:27.519> you<00:00:27.699> with<00:00:27.849> your

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
general that's gonna help you with your

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.240 
general that's gonna help you with your
whole<00:00:28.119> lifting<00:00:28.449> experience<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:30.070> would

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
whole lifting experience one would

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.920 
whole lifting experience one would
always<00:00:30.460> be<00:00:30.730> posture<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.590> there's<00:00:32.770> a<00:00:32.860> certain

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
always be posture so there's a certain

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.389 
always be posture so there's a certain
posture<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.170> should<00:00:35.350> be<00:00:35.530> in<00:00:35.680> when<00:00:35.950> lifting

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
posture you should be in when lifting

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.819 
posture you should be in when lifting
most<00:00:36.670> weights<00:00:37.000> whether<00:00:37.840> it's<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.140> deadlift<00:00:38.530> a

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
most weights whether it's a deadlift a

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.569 
most weights whether it's a deadlift a
squat<00:00:39.360> etc<00:00:40.360> and<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.680> way<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.950> posture<00:00:42.280> looks

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
squat etc and the way the posture looks

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.930 
squat etc and the way the posture looks
is<00:00:42.760> this<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:44.350> have<00:00:44.530> our<00:00:44.710> natural<00:00:45.190> s-curve<00:00:45.730> in

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
is this we have our natural s-curve in

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.779 
is this we have our natural s-curve in
our<00:00:46.030> spine<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:47.020> you<00:00:47.079> have<00:00:47.640> some<00:00:48.640> of<00:00:48.670> that

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
our spine so you have some of that

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:51.479 
our spine so you have some of that
lordosis<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:49.780> your<00:00:49.870> lumbar<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.399> that

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
lordosis and your lumbar some of that

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.610 
lordosis and your lumbar some of that
kyphosis<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.359> your<00:00:52.449> thoracic<00:00:52.780> spine<00:00:53.050> and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
kyphosis and your thoracic spine and

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.310 
kyphosis and your thoracic spine and
then<00:00:54.010> again<00:00:54.309> a<00:00:54.600> lordotic<00:00:55.600> curve<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:56.230> your

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
then again a lordotic curve and your

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.310 
then again a lordotic curve and your
cervical<00:00:56.770> spine<00:00:57.359> so<00:00:58.359> we<00:00:58.480> constantly<00:00:58.960> want<00:00:59.260> to

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
cervical spine so we constantly want to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.689 
cervical spine so we constantly want to
keep<00:00:59.559> your<00:00:59.769> spine<00:01:00.129> in<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.930> neutral<00:01:02.410> position

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
keep your spine in that neutral position

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.520 
keep your spine in that neutral position
when<00:01:03.699> lifting<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.760> kind<00:01:07.000> of<00:01:07.410> q.q<00:01:08.410> my

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
when lifting so I just kind of q.q my

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.110 
when lifting so I just kind of q.q my
clients<00:01:08.980> to<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.220> those<00:01:09.490> three<00:01:09.760> points<00:01:09.910> of

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
clients to have those three points of

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.720 
clients to have those three points of
contact<00:01:10.180> if<00:01:10.720> we<00:01:10.810> have<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:10.990> dowel<00:01:11.260> here<00:01:11.650> on<00:01:11.830> your

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:12.730 
contact if we have a dowel here on your

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.210 
contact if we have a dowel here on your
pelvis<00:01:13.260> shoulder<00:01:14.260> blades<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.800> head<00:01:15.010> and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
pelvis shoulder blades and head and

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.180 
pelvis shoulder blades and head and
that'll<00:01:16.030> kind<00:01:16.270> of<00:01:16.360> show<00:01:16.690> them<00:01:17.380> visually<00:01:17.980> we're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
that'll kind of show them visually we're

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.660 
that'll kind of show them visually we're
visual<00:01:18.580> or<00:01:19.210> visual<00:01:20.080> people<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.620> seeing<00:01:21.460> if

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
visual or visual people of seeing if

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.030 
visual or visual people of seeing if
you're<00:01:21.820> in<00:01:21.940> neutral<00:01:22.270> spine<00:01:22.450> or<00:01:22.630> not<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.950> that's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
you're in neutral spine or not so that's

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.660 
you're in neutral spine or not so that's
one<00:01:24.510> two<00:01:25.510> is<00:01:25.870> our<00:01:26.650> intra-abdominal<00:01:27.070> pressure

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
one two is our intra-abdominal pressure

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.200 
one two is our intra-abdominal pressure
or<00:01:28.290> core<00:01:29.290> activation<00:01:29.920> during<00:01:30.070> lifting<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:31.180> I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
or core activation during lifting so I

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.750 
or core activation during lifting so I
just<00:01:31.540> typically<00:01:31.930> will<00:01:32.050> cue<00:01:32.350> people<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:33.490> pull

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
just typically will cue people to pull

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.160 
just typically will cue people to pull
your<00:01:33.910> belly<00:01:34.120> button<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.450> or<00:01:34.630> try<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.870> touch

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
your belly button in or try and touch

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.100 
your belly button in or try and touch
your<00:01:35.350> spine<00:01:35.590> with<00:01:36.100> your<00:01:36.250> belly<00:01:36.460> button<00:01:36.820> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
your spine with your belly button and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.460 
your spine with your belly button and
that<00:01:38.110> inherently<00:01:39.010> is<00:01:39.250> gonna<00:01:40.110> cause<00:01:41.110> your

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
that inherently is gonna cause your

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.830 
that inherently is gonna cause your
transverse<00:01:42.010> abdominus<00:01:42.640> or<00:01:42.910> your<00:01:43.270> TVA<00:01:43.690> to

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
transverse abdominus or your TVA to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.050 
transverse abdominus or your TVA to
activate<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:45.100> that's<00:01:45.370> gonna<00:01:45.520> cause<00:01:45.820> some

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
activate and that's gonna cause some

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.840 
activate and that's gonna cause some
really<00:01:46.300> good<00:01:46.770> core<00:01:47.770> stability<00:01:48.100> which<00:01:48.730> is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
really good core stability which is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.460 
really good core stability which is
gonna<00:01:48.970> function<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.750> stabilize<00:01:50.230> your<00:01:50.410> spine

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
gonna function to stabilize your spine

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.070 
gonna function to stabilize your spine
during<00:01:51.160> a<00:01:51.340> lift<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:51.700> well<00:01:51.730> anytime<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.870> have

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
during a lift as well anytime you have

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.130 
during a lift as well anytime you have
spinal<00:01:53.620> loading<00:01:54.010> with<00:01:54.190> like<00:01:54.460> with<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.240> squat<00:01:55.780> or

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
spinal loading with like with a squat or

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.070 
spinal loading with like with a squat or
you<00:01:56.980> know<00:01:57.100> an<00:01:57.190> overhead<00:01:57.700> press<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.600> want<00:01:58.990> to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
you know an overhead press we want to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.440 
you know an overhead press we want to
have<00:01:59.230> that<00:01:59.530> core<00:01:59.830> stability<00:02:00.010> here<00:02:00.640> in<00:02:00.790> our

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
have that core stability here in our

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.320 
have that core stability here in our
spine<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:03.070> those<00:02:03.220> two<00:02:03.400> things<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.940> I'd<00:02:04.000> say

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
spine so those two things and I'd say

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.650 
spine so those two things and I'd say
the<00:02:04.540> last<00:02:04.780> one<00:02:05.170> would<00:02:05.770> just<00:02:05.980> be<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.130> spotter

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
the last one would just be a spotter

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.060 
the last one would just be a spotter
it's<00:02:07.660> always<00:02:07.870> good<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.080> lift<00:02:08.440> with<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.649> partner

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
it's always good to lift with a partner

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.400 
it's always good to lift with a partner
one<00:02:09.910> for<00:02:10.119> motivation<00:02:10.720> they're<00:02:11.080> gonna<00:02:11.200> push

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
one for motivation they're gonna push

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.670 
one for motivation they're gonna push
you<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.650> lift<00:02:11.830> harder

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
you to lift harder

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.819 
you to lift harder
to<00:02:13.219> go<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.760> extra<00:02:14.030> rep<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.930> maybe<00:02:15.109> try<00:02:15.439> and<00:02:15.709> do

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
to go the extra rep to maybe try and do

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.619 
to go the extra rep to maybe try and do
the<00:02:15.980> extra<00:02:16.340> weight<00:02:16.549> and<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:17.359> can<00:02:17.390> feel

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
the extra weight and you can feel

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.880 
the extra weight and you can feel
comfortable<00:02:17.780> doing<00:02:18.200> that<00:02:18.319> because<00:02:18.620> your

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
comfortable doing that because your

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.770 
comfortable doing that because your
partner<00:02:19.159> is<00:02:19.310> there<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:20.060> help<00:02:20.239> spot<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:20.750> or

partner is there to help spot you or

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.929 
partner is there to help spot you or
encourage<00:02:21.439> you<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.579> you<00:02:22.730> can

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
encourage you so that you can

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.770 
encourage you so that you can
successfully<00:02:23.769> do<00:02:24.769> that<00:02:24.950> extra<00:02:25.250> rep<00:02:25.430> or

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
successfully do that extra rep or

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.940 
successfully do that extra rep or
successfully<00:02:26.780> go<00:02:26.959> after<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.469> extra<00:02:27.769> weight

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
successfully go after that extra weight

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.339 
successfully go after that extra weight
so<00:02:28.879> I'd<00:02:29.090> say<00:02:29.299> those<00:02:29.450> are<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:29.689> three<00:02:29.989> pretty

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
so I'd say those are the three pretty

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.809 
so I'd say those are the three pretty
core<00:02:30.650> things<00:02:30.950> that<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.310> want<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.549> think<00:02:31.670> about

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
core things that you want to think about

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.629 
core things that you want to think about
in<00:02:32.239> terms<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.139> doing<00:02:33.769> resistance<00:02:34.280> training<00:02:34.430> or

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
in terms of doing resistance training or

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:36.879 
in terms of doing resistance training or
weight<00:02:34.819> lifting<00:02:35.209> and<00:02:35.359> doing<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.599> safely<00:02:35.889> so

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:36.889 
weight lifting and doing it safely so

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.129 
weight lifting and doing it safely so
again<00:02:37.129> those<00:02:37.250> three<00:02:37.489> things<00:02:37.730> are<00:02:38.139> posture

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
again those three things are posture

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.649 
again those three things are posture
which<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.069> neutral<00:02:40.310> spine<00:02:40.790> we<00:02:41.299> talked<00:02:41.540> about

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
which is neutral spine we talked about

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.729 
which is neutral spine we talked about
that<00:02:41.989> your<00:02:42.950> natural<00:02:43.400> s-curve<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:45.260> would<00:02:45.560> be

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
that your natural s-curve to would be

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.039 
that your natural s-curve to would be
your<00:02:46.189> intra-abdominal<00:02:46.669> pressure<00:02:47.209> or<00:02:47.659> core

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
your intra-abdominal pressure or core

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.470 
your intra-abdominal pressure or core
stabilization<00:02:48.730> touch<00:02:49.730> your<00:02:49.909> spine<00:02:50.150> with<00:02:50.329> your
