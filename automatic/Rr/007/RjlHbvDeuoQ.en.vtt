00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.339
 4WD extreme test of car engine and sport 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.769
 on a locked handling course are over 2000 meters altitude must be ten 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.519
 4WD cars prove 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.829
 first candidate 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.299
 the Opel Insignia in its sharpest version with 325 hp 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.960
 his four-wheel system is technically complex 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.020
 In principle, he drives as a front-wheel drive but one 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.030
 Electrohydraulic controlled multi-plate clutch directs the power Mr 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.330
 Kauder wave also continues to the rear 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.250
 in case of cases also the force from right to left or vice versa 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.470
 be distributed 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.940
 Tripolis Heroin 50 Meat It is very helpful on the Bangert 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.909
 strong to the outside 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.959
 So the next is the Opel AG will be future too 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 next candidate of the BMW x6 in the final version 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.640
 despite its size the Bayer does not let itself of its weight 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.320
 impress and stomp cheerfully his advantage a foul was you have that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.630
 rear axle 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.140
 No 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.810
 in a certain car, the left 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 the right wheel 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530
 exactly the same password 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.660
 I can currently be more force on the differential Petersen today 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.570
 balanced 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.670
 but now you have no way to transmit the electronic world 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.920
 That's exactly what makes the 6 you can get the power 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 have deliberately used one or the other council to give more strength and thus 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.970
 support a penetration of the car 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.130
 m how powerful 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.469
 555 hp and almost 2 you can 4 tons curb weight are the data of the BMW 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:51.820
 x6 m 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 this is the strongest car in this comparison 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.450
 The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution offers legal rally technology in mass production 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.390
 trumped legally on which underground 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.390
 so far the Snow King of Hochburgen 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:15.599
 his 295 hp are not rudimentary to the x6 but he is the only one with 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.999
 Thousand liters of gentian on the front axle there, the power is further distributed 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.919
 which in turn can play there with the e-book 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.819
 were offered 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.799
 the program of the left must count 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.629
 and yet he can not deny him and his own past 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:46.539
 Time for a saloon of audience 4 as extra on board a sports differential 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:51.639
 This controls the distribution of forces on the rear axle via the electronical scarf 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.589
 multi-plate clutch 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.589
 the data sheet shows 333 hp 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.100
 but Ingolstadt is clearly more important for the quality of the snow 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.899
 and star de 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:07.329
 even when accelerating is this is one of the fastest 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.929
 now it's about performing curves 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:14.009
 how can the grandson of the ur-quattro blow on the slippery course 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.919
 amortize the costs 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.729
 nevertheless was 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.729
 For example, 70,000 users 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.519
 manufactured 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.639
 The Nissan gt-r is about honor 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.459
 he could not score points while accelerating and he had to deal with the handling 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 squeeze lost ground at the club 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:43.079
 the gt-r with variable power distribution brings the 485 hp to the four wheels 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.810
 he can, like his rivals from Audi and BMW in the all - around competition, take part in a council of 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:51.809
 Rear axle continues 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.839
 is also well paid or not push 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.009
 was there again she is power is not everything 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.130
 231 to 555 hp 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.779
 she has to come to me the SUVs and sports cars 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:12.589
 everyone was there and there is a clear winner on the handling course 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:17.029
 The Audi s4 will win with almost two seconds ahead of them soon 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.870
 he goes high with two hundredths just beaten and in third place of the 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.259
 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.259
 HÃ¼ttlingen 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:32.110
 while many readings have many different opinions 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:38.219
 but in the end there can be only one winner the overall result of the 'auto engine 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.219
 and sport 'Hester is set 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.150
 coming from excellence males should have had the fastest time 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.939
 also a car 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:51.649
 that may be that they did not know before, they must apply and still only demanded 

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:54.539
 the storm nice combinations 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.890
 Tradition and a lot of technology all ten Allradler have made it 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.280
 because of snow test in the border area
