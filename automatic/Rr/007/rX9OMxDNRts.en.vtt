00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the basics of that and then it's more

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.510 
the basics of that and then it's more
about<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> shape<00:00:46.739> c<00:00:46.920> makes<00:00:47.129> which<00:00:47.370> are

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
about the shape c makes which are

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.910 
about the shape c makes which are
usually<00:00:48.300> pretty<00:00:48.510> similar<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.110> relatively

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
usually pretty similar and relatively

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.970 
usually pretty similar and relatively

going<00:06:33.069> into<00:06:33.610> the<00:06:33.909> blue<00:06:38.279> that's<00:06:39.279> kind<00:06:39.550> of<00:06:39.580> it

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
going into the blue that's kind of it

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.209 
going into the blue that's kind of it
obviously<00:06:40.090> play<00:06:40.779> it<00:06:40.870> much<00:06:41.020> cleaner<00:06:41.439> and<00:06:41.590> not

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:42.219 
obviously play it much cleaner and not

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:43.950 
obviously play it much cleaner and not
as<00:06:42.340> fast<00:06:42.550> but<00:06:42.819> that's<00:06:43.210> the<00:06:43.419> basics<00:06:43.810> of<00:06:43.900> the

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
as fast but that's the basics of the

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.830 
as fast but that's the basics of the
song<00:06:44.229> I<00:06:44.499> guess<00:06:44.979> Ivan<00:06:45.580> listen<00:06:45.849> to<00:06:45.999> be<00:06:46.360> p1<00:06:46.569> in<00:06:46.779> a

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
song I guess Ivan listen to be p1 in a

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.360 
song I guess Ivan listen to be p1 in a
while<00:06:46.960> but<00:06:47.110> I<00:06:47.169> think<00:06:47.229> it's<00:06:47.560> strumming<00:06:48.009> just

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
while but I think it's strumming just

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.950 
while but I think it's strumming just
the<00:06:48.460> same<00:06:48.639> chords<00:06:48.969> though<00:06:49.120> I<00:06:49.389> haven't<00:06:49.779> tried

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 
the same chords though I haven't tried

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.860 
the same chords though I haven't tried
