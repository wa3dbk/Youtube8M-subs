best<00:00:07.350> hamburger<00:00:08.130> in<00:00:08.160> New<00:00:08.370> York<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.849> of

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
best hamburger in New York which is of

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.450 
best hamburger in New York which is of
course<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.840> hyperbolic<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.769> probably

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
course a hyperbolic and probably

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.490 
course a hyperbolic and probably
ridiculous<00:00:12.120> statement<00:00:12.509> because<00:00:12.809> frankly

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
ridiculous statement because frankly

nobody<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.070> eating<00:00:14.219> every<00:00:14.519> hamburger<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.000> New

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
York but I think it raises an important

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.400 
York but I think it raises an important
point<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:19.050> does<00:00:19.199> New<00:00:19.380> York

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
