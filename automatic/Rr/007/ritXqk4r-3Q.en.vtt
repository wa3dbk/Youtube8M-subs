Ariana has an issue with her diction and
it's<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.290> think<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it's I think it is the it is the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.399 
it's I think it is the it is the
difference<00:01:41.009> between<00:01:41.100> being<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:43.020> singer

and<00:01:43.439> being<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.950> great<00:01:44.280> singer<00:01:44.579> her<00:01:45.180> diction

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and being a great singer her diction

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.590 
and being a great singer her diction
needs<00:01:45.960> plenty<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.070> work<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> if<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> are<00:01:48.570> a
