00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.120
 I need to pay you in some way that 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.649
 please what did you do to me 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.750

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.329
 many trips in your futures of you 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 21 husband, you three, I do not want you 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.929
 drive me crazy with that of traveling with 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.379
 kids so I'm going to give you in this 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:03.920
 video 5 tips to travel with me 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.920
 with years 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 the number one is called motivating them to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.230
 keep a travel journal 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 although the photos and videos a very good 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.950
 way to capture forever the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 best moments of a trip another beautiful 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.250
 option is for your child to get used to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.260
 keep a travel journal and if not yet 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 he knows how to write he can do it with drawings 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.680
 of the things that he lives during his 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 adventure in the destination they visit and so 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 when the years go by and the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.900
 memories of your family vacation 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 they can do it from the perspective of 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.310
 your son's childhood full of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.410
 imagination and in the second half I should 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.060
 confess that you will probably be scared 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.460
 little bit at the beginning but I'm going to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.320
 explain is called use the transport 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.090
 public 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.950
 I know they sometimes wins us the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.020
 temptation to rent a car or ask for a 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 taxi for the convenience of this but the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 advantage of using public transport in 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.600
 a trip with your children is that they 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 they achieve more as an adventure besides 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.690
 that kids love the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 experience of climbing a meter or 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.200
 little boat the road without stopping 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.490
 mention that you are going to save a lot 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 money 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.810
 now point number 3 is that also 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.959
 This is going to cause you a little bit of fear 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.120
 at the beginning because we are marking a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.480
 network and precisely that's what it's called is called 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.310
 marc alÃ²s basically consists of scoring 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.260
 your phone number with a pen a site 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.760
 on your child's wrist and explain that 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.010
 in case they came to separate in 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.420
 a public place like an airport only 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.130
 You have to show the doll to 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.959
 anyone and ask you to 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.819
 speak a piece of paper on the phone 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.440
 work also but it's easier than 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.330
 miss it and having it written down in the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.880
 doll your son will feel much more 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.140

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.910
