 chrome presents its shower stall 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.259
 simple quick-assembly and his wise father 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.019
 for its assembly you will need 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.960
 of a level of a wrench a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.070
 mallet and a Phillips screwdriver 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.039
 some operations are more 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.260
 easily to two people 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.340
 arrange the five feet of the pedestal 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 200 mm well positioned in the corner 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.210
 installed its location your base 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 is controlled with a spirit level if 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.550
 rights regulate the planet and in 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.090
 acting on the feet install the leap 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.250
 of 90 mm which allows a more evacuation 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.800
 quick 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.920
 the apron has a beautiful refined that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 comes in contact with the receiver elias 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 epub it's underneath it's removable this 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 which allows you easy access to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.699
 assemble the different elements that 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.949
 make up the shower column 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 do not forget the joints and tight to the 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.760
 wrench with the help of a person 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.630
 presented the first shower screen 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.340
 by forming an angle of 90 degrees the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.650
 junction is made by interlocking 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 profiles and patented specially designed 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.110
 which is present on the whole length this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.750
 which solidifies the present structure and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.960
 the partition by the interior forming a 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 angle of 90 degrees and then exerted a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.759
 slight pressure in the middle of the junction 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.070
 led the latter outward 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.650
 in the sweat she sells a little in order to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.979
 the boxed and in its 2 go does the same 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.530
 for the other partitions your column of 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.180
 shower and partitions are assembled the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.280
 tips of curved profiles have a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.380
 specific form that comes to fit 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.020
 in the profiles of the vertical walls 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.750
 first installed the curved profile of the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.560
 down on the base then insert the seals 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560
 on each side 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.490
 the glass walls look like on the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 same principle as the partitions present 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.280
 the glass wall from the inside with 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.770
 an angle of 30 to 40 degrees exercise a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.200
 slight pressure in the middle of the junction 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.450
 and bring the glass wall towards 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.640
 Outside there remains only to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.350
 lower the glass wall with some 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.750
 mallet strokes for a junction 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.840
 total with the bottom profile and has 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.890
 joint prepare the high profile with its 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.970
 joints and position it on the shower 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.750
 give some mallet strokes for 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.160
 insert it assemble the casters with 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.030
 the different elements that 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.310
 make up support casters hides one 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.280
 from the bottom are composed in addition to a resort 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.100
 they allow to place and remove 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.959
 if necessary, wear them easily 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.500
 casters is fixed in levy blood on the 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.630
 doors 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.120
 they all have a cache of 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.340
 finish once the casters have been installed 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.959
 place and the outside handles and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.180
 interior for a better 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.930
 handling as well as the joints 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.060
 sealing present the door by 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.940
 inside the wheels and upside down 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.670
 the outside first by the top or by 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.980
 the bottom down the bottom wheels 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.290
 in their guide by slight pressure 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.800
 port adjustment this fact on the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.930
 high life roads c is the world gate 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.489
 unscrewed and she goes down the doors 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.140
 must be aligned and have a 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.180
 perfect junction on the whole length 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.310
 joints you just have to 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.160
 realize the finishes place the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.950
 last joints on the glass walls 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.100
 insert the cif bung installed the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.260
 showerheads and set up the 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.060
 different parts in order to secure 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.350
 the whole up and down on the ego 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.190
 position your shower she is ready 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.190
 to be connected
