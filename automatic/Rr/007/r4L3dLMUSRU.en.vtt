this kind of stalls fishing pattern
which<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.610> now<00:01:08.760> realize<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.960> cap<00:01:10.470> into<00:01:10.710> the

it's a cat point straight up one of my

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
it's a cat point straight up one of my
students<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.330> wildfire<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.200> pushed<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> was

students with wildfire and pushed it was

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
students with wildfire and pushed it was
and<00:01:23.869> he<00:01:24.869> showed<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.350> move<00:01:26.030> which<00:01:27.229> another

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and he showed me this move which another

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.370 
and he showed me this move which another
variant<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.340> think<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.790> pretty<00:01:30.030> damn

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
variant that I think it's pretty damn

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.520 
variant that I think it's pretty damn
bad<00:01:31.380> us

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.950 

it's<00:01:36.830> always<00:01:37.130> like<00:01:37.369> having<00:01:37.610> more<00:01:37.909> nerds<00:01:38.119> but

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040 

additionally<00:01:43.030> this<00:01:44.030> kind<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.450> convergence<00:01:44.990> of

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
additionally this kind of convergence of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.330 
additionally this kind of convergence of
two<00:01:45.230> things<00:01:45.440> I<00:01:45.530> was<00:01:45.620> playing<00:01:45.860> with<00:01:45.950> last<00:01:46.160> week

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
two things I was playing with last week

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.380 
two things I was playing with last week
so<00:01:47.210> I've<00:01:47.720> got<00:01:48.040> this<00:01:49.040> kind<00:01:49.370> of<00:01:49.430> G<00:01:49.670> style<00:01:49.970> plane

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
so I've got this kind of G style plane

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.680 
so I've got this kind of G style plane
bending<00:01:51.190> or<00:01:52.190> plate<00:01:52.610> shifting<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.240> should<00:01:53.450> say

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
bending or plate shifting it should say

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.220 
bending or plate shifting it should say
the<00:01:55.270> inequality<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.300> those<00:01:56.540> two<00:01:56.750> is<00:01:56.780> very

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
the inequality of those two is very

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.810 
the inequality of those two is very
recently<00:01:57.650> pointed<00:01:58.010> out<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.370> me<00:01:59.290> and<00:02:00.700> I've<00:02:01.700> been

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
recently pointed out to me and I've been

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.520 
recently pointed out to me and I've been
trying<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.150> get<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.450> down<00:02:02.600> instead<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.200> going

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
trying to get it down instead of going

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.420 
trying to get it down instead of going
in<00:02:03.890> opposites<00:02:05.500> going<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.740> same<00:02:07.520> direction

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
in opposites going in same direction

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.270 
in opposites going in same direction
which<00:02:10.430> is<00:02:10.460> turning<00:02:11.300> out<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.420> be<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.750> major

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
which is turning out to be a major

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.900 
which is turning out to be a major
having<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> pain<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:13.760> my<00:02:13.880> ass<00:02:14.090> but

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.960 

hopefully

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.970 

the<00:02:26.970> reason<00:02:27.210> I'm<00:02:27.270> doing<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.540> is<00:02:27.870> because<00:02:28.290> my

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the reason I'm doing this is because my

which the transition to get in and out
of<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.810> basically<00:02:43.320> requires<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.070> able

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
of it basically requires you to be able

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.990 
of it basically requires you to be able
to<00:02:44.610> these<00:02:45.330> have<00:02:46.230> always<00:02:46.530> been<00:02:46.890> opposites<00:02:47.760> for

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
to these have always been opposites for

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.880 
to these have always been opposites for
me<00:02:48.150> but<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.620> same<00:02:49.860> direction

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
me but if I can do it in same direction

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.820 
me but if I can do it in same direction
the<00:02:50.520> transition<00:02:51.000> comes<00:02:51.210> a<00:02:51.300> lot<00:02:51.420> easier<00:02:51.650> at<00:02:52.650> any

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
the transition comes a lot easier at any

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.780 
the transition comes a lot easier at any
rate<00:02:52.970> without<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> transition<00:02:54.720> here<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.650> go

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
rate without the transition here we go

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.860 
rate without the transition here we go
this<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.270> knock<00:02:57.660> home<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.080> three<00:02:58.490> rendered

this is a knock home in three rendered
diagonal<00:03:00.870> planes<00:03:02.540> so<00:03:04.640> there<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:05.850> Charlie

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270

it<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.380> by<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:07.890> way<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.340> utter<00:03:08.700> pain<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.120> the

it is by the way and utter pain in the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.400 
it is by the way and utter pain in the

ass to keep the poi in plane while doing

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:23.270 
ass to keep the poi in plane while doing
this

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.170 

yeah<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.930> yeah<00:03:26.400> Charlie's<00:03:27.400> video<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.850> totally

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
yeah so yeah Charlie's video is totally

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.420 
yeah so yeah Charlie's video is totally
awesome<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:29.170> don't<00:03:30.070> think<00:03:30.160> an

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
awesome I don't think an

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.900 
awesome I don't think an
all-encompassing<00:03:30.640> theory<00:03:31.240> of<00:03:31.360> boy<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.760> one

all-encompassing theory of boy for one

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.410 
all-encompassing theory of boy for one
thing<00:03:33.940> they<00:03:34.660> don't<00:03:34.780> include<00:03:34.990> anything<00:03:35.500> about

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
thing they don't include anything about

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.470 
thing they don't include anything about
degrees<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:38.250> degrees<00:03:39.250> of<00:03:39.280> twists<00:03:39.910> like<00:03:40.120> you'll

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
degrees of degrees of twists like you'll

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.410 
degrees of degrees of twists like you'll
get<00:03:40.660> with<00:03:41.250> tangles<00:03:42.250> with<00:03:42.600> weaves<00:03:44.400> crossers

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
get with tangles with weaves crossers

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.520 
get with tangles with weaves crossers
but<00:03:46.420> still<00:03:46.660> really<00:03:46.810> good<00:03:46.900> for<00:03:47.260> describing

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
but still really good for describing

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.990 
but still really good for describing
what<00:03:47.800> happens<00:03:48.130> with<00:03:48.540> polyrhythm<00:03:49.540> hybrids<00:03:50.380> and

I'm<00:03:57.400> digging<00:03:57.910> his<00:03:58.720> approach<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.440> switching

I'm digging his approach to switching

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.330 
I'm digging his approach to switching

in<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.940> say<00:04:04.450> I<00:04:04.780> want<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:07.209> example<00:04:07.300> I'm

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
in that say I want to for example I'm

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.710 
in that say I want to for example I'm
starting<00:04:08.650> off<00:04:08.800> in<00:04:09.070> same<00:04:10.030> time<00:04:10.239> same<00:04:10.270> direction

there's<00:04:21.700> kind<00:04:21.910> of<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.000> awkward<00:04:22.480> process

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
there's kind of this awkward process

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.210 
there's kind of this awkward process
that<00:04:23.020> go<00:04:23.110> through<00:04:23.350> where<00:04:23.500> one<00:04:23.650> hand<00:04:23.890> catches

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
that go through where one hand catches

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.340 
that go through where one hand catches
up<00:04:24.340> with<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.580> other<00:04:24.730> if<00:04:25.720> I'm<00:04:25.900> playing<00:04:26.050> around

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
up with the other if I'm playing around

switch<00:04:31.290> into<00:04:32.290> off<00:04:32.650> stats<00:04:32.979> same<00:04:33.190> time<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:36.270> then

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
switch into off stats same time and then

Ricola and then switch back in the same
time<00:04:54.210> same<00:04:54.360> direction<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:54.990> either<00:04:55.170> go

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
time same direction I can either go

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.090 
time same direction I can either go
reverse<00:04:55.560> or<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.210> switch<00:04:57.450> into<00:04:57.950> split<00:04:58.950> time

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100

reverse or it can switch into split time
opposites<00:04:59.690> and<00:05:00.690> then<00:05:01.620> back<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.920> same<00:05:02.070> time

opposites and then back to same time
same<00:05:02.430> direction<00:05:02.610> like<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:04.530> really<00:05:04.920> dig<00:05:05.130> this

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
same direction like so I really dig this

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.970 
same direction like so I really dig this
and<00:05:05.930> I've<00:05:06.930> been<00:05:07.020> trying<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.320> think<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.800> how<00:05:07.950> to

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
and I've been trying to think of how to

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.850 
and I've been trying to think of how to
do<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.370> with<00:05:08.610> soft<00:05:08.880> transitions<00:05:09.710> these<00:05:10.710> are

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
do it with soft transitions these are

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.320 
do it with soft transitions these are
all<00:05:10.920> what<00:05:11.070> i<00:05:11.130> would<00:05:11.280> call<00:05:11.430> hard<00:05:11.730> transitions

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
all what i would call hard transitions

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.320 
all what i would call hard transitions
let<00:05:13.140> me<00:05:13.230> explain<00:05:13.530> what<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.680> mean<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.980> so<00:05:14.940> as<00:05:15.180> my

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
let me explain what I mean that so as my

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.550 
let me explain what I mean that so as my
hands<00:05:15.540> are<00:05:15.630> going<00:05:15.750> around<00:05:15.960> same<00:05:16.170> time<00:05:16.200> same

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
hands are going around same time same

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.550 
hands are going around same time same
direction<00:05:16.830> to<00:05:17.310> switch<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.730> into<00:05:18.320> same<00:05:19.320> time

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
direction to switch it into same time

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.530 
direction to switch it into same time
opposites<00:05:20.160> I<00:05:20.400> have<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.060> reverse<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
opposites I have to reverse the

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.170 
opposites I have to reverse the
direction<00:05:21.690> of<00:05:22.020> one<00:05:22.860> hand<00:05:23.130> at<00:05:23.310> least<00:05:23.340> in<00:05:24.000> order

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
direction of one hand at least in order

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.770 
direction of one hand at least in order
to<00:05:24.240> get<00:05:24.390> there<00:05:24.740> like<00:05:25.740> so<00:05:26.420> my<00:05:27.420> boys<00:05:27.630> when

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
to get there like so my boys when

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.690 
to get there like so my boys when
switching<00:05:28.140> to<00:05:28.440> split<00:05:28.740> 7<00:05:28.950> same<00:05:29.130> direction<00:05:29.310> I

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
switching to split 7 same direction I

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.480 
switching to split 7 same direction I
have<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.360> once<00:05:30.510> again<00:05:31.040> switch<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.340> direction

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
have to once again switch the direction

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.650 
have to once again switch the direction
of<00:05:32.970> one<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.870> my<00:05:33.960> hands<00:05:34.910> unit<00:05:35.910> circle<00:05:36.090> contains

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
of one of my hands unit circle contains

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.730 
of one of my hands unit circle contains
this<00:05:36.960> awesome<00:05:37.440> property<00:05:37.650> wherein<00:05:38.400> i<00:05:38.640> can

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
this awesome property wherein i can

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:45.340 
this awesome property wherein i can
switch<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:41.700> direction<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:42.420> hand<00:05:42.810> versus<00:05:43.200> poi

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
switch the direction of hand versus poi

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.390 
switch the direction of hand versus poi
without<00:05:46.350> having<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.710> stop<00:05:46.950> my<00:05:47.100> hand<00:05:47.340> from

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
without having to stop my hand from

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.950 
without having to stop my hand from
moving<00:05:47.820> i<00:05:47.910> would<00:05:48.150> call<00:05:48.360> this<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.570> soft

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
moving i would call this a soft

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.839 
moving i would call this a soft
transition

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.409 

so<00:05:56.499> for<00:05:57.499> example<00:05:57.610> one<00:05:58.610> way<00:05:58.969> we<00:05:59.119> could<00:05:59.240> play

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
so for example one way we could play

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.510 
so for example one way we could play
with<00:05:59.599> this<00:05:59.809> with<00:06:00.139> other<00:06:00.709> than<00:06:00.919> hybrids<00:06:01.339> would

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
with this with other than hybrids would

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.449 
with this with other than hybrids would
say<00:06:01.789> beats<00:06:02.509> a<00:06:02.659> switch<00:06:03.020> between<00:06:03.409> which<00:06:03.860> hand<00:06:04.219> is

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:04.459 
say beats a switch between which hand is

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:18.839 
say beats a switch between which hand is
doing<00:06:05.679> the<00:06:06.679> flower

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:20.699 

and<00:06:18.939> then<00:06:19.749> when<00:06:20.020> we<00:06:20.050> come<00:06:20.289> together<00:06:20.439> in<00:06:20.649> the

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:20.709 
and then when we come together in the

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:23.129 
and then when we come together in the
middle<00:06:21.209> and<00:06:22.209> switch<00:06:22.509> them<00:06:22.599> both<00:06:22.809> into<00:06:23.020> the

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
middle and switch them both into the

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.980 
middle and switch them both into the
same<00:06:23.259> time<00:06:23.469> offsets<00:06:23.979> and<00:06:24.539> if<00:06:25.539> we<00:06:25.659> were<00:06:25.779> so

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
same time offsets and if we were so

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.339 
same time offsets and if we were so
motivated<00:06:27.419> we<00:06:28.419> can<00:06:28.599> collapse<00:06:28.899> them<00:06:29.080> into<00:06:29.229> the

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
motivated we can collapse them into the

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.019 
motivated we can collapse them into the
same<00:06:29.529> circle<00:06:30.149> either<00:06:31.149> by<00:06:32.339> virtue<00:06:33.339> of<00:06:33.610> about<00:06:33.909> of

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:37.899 
linear extensions or we could just

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:45.179 
linear extensions or we could just
budget<00:06:41.879> but<00:06:42.879> i<00:06:43.199> don't<00:06:44.199> know<00:06:44.289> i<00:06:44.619> don't<00:06:44.860> know<00:06:45.039> how

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
useful this is going to be overall but

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.820 
useful this is going to be overall but
definitely<00:06:49.360> it's<00:06:50.319> something<00:06:50.559> to<00:06:50.649> play<00:06:50.800> with

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
definitely it's something to play with

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.699 
definitely it's something to play with
something<00:06:51.309> to<00:06:51.399> see<00:06:51.490> if<00:06:51.580> i<00:06:51.639> can<00:06:51.789> make<00:06:51.909> useful

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:52.709 
something to see if i can make useful

pendulums which i think is unfortunate

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:16.859 
pendulums which i think is unfortunate
because<00:07:15.459> when<00:07:15.969> you<00:07:16.059> add<00:07:16.209> pendulums<00:07:16.659> are<00:07:16.749> in

the mix you can not only switch between

with<00:07:22.509> the<00:07:22.659> points<00:07:23.199> too<00:07:23.379> for<00:07:24.219> example<00:07:24.610> if<00:07:24.669> I

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:24.759

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:26.709 
started out in an office at same time

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:32.339 
started out in an office at same time
and<00:07:27.749> i<00:07:28.749> added<00:07:29.199> a<00:07:29.469> pendulum<00:07:29.860> to<00:07:30.189> one<00:07:30.369> side<00:07:31.349> Nicki

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:32.349 
and i added a pendulum to one side Nicki

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.829 
and i added a pendulum to one side Nicki
now<00:07:32.469> go<00:07:32.589> the<00:07:32.649> same<00:07:32.860> direction<00:07:32.949> same<00:07:33.430> time<00:07:33.839> at

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:34.839 
now go the same direction same time at

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:39.269 
now go the same direction same time at
the<00:07:35.259> pendulum<00:07:35.649> again<00:07:37.259> and<00:07:38.259> I<00:07:38.559> can<00:07:38.769> go<00:07:38.919> to<00:07:38.979> split

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:39.279 
the pendulum again and I can go to split

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:45.179 
the pendulum again and I can go to split
time<00:07:39.339> opposites<00:07:40.329> like<00:07:40.959> so<00:07:41.169> so<00:07:43.889> more<00:07:44.889> stuff<00:07:45.069> to

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:45.189 
time opposites like so so more stuff to

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:46.439 
time opposites like so so more stuff to
play<00:07:45.309> with<00:07:45.369> I'll<00:07:45.819> have<00:07:46.029> more<00:07:46.059> stuff<00:07:46.389> coming

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:46.449 
play with I'll have more stuff coming

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.079 
play with I'll have more stuff coming
