00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
what chemicals they can can't is so the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.770 
what chemicals they can can't is so the
question<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.530> how<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.030> clean<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
question is is how do you clean the

fruits and a friend turned me under this

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.880 
fruits and a friend turned me under this
special<00:00:51.149> water<00:00:51.539> machine<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.879> I<00:00:54.530> can<00:00:55.530> get<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
special water machine and I can get I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.860 
special water machine and I can get I
can<00:00:56.100> take<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.910> I'm<00:00:57.149> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.719> an

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
can take and I'm going to do an

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.689 
can take and I'm going to do an
experiment<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.859> using<00:00:59.250> filtered

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
experiment here just using filtered

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.029 
experiment here just using filtered
water<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.120> try<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> clean<00:01:01.289> these<00:01:01.500> vegetables

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
water and try to clean these vegetables

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.080 
water and try to clean these vegetables
off<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:04.189> left<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.460> far<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.790> what

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
off and see what is left as far as what

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
off and see what is left as far as what
actually<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.990> wash<00:01:07.320> off<00:01:07.619> using<00:01:08.040> regular

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
actually I can wash off using regular

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.490 
actually I can wash off using regular
water<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.510> I'm<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> use<00:01:09.990> strip

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
water and then I'm going to use strip

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.060 
water and then I'm going to use strip
water<00:01:10.770> 11.5<00:01:11.760> pH<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
water 11.5 pH and I think that that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.249 
water 11.5 pH and I think that that
strong<00:01:14.610> pH<00:01:15.000> water<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.020> able<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
strong pH water is going to be able to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.660 
strong pH water is going to be able to
take<00:01:16.439> some<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.830> pesticides<00:01:17.430> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
take some of these pesticides and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.770 
take some of these pesticides and
chemicals<00:01:18.030> off<00:01:18.180> there<00:01:18.390> we're<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.689> take

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
chemicals off there we're going to take

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.499 
chemicals off there we're going to take
a<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.470> water<00:01:19.799> samples<00:01:20.670> after<00:01:21.180> we

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
a look at the two water samples after we

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.910 
a look at the two water samples after we
wash<00:01:21.780> these<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> start<00:01:22.770> out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
wash these and we're going to start out

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.690 
wash these and we're going to start out
with<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> fresh<00:01:23.580> water<00:01:25.070> okay<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:26.520> we'll

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
with the fresh water okay so what we'll

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.590 
with the fresh water okay so what we'll
do<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.439> is<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:30.259> regular<00:01:32.600> clean

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.259 
there so what we're gonna do learn from
our<00:03:14.360> lesson<00:03:14.780> here<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.140> one<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.380> guess<00:03:16.269> will

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
our lesson here on this one I guess will

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.990 
our lesson here on this one I guess will
be<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.170> little<00:03:18.319> bit<00:03:18.500> more<00:03:18.650> careful<00:03:19.100> but<00:03:19.700> now<00:03:19.819> it

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
be a little bit more careful but now it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.380 
be a little bit more careful but now it
is<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.180> same<00:03:20.830> demonstration<00:03:22.360> with<00:03:23.360> the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
is the same demonstration with the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.560 
is the same demonstration with the
strong<00:03:24.370> Mountain<00:03:25.370> Water<00:03:26.860> 11.5<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:29.150> rewash

vegetables with a little bit of five and

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.640 
vegetables with a little bit of five and
what<00:03:35.390> we'll<00:03:35.570> do<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:36.110> is<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:37.459> will<00:03:38.470> go<00:03:39.470> with

light<00:04:49.260> here<00:04:49.640> maybe<00:04:50.640> I<00:04:50.790> can<00:04:53.120> get<00:04:54.120> for<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:55.760> this

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
light here maybe I can get for this this

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.030 
light here maybe I can get for this this
water<00:04:57.120> in<00:04:57.360> here<00:04:57.600> without<00:04:58.110> spilling<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.770> this

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
sometimes you have to think about what

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.869 
sometimes you have to think about what
you're<00:05:39.629> eating<00:05:39.659> try<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.139> buy<00:05:40.349> organic<00:05:40.879> we're

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:41.879 
you're eating try to buy organic we're

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.369 
you're eating try to buy organic we're
trying<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> buy<00:05:42.330> stuff<00:05:42.569> that's<00:05:42.629> locally<00:05:43.169> grown

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
trying to buy stuff that's locally grown

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.300 
trying to buy stuff that's locally grown
and<00:05:44.360> for<00:05:45.360> me<00:05:45.539> I'm<00:05:46.319> pretty<00:05:46.589> well<00:05:46.860> hooked<00:05:47.129> on

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
and for me I'm pretty well hooked on

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.829 
and for me I'm pretty well hooked on
this<00:05:47.400> machine<00:05:47.639> and<00:05:48.120> I<00:05:48.180> think<00:05:48.419> this<00:05:48.539> is<00:05:48.689> the

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:48.839 
this machine and I think this is the

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.430 
this machine and I think this is the
best<00:05:49.020> way<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.259> try<00:05:49.560> to<00:05:49.589> clean<00:05:49.860> vegetables
