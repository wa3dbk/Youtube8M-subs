know<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:20.910> when<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.269> pieces<00:04:21.419> are<00:04:21.600> even

know I like it when the pieces are even
but<00:04:22.079> unfortunately<00:04:22.680> this<00:04:22.800> one<00:04:22.980> is<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.550> has

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
but unfortunately this one is not it has

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.850 
but unfortunately this one is not it has
some<00:04:23.850> mismatches<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.720> some<00:04:25.230> miss<00:04:25.380> placements

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
some mismatches and some miss placements

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.770 
some mismatches and some miss placements
but<00:04:25.980> overall<00:04:26.639> this<00:04:26.760> looks<00:04:26.850> like<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.150> very<00:04:27.389> solid

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
but overall this looks like a very solid

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.090 
but overall this looks like a very solid
setup<00:04:28.110> it<00:04:28.230> looks<00:04:28.380> like<00:04:28.500> it's<00:04:28.710> gonna<00:04:28.800> make<00:04:28.889> the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
setup it looks like it's gonna make the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.710 
setup it looks like it's gonna make the
Hogs<00:04:29.340> really<00:04:29.730> run<00:04:29.940> around<00:04:30.060> throughout<00:04:30.570> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
Hogs really run around throughout the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.570 
Hogs really run around throughout the
base<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.440> traps<00:04:31.740> are<00:04:31.980> placed<00:04:32.250> very

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
base and the traps are placed very

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.250 
base and the traps are placed very
nicely<00:04:32.850> so<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.210> they<00:04:33.510> will<00:04:33.660> always<00:04:33.840> hit<00:04:34.110> the

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
nicely so that they will always hit the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.080 
nicely so that they will always hit the
hog<00:04:34.440> riders<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:34.950> any<00:04:35.340> incoming<00:04:35.970> troops

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
hog riders and any incoming troops

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.850 
hog riders and any incoming troops
probably<00:04:36.750> focus<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.229> like<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.590> said<00:04:37.740> before

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
probably focus just like I said before
