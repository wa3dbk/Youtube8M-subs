00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.340 
television or to your surround sound
system<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.880> since<00:01:36.570> most<00:01:36.750> CDs<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.110> actually

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
system and since most CDs don't actually

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
system and since most CDs don't actually
have<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> 3.5<00:01:37.710> millimeter<00:01:38.189> audio<00:01:38.579> jack<00:01:38.790> they

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
have the 3.5 millimeter audio jack they

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.600 
have the 3.5 millimeter audio jack they
also<00:01:39.420> give<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.590> RCA<00:01:41.100> connection<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
also give you this RCA connection so

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
also give you this RCA connection so
basically<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> audio<00:01:42.570> out<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
basically going to do the audio out of

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
basically going to do the audio out of
the<00:01:43.409> RCA<00:01:43.770> connections<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.030> plug<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the RCA connections you know plug this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.210 
the RCA connections you know plug this
in<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.079> use<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> adapter<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.920> then

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in you can use the adapter and then

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.590 
in you can use the adapter and then
you're<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> set<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.909> pointing<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
you're going to set this pointing that

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
you're going to set this pointing that
way<00:01:48.780> towards<00:01:49.020> your<00:01:49.259> headsets<00:01:49.619> now<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.970> range

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
way towards your headsets now the range

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.160 
way towards your headsets now the range
is<00:01:51.329> kind<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.540> limited<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:51.990> seven

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
is kind of limited there about seven

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
is kind of limited there about seven
meters<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.710> about<00:01:52.860> 15<00:01:53.130> feet<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
meters so it's about 15 feet and so

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.310 
meters so it's about 15 feet and so
basically<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.540> want<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.899> point<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
basically you want to do is point that

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.440 
basically you want to do is point that
to<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> front<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.399> TV<00:01:56.549> facing<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to the front of your TV facing you and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420 
to the front of your TV facing you and
then<00:01:57.930> these<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.140> our<00:01:58.439> receivers<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:58.979> both<00:01:59.189> sides

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
then these I our receivers on both sides

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.980 
then these I our receivers on both sides
are<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.000> each<00:02:00.210> channel<00:02:00.630> separately

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
are going to get each channel separately

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.620 
are going to get each channel separately
to<00:02:01.680> give<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.189> wireless<00:02:02.520> audio<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.390> if

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to give you your wireless audio now if

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
to give you your wireless audio now if
you<00:02:03.990> want<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.380> do<00:02:04.710> wireless<00:02:05.159> microphone<00:02:05.579> as

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
you want to do wireless microphone as

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.459 
you want to do wireless microphone as
well<00:02:05.729> don't<00:02:06.270> worry<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.570> its<00:02:06.750> included<00:02:07.229> in

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
well don't worry about its included in

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.219 
well don't worry about its included in
the<00:02:07.619> box<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.149> is<00:02:09.229> it's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the box and this is what it is it's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
the box and this is what it is it's
basically<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.709> little<00:02:11.099> tiny<00:02:11.250> 3.5<00:02:11.940> million<00:02:12.120> Jack

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
basically a little tiny 3.5 million Jack

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.250 
basically a little tiny 3.5 million Jack
and<00:02:12.690> what

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and what

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.360 
and what
Do<00:02:13.319> It<00:02:13.349> this<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.709> you're<00:02:13.860> going<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.040> plug<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
Do It this is it you're going to plug it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.520 
Do It this is it you're going to plug it
in<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.879> your<00:02:15.000> controller<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.379> basically

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
in to your controller and then basically

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 
in to your controller and then basically
with<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.069> controller<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.879> can<00:02:18.000> flip<00:02:18.299> this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
with your controller you can flip this

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
with your controller you can flip this
up<00:02:18.659> and<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.049> point<00:02:19.319> towards<00:02:20.010> your

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
up and it's going to point towards your

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.740 
up and it's going to point towards your
face<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.090> your<00:02:21.329> wireless

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
face and that is your wireless

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.479 
face and that is your wireless
microphone<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:23.040> actually<00:02:23.340> got<00:02:23.459> really

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
microphone it's actually got really

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.610 
microphone it's actually got really
really<00:02:23.909> good<00:02:24.090> quietly<00:02:24.420> quality<00:02:25.230> very<00:02:25.500> high

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
really good quietly quality very high

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.679 
really good quietly quality very high
sensitivity<00:02:25.980> low<00:02:26.819> interference<00:02:27.390> it's

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
sensitivity low interference it's

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.589 
sensitivity low interference it's
basically<00:02:28.409> CD<00:02:28.739> quality<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.909> end<00:02:30.329> up<00:02:30.450> working

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
basically CD quality and end up working

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.420 
basically CD quality and end up working
out<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.019> well<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.530> it's<00:02:32.250> basically

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
out really well so it's basically

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.190 
out really well so it's basically
basically<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.269> there's<00:02:33.569> not<00:02:33.690> much<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:33.900> on

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
basically it there's not much going on

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.500 
basically it there's not much going on
here<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.620> said<00:02:34.890> basically<00:02:35.040> twice<00:02:35.370> there<00:02:35.579> it's

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
here I said basically twice there it's

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.949 
here I said basically twice there it's
very<00:02:36.690> simple<00:02:37.430> value-oriented<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.659> can't

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
very simple value-oriented if you can't

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.660 
very simple value-oriented if you can't
spend<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.290> ton<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> money<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.859> your<00:02:41.280> stuff<00:02:41.519> if
