 good friends today I will teach you to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.219
 how to change the internal memory by the 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.519
 external in the engine and good first thing 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.559
 that we have to do well in the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.800
 requirements that we have to have is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.619
 have superuser permissions on 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.689
 our good engine once we already 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.930
 let's have superuser permissions 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.980
 we are going to install the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.600
 xbox installs this I'll leave it in the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.420
 link of the download in the description 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 so that if they do not have it what 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.650
 download good then to change the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.430
 internal memory we will enter and we 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:49.260
 let's go to download let's search 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.590
 x internal 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.920
 the internal sd here is how you will see 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.990
 well let's go to versions and download the 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.489
 3.2 what is it that I have now 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:06.460
 installed once installed we are not going to 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.440
 this to not double restart our 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.380
 device we are going to 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.900
 well let's enter the application 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.750
 after it has just been installed that 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.909
 is going to be this is going to be this 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.270
 appear like this 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.350
 then we are going to stop to palomear these 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.189
 three options 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 I'm sorry and here we are not going to move 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.619
 nothing because it already brings the default route 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.780
 then let's put him to accept and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.440
 let's restart our phone 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.299
 well that was all good for when 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.450
 do we reboot the device and 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.789
 when it has finished restarting 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.840
 it's not going to change us here in the settings 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.659
 the information that says here in 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.329
 let's say me here 2 with 17 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.909
 it will not appear in the sd memory or 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.640
 here that I have the sd card of one of 8 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.540
 gigas will not appear as the internal 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.750
 but nevertheless when it does not cal not change 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.760
 this information anyway is going to 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.470
 be changed the internal memory by the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.650
 external so we do not have what 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.650
 worry 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.490
 then the only thing I wanted to tell you 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.680
 is that they subscribe to this channel because 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.980
 I will be uploading videos for the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.980
 engine
