this is pretty much just my everyday
summer<00:00:13.850> makeup<00:00:14.270> that<00:00:14.690> I<00:00:14.719> do<00:00:14.990> and<00:00:15.469> most<00:00:16.309> of<00:00:16.460> this

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
summer makeup that I do and most of this

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.450 
summer makeup that I do and most of this
makeup<00:00:16.820> is<00:00:17.119> waterproof<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:17.780> I<00:00:18.470> decided<00:00:19.340> to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
makeup is waterproof so I decided to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.580 
makeup is waterproof so I decided to
incorporate<00:00:20.000> all<00:00:20.480> this<00:00:20.660> makeup<00:00:20.900> together<00:00:21.140> and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
incorporate all this makeup together and

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.579 
incorporate all this makeup together and
create<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.789> mostly<00:00:23.269> waterproof<00:00:23.839> look<00:00:24.109> some<00:00:24.500> of

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:24.589 
create a mostly waterproof look some of

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.919 
create a mostly waterproof look some of
these<00:00:24.679> products<00:00:25.220> may<00:00:25.400> not<00:00:25.429> be<00:00:25.699> waterproof<00:00:26.210> but

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
these products may not be waterproof but

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.849 
these products may not be waterproof but
I<00:00:27.169> think<00:00:27.529> about<00:00:27.789> 90%<00:00:28.789> of<00:00:28.849> them<00:00:28.970> are<00:00:29.499> so<00:00:30.499> I

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
I think about 90% of them are so I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.710 
I think about 90% of them are so I
really<00:00:31.279> like<00:00:31.460> these<00:00:31.730> and<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.450> think<00:00:32.630> they're
