the user cookies that could send those

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
the user cookies that could send those
use<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.370> cookies<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.570> attacker<00:00:44.059> now<00:00:45.059> today

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
use or cookies to the attacker now today

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.700 
use or cookies to the attacker now today
we're<00:00:45.510> going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> cover<00:00:45.870> cross-site

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
we're going to cover cross-site

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.209 
we're going to cover cross-site
scripting<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.899> reason<00:00:49.289> that's<00:00:49.500> possible

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
scripting and the reason that's possible

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.790 
scripting and the reason that's possible
at<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.989> combination<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.590> both

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
at all is it's a combination of both

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.139 
at all is it's a combination of both
script<00:00:53.460> injection<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.210> session<00:00:54.930> hijacking

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
script injection and session hijacking

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
script injection and session hijacking
which<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.300> covered<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.719> previous<00:00:58.109> video<00:00:58.260> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
which we covered in a previous video so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.549 
which we covered in a previous video so
essentially<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.780> website<00:01:00.780> must<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.289> vulnerable

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
essentially a website must be vulnerable

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.299 
essentially a website must be vulnerable
to<00:01:01.829> script<00:01:02.340> injection<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.619> two<00:01:04.619> users<00:01:05.040> must

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to script injection and two users must

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
to script injection and two users must
be<00:01:05.430> able<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> interact<00:01:06.170> in<00:01:07.170> order<00:01:07.409> for

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
be able to interact in order for

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.250 
be able to interact in order for
cross-site<00:01:07.740> scripting<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> work<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.930> see

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
cross-site scripting to work so you see

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.980 
cross-site scripting to work so you see
a<00:01:10.290> lot<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.710> cross-site<00:01:11.310> scripting<00:01:11.990> being

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a lot of cross-site scripting being

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
a lot of cross-site scripting being
combined<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.470> these<00:01:13.590> phishing<00:01:13.979> attacks

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
combined with these phishing attacks

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.270 
combined with these phishing attacks

of these things

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.090

well<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> cross<00:01:46.170> site<00:01:46.380> scripting<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.920> don't

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
well the cross site scripting you don't

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.760 
well the cross site scripting you don't
really<00:01:47.220> need<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.240> phishing<00:01:48.630> phase<00:01:48.869> because

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
really need the phishing phase because

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.469 
really need the phishing phase because
in<00:01:49.890> scrot<00:01:50.189> cross-site<00:01:50.820> scripting<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> have

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in scrot cross-site scripting you have

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
in scrot cross-site scripting you have
the<00:01:51.630> ability<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.960> inject<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> code<00:01:52.710> directly

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the ability to inject the code directly

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.179 
the ability to inject the code directly
or<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.850> script<00:01:54.119> directly<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.470> bank's

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
or the script directly into that bank's

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.630 
or the script directly into that bank's
website<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.850> real<00:01:57.030> website<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:59.040> someone

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640

let's<00:02:13.379> attack<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.980> website<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.700> use<00:02:15.150> that

let's attack that website and use that

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.039 
let's attack that website and use that
to<00:02:16.310> scrape<00:02:17.310> my<00:02:17.519> information<00:02:18.209> that's<00:02:18.840> why

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
to scrape my information that's why

to scrape my information that's why
cross-site<00:02:19.560> scripting<00:02:20.040> can<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.720> difficult

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
cross-site scripting can be so difficult

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.360 
cross-site scripting can be so difficult
to<00:02:22.349> deal<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.680> from<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.950> user<00:02:23.159> perspective

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
to deal with from a user perspective

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.240 
to deal with from a user perspective
because<00:02:23.909> in<00:02:24.329> many<00:02:24.810> cases<00:02:25.319> it<00:02:25.530> looks<00:02:25.769> extremely

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
because in many cases it looks extremely

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.429 
because in many cases it looks extremely
legitimate<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.180> it's<00:02:27.540> leveraging<00:02:28.319> an

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
legitimate because it's leveraging an

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.399 
legitimate because it's leveraging an
attack<00:02:28.769> against<00:02:29.579> your<00:02:30.269> bank's<00:02:30.780> your<00:02:31.140> online

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
attack against your bank's your online

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.870

shopping<00:02:31.860> organizations<00:02:32.610> website

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.610 

now<00:02:37.390> we<00:02:37.450> need<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.810> find<00:02:37.990> some<00:02:38.350> place<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
now we need to find some place to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.590 
now we need to find some place to
interact<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> user<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.210> if<00:02:40.270> we<00:02:40.360> go<00:02:40.450> into

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
interact with the user so if we go into

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.650 
interact with the user so if we go into
products<00:02:41.140> books<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:43.120> take<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> look<00:02:43.540> at<00:02:43.630> a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
products books we take a look at a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.750 
products books we take a look at a
specific<00:02:43.870> book<00:02:44.440> we<00:02:45.010> find<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.430> there's<00:02:45.640> an

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
specific book we find that there's an

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.080 
specific book we find that there's an
area<00:02:46.060> within<00:02:46.360> here<00:02:46.540> called<00:02:46.810> add<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.140> comment<00:02:48.090> so

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
area within here called add a comment so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.270 
area within here called add a comment so
theoretically<00:02:49.360> we<00:02:49.930> could<00:02:50.140> type<00:02:50.320> any<00:02:50.740> comment

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
theoretically we could type any comment

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.460 
theoretically we could type any comment
we<00:02:51.400> want<00:02:51.640> in<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:51.970> area<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.630> that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
we want in this area and that

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.470 
we want in this area and that
information<00:02:54.220> is<00:02:54.370> going<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.610> be<00:02:54.670> displayed<00:02:55.180> to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
information is going to be displayed to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.370 
information is going to be displayed to
all<00:02:56.110> users<00:02:57.270> that<00:02:58.270> are<00:02:58.480> reviewing<00:02:59.290> this

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
all users that are reviewing this

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.770 
all users that are reviewing this
particular<00:02:59.710> book<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:01.210> you<00:03:01.330> recall<00:03:01.450> earlier

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
particular book so if you recall earlier

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.290 
particular book so if you recall earlier
we<00:03:02.020> had<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> simple<00:03:02.590> alert<00:03:03.160> command<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:04.150> would

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
we had a simple alert command that would

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.280 
we had a simple alert command that would
pop<00:03:04.570> up<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:05.520> essentially<00:03:06.520> just<00:03:06.730> show<00:03:06.910> us<00:03:07.290> our

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
pop up and essentially just show us our

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.710 
pop up and essentially just show us our
cookie<00:03:08.770> information<00:03:09.300> well<00:03:10.300> we<00:03:10.420> can<00:03:10.570> do<00:03:10.690> a

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
cookie information well we can do a

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.280 
cookie information well we can do a
derivative<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:12.100> attack<00:03:12.580> here<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:14.200> I'm

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
derivative of that attack here so I'm

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.860 
derivative of that attack here so I'm
simply<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.860> say<00:03:15.100> hat<00:03:15.430> so<00:03:16.390> instead<00:03:16.810> of

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
simply going to say hat so instead of

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.290 
simply going to say hat so instead of
showing<00:03:17.470> me<00:03:17.620> cookie<00:03:17.890> information<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.580> want<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
showing me cookie information I want the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300 
showing me cookie information I want the
term<00:03:19.480> hack<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.900> come<00:03:20.050> up<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.800> I'll<00:03:20.920> click<00:03:21.100> Add

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
and again I'm logged in as bugs so I

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.370 
and again I'm logged in as bugs so I
want<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.580> log<00:03:24.790> out<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.330> lot<00:03:25.720> get<00:03:25.870> as<00:03:25.960> a<00:03:25.990> different

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
want to log out a lot get as a different

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.220 
want to log out a lot get as a different
user<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.970> we<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.120> recall<00:03:28.420> from<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.780> very

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
user and we can recall from the very

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.900 
user and we can recall from the very
early<00:03:29.590> sequel<00:03:29.920> injection<00:03:30.010> attacks<00:03:30.610> where<00:03:30.820> we

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
early sequel injection attacks where we

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.940 
early sequel injection attacks where we
dumped<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.210> username<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:32.350> password<00:03:32.410> database

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
dumped a username and password database

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.820 
dumped a username and password database
Taz<00:03:33.760> D<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.330> Tasmanian<00:03:35.320> devil

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
Taz D is Tasmanian devil

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.990 
Taz D is Tasmanian devil
so<00:03:36.280> I'll<00:03:36.400> log<00:03:36.610> in<00:03:36.820> as<00:03:37.170> Taz<00:03:38.170> D<00:03:38.380> with<00:03:38.650> Taz<00:03:39.040> Taz

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
so I'll log in as Taz D with Taz Taz

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.290 
so I'll log in as Taz D with Taz Taz
devil<00:03:40.390> as<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:41.050> password<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:42.000> once<00:03:43.000> we<00:03:43.150> get

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
devil as the password and once we get

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.200 
devil as the password and once we get
logged<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:44.460> essentially<00:03:45.460> we're<00:03:45.760> just<00:03:45.970> going

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.870 

now<00:04:26.410> at<00:04:26.560> this<00:04:26.710> point<00:04:27.010> what<00:04:27.190> I'd<00:04:27.310> like<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.610> do<00:04:27.730> is

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
now at this point what I'd like to do is

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.460 
now at this point what I'd like to do is
go<00:04:28.030> ahead<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.240> paste<00:04:28.570> in<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.780> script<00:04:29.200> it's<00:04:29.410> a

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
go ahead and paste in the script it's a

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.720 
go ahead and paste in the script it's a
pretty<00:04:29.680> large<00:04:29.860> script<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.400> don't<00:04:30.520> want<00:04:30.640> to

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
pretty large script so I don't want to

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.790 
pretty large script so I don't want to
type<00:04:30.880> at<00:04:31.030> all<00:04:31.180> essentially<00:04:32.170> I'm<00:04:32.290> saying<00:04:32.590> let's

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
type at all essentially I'm saying let's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.860 
type at all essentially I'm saying let's
call<00:04:33.010> a<00:04:33.040> java<00:04:33.370> script<00:04:33.790> that's<00:04:34.420> going<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.720> look

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
call a java script that's going to look

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.050 
call a java script that's going to look
at<00:04:35.020> window<00:04:35.410> dot<00:04:35.590> location<00:04:35.950> which<00:04:36.430> simply<00:04:36.850> says

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
at window dot location which simply says

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.390 
at window dot location which simply says
where<00:04:37.390> am<00:04:37.420> i<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.870> I'm<00:04:38.080> changing<00:04:38.410> that<00:04:38.830> to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
where am i and I'm changing that to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.780 
where am i and I'm changing that to
localhost<00:04:39.790> /<00:04:40.270> homepage<00:04:41.230> ASP<00:04:42.040> so<00:04:42.460> I'm<00:04:42.550> saying

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
localhost / homepage ASP so I'm saying

where you are is someplace else I'm

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.469 
where you are is someplace else I'm
naming<00:04:45.040> a<00:04:45.190> localhost<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.030> could<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.300> any

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
naming a localhost but that could be any

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.740 
naming a localhost but that could be any
website<00:04:46.960> where<00:04:47.380> let<00:04:48.220> me<00:04:48.310> add<00:04:48.490> that<00:04:48.520> in
