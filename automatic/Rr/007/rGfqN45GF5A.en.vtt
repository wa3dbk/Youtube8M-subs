00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
few videos have been on ps3 but I'm

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.750 
few videos have been on ps3 but I'm
usually<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:19.050> PC<00:00:19.529> player<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> little

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
usually a PC player so it was a little

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.099 
usually a PC player so it was a little
bit<00:00:20.880> hard<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.090> me<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> move<00:00:21.449> across<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.990> get

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
bit hard for me to move across and get

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.470 
bit hard for me to move across and get
some<00:00:22.260> footage<00:00:22.560> out<00:00:22.740> advisable<00:00:23.400> whatever<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
some footage out advisable whatever it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.230 
some footage out advisable whatever it
was<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.660> different<00:00:25.080> experience<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:26.150> there<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
was a different experience and there are

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.640 
was a different experience and there are
a<00:00:27.300> few<00:00:27.539> reasons<00:00:27.810> why<00:00:28.050> I'm<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> talk

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a few reasons why I'm going to talk

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.859 
a few reasons why I'm going to talk
about<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.460> video<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.630> mainly

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
about that in this video but it's mainly

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.720 
about that in this video but it's mainly
just<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.230> compare<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> two<00:00:31.800> editions<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
just to compare the two editions and the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.569 
just to compare the two editions and the
way<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> feel<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.540> works<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.110> both<00:00:34.489> editions<00:00:35.489> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
way I feel it works on both editions of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.119 
way I feel it works on both editions of
the<00:00:35.730> game<00:00:35.760> console<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.630> PC<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.739> let's<00:00:37.920> start

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the game console and PC so let's start

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.610 
the game console and PC so let's start
off<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> main<00:00:40.260> difference

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
off so first of all the main difference

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.110 
off so first of all the main difference
you're<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> see<00:00:41.070> between<00:00:41.309> battlefield

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you're going to see between battlefield

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
you're going to see between battlefield
3<00:00:42.270> aftermath<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> PC<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.920> console<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
3 aftermath on the PC and on console is

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.020 
3 aftermath on the PC and on console is
the<00:00:45.510> increased<00:00:45.989> resolution<00:00:46.230> size<00:00:47.030> obviously

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the increased resolution size obviously

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.260 
the increased resolution size obviously
on<00:00:48.450> PC<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> max<00:00:49.200> resolution<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.309> more

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
on PC the max resolution is I think more

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.139 
on PC the max resolution is I think more
than<00:00:51.449> 1080p<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> play<00:00:53.969> out

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
than 1080p I think but what I play out

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.020 
than 1080p I think but what I play out
is<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.480> 1080p<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.920> console<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.579> maxes<00:00:56.940> out

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
is that 1080p and a console it maxes out

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150 
is that 1080p and a console it maxes out
at<00:00:57.090> 720<00:00:57.899> there<00:00:58.140> are<00:00:58.289> rumors<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> even

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
at 720 there are rumors that it even

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.779 
at 720 there are rumors that it even
maxes<00:00:59.520> out<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.660> think<00:01:01.109> 1024<00:01:01.859> by<00:01:02.010> 600<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
maxes out at and I think 1024 by 600 and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.399 
maxes out at and I think 1024 by 600 and
it's<00:01:02.910> simply<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.359> scale<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> 720<00:01:04.290> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it's simply up scale to 720 to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.350 
it's simply up scale to 720 to
accommodate<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> screen<00:01:05.220> size<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:06.060> because

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
accommodate the screen size just because

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
accommodate the screen size just because
the<00:01:06.479> graphics<00:01:06.869> inside<00:01:07.200> consoles<00:01:07.710> are

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the graphics inside consoles are

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
the graphics inside consoles are
starting<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> wear<00:01:08.400> away<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.750> you're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
starting to wear away but and you're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.630 
starting to wear away but and you're
definitely<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> notice<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.189> increase

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
definitely going to notice the increase

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.800 
definitely going to notice the increase
in<00:01:12.619> graphics<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.299> does<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> maps

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
in graphics and it really does the maps

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
in graphics and it really does the maps
justice<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.470> colors<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.009> come<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
justice the colors that come out of it

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.490 
justice the colors that come out of it
in<00:01:17.700> 1080p<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.509> look<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> much<00:01:19.110> better<00:01:19.290> than

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
in 1080p just look so much better than

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.770 
in 1080p just look so much better than
console<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.280> depending<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> what<00:01:21.390> graphics

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
console and depending on what graphics

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870 
console and depending on what graphics
card<00:01:21.990> you've<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.259> anyway<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:23.340> textures

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
card you've got anyway the more textures

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.370 
card you've got anyway the more textures
and<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> mesh<00:01:24.360> settings<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.080> can<00:01:25.229> get

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and the mesh settings that you can get

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.260 
and the mesh settings that you can get
in<00:01:25.500> there<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> ambient<00:01:26.580> occlusion<00:01:26.850> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
in there and the ambient occlusion and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.910 
in there and the ambient occlusion and
all<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.080> stuff<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.770> do

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
all that kind of stuff that you can do

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.999 
all that kind of stuff that you can do
on<00:01:29.070> PC<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.990> brings<00:01:31.259> up<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> maps<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
on PC it really brings up the maps to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
on PC it really brings up the maps to
life<00:01:32.159> even<00:01:32.610> more<00:01:32.729> than<00:01:32.939> they<00:01:33.180> were<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.860> ps3

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
life even more than they were on ps3

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.929 
life even more than they were on ps3
which<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.520> playing<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
which is what I was playing and I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.609 
which is what I was playing and I
thought<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> graphics<00:01:36.390> were<00:01:36.659> all<00:01:36.869> right<00:01:37.079> for

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
thought the graphics were all right for

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
thought the graphics were all right for
console<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.250> honest<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.479> yeah<00:01:39.659> you're

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
console to be honest but yeah you're

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.789 
console to be honest but yeah you're
definitely<00:01:39.990> going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> huge

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
definitely going to see a huge

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.350 
definitely going to see a huge
improvement<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.430> graphics<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> PC

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
improvement in graphics with the PC

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.649 
improvement in graphics with the PC
version<00:01:43.310> secondly<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.540> difference<00:01:45.540> you're

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
version secondly the difference you're

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
version secondly the difference you're
gonna<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.170> an<00:01:46.470> increased<00:01:46.860> apply<00:01:47.189> account

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
gonna see is an increased apply account

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
gonna see is an increased apply account
now<00:01:47.759> obviously<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.390> console<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.170> maxes<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
now obviously on console it maxes out a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.520 
now obviously on console it maxes out a
24-month<00:01:50.610> servers<00:01:51.119> whereas<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.570> PC<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.170> maxes

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
24-month servers whereas on PC it maxes

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
24-month servers whereas on PC it maxes
out<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.680> 64<00:01:53.280> miles<00:01:53.549> over<00:01:53.850> C<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.390> an

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
out at 64 miles over C and I see an

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.410 
out at 64 miles over C and I see an
increase<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.020> team<00:01:55.530> size<00:01:55.770> from<00:01:55.979> 12<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.549> 32<00:01:56.729> at

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
increase of team size from 12 to 32 at

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
increase of team size from 12 to 32 at

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
obviously like I've already said which

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.560 
obviously like I've already said which
gives<00:02:21.460> you<00:02:21.550> an<00:02:21.640> increased<00:02:21.970> chance<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.330> getting

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
gives you an increased chance of getting

kills and double kills for your team now
if<00:02:24.430> you're<00:02:24.550> playing<00:02:24.700> scavenger<00:02:25.240> mode<00:02:25.390> with

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
if you're playing scavenger mode with

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.480 
if you're playing scavenger mode with
your<00:02:25.660> reduced<00:02:26.320> amount<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.680> hand<00:02:26.830> mode<00:02:26.950> getting

your reduced amount of hand mode getting

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.680 
your reduced amount of hand mode getting
double<00:02:27.700> kills<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.000> quite<00:02:28.180> important<00:02:28.600> because

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
double kills is quite important because

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.120 
double kills is quite important because
you<00:02:28.900> need<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.110> conserve<00:02:29.440> your<00:02:29.470> ammo<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:29.950> much

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
you need to conserve your ammo as much

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.550 
you need to conserve your ammo as much
as<00:02:30.310> possible<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.750> more<00:02:31.930> kills<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.350> get

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
as possible and the more kills you get

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.170 
as possible and the more kills you get
obviously<00:02:32.860> with<00:02:33.340> more<00:02:33.520> people<00:02:33.670> on<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:33.970> server

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
obviously with more people on the server

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.820 
obviously with more people on the server
the<00:02:34.570> higher<00:02:34.960> chance<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.440> is<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.710> you're

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the higher chance it is that you're

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.950 
the higher chance it is that you're
gonna<00:02:35.890> win<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> game<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.580> your<00:02:36.640> team<00:02:36.910> now<00:02:37.900> the

gonna win the game for your team now the

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.780 
gonna win the game for your team now the
higher<00:02:38.440> play<00:02:38.680> account<00:02:38.920> also<00:02:39.130> works<00:02:39.310> against

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
higher play account also works against

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.490 
higher play account also works against
you<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.210> the<00:02:40.480> fact<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.900> Maps<00:02:41.140> become

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
you in the fact that the Maps become

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.340 
you in the fact that the Maps become
very<00:02:41.740> crowded<00:02:42.370> now<00:02:42.820> obviously<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.960> know<00:02:44.110> that

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
very crowded now obviously we know that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.200 
very crowded now obviously we know that

quite annoying also if you're playing
scavenger<00:03:13.960> mode<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.230> weapon<00:03:14.650> pickups<00:03:14.830> have

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
scavenger mode the weapon pickups have

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.670 
scavenger mode the weapon pickups have
become<00:03:15.760> more<00:03:16.300> sparse<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.050> like<00:03:17.260> let's<00:03:17.560> say

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
become more sparse so like let's say

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.780 
become more sparse so like let's say
you're<00:03:17.800> running<00:03:17.920> towards<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.340> weapon<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.670> pick

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
you're running towards a weapon to pick

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.950 
you're running towards a weapon to pick
it<00:03:18.910> up<00:03:19.000> someone<00:03:19.330> might<00:03:19.450> get<00:03:19.600> there<00:03:19.750> just

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
it up someone might get there just

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.910 
it up someone might get there just
before<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.530> then<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.680> weapon

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
before you and then the weapon

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.160 
before you and then the weapon
disappears<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.940> there's<00:03:22.540> more<00:03:22.720> players<00:03:23.020> on

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
disappears so there's more players on

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.390 
disappears so there's more players on
the<00:03:23.200> map<00:03:23.440> which<00:03:23.560> gives<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:23.830> less<00:03:24.040> chance<00:03:24.280> of

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
the map which gives you less chance of

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.190 
the map which gives you less chance of
picking<00:03:24.550> up<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.940> new<00:03:25.060> weapon<00:03:25.450> which<00:03:25.900> means<00:03:26.140> you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
picking up a new weapon which means you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.930 
picking up a new weapon which means you
need<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.440> be<00:03:26.530> even<00:03:26.710> more<00:03:27.070> conservative<00:03:27.520> with

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
need to be even more conservative with

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.520 
need to be even more conservative with
your<00:03:27.970> ammo<00:03:28.390> than<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.690> normally<00:03:28.900> would<00:03:29.170> have

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
your ammo than you normally would have

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.230 
your ammo than you normally would have
to<00:03:29.710> be<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.670> means<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.060> probably

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
to be and it means that you probably

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.820 
to be and it means that you probably
won't<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.600> able<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.840> get<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> new<00:03:32.290> weapon<00:03:32.650> as

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
won't be able to get a new weapon as

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.780 
won't be able to get a new weapon as
quickly<00:03:33.220> which<00:03:33.340> means<00:03:33.550> you'll<00:03:33.640> have<00:03:33.730> to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
quickly which means you'll have to

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.520 
quickly which means you'll have to
resort<00:03:34.120> back<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.360> your<00:03:34.480> handgun<00:03:34.840> again<00:03:35.080> which

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
resort back to your handgun again which

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.620 
resort back to your handgun again which
is<00:03:35.680> fine<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.130> feel<00:03:36.280> good<00:03:36.400> with<00:03:36.580> a<00:03:36.610> handgun<00:03:37.030> but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
is fine you feel good with a handgun but

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.180 
is fine you feel good with a handgun but

if you like me who prefers like an

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.800 
if you like me who prefers like an
assault<00:03:39.700> rifle<00:03:39.730> or<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.180> fully<00:03:40.420> automatic

weapon<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.710> fire<00:03:41.920> people<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.690> little<00:03:43.900> bit

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
weapon to fire people it's a little bit

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.320 
weapon to fire people it's a little bit
more<00:03:44.140> difficult<00:03:44.680> just<00:03:45.610> another<00:03:45.850> quick<00:03:46.120> thing

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
more difficult just another quick thing

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.730 
more difficult just another quick thing
to<00:03:46.360> mention<00:03:46.630> about<00:03:46.870> another<00:03:47.230> difference<00:03:47.620> is

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
to mention about another difference is

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.800 
to mention about another difference is
that<00:03:47.800> PC<00:03:48.370> has<00:03:48.610> no<00:03:48.850> in-game<00:03:49.420> chat

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
that PC has no in-game chat

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.199 
that PC has no in-game chat
whereas<00:03:50.230> console<00:03:50.650> does<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:51.130> found<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.150> quite

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
whereas console does I found it quite

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.720 
whereas console does I found it quite
useful<00:03:52.480> on<00:03:52.930> ps3<00:03:53.260> where<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.980> players<00:03:54.490> would

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
useful on ps3 where and players would

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.100 
useful on ps3 where and players would
tell<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.030> where<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.300> enemies<00:03:55.600> happen<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> be

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
tell you where the enemies happen to be

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.199 
tell you where the enemies happen to be
or<00:03:56.590> as<00:03:56.740> on<00:03:56.860> PC<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.370> have<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.670> spend<00:03:57.910> your<00:03:58.060> time

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
or as on PC you have to spend your time

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.850 
or as on PC you have to spend your time
typing<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.780> out<00:03:58.840> in<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.230> in-game<00:03:59.350> chat<00:03:59.500> which

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
typing it out in the in-game chat which

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.320 
typing it out in the in-game chat which
can<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.130> quite<00:04:00.340> annoying<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.060> takes<00:04:01.240> a

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
can be quite annoying and it takes a

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.390 
can be quite annoying and it takes a
hell<00:04:01.450> of<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.630> long<00:04:01.750> time<00:04:01.959> by<00:04:02.470> which<00:04:02.650> time<00:04:02.920> the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
hell of a long time by which time the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.830 
hell of a long time by which time the
enemy<00:04:03.640> have<00:04:03.760> sort<00:04:03.970> of<00:04:04.000> moved<00:04:04.150> on<00:04:04.390> to<00:04:04.540> somewhere

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
enemy have sort of moved on to somewhere

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.390 
enemy have sort of moved on to somewhere
else<00:04:04.900> it's<00:04:05.260> not<00:04:05.380> really<00:04:05.620> as<00:04:05.709> relevant<00:04:06.070> so

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
else it's not really as relevant so

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.780 
else it's not really as relevant so
that's<00:04:06.550> probably<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.850> plus<00:04:07.090> for<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.390> consoles

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
that's probably a plus for the consoles

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.610 
that's probably a plus for the consoles
and<00:04:09.330> finally<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:09.900> just<00:04:09.930> gonna<00:04:10.170> talk<00:04:10.379> about<00:04:10.409> my

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
of a lot slower can I say PC or ps3 can

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.390 
of a lot slower can I say PC or ps3 can
remember<00:04:36.810> but<00:04:37.380> basically<00:04:37.680> on<00:04:37.830> ps3<00:04:38.100> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
remember but basically on ps3 the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.740 
remember but basically on ps3 the
gameplay<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.880> hell<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.210> lot<00:04:39.330> slower<00:04:39.539> and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
gameplay is a hell of a lot slower and

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.110 
gameplay is a hell of a lot slower and
on<00:04:39.900> PC<00:04:40.199> it's<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.380> lot<00:04:40.530> faster<00:04:41.190> and<00:04:41.490> that's

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
on PC it's a lot faster and that's

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.850 
on PC it's a lot faster and that's
probably<00:04:42.360> due<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.720> sensitivity<00:04:43.410> of<00:04:43.440> like

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
probably due to the sensitivity of like

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.200 
probably due to the sensitivity of like
the<00:04:44.070> way<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.250> can<00:04:44.520> move<00:04:44.669> your<00:04:44.850> character

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
the way you can move your character

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.080 
the way you can move your character
around<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> hell<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.139> lot<00:04:46.289> faster<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.910> I

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
around the hell of a lot faster and I

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.240 
around the hell of a lot faster and I
have<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.449> say<00:04:48.630> that<00:04:48.840> but<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.289> players<00:04:49.680> on<00:04:49.830> PC

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
have to say that but the players on PC

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.200 
have to say that but the players on PC
can<00:04:50.550> be<00:04:51.229> just<00:04:52.229> either<00:04:52.530> elite<00:04:53.280> or<00:04:53.520> complete

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
can be just either elite or complete

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.719 
can be just either elite or complete
noobs<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:55.199> but<00:04:55.500> whereas<00:04:55.800> on<00:04:55.889> ps3<00:04:56.190> you've<00:04:56.580> got

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
noobs so but whereas on ps3 you've got

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.210 
noobs so but whereas on ps3 you've got
kind<00:04:56.910> of<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.419> mix<00:04:58.110> or<00:04:58.380> in<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.800> middle<00:04:59.070> so

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
kind of like a mix or in the middle so

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.040 
kind of like a mix or in the middle so
you<00:04:59.250> kind<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.610> got<00:04:59.699> like<00:04:59.880> average<00:05:00.630> players

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
you kind of got like average players

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.390 
you kind of got like average players
averaging<00:05:01.260> two<00:05:01.590> really<00:05:01.889> good<00:05:02.039> players<00:05:02.310> but

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
averaging two really good players but

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.029 
averaging two really good players but
there<00:05:02.699> aren't<00:05:02.880> so<00:05:03.150> many<00:05:03.289> amazing<00:05:04.289> players<00:05:04.800> and

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
there aren't so many amazing players and

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.159 
there aren't so many amazing players and
so<00:05:05.160> many<00:05:05.370> shit<00:05:05.729> players<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.660> think<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.080> was

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
so many shit players so I think that was

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.540 
so many shit players so I think that was
a<00:05:07.199> really<00:05:07.380> good<00:05:07.530> experience<00:05:07.860> to<00:05:08.010> play<00:05:08.160> on<00:05:08.280> ps3

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
a really good experience to play on ps3

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.040 
a really good experience to play on ps3
and<00:05:08.699> I'm<00:05:08.970> probably<00:05:09.090> gonna<00:05:09.270> stick<00:05:09.570> with<00:05:09.720> it<00:05:09.870> so

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
and I'm probably gonna stick with it so

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.439 
and I'm probably gonna stick with it so
that<00:05:10.199> when<00:05:10.320> endgame<00:05:10.650> comes<00:05:10.919> out<00:05:11.130> I'll<00:05:12.060> be<00:05:12.120> able

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
that when endgame comes out I'll be able

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.490 
that when endgame comes out I'll be able
to<00:05:12.539> play<00:05:12.690> it<00:05:12.810> properly<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.199> get<00:05:13.289> some<00:05:13.380> really
