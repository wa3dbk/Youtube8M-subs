there<00:00:04.430> are<00:00:04.580> basically<00:00:05.029> two<00:00:05.540> ways<00:00:05.569> to<00:00:06.260> flutter

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
there are basically two ways to flutter

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.310 
there are basically two ways to flutter
tongue<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.370> first<00:00:07.670> way<00:00:08.000> is<00:00:08.240> to<00:00:08.780> roll<00:00:09.019> your

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
tongue the first way is to roll your

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.680 
tongue the first way is to roll your
tongue<00:00:09.349> as<00:00:09.860> if<00:00:10.250> you<00:00:10.550> are<00:00:10.820> rolling<00:00:11.059> and<00:00:11.510> are<00:00:13.690> so

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
tongue as if you are rolling and are so

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.650 
tongue as if you are rolling and are so
you<00:00:14.749> can<00:00:15.139> practice<00:00:15.530> it<00:00:15.650> by<00:00:15.799> saying<00:00:16.070> an<00:00:16.340> arm<00:00:16.660> as

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
you can practice it by saying an arm as

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.020 
you can practice it by saying an arm as
in<00:00:17.960> ruffles<00:00:18.860> have<00:00:19.310> ridges<00:00:21.100> and<00:00:22.100> then<00:00:22.400> you<00:00:22.820> can

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.030 
in ruffles have ridges and then you can

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.200 
in ruffles have ridges and then you can
practice<00:00:23.210> making<00:00:23.960> that<00:00:24.700> roll<00:00:25.700> with<00:00:26.030> your

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
practice making that roll with your

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.720 
practice making that roll with your
tongue<00:00:26.510> but<00:00:27.470> not<00:00:27.860> voicing<00:00:28.760> the<00:00:29.210> are<00:00:30.580> you<00:00:31.580> can

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
throat and this is similar to the kind

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.380 
throat and this is similar to the kind
of<00:01:08.600> art<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.049> would<00:01:09.409> use<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.950> French<00:01:13.360> it's<00:01:14.360> a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
of art you would use in French it's a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.910 
of art you would use in French it's a
little<00:01:14.630> harder<00:01:14.899> for<00:01:14.930> me<00:01:15.079> to<00:01:15.200> do<00:01:15.469> than<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
little harder for me to do than the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.880 
little harder for me to do than the
tongue<00:01:16.159> flutter<00:01:17.110> but<00:01:18.110> it's<00:01:18.320> good<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.590> practice

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
tongue flutter but it's good to practice

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.580 
tongue flutter but it's good to practice
it<00:01:19.250> with<00:01:19.280> French<00:01:20.060> words<00:01:20.450> that<00:01:20.780> start<00:01:21.079> with<00:01:21.140> are

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
it with French words that start with are

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.120 
it with French words that start with are

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
like clay bonus yawn

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.029 
like clay bonus yawn
let's<00:01:25.490> try<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.729> one<00:01:25.850> again<00:01:26.180> hi<00:01:26.840> Volusia<00:01:27.439> or

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
let's try that one again hi Volusia or

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.279 
let's try that one again hi Volusia or
perhaps<00:01:28.570> jean-pierre<00:01:29.920> Rampal<00:01:31.960> and<00:01:32.960> once<00:01:33.200> you

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
perhaps jean-pierre Rampal and once you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.980 
perhaps jean-pierre Rampal and once you
get<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.560> feeling<00:01:33.859> of<00:01:34.450> rolling<00:01:35.450> with<00:01:35.689> your

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
get the feeling of rolling with your

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.230 
get the feeling of rolling with your
throat<00:01:36.289> then<00:01:36.890> just<00:01:37.520> like<00:01:37.700> with<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.030> flutter

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
throat then just like with the flutter

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.980 
throat then just like with the flutter
tongue<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.430> unvoiced<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:41.000> are<00:01:41.149> so<00:01:41.659> you<00:01:41.750> just

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
tongue you unvoiced the are so you just

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.200 
tongue you unvoiced the are so you just
make<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.590> rolling<00:01:42.950> sound<00:01:43.250> without<00:01:43.670> your

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
make the rolling sound without your

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.840 
make the rolling sound without your
voice

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.780 

and<00:01:47.630> if<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.740> feel<00:01:49.070> like<00:01:49.280> you're<00:01:49.430> on<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.640> edge

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
and if you feel like you're on the edge

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.640 
and if you feel like you're on the edge
of<00:01:50.000> doing<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.570> can't<00:01:50.840> quite<00:01:51.170> get<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.530> a

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
of doing this but can't quite get it a

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.500 
of doing this but can't quite get it a
good<00:01:51.830> thing<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.340> think<00:01:52.460> of<00:01:52.700> sort<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:52.909> closing

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
good thing to think of sort of closing

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.340 
good thing to think of sort of closing
your<00:01:53.540> throat<00:01:53.870> just<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.470> little<00:01:54.770> bit<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:55.550> that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
your throat just a little bit so that

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.690 
your throat just a little bit so that
everything<00:01:57.350> can<00:01:57.380> vibrate<00:01:57.890> against<00:01:58.220> itself<00:01:58.550> in

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
everything can vibrate against itself in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.230 
everything can vibrate against itself in
there

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.910 

and<00:02:02.510> then<00:02:02.780> once<00:02:02.990> you've<00:02:03.140> got<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.530> feeling

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
and then once you've got that feeling

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.310 
and then once you've got that feeling
all<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.490> do<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.760> add<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.119> flute<00:02:05.330> finger<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.170> low

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
all you do is add the flute finger a low

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.900 
all you do is add the flute finger a low
note<00:02:06.500> roll<00:02:07.009> in<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.460> go<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:12.610> those<00:02:13.610> are

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
note roll in and go for it those are

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:23.330 
note roll in and go for it those are
your<00:02:14.060> two<00:02:14.300> types<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.990> flutters
