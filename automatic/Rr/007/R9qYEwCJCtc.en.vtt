actually<00:01:52.110> I'm<00:01:52.560> quite<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:53.130> quite<00:01:53.369> interested

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
actually I'm quite I'm quite interested

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.370 
actually I'm quite I'm quite interested
to<00:01:53.850> try<00:01:54.000> him<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:55.020> he'd<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.140> quite

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
to try him and I think he'd be quite

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.990 
to try him and I think he'd be quite
good<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> can't<00:01:56.280> imagine<00:01:56.340> him<00:01:56.610> being<00:01:56.670> like

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
good I can't imagine him being like

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.870 
good I can't imagine him being like
videl<00:01:57.990> very<00:01:58.320> fast<00:01:58.649> if<00:01:59.009> he's<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.310> strong<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.700> him

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
videl very fast if he's as strong as him

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.940 
videl very fast if he's as strong as him
then<00:02:00.180> he'll<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> very<00:02:01.439> very<00:02:01.590> good<00:02:01.710> player

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
then he'll be a very very good player

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.039
