00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.420 
does this team have a chance to be a
national<00:02:03.350> contender<00:02:03.740> I<00:02:03.950> don't<00:02:04.220> think<00:02:04.370> they

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
national contender I don't think they

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.220 
national contender I don't think they
have<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.580> chance<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.060> be<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.270> national<00:02:05.510> contender

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
have a chance to be a national contender

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.300 
have a chance to be a national contender
because<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.560> think<00:02:06.620> there's<00:02:06.920> too<00:02:07.160> many

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
because I think there's too many

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.820 
because I think there's too many
questions<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.270> morgantown<00:02:08.810> right<00:02:09.080> now<00:02:09.290> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
questions in morgantown right now it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.290 
questions in morgantown right now it
doesn't<00:02:10.040> have<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.220> do<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.550> much<00:02:10.700> with<00:02:10.850> losing

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
doesn't have to do so much with losing

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.060 
doesn't have to do so much with losing
rich<00:02:11.480> Rodriguez's<00:02:12.230> head<00:02:12.380> coach<00:02:12.620> but<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:12.890> think

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
rich Rodriguez's head coach but I think

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.980 
rich Rodriguez's head coach but I think
it<00:02:13.130> has<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.400> do<00:02:13.520> more<00:02:13.550> with<00:02:13.910> losing<00:02:14.360> players<00:02:14.690> on

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
it has to do more with losing players on

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.640 
it has to do more with losing players on
the<00:02:15.140> field

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
the field

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.220
