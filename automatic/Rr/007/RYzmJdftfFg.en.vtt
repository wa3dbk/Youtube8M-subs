00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.430
 came to you from the channel plus one 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.650
 video from my server which is minecraft 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.720
 games here you play several mini games 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.369
 great fun and to continue here 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.330
 our series showing the mind games 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.519
 server 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.859
 today I'm going to play the paint ball, which is a 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 of the youngest boys thrown in here and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.510
 a very fun game so let's go 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.050
 play I'm going to enter here in room 2 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.839
 I'm going to tell people here to get in 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.299
 room 2 to play and if nobody here 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.570
 it's a lot of time the guys play 30 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.670
 players at the same time which gives a game 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 closing game very very beast beast 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 and how does it work comb or 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.040
 maybe you never played in life 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.729
 but you may have already heard the 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.040
 respect 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.769
 Pit Bull is a shooting game in case he 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.809
 play with paint weapons so you do not hurt 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.729
 Everybody hurts, everybody hurts. 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 You know it hurts, it hurts purple. 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.470
 in the bush is at least what does not kill 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.810
 so that's the goal comb works 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.270
 Only here we used balls of snow. 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.259
 It's too much of the time It's really cool to play 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 so let's get the beauty started 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.109
 People here are on top of the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.299
 castle are several maps available 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.490
 here the guys play and I'm on the team 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.460
 blue as you can see from my 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.939
 armor then my goal and goal 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.070
 of my team is to kill the participants of the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.499
 team red the team who kill the other 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070
 time 100 times wins this is how 

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:40.259
 it works 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.100
 I want the government to get into my 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.640
 head 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.560
 oops I'll look at pirate ship because 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 I have a cover of the oua between a new 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.270
 dish and meto balance care channel 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 Beware when you kill someone you 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.990
 Hear a noise, then you can stay. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.450
 knowing if you killed do not beat saw 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.969
 so it works the team is winning 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.100
 it was time winning and this nobody 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.619
 here is very much time you start 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.229
 with some balls and when you kill 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.360
 someone else or you get 10 more 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.060
 helium and when your team kills someone 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.800
 all the participants of the team 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.240
 won a ball that for that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.880
 never ends in his balls and that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.120
 Encourage you is to kill every 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.390
 once more in Caracas I 'm already 6/0 face 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.459
 the egg that goes 7/0 that's how much base it is 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.250
 help the team face up 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.530
 Care careful the singer killed matei 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.830
 the knight who incidentally ended only in 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.110
 chats putz 10/0 ae mata mata is more 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.209
 a guy who will invade the vain invade the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.670
 field of them did not stay shift here looks 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.130
 only 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.860
 moyÃ¡ to follow you by surprise the boy 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.290
 Had a surprise, our bad tei died. 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.720
 that is, it maintains 13 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.239
 I sent 13 without dying it was serious that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.550
 did they can come in the top bar 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.640
 kills and deaths in the case of forest and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.709
 13 and again unfortunately happens 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.170
 face when everyone is playing 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.420
 same time type hallelujah stands 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.430
 too much of the time because you enter the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.090
 front of cars and you already die face is 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.100
 very much fun it was good to 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 people have no idea about the pentium more 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.050
 also produces mini games 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.690
 championships because those here wanting 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.060
 or is not a competitive game right in the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.310
 real life good comb is a game that is 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.959
 seen as I do not even know if officially 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.090
 but it is a game that is kind of seen with 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.459
 a sport because staff plays staff 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.860
 fights the championship guys train and 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.480
 I think it could be like this here too. 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.269
 It's not that I came to our server. 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.940
 So we're figuring out who we are. 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.040
 thinking about making and marking some 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.250
 tournaments a few championships where 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.590
 teams will be able to face certain 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.400
 the winner gets some very 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.799
 cool 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.720
 The Pope was and if it really works out 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.640
 rest assured that there will be many 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.739
 news about this including me obvious 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.299
 I want to set up a team and I'm going 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.459
 live it all over the 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.040
 you face will be very nice to them 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.810
 help this idea I thought that there 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.820
 I started with the server guys 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.549
 They liked the idea a lot and I 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.620
 they supported the run much 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.320
 With him he killed himself to hit but there is more 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.299
 our team is already with us. 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.979
 our team won the old guy killed 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.780
 today old singer 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.270
 we win when he reaches 100 points 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.550

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.060
