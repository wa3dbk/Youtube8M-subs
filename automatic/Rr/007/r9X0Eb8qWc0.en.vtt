all the way to back here the you can

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.830 
all the way to back here the you can
kind<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.890> double<00:02:26.220> strands<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.030> the

double knots matsuri

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.830 
double knots matsuri
or<00:02:30.120> larger<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:30.930> won't<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.769> bleaching<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.519> I

don't believe in bleaching bleaching

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.949 
don't believe in bleaching bleaching
does<00:02:35.760> weaken<00:02:36.359> the<00:02:36.510> knots<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.400> actually

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
does weaken the knots so it's actually

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.800 
does weaken the knots so it's actually
ventilated<00:02:39.959> without<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:41.129> part<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.450> see<00:02:42.629> if<00:02:42.720> I

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
ventilated without a part and see if I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.890 
ventilated without a part and see if I
can<00:02:42.989> comb<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:44.090> without<00:02:45.090> having<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.959> lift<00:02:46.799> up

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
can comb it without having it lift up

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.199 
can comb it without having it lift up
the<00:02:48.900> pattern<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:50.060> ventilated<00:02:51.060> it

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
the pattern that I ventilated it

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:58.729 
the pattern that I ventilated it
basically<00:02:51.780> was<00:02:52.169> I<00:02:56.540> wanted<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:57.989> no

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
basically was I wanted it to just no

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.369 
basically was I wanted it to just no
part<00:02:59.299> in<00:03:00.299> order<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.720> get<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> part<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.349> show

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
part in order to get the part to show

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.710 
part in order to get the part to show
you<00:03:01.620> actually<00:03:02.159> had<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.549> part<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.359> wet

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
you actually had to part it in and wet

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.899 
you actually had to part it in and wet
it<00:03:04.129> so<00:03:05.129> it<00:03:05.430> would<00:03:05.669> actually<00:03:07.280> part<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:08.730> now

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
it so it would actually part because now

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.379 
it so it would actually part because now
it's<00:03:09.120> kind<00:03:09.389> of<00:03:09.510> ventilated<00:03:10.760> too<00:03:11.760> it's

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
ventilated like at an angle and then I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.710 
ventilated like at an angle and then I
started<00:03:16.199> coming<00:03:17.040> around<00:03:17.159> this<00:03:17.699> way<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.479> as<00:03:18.599> you

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
ventilated in one direction

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.490 
ventilated in one direction
and<00:04:21.340> that's<00:04:22.240> the<00:04:22.390> only<00:04:22.660> direction<00:04:22.810> that<00:04:23.260> it's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
and that's the only direction that it's

I<00:07:17.710> took<00:07:18.490> the<00:07:18.819> hook<00:07:18.970> off<00:07:19.240> and<00:07:19.870> I<00:07:21.300> put<00:07:22.300> velcro<00:07:23.970> so

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:24.970 
I took the hook off and I put velcro so

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:35.010 
I took the hook off and I put velcro so
because<00:07:25.509> it's<00:07:25.870> not<00:07:26.020> um<00:07:30.659> okay<00:07:31.659> Erica<00:07:33.509> so<00:07:34.509> I<00:07:34.539> got

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.020 
because it's not um okay Erica so I got

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.020 
because it's not um okay Erica so I got
this<00:07:35.139> idea<00:07:35.379> from<00:07:35.770> the<00:07:35.979> Wendy<00:07:36.190> Williams<00:07:36.340> wigs

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
this idea from the Wendy Williams wigs

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.899 
this idea from the Wendy Williams wigs
that<00:07:37.270> I<00:07:37.300> read<00:07:37.599> you<00:07:37.840> this<00:07:38.620> is<00:07:38.830> awful<00:07:39.340> because<00:07:39.669> it

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:39.909 
that I read you this is awful because it

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:44.339 
that I read you this is awful because it
gets<00:07:40.090> all<00:07:40.389> stuck<00:07:41.550> to<00:07:42.550> the<00:07:42.699> hair<00:07:43.319> so<00:07:44.319> you

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349 
gets all stuck to the hair so you

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:46.499 
gets all stuck to the hair so you
actually<00:07:44.620> have<00:07:45.009> to<00:07:45.159> velcro<00:07:45.699> it<00:07:45.880> probably

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:46.509 
actually have to velcro it probably

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:51.210 
actually have to velcro it probably
before<00:07:46.690> you<00:07:46.960> put<00:07:47.199> it<00:07:47.319> on<00:07:49.020> so<00:07:50.020> it's<00:07:50.710> just<00:07:50.889> a<00:07:51.009> lot

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:51.220 
before you put it on so it's just a lot

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.510 
before you put it on so it's just a lot
easier<00:07:51.430> to<00:07:52.360> deal<00:07:52.539> with<00:07:52.599> them<00:07:53.050> snaps<00:07:53.470> it<00:07:54.039> really

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 
easier to deal with them snaps it really

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.700 
easier to deal with them snaps it really
is<00:07:54.729> it<00:07:55.090> just<00:07:55.300> looks<00:07:55.509> like<00:07:55.599> it's<00:07:55.930> complicated

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:56.710 
is it just looks like it's complicated

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.680 
is it just looks like it's complicated
because<00:07:56.800> they<00:07:57.099> I'm<00:07:57.370> just<00:07:57.880> taking<00:07:58.180> it<00:07:58.300> off<00:07:58.449> and

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:58.690 
because they I'm just taking it off and

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:04.140 
because they I'm just taking it off and
the<00:07:58.750> hair<00:07:58.990> is<00:07:59.020> all<00:07:59.259> tangled<00:08:00.930> okay<00:08:01.930> so<00:08:03.150> there
