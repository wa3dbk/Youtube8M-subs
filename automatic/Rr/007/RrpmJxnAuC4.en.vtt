00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.889 
because there's no like getting trapped
in<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.720> corner<00:01:45.899> forever<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> beat

on Ryan yeah successful yeah another you
know<00:01:52.890> large<00:01:53.610> addition<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> game<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.570> an

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
know large addition to the game or an

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
know large addition to the game or an
important<00:01:54.960> addition<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> meters<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
important addition are the meters that

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
important addition are the meters that
you<00:01:56.310> see<00:01:56.490> up<00:01:56.520> next<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> our<00:01:57.060> health<00:01:57.210> bars<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.570> I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you see up next to our health bars so I

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.420 
you see up next to our health bars so I
was<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.890> critical

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
was a little bit about the critical

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.569 
was a little bit about the critical
critical<00:01:59.820> gauge<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.840> that's<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.590> two<00:02:02.310> bar

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
critical gauge yeah so that's a two bar

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
critical gauge yeah so that's a two bar
maximum<00:02:03.180> meter<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.840> basically<00:02:04.140> acts<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
maximum meter that basically acts like a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
maximum meter that basically acts like a
super<00:02:04.920> meter<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> can<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> bust<00:02:06.329> up

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
super meter so you can use it to bust up

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.559 
super meter so you can use it to bust up
really<00:02:07.290> nice<00:02:07.530> attacks<00:02:07.920> once<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.700> demonstrate

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
really nice attacks once you demonstrate

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.780 
really nice attacks once you demonstrate
like<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:09.989> there

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
like right there

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.229 
like right there
yeah<00:02:13.189> so<00:02:14.189> every<00:02:14.340> character<00:02:14.849> gets<00:02:14.969> their<00:02:15.209> own

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
yeah so every character gets their own

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.509 
yeah so every character gets their own
animation<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.439> super<00:02:16.980> sweet<00:02:17.219> attack

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
animation of like a super sweet attack

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.420 
animation of like a super sweet attack
it's<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:17.879> very<00:02:18.060> cinematic<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.620> does<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.859> real

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
it's a very cinematic and it does a real

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.490 
it's a very cinematic and it does a real
nice<00:02:20.760> chunk<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.329> damage<00:02:21.689> as<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.260> see

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
nice chunk of damage as you can see

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.809 
nice chunk of damage as you can see
they're<00:02:22.709> right<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.280> typically<00:02:23.609> they

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
they're right and typically they

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.220 
they're right and typically they
wouldn't<00:02:24.090> be<00:02:24.180> full<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.900> all<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> time

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
wouldn't be full like this all the time

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.809 
wouldn't be full like this all the time
we<00:02:25.560> just<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.859> it<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.069> training<00:02:26.430> mode<00:02:26.459> so

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
we just have it in training mode so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.599 
we just have it in training mode so
everything's<00:02:27.269> in<00:02:27.420> forever<00:02:27.989> oh<00:02:28.260> no<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:29.010> finally

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
everything's in forever oh no I finally

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.280 
everything's in forever oh no I finally
I<00:02:29.640> finally<00:02:30.150> managed<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> missed

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
I finally managed to do it and I missed

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.559 
I finally managed to do it and I missed
oh<00:02:31.579> well<00:02:32.579> that's<00:02:32.700> okay<00:02:32.939> we're<00:02:33.120> used<00:02:33.299> to<00:02:33.359> being

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
oh well that's okay we're used to being

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.929 
oh well that's okay we're used to being
a<00:02:33.659> failure<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.140> anyways<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> tell<00:02:35.909> us

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
a failure so anyways can you tell us

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.699 
a failure so anyways can you tell us
about<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.239> level<00:02:36.420> 5<00:02:36.689> so<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.319> can<00:02:37.439> also<00:02:37.560> use

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
about the level 5 so you can also use

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.819 
about the level 5 so you can also use
half<00:02:38.129> of<00:02:38.459> a<00:02:38.730> meter<00:02:39.389> to<00:02:39.629> do<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.139> brave<00:02:40.560> edge

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
half of a meter to do the brave edge

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.160 
half of a meter to do the brave edge
which<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.909> where<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.120> power<00:02:42.420> up<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.810> normal

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
which is where you power up a normal

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.929 
which is where you power up a normal
attack<00:02:43.439> gotcha<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.220> sort<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.579> an<00:02:44.700> e<00:02:44.790> ex

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
attack gotcha so sort of like an e ex

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.899 
attack gotcha so sort of like an e ex
move<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.450> street<00:02:45.689> fighter<00:02:45.870> exactly<00:02:46.500> and

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
move in in street fighter exactly and

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.940 
move in in street fighter exactly and
using<00:02:47.909> those<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.269> combos<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:49.079> be<00:02:49.260> insanely

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
using those in combos can be insanely

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.970 
using those in combos can be insanely
damaging<00:02:50.689> right<00:02:51.689> on<00:02:51.840> yeah<00:02:52.109> it<00:02:52.439> Ryan<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:52.950> I

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
knew a little bit more about the game we

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:55.460 
knew a little bit more about the game we
won't<00:02:54.419> have<00:02:54.569> been<00:02:54.659> playing<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.079> Tuesday<00:02:55.409> so

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
that's forgivable any other uses for the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.020 
that's forgivable any other uses for the
critical<00:02:59.970> gauge<00:03:00.120> yeah<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.109> can<00:03:01.319> also<00:03:01.439> do<00:03:01.680> a

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
critical gauge yeah you can also do a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.720 
critical gauge yeah you can also do a
just<00:03:03.030> guard<00:03:03.450> using<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.169> quarter<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.129> a<00:03:05.519> gauge

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
just guard using a quarter of a gauge

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.750 
just guard using a quarter of a gauge
okay<00:03:06.389> and<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:07.019> that's<00:03:07.889> like<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.069> perry<00:03:08.489> and

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
okay and that that's like a perry and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.089 
okay and that that's like a perry and
street<00:03:09.209> fighter<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:10.079> basically<00:03:10.379> block<00:03:10.799> as

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
street fighter you basically block as

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
games what is frame advantage so that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.960 
games what is frame advantage so that
means<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.659> whoever<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.409> attacked<00:03:22.829> you<00:03:23.040> you

them back because they'll be in an
animation<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.129> you<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.639> just<00:03:29.819> go<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.120> town<00:03:30.389> on

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
animation and you can just go to town on

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.879 
animation and you can just go to town on
it<00:03:30.720> would<00:03:30.900> have<00:03:31.019> knowledge<00:03:31.290> punishing<00:03:31.739> them

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
it would have knowledge punishing them

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.250 
it would have knowledge punishing them
for<00:03:32.209> exactly<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.599> kind<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.959> punish

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
for exactly it's kind of like a punish

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.839 
for exactly it's kind of like a punish
right<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.799> high<00:03:34.979> it's<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.459> high-risk

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
right so high it's a high-risk

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.140 
right so high it's a high-risk
high-reward<00:03:36.359> block<00:03:37.250> so<00:03:38.250> any<00:03:38.430> other<00:03:38.639> new

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
high-reward block so any other new

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.869 
high-reward block so any other new
mechanics<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.659> haven't<00:03:39.840> covered<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.169> far

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
mechanics that we haven't covered so far

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.309 
mechanics that we haven't covered so far
no<00:03:41.879> I<00:03:41.909> think<00:03:42.180> that's<00:03:42.359> think<00:03:42.479> that's<00:03:42.810> most<00:03:43.079> of

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
no I think that's think that's most of

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.520 
no I think that's think that's most of
them<00:03:43.470> all<00:03:43.739> right<00:03:43.949> what<00:03:44.220> all<00:03:44.579> these<00:03:44.790> come<00:03:45.120> on

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
them all right what all these come on

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.920 
them all right what all these come on
