the<00:02:52.080> critical<00:02:52.410> question<00:02:53.100> there<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:54.600> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
the critical question there is not to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.920 
the critical question there is not to
cost<00:02:55.140> this<00:02:55.440> as<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> water-saving<00:02:56.550> problem<00:02:57.420> but

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
cost this as a water-saving problem but

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.040 
cost this as a water-saving problem but
to<00:02:58.080> cost<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.560> as<00:02:58.830> an<00:02:59.190> opportunity<00:02:59.459> to<00:03:00.180> invest

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
to cost it as an opportunity to invest

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.920 
to cost it as an opportunity to invest
in<00:03:01.520> equipping<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:03.090> irrigation<00:03:03.780> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
in the productivity game so that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.770 
in the productivity game so that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
and you'll say if Australia does that
