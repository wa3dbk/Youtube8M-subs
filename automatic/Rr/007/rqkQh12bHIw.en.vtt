much<00:01:33.190> inspiration<00:01:33.430> just<00:01:33.940> from<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.450> venue

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
much inspiration just from the venue

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.020 
much inspiration just from the venue
that<00:01:35.020> we<00:01:35.979> saw<00:01:36.130> photos<00:01:36.399> we<00:01:36.759> were<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:36.909> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that we saw photos we were on the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.999 
that we saw photos we were on the
venue's<00:01:37.360> website<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:38.259> we<00:01:38.350> saw<00:01:38.470> these<00:01:38.619> floors

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
venue's website and we saw these floors

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.420 
venue's website and we saw these floors
and<00:01:39.250> we<00:01:39.310> all<00:01:39.430> kind<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.729> went<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:41.340> sort<00:01:42.340> of

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
and we all kind of went this sort of

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.719 
and we all kind of went this sort of
gray<00:01:42.909> very<00:01:43.630> industrial<00:01:44.619> it's<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.920> has<00:01:45.310> speaks

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
gray very industrial it's it has speaks

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.310 
gray very industrial it's it has speaks
so<00:01:45.910> much<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.300> in<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.509> original<00:01:46.660> use<00:01:47.050> of<00:01:47.200> this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
so much to in the original use of this

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.600 
so much to in the original use of this
building<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.070> was<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> huge

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
building that that was a huge

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.460 
building that that was a huge
inspiration<00:01:48.789> I<00:01:49.330> think<00:01:49.570> not<00:01:50.080> only<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
inspiration I think not only in the

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.050 
inspiration I think not only in the
color<00:01:50.679> palette<00:01:50.920> but<00:01:51.159> then<00:01:51.310> in<00:01:51.460> things<00:01:51.970> like

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
color palette but then in things like

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.550 
color palette but then in things like
type<00:01:52.360> treatment<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.929> we<00:01:53.020> wanted<00:01:53.259> things<00:01:53.470> to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
type treatment that we wanted things to

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.620 
type treatment that we wanted things to
be<00:01:53.679> sort<00:01:54.610> of<00:01:54.640> industrial<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.270> have<00:01:55.450> some

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
be sort of industrial and have some

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.320 
be sort of industrial and have some
architecture<00:01:56.320> and<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:56.710> use<00:01:57.179> touches<00:01:58.179> of

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
architecture and then use touches of

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.389 
architecture and then use touches of
romance<00:01:58.720> to<00:01:59.050> sort<00:01:59.289> of<00:01:59.380> personalized<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.250> but

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
romance to sort of personalized it but

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.930 
romance to sort of personalized it but
we<00:02:00.520> really<00:02:00.880> loved<00:02:01.179> this<00:02:01.750> place<00:02:02.050> Hey<00:02:02.800> oh<00:02:03.460> look
