little saws at you which is terrible and
deadly<00:02:28.460> also<00:02:29.460> key<00:02:29.760> differences<00:02:30.270> playing<00:02:30.540> as

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
deadly also key differences playing as

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.720 
deadly also key differences playing as
doubt<00:02:30.930> his<00:02:31.650> blink<00:02:32.010> ability<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.460> different

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
doubt his blink ability is different

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.840 
doubt his blink ability is different
than<00:02:32.820> corvo's<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:33.740> when<00:02:34.740> you<00:02:35.040> pull<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
than corvo's so when you pull the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.060 
than corvo's so when you pull the
trigger<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.240> blink<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:37.110> stop<00:02:37.530> time<00:02:37.740> and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
trigger to blink you can stop time and

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.280 
trigger to blink you can stop time and
then<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.700> can<00:02:38.910> aim<00:02:39.210> wherever<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.020> want<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> go

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
then you can aim wherever you want to go

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.470 
then you can aim wherever you want to go
so<00:02:41.070> if<00:02:41.130> you're<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> Ledge<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.270> want<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
so if you're at a Ledge and you want to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.010 
so if you're at a Ledge and you want to
get<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> higher<00:02:42.930> ledge<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.620> jump<00:02:43.920> out

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
get to a higher ledge you can jump out

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.570 
get to a higher ledge you can jump out
activate<00:02:46.020> blink<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:46.860> turn<00:02:47.160> around<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
activate blink and then turn around and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.100 
activate blink and then turn around and
blink<00:02:47.880> back<00:02:48.150> up<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.720> makes<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:48.960> some

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
blink back up and so it makes for some

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.830 
blink back up and so it makes for some
pretty<00:02:49.140> cool<00:02:49.820> locomotive<00:02:50.820> twists<00:02:51.450> for

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
pretty cool locomotive twists for

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390 
pretty cool locomotive twists for
playing<00:02:52.380> as<00:02:52.530> down<00:02:52.680> makes<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.040> feel<00:02:53.190> different

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
playing as down makes it feel different

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.570 
playing as down makes it feel different
and<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:53.970> pretty<00:02:54.660> awesome<00:02:54.720> um<00:02:55.260> I'm<00:02:56.250> real
