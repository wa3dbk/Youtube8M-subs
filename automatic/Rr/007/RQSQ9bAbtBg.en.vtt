00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
different events for example you want to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.950 
different events for example you want to
get<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> presentation<00:01:45.659> room

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
get into a presentation room

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.410 
get into a presentation room
for<00:01:47.260> a<00:01:47.290> boardroom<00:01:47.620> you<00:01:48.580> could<00:01:48.760> set<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.060> off<00:01:49.180> so

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
for a boardroom you could set it off so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.390 
for a boardroom you could set it off so
that<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.660> lights<00:01:49.840> dim<00:01:50.110> down<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.950> set<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.310> off

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
that the lights dim down you set it off

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.250 
that the lights dim down you set it off
so<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.670> lights<00:01:51.880> turn<00:01:52.060> back<00:01:52.210> up<00:01:52.390> again

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
so the lights turn back up again

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.080 
so the lights turn back up again
you<00:01:53.590> have<00:01:53.710> architectural<00:01:54.310> controls<00:01:54.730> a

professional side what I'm about to tell
you<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.720> is<00:02:43.750> basically<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.470> very<00:02:44.500> simple

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
you it is basically a very simple

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.180 
you it is basically a very simple
demonstration<00:02:46.500> where<00:02:47.500> we

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.550 

I<00:02:52.370> returned<00:02:53.060> all<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.240> lights<00:02:53.540> off<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:54.410> our

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
I returned all the lights off with our

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.670 
I returned all the lights off with our
mall<00:02:54.800> controls

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.399 

I<00:02:58.390> have<00:02:59.390> different<00:02:59.720> scenes<00:02:59.989> program

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
I have different scenes program

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.679 
I have different scenes program
categories<00:03:01.010> if<00:03:01.159> you<00:03:01.250> turn<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.549> lights<00:03:01.730> off

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:13.720 

turn<00:03:05.689> off<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.049> LEDs<00:03:11.620> to<00:03:12.620> LED<00:03:13.069> fixtures<00:03:13.459> turn

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
turn off the LEDs to LED fixtures turn

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.970 
turn off the LEDs to LED fixtures turn
it<00:03:13.849> back<00:03:14.030> on<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:15.319> all<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.560> this<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.829> pretty

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
it back on so all of this is pretty

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.050 
it back on so all of this is pretty
easily<00:03:16.430> programmable<00:03:16.849> just<00:03:17.329> using<00:03:18.879> what<00:03:19.879> we

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
easily programmable just using what we

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.960 
easily programmable just using what we
see<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.980> definitely<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.010> tremendous<00:03:22.579> growth<00:03:22.790> in

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970
