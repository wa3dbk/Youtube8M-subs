00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.880
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.110
 another minecraft 1.8 tutorial and in 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 this video will give you the new one 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.380
 imagine world generator 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.229
 because now you can with the generated 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.390
 now consciously make very epic apps eg 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.789
 this fantasy landscape or too 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.680
 huge mountains you can whole region 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.270
 allow the water level to dry out 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.280
 influence that eg in this world the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.080
 It's normal if I'm a regulator 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.820
 then turn that in the other world 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.689
 Water will be in the interior or even 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.460
 is not there anymore 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.409
 You can also see the whole several 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.149
 replace with lava or completely 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.830
 create closed worlds like that 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.240
 whole works that shows in this 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.750
 tutorial and I wish you much now 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.340
 fun 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.720
 First, we have to create a new world 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.789
 We just give up for that 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.430
 create single player and new world 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.220
 and we just call the world 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.200
 world set the credit mode with it 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.670
 want to be able to fly rom and then have to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.459
 We click on more world options 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.870
 a team we have to open a world 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.670
 adjust and then we can 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 Customize here and here we have it all 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.569
 many regulators but many pages 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.650
 can take and I will 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.250
 the most important things of it 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.080
 demonstrate 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.609
 with the first we can regulate the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.049
 sea ​​level height that is to say 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.350
 if we can change that here we can 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.750
 the sea level either at height 178 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.269
 make it or go down that very far 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.799
 the euro for 22 is so real 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.290
 create cool worlds like for example 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.519
 here I have a world with me 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.230
 made three different attitude 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.299
 and once the water level is complete 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.739
 away then there is a bit and how it is 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.730
 would actually look normal 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.109
 I think that looks pretty 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.780
 Impressive and with it you can 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.760
 then you can do really cool things 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.470
 Set here if filling is allowed 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.970
 or on fortresses 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.920
 These are the things that were going on 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.170
 Escape then if villages are regulated 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.000
 whether the shafts are to be generated 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.280
 should give stamp in the jungle 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.470
 Should this new stamp several 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.150
 should give then give information 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.160
 and if they left these, then 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.549
 eschborn spaces so give dungeons 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.769
 should 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.329
 and if so, how often will the subway become 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.889
 seven is the standard though 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.269
 we want to have quite a few now 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.739
 we simply screw it all the way up 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.200
 and then it gets pretty in the world 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 much borner give us when the longing 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.359
 We can annoy in minecraft simply 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.859
 turn off 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.910
 but if we have a lot of them 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.010
 we just need to do that 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.930
 Probably turn it down 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.230
 means the lower this number is here 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.909
 the more often you would see now 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.950
 this whole landscape here completely 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.319
 be flooded because many see it 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.909
 There's no wanting to do that 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.620
 either at 9 or if we are quite a few 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.080
 Just want to have that percentage 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.760
 put it high on this here 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.080
 see also with the lover because the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.690
 It does not happen that often because of that 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.890
 this number can put on 80 then 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.959
 you also adjust that whole 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.400
 ocean not of water but of lava 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.769
 I should also have something for that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.690
 prepared as for example with this paper 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.160
 I have them once with water and one 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.620
 with lava and I think that looks too 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.390
 quite cool out with this regulator here 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.010
 we can adjust which flowers is 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.919
 Everything should be so when we go to 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.150
 example only want to have the desert 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.079
 we only hire for that reason 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.340
 or we will for example only 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.510
 want to have any high mountains 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.669
 because we have this regulator 1 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.860
 the whole thing is very handy if you eg 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.780
 wanted to do tutorials and for that 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.190
 Certain biom needs because there is one 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.510
 then you can just do creature sport 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.510
 that we for example the 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.720
 marsh and spontaneously immediately 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.880
 in a swamp you can stop 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.410
 how big the biome should be here 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.229
 he now stood wise at four 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.419
 because we want that every five days 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.130
 somehow there is a new bio more 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.840
 then that's correct to 1 and if we 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.550
 we want to have huge flowers 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.780
 the simple subordinate to eight 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.490
 how likely is it to set 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.470
 that you meet rivers when we do that 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.210
 to adjust then there are now and then 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.130
 sometimes a river changes scenery and if 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.380
 we put that on five then gives a lot 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.970
 many rivers in the countryside then 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.380
 let's go to the next page and there 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.419
 we can adjust how big the 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.669
 Whole veins should be when we go to 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.770
 For example, you want to have a lot of iron ore 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.770
 then we put the vein size on whole 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.450
 big and then you find underground 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.490
 a huge bigger that is one 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.800
 but not four but suddenly 50 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.240
 but blocks enter contains 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.889
 set from where to where you found 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:30.479
 should be for example of 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.979
 level 14 to 35 are found and it 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.599
 should be tried many times this too 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.580
 So that means that almost 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.830
 Iron ore veins are the whole thing 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.039
 adjust salary for gold and redstone 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.389
 also pretty cool for diamonds 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.410
 setting options the next 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.940
 page is actually really just what 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.310
 for professionals and you can see here already 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.020
 that in the six pack the signs 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.680
 they all overlap and so go 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.150
 I go here because there you can 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.070
 whole thing individually without regulator 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.840
 hire and if you have any 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.580
 would want to create useful maps 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.539
 I do not recommend these values ​​too blatantly 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.360
 to use 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.889
 with the scaling main function iks 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.240
 can you adjust how long the dragged 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.970
 meant to be mountains that means if I were 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.070
 here this rule but completely down 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.900
 turn then you can now see that 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.910
 These mountains are cut in slices 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.479
 look and if you look at it very high 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.729
 then they turn a little wider 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.620
 whole can then be synonymous with y and z 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.699
 make all these things are 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.139
 actually so important because that 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.570
 actually the map just a little dirty 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.310
 What a cool thing is the base height 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.900
 this one can be here for example too 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.400
 set it down if you go to the bottom 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.840
 is then the still mountains 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.490
 bigger because they have more space now 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.960
 have it up or we'll do it 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.070
 At the top are the very small ones 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.880
 because not so much space after 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.310
 is up 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.770
 normally it is 85 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.720
 if we go down this one now 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.699
 This corresponds to eight blocks in the 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.259
 Minecraft reality if you can do that 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.520
 exaggerates not quite quirky 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.530
 things like this one 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.270
 will the village be in the middle of the water and 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.150
 on huge stilts stands thus 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.199
 you should be a little careful 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.760
 with the high current one can 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:58.389
 adjust how knitted the mountains be 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.610
 should 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.289
 if I now under rates on all 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.610
 then you can see the huge one here 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.419
 landscapes with huge mountains 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.919
 arise 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.020
 and since it is just with this lever 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.820
 A conclusion and was here 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.770
 show this lever here and that is 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.680
 that the weighting of the biofactors 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.300
 that means how strong the influence of 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.659
 to enter a bio into the landscape 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.760
 should 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.320
 For example, a snow mountain is organic 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.630
 known that it has high mountains 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.030
 if we fix this little bit high 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.430
 then put all this factor mountains 

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:30.070
 a pretty big one and thus become 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.300
 we can create huge mountains 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.919
 but also a fun the whole 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.960
 generate random values ​​and then stand 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:36.340
 also quite bizarre maps or us 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.169
 just use the templates that we have 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.639
 minecraft commands and then we can 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:42.130
 For example, a water world 

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:43.300
 I create or land such an island 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.039
 he wanted to say if you are such 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.139
 Giant maps created that then we 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.000
 Minecraft must allocate more gigabytes 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:50.949
 how that works I have in this 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.270
 video shown now finds below 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.280
 linked on the left or in the video 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.789
 description I thank you for 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.690
 watch 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:57.690
 Until next time
