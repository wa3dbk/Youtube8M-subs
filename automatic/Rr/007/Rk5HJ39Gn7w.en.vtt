was<00:00:19.949> bad<00:00:20.359> so<00:00:21.359> we're<00:00:21.510> gonna<00:00:21.600> run<00:00:21.869> through<00:00:22.080> tests

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
was bad so we're gonna run through tests

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.259 
was bad so we're gonna run through tests
so<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.189> exactly<00:00:23.340> what's<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:23.970> on

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
so you can see exactly what's going on

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
so you can see exactly what's going on
we're<00:00:24.480> gonna<00:00:24.600> do<00:00:24.840> I'll<00:00:24.990> do<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> startup

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we're gonna do I'll do a startup

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.060 
we're gonna do I'll do a startup
sequence<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:27.240> I'll<00:00:28.019> put<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.410> two

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
sequence and then I'll put in two

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.550 
sequence and then I'll put in two
hundred<00:00:29.369> megahertz<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.240> then<00:00:30.449> three<00:00:31.140> gig<00:00:31.380> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
hundred megahertz and then three gig and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
hundred megahertz and then three gig and
then<00:00:31.650> five<00:00:31.949> gig<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.430> be<00:00:32.550> able<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.630> exactly

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
then five gig to be able to see exactly

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:45.000 
then five gig to be able to see exactly
what's<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.500> on

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:02:03.020 

so<00:00:45.610> here's<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.940> startup<00:00:46.300> sequence

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 

if<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.720> notice<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.200> right-hand<00:02:04.650> corner

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
if you notice in the right-hand corner

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
if you notice in the right-hand corner
it's<00:02:05.340> listed<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.030> error<00:02:06.740> 301<00:02:08.810> frequency<00:02:09.810> I'm

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
it's listed with error 301 frequency I'm

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.450 
it's listed with error 301 frequency I'm
sorry<00:02:10.590> air<00:02:10.710> 301<00:02:11.340> yto<00:02:11.970> unlock<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.780> air

sorry air 301 yto unlock and air
three-one-seven<00:02:14.490> frequency<00:02:15.240> ACC<00:02:16.050> which<00:02:16.290> I'm

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
three-one-seven frequency ACC which I'm

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
three-one-seven frequency ACC which I'm
assuming<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.950> acquisition<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.240> now<00:02:18.360> I'm<00:02:18.450> going

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
assuming is acquisition so now I'm going

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.949 
assuming is acquisition so now I'm going
to<00:02:18.690> punch<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.140> frequency<00:02:20.100> 200<00:02:21.030> megahertz<00:02:21.390> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
to punch in frequency 200 megahertz and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.840 
to punch in frequency 200 megahertz and
a<00:02:22.650> span<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:24.080> ten<00:02:25.080> megahertz<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.070> then<00:02:26.730> I'm

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
a span of ten megahertz and then I'm

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.730 
a span of ten megahertz and then I'm
gonna<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.690> signal<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.140> I'll<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.410> putting

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
gonna the signal that I'll be putting

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:39.820 
gonna the signal that I'll be putting
into<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.130> will<00:02:29.280> be<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.810> 200<00:02:30.810> megahertz<00:02:31.080> signal

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.040 

so<00:02:40.370> that's<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.640> 200<00:02:41.120> megahertz<00:02:41.390> signal<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.840> my

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
so that's a 200 megahertz signal so my

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.810 
so that's a 200 megahertz signal so my
center<00:02:45.380> frequency<00:02:45.920> 200<00:02:46.640> megahertz<00:02:47.320> 200

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
center frequency 200 megahertz 200

00:02:48.820 --> 00:03:07.420 
center frequency 200 megahertz 200
megahertz

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.979 

and<00:03:07.970> there<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.150> have<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.360> hundred<00:03:08.659> megahertz<00:03:09.110> pan

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
and there I have a hundred megahertz pan

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.770 
and there I have a hundred megahertz pan
and<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.400> can<00:03:13.549> see<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.879> signal<00:03:14.329> bounces

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
and so you can see the signal bounces

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.220 
and so you can see the signal bounces
back<00:03:15.019> and<00:03:15.230> forth<00:03:16.060> 0db<00:03:17.060> my<00:03:17.420> reference<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.200> zero

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
back and forth 0db my reference is zero

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.949 
back and forth 0db my reference is zero
DB<00:03:18.980> my<00:03:19.189> reference<00:03:19.640> level<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.180> have<00:03:20.329> zero<00:03:20.599> DB

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
DB my reference level and I have zero DB

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.949 
DB my reference level and I have zero DB
going<00:03:21.290> into<00:03:21.590> it<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.099> is<00:03:22.549> reading<00:03:23.030> full

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
going into it so it is reading full

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.250 
going into it so it is reading full
scale<00:03:24.349> or<00:03:24.560> a<00:03:24.590> little<00:03:24.859> above<00:03:25.099> full<00:03:25.430> scale<00:03:26.260> 100

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
scale or a little above full scale 100

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.460 
scale or a little above full scale 100
megahertz<00:03:27.590> per<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:29.150> 100<00:03:29.480> megahertz<00:03:29.689> pan<00:03:30.140> and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
megahertz per the 100 megahertz pan and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.710 
megahertz per the 100 megahertz pan and
it's<00:03:30.620> jumping<00:03:31.010> one<00:03:31.489> division<00:03:31.879> to<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.450> right

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
it's jumping one division to the right

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.140 
it's jumping one division to the right
and<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.989> the<00:03:33.049> left<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.640> now<00:03:34.670> I'm<00:03:34.849> going<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.030> go

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
and to the left so now I'm going to go

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.660 
and to the left so now I'm going to go
up<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.450> 3<00:03:36.079> gig<00:03:36.379> I'm<00:03:36.680> gonna<00:03:36.829> change<00:03:37.129> my<00:03:37.189> input

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
up to 3 gig I'm gonna change my input

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.809 
up to 3 gig I'm gonna change my input
signal<00:03:37.939> to<00:03:38.239> 3

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:59.350 

so<00:03:46.450> Center<00:03:46.780> frequency<00:03:47.319> I'm<00:03:47.500> typing<00:03:47.860> in<00:03:48.010> 3<00:03:48.280> gig

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.830 

and<00:03:59.900> the<00:03:59.990> same<00:04:00.200> errors<00:04:00.590> occur<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.540> 3:17<00:04:02.540> error

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
and the same errors occur the 3:17 error

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.250 
and the same errors occur the 3:17 error
3:17<00:04:03.770> which<00:04:04.700> is<00:04:04.850> frequency<00:04:05.270> acquisition<00:04:06.050> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
3:17 which is frequency acquisition and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.990 
3:17 which is frequency acquisition and
air<00:04:06.470> 301<00:04:07.330> which<00:04:08.330> is<00:04:08.510> yto<00:04:08.930> unlocked<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:10.610> now

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
air 301 which is yto unlocked and now

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:28.589 
air 301 which is yto unlocked and now
I'll<00:04:11.300> go<00:04:11.450> up<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.810> 18<00:04:12.440> gig

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.609 

so<00:04:29.199> similar<00:04:29.649> results<00:04:30.099> is<00:04:30.249> as<00:04:30.399> low<00:04:30.729> down<00:04:30.779> as<00:04:31.779> the

00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:32.619 
so similar results is as low down as the

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:38.450 
so similar results is as low down as the
lower<00:04:32.770> frequencies

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.900 

we<00:04:39.150> hope<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.600> helps
