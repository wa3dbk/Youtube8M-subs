00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
something completely new with a load of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.560 
something completely new with a load of
other<00:01:08.220> people<00:01:08.549> their<00:01:08.670> own<00:01:08.700> age<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
other people their own age it's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
other people their own age it's
petrifying<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.290> can't<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.560> nervous<00:01:10.770> but<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
petrifying you can't be nervous but so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.859 
petrifying you can't be nervous but so
is<00:01:11.729> everyone<00:01:12.000> else<00:01:12.119> that's<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> whole<00:01:12.659> point

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
is everyone else that's the whole point

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.690 
is everyone else that's the whole point
and<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.439> being<00:01:13.770> nervous<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.340> part<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and I think being nervous is part of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.890 
and I think being nervous is part of
what<00:01:14.850> drives<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.509> more<00:01:15.720> friends

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
what drives you can make more friends

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
what drives you can make more friends
and<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.530> more<00:01:16.680> things<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.250> only<00:01:17.430> guy<00:01:17.549> who

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
and to do more things the only guy who

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
and to do more things the only guy who
won't<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.090> nervous<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> guy<00:01:19.110> who

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
won't be nervous will be the guy who

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630 
won't be nervous will be the guy who
ends<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.740> no<00:01:19.950> friend<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.340> you'll<00:01:20.490> know
