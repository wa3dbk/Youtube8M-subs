00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.839 
gets pretty good so I had my eye on it
for<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.190> while<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.730> saw<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.509> forecast<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.849> just

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
for a while I saw the forecast and just

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.550 
for a while I saw the forecast and just
sort<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> said<00:00:15.240> hey<00:00:15.389> look<00:00:15.599> go<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.020> play<00:00:16.320> now

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
sort of said hey look go and play now

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.040 
sort of said hey look go and play now
and<00:00:17.090> yeah<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.119> got<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> message<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.750> Ryan

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
and yeah I got a message from Ryan

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.599 
and yeah I got a message from Ryan
saying<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.770> looking<00:00:20.039> pretty<00:00:20.160> good

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
saying is looking pretty good

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640 
saying is looking pretty good
so<00:00:20.789> thought<00:00:21.390> we'd<00:00:21.510> give<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.320> how

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
so thought we'd give it a go and see how

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.599 
so thought we'd give it a go and see how
it<00:00:22.740> went<00:00:23.689> it's<00:00:24.689> like<00:00:24.869> two<00:00:25.160> cameras<00:00:26.160> with<00:00:26.369> over

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
it went it's like two cameras with over

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.730 
it went it's like two cameras with over
there<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.060> press<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:28.050> decided<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.680> would

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
there and press and we decided it would

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.229 
there and press and we decided it would
be<00:00:28.800> worth<00:00:29.550> coming<00:00:29.849> over<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.810> West<00:00:30.990> base

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
be worth coming over to the West base

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.060 
be worth coming over to the West base
like<00:00:33.239> Rick<00:00:33.780> realistically<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.770> probably

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
like Rick realistically it's probably

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.709 
like Rick realistically it's probably
like<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.219> most<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> most<00:00:36.480> perfect

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
like the most one of the most perfect

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.959 
like the most one of the most perfect
waves<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.770> kite<00:00:38.010> surfing<00:00:38.040> because<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> wind

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
waves for kite surfing because the wind

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.900 
waves for kite surfing because the wind
is<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.870> perfect<00:00:40.140> direction<00:00:40.910> like

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
is like the perfect direction like

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.680 
is like the perfect direction like
you're<00:00:42.480> out<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.950> ocean<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.879> near<00:00:45.390> your

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
you're out in the ocean not near your

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.510 
you're out in the ocean not near your
you<00:00:45.930> sort<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> near<00:00:46.620> rocks<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> mean<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you sort of near rocks but I mean you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.090 
you sort of near rocks but I mean you
know<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:48.450> lists<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.960> safe<00:00:49.379> sort<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> distance

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
know it lists a safe sort of distance

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
know it lists a safe sort of distance
away<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.320> time<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
away and you have all the time in the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
away and you have all the time in the
world<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> try<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:53.940> line<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
world really to try and line it up and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
world really to try and line it up and
get<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.140> spot<00:00:55.500> get<00:00:56.340> barreled<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
get in the right spot get barreled and

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.130 
get in the right spot get barreled and
get<00:00:57.239> barreled<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.660> come<00:00:57.840> straight<00:00:58.079> back

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
get barreled in you come straight back

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.119 
get barreled in you come straight back
out<00:00:58.410> again

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.190 

when<00:01:04.699> we<00:01:04.850> first<00:01:05.089> looked<00:01:05.300> at<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.480> it<00:01:05.810> was<00:01:05.900> living

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
when we first looked at it it was living

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.320 
when we first looked at it it was living
all<00:01:06.320> right<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.740> was<00:01:06.890> big<00:01:07.100> inconsistent<00:01:07.940> there

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
all right it was big inconsistent there

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.880 
all right it was big inconsistent there
was<00:01:08.420> definitely<00:01:08.810> definitely<00:01:09.229> some<00:01:09.530> good<00:01:09.680> ones

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
was definitely definitely some good ones

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.380 
was definitely definitely some good ones
and<00:01:10.190> so<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.640> thought<00:01:10.760> we'd<00:01:10.970> hit<00:01:11.090> it

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
and so we thought we'd hit it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.000 
and so we thought we'd hit it
the<00:01:11.510> wind<00:01:11.690> was<00:01:11.870> wind<00:01:12.350> was<00:01:12.470> filling<00:01:12.710> in<00:01:12.800> pretty

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
the wind was wind was filling in pretty

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.860 
the wind was wind was filling in pretty
good<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.370> it<00:01:13.430> got<00:01:13.760> pretty<00:01:14.120> windy<00:01:14.390> pretty<00:01:14.600> fast

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
good and it got pretty windy pretty fast

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.270 
good and it got pretty windy pretty fast
so<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:16.100> got<00:01:16.220> out<00:01:16.370> there<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.820> had<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.330> go<00:01:17.600> oh<00:01:18.280> I

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
so we got out there and had a go oh I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.560 
so we got out there and had a go oh I
guess<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:19.790> kind<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:19.970> went<00:01:20.090> all<00:01:20.180> right<00:01:20.330> for<00:01:20.540> a

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
guess it kind of went all right for a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.100 
guess it kind of went all right for a
bit<00:01:20.720> we<00:01:20.840> got<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.020> few<00:01:21.260> waves<00:01:21.440> and<00:01:21.770> then<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:23.110> guess

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
bit we got a few waves and then I guess

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.050 
bit we got a few waves and then I guess
I<00:01:24.259> was<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.410> first<00:01:24.650> one<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.190> just<00:01:25.670> sort<00:01:25.790> of<00:01:25.850> drop

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
I was the first one to just sort of drop

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.130 
I was the first one to just sort of drop
my<00:01:26.180> kite<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.540> go<00:01:26.630> over<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:26.869> falls<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:29.140> from

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
my kite and go over the falls and from

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.260 
my kite and go over the falls and from
then<00:01:30.320> on<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.740> got<00:01:30.890> worse

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.570 

I'm<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> piece

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:02:01.490 

why

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:10.620 

is<00:02:01.620> goes<00:02:02.070> mess
