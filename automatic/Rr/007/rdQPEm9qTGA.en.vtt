00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.180
 around the video material at all 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.820
 to be able to edit your videos 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.180
 of the camcorder on the pc dubbed 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.349
 become 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.810
 and there are different ones 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.360
 options depending on what a 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.310
 camcorder insert them 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.910
 apparently with a possibility if 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.830
 she an 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.230
 dv camcorder or have a 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.870
 hd-camcorder he still up 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.440
 recording tapes makes the topic on 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.400
 that will become such a tape drive 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.589
 the connection to the pc via firewire 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.449
 I made it in again 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.430
 and that works over one 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.299
 firewire cable that has on one 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 side a little wider ending and up 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:59.680
 the other side a little narrower 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.890
 ending the narrower part now comes in 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.950
 the dv camcorder or hdv camcorder the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.260
 Technology is the same and the other 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.100
 end comes in the firewire entrance of the 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.869
 pcs usually features renewal pc 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.640
 about such a celebration alone 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.619
 you do not have to worry about that 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.689
 otherwise there are such inputs too 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.890
 in the form of on cards you then 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.890
 can build in the pc 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.570
 more modern camcorder draws the picture 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.540
 on so-called sd cards 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.540
 but this I fold out here we 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.110
 are then such little cards and the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.250
 just be plugged in here and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.369
 then the video material 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.619
 recorded the dubbing on the pc 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.990
 is relatively easy to do so 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.540
 camcorder via usb with the computer 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.700
 connect is a lot easier but that 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.910
 whole about such an adapter 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.470
 this is a normal usb plug 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.400
 and here at the end you can get a SD card 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.010
 insert 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.679
 the whole is then synonymous with the pc 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.119
 connected 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.530
 and the video material then gets like that 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.750
 the pc gets a bit more complicated 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.760
 whole if you have an analog camcorder 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.459
 The two models are here 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.859
 digital camcorders and the understand 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.780
 Great with the pc because the pc just 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.909
 also a digital medium is one 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.980
 analog camcorder is not 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.400
 digital as the name says and then must 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.799
 the video signals are converted 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.170
 analog on digital for that you need 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.139
 a converter that can be an example 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.859
 tv card be if the vaccination pc 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.290
 is installed 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.209
 then this tv card usually has 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.959
 via an input via an analogue 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.400
 input if you have no card then 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.629
 you can do it all over an external 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.700
 to solve the device 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.889
 I've got a model like that too 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.060
 magix which are basically so ne 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:03.669
 small usb box is here at the end of a 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.510
 USB plug which is connected to the pc 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:10.480
 connected and on the other side 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.970
 do you have the video input called that 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.299
 is then usually a yellow here 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.959
 plug in his yellow socket via cinch and 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:23.409
 then there are two more jacks for 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.209
 the audio signal such a third book 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.590
 is available if you have a video 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.479
 camcorder or have a sv sc kamprad 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.530
 those were so higher quality models then 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:35.729
 the whole thing is about a s video 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.349
 connected 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.479
 out of the camcorder goes out the whole 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:43.389
 with certain cables then 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.159
 according to the jacks a yellow and 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.840
 a red and a white plug 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:50.680
 if you have the whole of one 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.329
 VCR need to play over 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.109
 are there special cable solutions? 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.540
 VCR usually has one 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:01.060
 skat 1 or exit 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.189
 and there is such a state here 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:10.290
 plug the end of a cinch again 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:14.440
 Connection has made that time off 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.290
 yellow white and red 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:24.000
 and the whole thing comes in the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:28.090
 video shot card yellow white and red 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.560
 that comes then as said in the pc and 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.980
 that comes in the video recorder and 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.260
 this is the connection and magix 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.830
 can read the video signal from 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.970
 these devices from this converter 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.730
 There are analogue digital hikers 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.530
 different versions if you 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.020
 maybe watch TV at the same time 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.580
 want to look at the pc then there is here 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.430
 so possibilities this is called the 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.050
 eyetv hybrid and with that you can 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.780
 Watching TV, too, that one such a 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.100
 antenna at the end and the 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.860
 side effect is if they are one 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.100
 Pay attention to the fact that the 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:06.400
 card has analog inputs that is then 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.360
 Here's a little plug and then 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:14.320
 is usually already supplied with cable 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.750
 this connects you with ca and then 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.610
 are there again the just mentioned 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.290
 inputs available and then you can 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.510
 the whole synonymous with the video recorder per 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.270
 scart connect and then poses so 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.770
 connection is therefore both tv card 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.169
 do you have the advantage you can too 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.720
 Watching TV and old analogue videos 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.610
 dub or they take a pure 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.950
 device because you can not watch TV 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.430
 but watch the dubbing works 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.430
 with it too
