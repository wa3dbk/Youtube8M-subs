on kind of pipe line welding out outside
welding<00:00:32.189> I've<00:00:32.850> had<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> couple<00:00:33.210> projects

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
welding I've had a couple projects

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.700 
welding I've had a couple projects
lately<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.590> were<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:34.829> outside<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.710> just

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
lately that were all outside and just

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.170 
lately that were all outside and just
the<00:00:37.800> way<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> light<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.489> there<00:00:38.879> was<00:00:39.000> light

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the way the light was there was light

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180 
the way the light was there was light
coming<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.690> behind<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.200> hood<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.980> made<00:00:41.100> it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
coming in behind my hood and it made it

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.530 
coming in behind my hood and it made it
really<00:00:41.370> hard<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> see<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.270> really

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
really hard to see and was really

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.119 
really hard to see and was really
frustrating<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.590> decided<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> know

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
frustrating so I just decided you know

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.229 
frustrating so I just decided you know
I'm<00:00:44.219> gonna<00:00:44.309> bite<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> bullet<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> pick<00:00:45.090> up

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I'm gonna bite the bullet and pick up

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.040 
I'm gonna bite the bullet and pick up
one<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> these<00:00:45.570> they're<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
one of these they're not all that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.330 
one of these they're not all that
expensive<00:00:46.440> they're<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:46.920> 70<00:00:47.340> bucks<00:00:49.340> they're

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
expensive they're about 70 bucks they're

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.299 
expensive they're about 70 bucks they're
basically<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.820> made<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.180> balsa<00:00:51.449> and

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
basically just made out of balsa and

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.860 
basically just made out of balsa and
like<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.489> fiber<00:00:53.730> metal<00:00:54.120> stuff<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.600> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
like this fiber metal stuff here so I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.119 
like this fiber metal stuff here so I
suppose<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.590> probably<00:00:55.710> build<00:00:55.980> one

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
suppose you could probably build one

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
suppose you could probably build one
pretty<00:00:56.370> easy<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.239> didn't<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.870> feel

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
pretty easy I just didn't really feel

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.010 
pretty easy I just didn't really feel
like<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.800> know<00:00:58.890> trying<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> track<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.399> some

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
like you know trying to track down some

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.270 
like you know trying to track down some
fiber<00:01:01.020> metal<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:01.680> anybody's<00:01:02.100> interested

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
fiber metal but if anybody's interested

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
fiber metal but if anybody's interested
I'm<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.059> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> halfway<00:01:03.629> noodling

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
I'm actually kind of halfway noodling

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
I'm actually kind of halfway noodling
with<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> notion<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> tracking<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.000> some<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
with the notion of tracking down some of

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
with the notion of tracking down some of
this<00:01:06.479> blue<00:01:07.470> stuff<00:01:08.130> here<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.610> yeah<00:01:08.880> that's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this blue stuff here and yeah that's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.890 
this blue stuff here and yeah that's
that<00:01:09.240> annoying<00:01:09.659> LG<00:01:10.409> washer<00:01:10.970> anyway<00:01:11.970> yeah<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that annoying LG washer anyway yeah so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.640 
that annoying LG washer anyway yeah so
I'm<00:01:13.200> thinking<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.479> kind<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> seein

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
I'm thinking of a you know kind of seein

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.840 
I'm thinking of a you know kind of seein
if<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:16.920> track<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.310> some<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> fiber

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
if I could track down some of the fiber

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.850 
if I could track down some of the fiber
bevel<00:01:18.210> stuff<00:01:18.420> cut<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> parts<00:01:19.080> on<00:01:19.259> my<00:01:19.380> CNC

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
bevel stuff cut out the parts on my CNC

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.649 
bevel stuff cut out the parts on my CNC
and<00:01:19.890> build<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.759> couple<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.060> these<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.479> I'll

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659

there I think was 12 bucks for shipping

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770 
there I think was 12 bucks for shipping
and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> was<00:01:43.350> 68<00:01:43.740> bucks<00:01:44.100> for<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.689> for<00:01:45.689> the
