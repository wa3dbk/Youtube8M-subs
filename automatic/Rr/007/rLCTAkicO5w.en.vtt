00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.790
 eae the g2 okay 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.379
 This is a type of video I do not usually 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.719
 do a lot here on this channel 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.040
 But I'm going to need to do good now. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.230
 first person 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.660
 Merry Christmas, Happy New Year to everyone. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.880
 you so that in the future you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.250
 watched and the channel is already coming 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 now on the day nearly 50 thousand mark 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.500
 mosquitoes expensive but many are enrolled 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.150
 personal or so I feel I must 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.840
 tell you what's happening 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.720
 now 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
 Good Christmas is coming and I'm not going 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 stay at home or I will not have to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.320
 hiring more mothers does not mean 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 I'm going to stop posting video, not me. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 I did several videos 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.360
 in advance beauty and I will 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.739
 program and following during this time 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.030
 You're traveling because I'm not going to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 eat a certain job right then a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 Anything is I can not keep 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.670
 that scheme that was making a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.879
 snack manta minecraft one day and the sims 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.190
 3 other day because I'm a little 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.020
 2003 much more than minecraft then 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.290
 during that time you will have more videos 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.860
 minecraft yes and exclusively from the series 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.689
 the minecraft commodity in 1,485 other 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 thing i know harry potter was 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.030
 updated is 1.4 1.6 but I'm not going 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 to leave 1.445 for now because 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.070
 There's why I left you just for three 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.060
 hit the red power we have many 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.580
 other modes 14.5 and unicredit 11,468 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.070
 red bull and a few more some 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.990
 few, in fact, then we will have the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.159
 molds leave the bother pec too 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.210
 because I want to maintain compatibility 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.880
 with him 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.860
 so when they leave it all leave 4.4 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.150
 with you and we are going to leave for a 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 point and 6 we will not start a new 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.460
 series, we're going to continue like this 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 upgrade the series by 4 5 to the one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.390
 point to happen then you will have this 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.640
 change yes but we will not 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.790
 will not have this update we will not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.009
 start from scratch beauty beauty 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.619
 Another thing is I opened a poll in the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.930
 facebook to know if you guys are 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 whether or not you like the songs if you have 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.560
 any suggestion open to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.530
 new options then you can put the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.300
 option there and even if you 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.960
 place now will have many more votes 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.640
 others 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.800
 but if you now put the option to 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.290
 listen to the option analyst job understood 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.240
 just being on the list is already going to be a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.340
 way you talk to me man does not do 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.350
 so does like that and a lot of people 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.330
 I agreed from the moment you 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.890
 put things are getting so I 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.020
 see that not this guy here 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.770
 this option is a good option despite 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.430
 have these 200,200 options above also 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.810
 not if you have lots of options full of 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.460
 photos on top I realize that you 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.220
 He puts it there at that time then 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.770
 I'll get it here is proportional to the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.820
 time to see that you have placed the 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:49.230
 vote you received 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.720
 and it's these people so now I'm going to put 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.940
 another manifest video maybe not today 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.640
 What I'm going to do this video is 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.750
 I want to see the recording on the 22nd. 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.730
 put today 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.370
 maybe I can not put it on today 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.310
 because because you could not edit yesterday 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.860
 in time the video of today is then possible 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.840
 Who only has tomorrow tonight? 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.820
 beauty because it is the time of the club for 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.730
 but I ended up typing this now 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.250
 video and compile the time of the pillow 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.700
 It takes ten hours without 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.560
 10 hours shipping then if you put 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:30.840
 here seven o'clock will leave the 7 -2 will leave 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.450
 if you 're 45 hours highlighting at 15 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.080
 hours or is it late? 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.810
 to get ready beauty and this is it I hope 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.300
 that you have an understanding of the news by 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.790
 What are you doing to leave you? 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.920
 reported today not to be high 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.110
 for example inspired her in the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.450
 I do not know how long it will take 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.550
 but have been waiting a long time since 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.010
 2003 is no longer 20 days stressed 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.720
 Come back from the trip, I'm going 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.210

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.450
