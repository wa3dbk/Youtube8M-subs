00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.920 
and this and you get a gravity staff
like<00:02:13.080> by<00:02:13.530> itself<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> doesn't<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.370> anything

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
make this pattern I guess and get a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.680 
make this pattern I guess and get a
gravity<00:02:48.870> director<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.240> gravity

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
gravity director so if this gravity

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.270 
gravity director so if this gravity
director<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.140> place<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.590> let's<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.160> outside

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
director you place it let's go outside

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.490 
director you place it let's go outside
for<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:55.350> place<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.740> down<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:57.470> when<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
for this you place it down and when you

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.560 
for this you place it down and when you
step<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.340> does<00:02:59.490> nothing<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.240> when<00:03:00.480> you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
step in it it does nothing but when you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.050 
step in it it does nothing but when you
right<00:03:00.810> click<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.410> gravity<00:03:01.950> wait<00:03:02.670> yeah

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
right click with the gravity wait yeah

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.480 
right click with the gravity wait yeah
the<00:03:03.240> gravity<00:03:03.600> staff<00:03:03.980> changes<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.100> direction

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
the gravity staff changes the direction

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.230 
the gravity staff changes the direction
of<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.640> gravity

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
of the gravity

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.210 
of the gravity
you<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.780> wherever<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:07.410> moving<00:03:07.830> is<00:03:07.980> wherever

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you see wherever it's moving is wherever

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.830 
you see wherever it's moving is wherever
the<00:03:08.400> graph<00:03:08.580> wherever<00:03:09.060> you're<00:03:09.180> gonna<00:03:09.270> fall<00:03:09.570> to

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the graph wherever you're gonna fall to

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.590 
the graph wherever you're gonna fall to
so<00:03:10.140> see<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:11.550> light<00:03:11.760> on<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> tree<00:03:12.240> and<00:03:12.450> I

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
so see and I light on the tree and I

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.000 
so see and I light on the tree and I
have<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.290> try<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.709> back<00:03:15.260> and<00:03:16.260> there<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.770> go

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
have to try to get back and there we go

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.870 
have to try to get back and there we go
hop<00:03:19.400> see<00:03:21.320> almost<00:03:22.320> there<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.580> we'll

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
hop see almost there and we'll

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.640 
hop see almost there and we'll
right-click<00:03:24.120> this<00:03:24.450> again<00:03:24.750> let's<00:03:25.470> get

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
right-click this again let's get

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.610 
right-click this again let's get
ourselves<00:03:25.770> right<00:03:26.190> side<00:03:26.670> up<00:03:26.850> again<00:03:26.970> huh<00:03:27.540> oh<00:03:27.930> no

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.080 
ourselves right side up again huh oh no
I<00:03:28.920> wouldn't<00:03:29.459> upside<00:03:29.820> down<00:03:30.030> crap<00:03:31.760> that's<00:03:32.760> not

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
I wouldn't upside down crap that's not

oh my gravity runes there we go all is
well<00:03:42.739> and<00:03:43.739> now<00:03:43.860> we're<00:03:44.010> gonna<00:03:44.100> die<00:03:45.620> wait

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
well and now we're gonna die wait

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.930 
well and now we're gonna die wait
where's<00:03:46.800> the<00:03:46.980> floor<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:49.070> just<00:03:50.070> died<00:03:50.310> this<00:03:50.370> day

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
died but uh you know I'm curious why

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.270 
died but uh you know I'm curious why
that<00:04:07.320> recipe<00:04:07.709> didn't<00:04:08.250> work<00:04:08.489> let's<00:04:08.850> take<00:04:09.540> these

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
that recipe didn't work let's take these

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.080 
that recipe didn't work let's take these
it's<00:04:11.280> weird

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
it's weird

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.789 
it's weird
oh<00:04:12.620> no<00:04:13.620> oh<00:04:14.480> there<00:04:15.480> we<00:04:15.630> go<00:04:15.690> take<00:04:16.410> those<00:04:16.530> out<00:04:16.709> of

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
oh no oh there we go take those out of

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.310 
oh no oh there we go take those out of
my<00:04:16.890> hand

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
my hand

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.450 
my hand
take<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.410> gravity<00:04:19.799> of<00:04:19.859> your<00:04:19.890> own<00:04:20.160> it

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
take the gravity of your own it

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.240 
take the gravity of your own it
shouldn't<00:04:21.270> it<00:04:21.450> said<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.229> was<00:04:22.320> like

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
shouldn't it said it was like

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.990 
shouldn't it said it was like
that<00:04:25.280> there<00:04:26.280> it<00:04:26.430> is

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
that there it is

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.080 
that there it is
you<00:04:27.600> got<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.840> gravity<00:04:28.260> regulator<00:04:28.850> take<00:04:29.850> this

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
you got the gravity regulator take this

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.960 
you got the gravity regulator take this
and<00:04:30.600> I'll<00:04:30.930> grab<00:04:31.140> my<00:04:31.170> spare<00:04:31.830> wand<00:04:32.280> out<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.580> here

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
and I'll grab my spare wand out of here

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.340 
and I'll grab my spare wand out of here
and<00:04:34.700> you<00:04:35.700> see<00:04:35.880> jumping<00:04:36.690> right<00:04:36.780> now<00:04:36.930> right

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
and you see jumping right now right

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.340 
and you see jumping right now right
click<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.570> nothing's<00:04:39.570> happening<00:04:40.110> oh

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
click it and nothing's happening oh

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.040 
click it and nothing's happening oh
there<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.630> yeah

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
there it is yeah

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.280 
there it is yeah
yeah<00:04:44.040> there<00:04:44.400> we<00:04:44.580> go<00:04:45.120> wondering<00:04:45.870> why<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.080> wasn't

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
yeah there we go wondering why it wasn't

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.850 
yeah there we go wondering why it wasn't
working

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
working

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.060 
working
so<00:04:47.430> changing<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.660> color<00:04:49.110> by<00:04:49.590> right-clicking

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
so changing this color by right-clicking

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.150 
so changing this color by right-clicking
it<00:04:50.340> with<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.700> staff<00:04:51.260> like<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:52.560> you<00:04:52.650> can<00:04:52.800> jump

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
it with the staff like so you can jump

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.820 
it with the staff like so you can jump
higher<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:53.730> fall<00:04:54.450> slower<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:55.530> affects

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
higher and fall slower it affects

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.130 
higher and fall slower it affects
gravity<00:04:56.340> in<00:04:56.490> general<00:04:56.940> so<00:04:57.180> let's<00:04:57.450> walk<00:04:57.900> outside

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
gravity in general so let's walk outside

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.510 
gravity in general so let's walk outside
whoo<00:04:59.070> look<00:04:59.940> at<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:03.919> jump<00:05:04.919> on<00:05:05.070> top<00:05:05.250> of<00:05:05.310> my

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
whoo look at that jump on top of my

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.860 
whoo look at that jump on top of my
house<00:05:05.760> that's<00:05:06.300> cool<00:05:06.720> that's<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.620> back<00:05:07.800> down

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
house that's cool that's the back down

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.710 
house that's cool that's the back down
right<00:05:09.870> look<00:05:10.020> it<00:05:10.140> again<00:05:10.350> we<00:05:10.740> got<00:05:10.890> red<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.720> I'm

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
right look it again we got red and I'm

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:20.150 
right look it again we got red and I'm
oh<00:05:13.230> wait<00:05:14.930> what's<00:05:15.930> up<00:05:17.870> sorry<00:05:18.870> ok<00:05:19.860> so<00:05:19.919> you<00:05:20.070> have

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
oh wait what's up sorry ok so you have

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.590 
oh wait what's up sorry ok so you have
to<00:05:20.250> walk<00:05:20.400> through<00:05:20.669> it<00:05:20.790> to<00:05:20.910> activate<00:05:21.330> it<00:05:21.510> and

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
to walk through it to activate it and

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.600 
to walk through it to activate it and
