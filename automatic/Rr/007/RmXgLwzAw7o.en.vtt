the different models of the CTS the CTS
is<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.150> expanding<00:01:36.780> its<00:01:36.900> lineup

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
is is going to be expanding its lineup

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.680 
is is going to be expanding its lineup
rather<00:01:37.770> dramatically<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.360> sedan

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
rather dramatically we have a sedan

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.810 
rather dramatically we have a sedan
we've<00:01:40.320> always<00:01:40.530> had<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.800> sedan<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.610> will

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
we've always had a sedan but we will

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.750 
we've always had a sedan but we will
soon<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.300> coupe<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> wagon<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.760> so

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
soon have a coupe and a wagon and so

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.580 
soon have a coupe and a wagon and so
those<00:01:44.910> wheels<00:01:45.150> might<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.140> might<00:01:46.260> see<00:01:46.470> those

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.420 
when it comes to market we're still
working<00:02:00.300> working<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.290> those<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.860> doing<00:02:02.399> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
working working out those and doing a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.770 
working working out those and doing a
little<00:02:02.580> armwrestling<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.390> engineers

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
little armwrestling with the engineers

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.510 
little armwrestling with the engineers
the<00:02:04.350> engineers<00:02:04.770> were<00:02:04.950> always<00:02:05.100> worried<00:02:05.460> about

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the engineers were always worried about

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180 
the engineers were always worried about
the<00:02:05.910> loading<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.500> body<00:02:07.680> structure

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the loading of the the body structure

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.199 
the loading of the the body structure
and<00:02:08.660> so<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.170> know<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> they<00:02:11.370> tend<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> want<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
and so you know the they tend to want to

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.270 
and so you know the they tend to want to
kind<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.200> want<00:02:13.320> to<00:02:13.380> reduce<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> size<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.190> the

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
kind of want to reduce the size of the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.699 
kind of want to reduce the size of the
wheel<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.700> reduce<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> unsprung<00:02:15.780> mass<00:02:15.840> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
wheel to reduce the unsprung mass the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.280 
wheel to reduce the unsprung mass the
hood<00:02:17.520> as<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:18.120> stands<00:02:18.360> right<00:02:18.570> now<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:19.080> not

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
hood as it stands right now is not

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.880 
hood as it stands right now is not
functional<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.600> we<00:02:22.050> will<00:02:22.320> we're<00:02:22.770> going

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
functional but but we will we're going

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.890 
functional but but we will we're going
to<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.070> giving<00:02:23.459> some<00:02:23.640> consideration<00:02:24.270> when<00:02:24.780> we

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
to be giving some consideration when we

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.150 
to be giving some consideration when we
bring<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.260> production<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.860> make<00:02:25.980> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
bring that to production to make that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.190 
bring that to production to make that
functional<00:02:26.660> one<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.810> things<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.140> we

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
functional one of the things that we

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.930 
functional one of the things that we
pride<00:02:28.440> ourselves<00:02:28.560> on<00:02:28.920> at<00:02:29.100> Cadillac<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.700> that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
pride ourselves on at Cadillac is that

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.320 
pride ourselves on at Cadillac is that
if<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.930> something<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.730> idea<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.120> that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
if you see something the idea is that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.750 
if you see something the idea is that
it's<00:02:33.510> real<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.290> functional<00:02:34.760> especially

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
it's real and it's functional especially

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.240 
it's real and it's functional especially
if<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.360> V<00:02:36.540> Series<00:02:36.920> there's<00:02:37.920> nothing

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
if it's on a V Series there's nothing

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.009 
if it's on a V Series there's nothing
not<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.549> that's<00:02:38.880> that's<00:02:39.330> not<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:39.989> a
