00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
without an application like the file

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.530 
without an application like the file
explorer<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.369> lot<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> times<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> removing

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
explorer and a lot of times the removing

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.069 
explorer and a lot of times the removing
system<00:01:48.869> applications<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.729> messy<00:01:51.079> but

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
system applications can get messy but

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.810 
system applications can get messy but
this<00:01:52.259> makes<00:01:52.560> everything<00:01:52.860> nice<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.220> easy<00:01:53.640> so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
this makes everything nice and easy so

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.120 
this makes everything nice and easy so
we'll<00:01:53.939> go<00:01:54.000> ahead<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.149> click<00:01:54.360> Save<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
we'll go ahead and click Save and it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.530 
we'll go ahead and click Save and it
will<00:01:56.219> go<00:01:56.310> ahead<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.520> hide<00:01:56.759> those<00:01:57.000> apps<00:01:57.299> will

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
will go ahead and hide those apps will

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.160 
will go ahead and hide those apps will
grant<00:01:57.780> superuser<00:01:58.469> permission<00:01:59.780> okay<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> we

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
grant superuser permission okay and we

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.730 
grant superuser permission okay and we
will<00:02:01.350> set<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.950> pin

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
will set a pin

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
will set a pin
one<00:02:05.430> two<00:02:05.759> three<00:02:06.240> four<00:02:07.819> continue<00:02:08.819> one<00:02:09.720> two

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
one two three four continue one two

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.660 
one two three four continue one two
three<00:02:10.380> four<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:11.069> probably<00:02:11.280> want<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> make<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
three four you probably want to make it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
three four you probably want to make it
something<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:12.209> difficult<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.319> figure<00:02:13.500> out

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
something more difficult to figure out

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
something more difficult to figure out
than<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.480> okay<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.540> from<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:18.180> shows

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
than that okay so from now on it shows

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.479 
than that okay so from now on it shows
you<00:02:18.569> hear<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:19.110> hidden<00:02:19.380> applications<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
you hear your hidden applications if you

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.059 
you hear your hidden applications if you
want<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> access<00:02:20.849> these<00:02:21.209> applications<00:02:22.069> you

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
want to access these applications you

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.040 
want to access these applications you
would<00:02:23.190> go<00:02:23.280> into<00:02:23.400> your<00:02:23.519> app<00:02:23.670> hider<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.209> enter

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
would go into your app hider and enter

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.390 
would go into your app hider and enter
your<00:02:25.080> PIN<00:02:25.739> code<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:30.050> then<00:02:31.050> there<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.220> have

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
your PIN code and then there you have

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.380 
your PIN code and then there you have
your<00:02:32.430> hidden<00:02:32.790> applications<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
your hidden applications so in the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.090 
your hidden applications so in the
settings<00:02:36.900> you<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.019> disable<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.950> pin

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
settings you can disable the pin

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.650 
settings you can disable the pin
protection<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.760> change<00:02:39.090> your<00:02:39.239> PIN<00:02:39.420> code

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
protection you can change your PIN code

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.330 
protection you can change your PIN code
or<00:02:39.870> retrieve<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.590> pin<00:02:40.890> code<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.220> you've

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
or retrieve a pin code if you've

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.000 
or retrieve a pin code if you've
forgotten<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.150> clear<00:02:42.390> your<00:02:42.480> history

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
forgotten it you can clear your history

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.190 
forgotten it you can clear your history
change<00:02:44.010> app<00:02:44.250> name<00:02:44.700> so<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.600> want<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.019> to

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
change app name so if you want this to

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.110 
change app name so if you want this to
be<00:02:46.350> something<00:02:46.830> other<00:02:47.130> than<00:02:47.370> app<00:02:47.580> hider<00:02:47.850> so

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
be something other than app hider so

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.910 
be something other than app hider so
that's<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.510> Potter's<00:02:48.989> pretty<00:02:49.200> obvious<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.830> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
that's a Potter's pretty obvious as to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.009 
that's a Potter's pretty obvious as to
what<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.160> application<00:02:50.819> does<00:02:51.150> if<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.870> want

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
what that application does if you want

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.440 
what that application does if you want
to<00:02:52.110> change<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> something<00:02:52.860> else<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.420> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
to change that to something else so that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.050 
to change that to something else so that
whoever<00:02:54.690> picks<00:02:55.500> up<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:55.799> phone<00:02:56.060> they're

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
whoever picks up your phone they're

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
name there okay so that pretty much

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.530 
name there okay so that pretty much
wraps<00:03:10.350> it<00:03:10.590> up<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.940> app<00:03:12.120> hider

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
wraps it up for the app hider

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.380 
wraps it up for the app hider
application<00:03:14.989> it's<00:03:15.989> very<00:03:16.109> simple<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.560> use<00:03:16.650> and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
it is a very useful application after

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.960 
it is a very useful application after
removing<00:03:21.989> those<00:03:22.230> unwanted<00:03:22.650> applications<00:03:22.970> the

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
removing those unwanted applications the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.190 
removing those unwanted applications the
