00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
building games

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.950 
building games
a long<00:06:38.920> time<00:06:39.190> more<00:06:39.790> so<00:06:39.970> than<00:06:40.150> any<00:06:40.270> of<00:06:40.360> us<00:06:40.630> I

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
a long time more so than any of us I

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.110 
a long time more so than any of us I
would<00:06:41.890> assume<00:06:42.070> that<00:06:42.130> they<00:06:42.310> know<00:06:42.460> how<00:06:42.640> to<00:06:42.670> build

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
would assume that they know how to build

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.800 
would assume that they know how to build
a<00:06:43.300> game<00:06:44.190> as<00:06:45.190> far<00:06:45.460> as<00:06:45.520> porting<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:46.120> down<00:06:46.330> to<00:06:46.720> the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
a game as far as porting it down to the

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.840 
a game as far as porting it down to the
Wii<00:06:46.960> U<00:06:47.230> and<00:06:47.260> changing<00:06:48.190> everything<00:06:48.520> for<00:06:48.730> their

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
on it

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.300 
on it
are<00:07:13.240> they<00:07:13.500> reconsidering<00:07:14.500> not<00:07:14.830> bringing<00:07:15.220> it

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
are they reconsidering not bringing it

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.950 
are they reconsidering not bringing it
out<00:07:15.370> because<00:07:16.120> there's<00:07:16.270> not<00:07:16.360> really<00:07:16.420> much<00:07:16.780> of<00:07:16.810> a

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
out because there's not really much of a

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.570 
out because there's not really much of a
sailor<00:07:17.320> market<00:07:17.680> there<00:07:17.860> I<00:07:17.890> mean<00:07:18.130> would<00:07:18.400> it<00:07:18.430> be

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
sailor market there I mean would it be

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.640 
sailor market there I mean would it be
worth<00:07:18.790> their<00:07:19.060> while<00:07:19.300> to<00:07:19.660> spend<00:07:19.870> the<00:07:20.260> money<00:07:20.380> to

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
worth their while to spend the money to

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.310 
worth their while to spend the money to
market<00:07:21.010> that<00:07:21.130> game<00:07:21.370> for<00:07:21.610> a<00:07:21.640> console<00:07:22.510> that<00:07:22.630> they
