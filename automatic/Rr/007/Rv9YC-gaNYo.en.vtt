00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
onset of the stick was made so

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
onset of the stick was made so
essentially<00:01:41.820> an<00:01:41.880> abrupt<00:01:42.180> sharp<00:01:42.509> aft<00:01:42.750> stick

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
essentially an abrupt sharp aft stick

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.039 
essentially an abrupt sharp aft stick
input<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> test<00:01:44.729> aircraft<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.570> question

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
input now the test aircraft in question

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.170 
input now the test aircraft in question
was<00:01:46.380> loaded<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:47.070> asymmetric<00:01:47.850> missiles

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
was loaded with asymmetric missiles

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.090 
was loaded with asymmetric missiles
which<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.049> say<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> had<00:01:49.439> more<00:01:49.649> missiles<00:01:49.979> on

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
which is to say it had more missiles on

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800 
which is to say it had more missiles on
the<00:01:50.130> left<00:01:50.399> wing<00:01:50.909> than<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.240> had<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> right

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the left wing than it had on the right

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.300 
the left wing than it had on the right
and<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> situation<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.159> could

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and this is a situation that one could

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550 
and this is a situation that one could
find<00:01:53.460> oneself<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.329> combat<00:01:55.079> after<00:01:55.290> having

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
find oneself in in combat after having

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.280 
find oneself in in combat after having
employed<00:01:55.829> several<00:01:56.070> missiles<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.990> happened

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
employed several missiles what happened

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.780 
employed several missiles what happened
on<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.409> particular<00:01:58.740> test<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.369> something

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
on this particular test is something

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.580 
on this particular test is something
that<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.030> expected<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.659> happen<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.200> aircraft

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that we expected to happen the aircraft

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.800 
that we expected to happen the aircraft
departed<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.130> control<00:02:02.490> flight<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.570> way<00:02:03.689> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
departed from control flight the way it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.889 
departed from control flight the way it
did<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> with<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> rapid<00:02:06.210> aft<00:02:06.420> input

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
did so was that with the rapid aft input

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.020 
did so was that with the rapid aft input
of<00:02:06.990> stick

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
of stick

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.359 
of stick
we<00:02:08.660> had<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.050> very<00:02:09.320> high<00:02:09.560> buildup<00:02:10.280> of

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
we had a very high buildup of

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.280 
we had a very high buildup of
angle-of-attack<00:02:10.670> or<00:02:11.150> alpha<00:02:11.570> however

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
angle-of-attack or alpha however

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.840 
angle-of-attack or alpha however
coincident<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.370> due<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
coincident with this due to the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.210 
coincident with this due to the
asymmetry<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.720> missiles<00:02:15.080> involved<00:02:15.500> some

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
asymmetry of the missiles involved some

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.520 
asymmetry of the missiles involved some
beta<00:02:16.820> or<00:02:17.090> sideslip<00:02:17.510> was<00:02:17.840> created<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.350> well

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
beta or sideslip was created as well

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.440 
beta or sideslip was created as well
this<00:02:19.190> essentially<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.910> same<00:02:20.180> thing<00:02:20.390> as

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
this essentially was the same thing as

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.120 
this essentially was the same thing as
putting<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.290> boot<00:02:21.560> full<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.890> right<00:02:22.100> rudder

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
putting in a boot full of right rudder

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.010 
putting in a boot full of right rudder
in<00:02:22.580> an<00:02:22.790> area<00:02:23.150> that's<00:02:23.300> already<00:02:23.600> prone<00:02:23.870> to

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
in an area that's already prone to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.380 
in an area that's already prone to
departure<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:25.340> end<00:02:25.520> result<00:02:25.850> was<00:02:26.120> that<00:02:26.150> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
departure the end result was that the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.680 
departure the end result was that the
aircraft<00:02:26.540> departed<00:02:26.990> in<00:02:27.440> yaw<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:28.670> at<00:02:29.030> over<00:02:29.150> 120

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
aircraft departed in yaw in at over 120

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.780 
aircraft departed in yaw in at over 120
degrees<00:02:30.110> per<00:02:30.290> second<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:30.980> right<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
degrees per second to the right so

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.240 
degrees per second to the right so
essentially<00:02:32.390> what<00:02:32.510> we<00:02:32.600> have<00:02:32.720> happening<00:02:33.140> is<00:02:33.350> by

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
essentially what we have happening is by

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.130 
essentially what we have happening is by
simple<00:02:34.640> application<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.360> rapid<00:02:35.720> aft<00:02:35.870> stick

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
simple application of a rapid aft stick

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.320 
simple application of a rapid aft stick
we<00:02:36.709> end<00:02:36.830> up<00:02:36.920> with<00:02:37.070> an<00:02:37.220> intense<00:02:37.550> high<00:02:37.820> yaw<00:02:38.090> rate

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
we end up with an intense high yaw rate

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.360 
we end up with an intense high yaw rate
to<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.570> right<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.470> airport<00:02:39.860> airplane

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
to the right the airport airplane

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.370 
to the right the airport airplane
departed<00:02:40.850> from<00:02:41.000> controlled<00:02:41.420> flight<00:02:41.690> this<00:02:42.200> was

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
departed from controlled flight this was

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.590 
departed from controlled flight this was
as<00:02:42.530> expected<00:02:42.850> what<00:02:43.850> we<00:02:43.940> were<00:02:44.030> looking<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.390> make

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
as expected what we were looking to make

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.210 
as expected what we were looking to make
sure<00:02:44.630> what<00:02:44.930> happened<00:02:45.290> was<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.980> flight

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
sure what happened was that the flight

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.199 
sure what happened was that the flight
controls<00:02:46.580> would<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.880> enough<00:02:47.090> authority

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
controls would have enough authority

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.630 
controls would have enough authority
after<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.170> departure<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:49.100> recover<00:02:49.489> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
after the departure to recover the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.670 
after the departure to recover the
airplane<00:02:50.000> which<00:02:50.570> they<00:02:50.750> did<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.200> everything

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
airplane which they did and everything

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.910 
airplane which they did and everything
was<00:02:51.950> fine<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:53.239> only<00:02:53.390> problem<00:02:53.840> came<00:02:54.080> in<00:02:54.320> that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
was fine the only problem came in that

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.390 
was fine the only problem came in that
in<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.640> post<00:02:55.850> departure<00:02:56.690> gyrations<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
in the post departure gyrations the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.010 
in the post departure gyrations the
aircraft<00:02:58.790> exceeded<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.420> aircraft's

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020

take a flight test the good news is that

take a flight test the good news is that
