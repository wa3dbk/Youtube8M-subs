00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.990
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.580
 I think it was here we are a new video 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.590
 of news in which we are going to review 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.900
 three important issues such as for example 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.880
 the improvement of the skin give my spirit 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.680
 of the river that has been added with new 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.720
 colors we will also see the new icon 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.699
 of invoker that could be doing 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.619
 reference to a new skin I do not know what 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.050
 we'll go over the second story and for 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.489
 last we will see the news of the rise of 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.410
 the dragons kill a news that 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.760
 updated on the official page of 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.670
 league of legends and which shows us 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.470
 the brawn skins kills dragons and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.540
 pantheon and a little story that 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.820
 we will review next let's start 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.440
 for the improvement of the nami skin as 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.330
 you can see on the left you have the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.250
 previous version a very subdued version 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.900
 with very poor colors yes that's true 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.850
 that nothing like what we could see 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.979
 in shifting to the right we have the 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.830
 new version of nami spirit of the river 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.140
 a version with more vivid colors more 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.909
 striking and more similar displaces the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.500
 truth is that it cool a lot more and as 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.630
 I always tell you the server pp is 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.979
 subject to changes and tests therefore 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.080
 we never really know how it's going to 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.270
 finish a thing we always give for 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.920
 done before the cycle has finished 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.540
 that a corner is ugly or whatever 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.070
 without taking into account that they can 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.260
 changes of this style I think the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.210
 corner improves me a lot more with this 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.010
 before I did not convince myself now 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.140
 it convinces me a little bit more but good 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.390
 I still think that something is missing so 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.430
 tell me what do you think let's go to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.810
 the next news on the server pp 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.280
 have added this new icon 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.800
 summoner which we can draw a 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.270
 similar to the mordecai helmet being maybe 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.860
 we can be talking about a new skin 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.910
 I do not know if it is true that it does 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.010
 enough years 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.600
 guerri or had thought a skin that was 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.130
 added to the server pp yes that 's true 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.290
 that it was just an image in which you are 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 seeing on the screen and telling you that those 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.240
 who was canceled and again in the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.160
 pack if it's 2014 they talked about 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.320
 this skin that maybe they could go back to 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.930
 take it out I do not know how far can 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.090
 be coincidental or have to see the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.800
 invoker icon tell me what you 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.060
 you think about it even though it is 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.860
 true that with just an icon of a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.930
 we can not take many snack 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.179
 things in particular so let's go 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.709
 to the next news on the page 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.870
 The official ico player was added to the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.580
 news the rise of the dragon slayers 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.989
 which by the way I recommend you read because 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.060
 It has a pretty interesting story 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.500
 and you have a link in the description with 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.300
 several images like the one you are 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.080
 seeing first of all let's go over 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.020
 certain 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.160
 inside the images not counted 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.140
 spoilers yes that's true that it showed 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.460
 the brawn pantheon image but 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.620
 have not seen anything more than 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.630
 dragons many decÃ­s can be something without 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.670
 good to say chaos without coming from the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.440
 Chinese tradition I do not think I have anything 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.930
 to see these are more dragon styles 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.060
 mediaeval of the middle ages not by 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.470
 so say yes it is true that good 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.210
 who knows but well I think it's not going 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.460
 to have relationship with austin in any 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.320
 they have nothing to do so 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 well before finalizing I would like that 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.480
 we will review the skins of the characters 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.730
 of kill dragons for example we have to 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.590
 pantheon kills dragons and that power to the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.420
 mole line in the jungle too 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.820
 we have to boil that like pantheon 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.520
 it can be viable in everything for 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.730
 jungle we have a game and we have brown 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.140
 support and carry we would miss a mid 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.060
 maybe we can be waiting for a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.890
 skin to kill dragons for the line of 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.959
 mid of a particular champion 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.510
 we'll be aware, I do not think it's 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.520
 short term we will delay in seeing some 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.050
 news about it but good I hope 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.400
 that you liked the video as 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.190
 you already know you can subscribe 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.750

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.030

 goodbye video
