00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.800
 on the Mac 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.940
 especially 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.630
 I can leave my known reason within Paszek and Men 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.779
 Say that it will be like in a slideshow 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.140

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.810
 already at the end of the screen background 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.250
 but now i just wanted to be quite so is always nice to have slideshow 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.880

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.910

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.180
 say I can say change every 30 minutes 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.530
 every hour every day everywhere physics down fast times five seconds 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.490

 it was certainly influenced by the 1 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.060
 I do not claim to open the grandfathers normally 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 and nothing happens 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.930
 but I can also handle it well 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.660
