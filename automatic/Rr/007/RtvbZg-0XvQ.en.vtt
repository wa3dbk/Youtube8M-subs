Rockstar announced they were going to be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.189 
Rockstar announced they were going to be
introducing<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.340> exira<00:00:53.699> blimp<00:00:54.090> into<00:00:54.480> GTA<00:00:54.809> 5

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
introducing the exira blimp into GTA 5

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080 
introducing the exira blimp into GTA 5
and<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.800> was<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.250> faster<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.910> more

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and it was going to be faster and more

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.939 
and it was going to be faster and more
maneuverable<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.320> already<00:00:58.500> available

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
maneuverable than the already available

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.910 
maneuverable than the already available
atomic<00:00:59.879> blimp<00:01:00.180> while<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:01.230> confirm<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
atomic blimp while I can confirm the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
atomic blimp while I can confirm the
Exile<00:01:02.219> blink<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> faster<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.660> also<00:01:03.840> more

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Exile blink is faster and it's also more

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.780 
Exile blink is faster and it's also more
maneuverable<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.189> say<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.430> terms<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
maneuverable I would say in terms of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390 
maneuverable I would say in terms of
speed<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.540> 20%<00:01:07.110> faster<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
speed it's about 20% faster and when it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.070 
speed it's about 20% faster and when it
comes<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> maneuverability<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> can

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
comes down to maneuverability I can

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.500 
comes down to maneuverability I can
confirm<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.220> easier<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.760> use<00:01:12.060> I'm

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
confirm it is a lot easier to use I'm

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.969 
confirm it is a lot easier to use I'm
not<00:01:12.840> too<00:01:12.960> sure<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.439> also<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> case

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
not too sure if this is also the case

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
not too sure if this is also the case
but<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.430> also<00:01:14.580> think<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> x0<00:01:15.299> blimp<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
but I also think the x0 blimp is

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.359 
but I also think the x0 blimp is
slightly<00:01:16.110> bigger<00:01:16.320> than<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.920> previously

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
slightly bigger than the previously

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.999 
slightly bigger than the previously
available<00:01:17.520> atomic<00:01:18.360> blimp<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> atomic<00:01:19.770> blimp

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
available atomic blimp the atomic blimp

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.260 
available atomic blimp the atomic blimp
is<00:01:20.159> still<00:01:20.430> available<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
is still available on the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.880 
is still available on the

next-generation version of Grand Theft
Auto<00:01:23.100> 5<00:01:23.549> however<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> option

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
Auto 5 however there is not the option

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.020 
Auto 5 however there is not the option
to<00:01:25.470> call<00:01:25.680> for<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> atomic<00:01:26.189> blimp<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.729> use

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
to call for the atomic blimp and use

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
to call for the atomic blimp and use
that<00:01:27.240> one<00:01:27.360> instead<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> overall<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.280> really

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
that one instead so overall I really

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
that one instead so overall I really
like<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> X<00:01:30.060> 0<00:01:30.270> blimp<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.930> sure<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> guys

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
like the X 0 blimp and I'm sure you guys

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.690 
like the X 0 blimp and I'm sure you guys
