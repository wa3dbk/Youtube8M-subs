Cullen<00:00:40.969> also<00:00:41.420> demonstrated<00:00:41.960> our<00:00:42.140> dynamics

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
Cullen also demonstrated our dynamics

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.229 
Cullen also demonstrated our dynamics

volume here but in this video I'm
primarily<00:00:46.160> going<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:46.519> be<00:00:46.609> focusing<00:00:47.030> on<00:00:47.210> our

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
primarily going to be focusing on our

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.360 
primarily going to be focusing on our
legato<00:00:47.899> interface<00:00:48.320> in<00:00:48.500> here<00:00:48.859> one<00:00:49.249> of<00:00:49.309> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
legato interface in here one of the

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.189 
legato interface in here one of the
great<00:00:49.579> things<00:00:49.940> about<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.420> Clara<00:00:50.629> series<00:00:50.989> and

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
great things about the Clara series and

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.569 
great things about the Clara series and
our<00:00:51.320> dodgey<00:00:51.559> series<00:00:51.920> as<00:00:52.039> well<00:00:52.219> is<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.460> you

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
our dodgey series as well is that you

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.310 
our dodgey series as well is that you
can<00:00:52.699> take<00:00:52.910> any<00:00:53.210> legato<00:00:53.570> articulation<00:00:54.199> and

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
can take any legato articulation and

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.349 
can take any legato articulation and
combine<00:00:54.679> them<00:00:54.800> with<00:00:54.920> other<00:00:55.129> ones<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.089> the

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
combine them with other ones so the

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:57.669 
combine them with other ones so the
first<00:00:56.539> one<00:00:56.690> we<00:00:56.780> have<00:00:56.929> here<00:00:57.109> is<00:00:57.170> our<00:00:57.320> natural

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
first one we have here is our natural

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.919 
first one we have here is our natural
legato<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.519> that's<00:00:58.969> essentially<00:00:59.480> how<00:00:59.510> things

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
legato and that's essentially how things

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.660 
legato and that's essentially how things
were<00:01:00.109> recorded<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.949> session<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.519> get

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
were recorded in the session so you get

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.189 
were recorded in the session so you get
the<00:01:01.760> perfect<00:01:01.969> performance<00:01:02.449> if<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:02.960> really

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
the perfect performance if you really

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.810 
the perfect performance if you really
want<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.469> natural<00:01:03.829> feel<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.460> down

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
want the natural feel of it and down

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.310 
want the natural feel of it and down
here<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.120> got<00:01:05.210> our<00:01:05.269> medium<00:01:05.720> art<00:01:05.960> which<00:01:06.170> has<00:01:06.290> a

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
here we got our medium art which has a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.930 
here we got our medium art which has a
little<00:01:06.530> more<00:01:06.650> elaborate<00:01:07.070> swell<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.820> can

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
little more elaborate swell and you can

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.160 
little more elaborate swell and you can
see<00:01:08.060> this<00:01:08.180> will<00:01:08.390> get<00:01:08.570> stronger<00:01:08.930> with<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
see this will get stronger with the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.200 
see this will get stronger with the
strong<00:01:09.470> one<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.829> strong<00:01:10.040> too<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.579> all<00:01:11.060> these

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
strong one and strong too and all these

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.389 
strong one and strong too and all these
amnon<00:01:11.600> vibrato<00:01:11.990> down<00:01:12.890> here<00:01:13.130> we<00:01:13.250> got<00:01:13.369> our

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
amnon vibrato down here we got our

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.490 
amnon vibrato down here we got our
vibrato<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.299> we<00:01:14.390> got<00:01:14.509> a<00:01:14.540> heavy<00:01:14.810> vibrato<00:01:15.229> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
vibrato and we got a heavy vibrato that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.230 
vibrato and we got a heavy vibrato that
almost<00:01:15.770> has<00:01:15.950> sort<00:01:16.220> of<00:01:16.250> an<00:01:16.399> ethnic<00:01:16.820> character

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
almost has sort of an ethnic character

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.460 
almost has sort of an ethnic character
to<00:01:17.360> it<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.540> you<00:01:17.600> got<00:01:17.720> stuck<00:01:17.990> at<00:01:18.079> cismo<00:01:18.350> and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
to it and you got stuck at cismo and

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.170 
to it and you got stuck at cismo and
Mikado<00:01:18.740> here<00:01:18.979> as<00:01:19.070> well<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.700> beauty<00:01:19.969> of<00:01:20.000> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.649 
interface is that you can seamlessly
combine<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.460> non<00:01:22.610> vibrato<00:01:22.969> with<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.329> vibrato

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
combine the non vibrato with a vibrato

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.780 
combine the non vibrato with a vibrato
and<00:01:23.869> so<00:01:23.990> forth<00:01:24.320> anyway<00:01:24.950> too<00:01:25.369> much<00:01:25.520> talking

let's<00:01:26.270> get<00:01:26.450> down<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.689> business<00:01:26.810> let<00:01:27.170> me<00:01:27.259> just

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
let's get down to business let me just

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.499 
let's get down to business let me just
demonstrate<00:01:27.860> here<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.790> natural<00:01:29.090> legato

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
demonstrate here the natural legato

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:49.740 
demonstrate here the natural legato
first

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.350 

and<00:01:50.799> for<00:01:51.799> me<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.100> natural<00:01:52.429> legato<00:01:52.759> here<00:01:53.209> is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
and for me the natural legato here is

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.880 
and for me the natural legato here is
just<00:01:53.600> a<00:01:53.659> perfect<00:01:53.869> way<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:54.289> having<00:01:54.469> sort<00:01:54.709> of<00:01:54.799> a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
just a perfect way of having sort of a

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.969 
just a perfect way of having sort of a
playful<00:01:55.390> faster<00:01:56.390> running<00:01:56.840> style<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.439> keep<00:01:57.890> in

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
playful faster running style and keep in

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.709 
playful faster running style and keep in
mind<00:01:58.009> as<00:01:58.219> well<00:01:58.399> I'm<00:01:58.579> using<00:01:58.759> our<00:01:58.969> fast<00:01:59.390> legato

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
mind as well I'm using our fast legato

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.050 
mind as well I'm using our fast legato
pads<00:01:59.990> we<00:02:00.140> actually<00:02:00.439> have<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.770> slow<00:02:01.189> one<00:02:01.340> as<00:02:01.490> well

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
pads we actually have a slow one as well

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.300 
pads we actually have a slow one as well
let<00:02:02.569> me<00:02:02.659> try<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.840> play<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.469> few<00:02:03.770> examples<00:02:04.250> here

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
let me try to play a few examples here

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.550 
let me try to play a few examples here
I'll<00:02:05.119> just<00:02:05.329> try<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.539> play<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.929> natural<00:02:06.110> and

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
I'll just try to play the natural and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.960 
I'll just try to play the natural and
then<00:02:06.649> I'll<00:02:06.770> try<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.009> play<00:02:07.130> Mediamark<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.880> then

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
then I'll try to play Mediamark and then

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.279 
then I'll try to play Mediamark and then
I'll<00:02:08.090> show<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.269> how<00:02:08.450> they<00:02:08.660> can<00:02:08.810> be<00:02:08.929> combined

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
I'll show you how they can be combined

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.749 
I'll show you how they can be combined
and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:09.590> I'll<00:02:09.950> go<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.220> little<00:02:10.310> more<00:02:10.429> into<00:02:10.640> that

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
and then I'll go a little more into that

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.789 
and then I'll go a little more into that
but<00:02:10.959> check<00:02:11.959> out<00:02:12.079> the<00:02:12.170> difference<00:02:12.440> between<00:02:12.739> the

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
but check out the difference between the

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:29.920 
but check out the difference between the
different<00:02:13.040> ones<00:02:13.160> here

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.270 

and<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.170> notice<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> first<00:02:31.799> one<00:02:32.069> was<00:02:32.250> just

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
and if you notice the first one was just

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.890 
and if you notice the first one was just
a<00:02:32.519> natural<00:02:32.879> one<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> second<00:02:33.659> one<00:02:33.750> was

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
a natural one then the second one was

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.420 
a natural one then the second one was
longer<00:02:34.170> he<00:02:34.409> had<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> little<00:02:34.680> more<00:02:34.799> longer<00:02:35.220> art

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
longer he had a little more longer art

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550 
longer he had a little more longer art
to<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.000> in<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.750> third<00:02:36.900> example<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.440> was

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
to it and in the third example I was

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.559 
to it and in the third example I was
combining<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.220> non<00:02:38.700> vibrato<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> vibrato

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
combining and non vibrato with a vibrato

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.630 
combining and non vibrato with a vibrato
and<00:02:39.989> I<00:02:40.049> think<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.349> can<00:02:40.500> hear<00:02:40.739> how<00:02:41.010> smooth<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and I think you can hear how smooth the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.309 
and I think you can hear how smooth the
transition<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.269> it's<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:42.629> like<00:02:42.690> fake<00:02:43.140> or

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
transition is it's not like fake or

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.020 
transition is it's not like fake or
anything<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.739> truly<00:02:44.220> performed<00:02:44.909> by<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
anything it's truly performed by a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.440 
anything it's truly performed by a
player<00:02:45.299> for<00:02:45.870> reals<00:02:46.519> anyway<00:02:47.519> let's<00:02:48.209> move<00:02:48.329> on

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
player for reals anyway let's move on

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.420 
player for reals anyway let's move on
here<00:02:48.510> let<00:02:48.959> me<00:02:48.989> try<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.200> play<00:02:49.430> another

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
here let me try to play another

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.180 
here let me try to play another
demonstration<00:02:50.819> here<00:02:51.599> using<00:02:52.110> our<00:02:52.260> vibrato<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
demonstration here using our vibrato and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.369 
demonstration here using our vibrato and
heavy<00:02:53.519> vibrato<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.329> try<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> combine<00:02:55.079> them

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
heavy vibrato and try to combine them

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.930 
heavy vibrato and try to combine them
together<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.099> get<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> feeling<00:02:56.670> for

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
together so you can get a feeling for

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.670 
together so you can get a feeling for
what<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.720> instrument<00:02:58.049> can<00:02:58.140> sound<00:02:58.379> like<00:02:58.440> when

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
what the instrument can sound like when

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.559 
what the instrument can sound like when
it's<00:02:58.829> pushed<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.340> further<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.849> again

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
it's pushed a little further and again

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.390 
it's pushed a little further and again
the<00:03:00.780> vibrato<00:03:01.140> things<00:03:01.590> they're<00:03:01.890> not<00:03:02.040> really

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
the vibrato things they're not really

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220 
the vibrato things they're not really
that<00:03:02.700> common<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.299> orchestral<00:03:03.569> realm<00:03:04.049> but

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that common in the orchestral realm but

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.289 
that common in the orchestral realm but
they're<00:03:04.349> more<00:03:04.709> used<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.160> jazz<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.940> ethnic

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
they're more used in jazz and ethnic

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.449 
they're more used in jazz and ethnic
stuff<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:06.870> writing<00:03:07.500> other<00:03:07.680> styles<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.310> then

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
stuff and writing other styles but then

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:35.330 
stuff and writing other styles but then
check<00:03:08.640> it<00:03:08.730> out

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.490 

and<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:37.060> trainer<00:03:37.360> would<00:03:37.690> probably<00:03:38.050> hear<00:03:38.230> that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
and the trainer would probably hear that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.260 
and the trainer would probably hear that
there<00:03:38.680> were<00:03:38.770> actually<00:03:39.130> breathing<00:03:39.460> sounds<00:03:40.060> in

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
there were actually breathing sounds in

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.090 
there were actually breathing sounds in
this<00:03:40.450> little<00:03:40.690> example<00:03:40.750> here<00:03:41.080> those<00:03:42.070> were

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
this little example here those were

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.190 
this little example here those were
added<00:03:42.430> on<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.760> second<00:03:43.150> Channel<00:03:43.420> we<00:03:44.020> have<00:03:44.170> a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
added on a second Channel we have a

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.020 
added on a second Channel we have a
specific<00:03:44.710> effects<00:03:45.100> patch<00:03:45.340> here<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.850> has

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
specific effects patch here that has

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.690 
specific effects patch here that has
runs<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:47.050> breaths<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.800> valve<00:03:48.130> clicks<00:03:48.460> that<00:03:48.670> I

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
runs and breaths and valve clicks that I

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.970 
runs and breaths and valve clicks that I
love<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.120> use<00:03:49.150> for<00:03:49.480> note<00:03:49.600> repetitions<00:03:50.170> let<00:03:50.920> me

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
love to use for note repetitions let me

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.930 
love to use for note repetitions let me
transfer<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.430> here<00:03:53.520> one<00:03:54.520> of<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.700> core

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
transfer you here one of the core

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.670 
transfer you here one of the core
pillars<00:03:55.420> in<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.780> Claire<00:03:56.170> design<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.530> also

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
pillars in the Claire design is also

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.290 
pillars in the Claire design is also
that<00:03:56.980> we<00:03:57.130> really<00:03:57.430> wanted<00:03:57.640> it<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.790> be<00:03:58.000> able<00:03:58.090> to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
that we really wanted it to be able to

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.000 
that we really wanted it to be able to
be<00:03:58.480> used<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:59.110> write<00:03:59.350> of<00:03:59.470> different<00:03:59.770> styles

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
be used on a write of different styles

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.820 
be used on a write of different styles
of<00:04:00.280> music<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:01.180> while<00:04:01.510> it's<00:04:01.780> classical<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.710> his

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
of music so while it's classical in his

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.890 
of music so while it's classical in his
essence<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.340> it's<00:04:03.670> really<00:04:03.940> great<00:04:04.480> for<00:04:04.600> that

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
essence and it's really great for that

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.480 
essence and it's really great for that
you<00:04:05.200> can<00:04:05.350> also<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> write<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.100> other<00:04:06.310> things

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
you can also do a write of other things

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.700 
you can also do a write of other things
so<00:04:06.760> let<00:04:07.450> me<00:04:07.540> kick<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.810> off<00:04:07.900> here<00:04:08.230> with<00:04:08.410> some

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
so let me kick it off here with some

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.760 
so let me kick it off here with some
modern<00:04:09.010> avant-garde<00:04:09.760> opus<00:04:10.630> one<00:04:10.930> modern

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
modern avant-garde opus one modern

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:24.380 
modern avant-garde opus one modern
concertos<00:04:12.460> stuff

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.880 

and<00:04:25.390> you<00:04:25.480> probably<00:04:25.630> noticed<00:04:25.900> as<00:04:26.140> well<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.620> it

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
and you probably noticed as well that it

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.350 
and you probably noticed as well that it
went<00:04:27.100> into<00:04:27.280> heavy<00:04:27.520> vibrato<00:04:27.850> so<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.150> really

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
went into heavy vibrato so you really

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.970 
went into heavy vibrato so you really
got<00:04:28.480> that<00:04:28.510> Lane<00:04:28.840> kind<00:04:29.380> of<00:04:29.440> sound<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> end

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
got that Lane kind of sound in the end

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.010 
got that Lane kind of sound in the end
but<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:31.150> library<00:04:31.270> is<00:04:31.450> also<00:04:31.540> great<00:04:31.780> for<00:04:31.900> other

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
but the library is also great for other

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.970 
but the library is also great for other
things<00:04:32.250> let<00:04:33.250> me<00:04:33.340> try<00:04:33.520> some<00:04:33.900> fluffy<00:04:34.980> Pixies

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
things let me try some fluffy Pixies

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.710

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
II and as I mentioned previously as well

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680 
II and as I mentioned previously as well
we<00:04:51.040> went<00:04:51.190> quite<00:04:51.490> deep<00:04:51.760> into<00:04:51.880> getting<00:04:52.210> vibrato

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
we went quite deep into getting vibrato

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.270 
we went quite deep into getting vibrato
and<00:04:52.930> heavy<00:04:53.230> vibrato<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:53.800> this<00:04:54.010> one

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
and heavy vibrato and this one

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.250 
and heavy vibrato and this one
particular<00:04:54.490> has<00:04:55.030> sort<00:04:55.270> of<00:04:55.300> an<00:04:55.420> ethnic<00:04:55.840> nature

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
particular has sort of an ethnic nature

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.560 
particular has sort of an ethnic nature
to<00:04:56.530> it<00:04:56.590> so<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.760> can<00:04:57.940> kind<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.270> make<00:04:58.390> the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
to it so you can kind of make the

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.690 
to it so you can kind of make the
clarinet<00:04:58.930> sound<00:04:59.170> like<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.410> Dilek<00:04:59.860> of<00:05:00.010> sorts<00:05:00.400> I

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
clarinet sound like a Dilek of sorts I

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.460 
clarinet sound like a Dilek of sorts I
guess<00:05:01.120> they<00:05:01.420> were<00:05:01.480> sort<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.780> similar<00:05:02.200> in<00:05:02.230> their

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
guess they were sort of similar in their

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:20.340 
guess they were sort of similar in their
nature<00:05:17.730> and<00:05:18.730> of<00:05:19.090> course<00:05:19.330> this<00:05:19.480> mandatory<00:05:19.810> we

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
nature and of course this mandatory we

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.870 
nature and of course this mandatory we
should<00:05:20.530> also<00:05:20.680> test<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.340> against<00:05:21.610> some

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
should also test it against some

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:38.340 
should also test it against some
classical<00:05:22.510> stuff<00:05:36.180> what<00:05:37.180> else<00:05:37.390> could<00:05:37.660> it<00:05:37.690> do<00:05:38.020> um
