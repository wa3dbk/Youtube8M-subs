00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.310
 hello I am smooth pita decoration and for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.379
 today we are going to do the toilet 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.050
 clean is a cream that is used as 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.909
 filling for the cakes to cover and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 hitting on the perfect edges and 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:26.869
 especially to make some decorations 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.869
 very cool cupcakes 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 Now what we're going to do is pass the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.000
 butter to point ointment 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.930
 to our mixer as you see is a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.100
 butter that is quite soft 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.170
 I recommend when the goal is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.540
 microwave but it was pointed so 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 natural here you take away at least one 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.430
 couple of hours in the refrigerator the leave 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.390
 stand at room temperature and let's 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.390
 proceed to beat it 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.340
 now let's throw the little sugar to 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.530
 little bear in mind that sugar has 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.690
 had to be previously sifted or 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.920
 sifted so that we do not find any 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.920
 lumps in the preparation 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.840
 Y 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.800
 as you have seen the volume has 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.720
 gone up and the butter has cleared 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.540
 so now let's move on to what it is 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.370
 give the flavor to the battery in this case 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.910
 and used fruits in peace you can 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.980
 take whatever essence you have 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.160
 vanilla essence radiant zest 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.530
 lemon orange in this case we are not 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.660
 very greedy with the strawberry 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.660
 we want the fruit in pasta 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.620
 we do not need to dye him 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.170
 because the color already the red color of the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.660
 strawberry will help to have it the toilet 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.410
 cream but in case you 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.300
 use some colorless essence 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.300
 you can put the coloring 2 what you want 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.740
 well we already have our battlefield as 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.610
 You see, it's super creamy, look what 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.260
 The best texture always has 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.360
 I recommend that you work wash yourself 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.090
 pri with the shovel you do not work with the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.010
 rods because the rod pricks a lot 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.810
 he gets a lot of air then 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.320
 moment to make it use it with the 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.210
 Pastry bag will come out as 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.500
 tiny bubbles of air and they will explode by 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.390
 put it like that 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.630
 I also recommend that you work with 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.590
 extra-fine icing sugar 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.300
 and 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.390
 the charges that we find in the 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.250
 supermarket is not bad what happens is 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.050
 that the extra- fine icing sugar that 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.739
 usually they are American brands 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.019
 or foreigners outside of Spain, let's go 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.510
 tend to be ten times thinner than 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.630
 normal icing sugar is 6 in icing sugar or 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.810
 from home it does not come out as finite as 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.570
 I would like for more than latam and 6 the no 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.550
 it comes out so fine but good that if what 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.530
 you have at home 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.280
 yourselves you have to keep trying 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.260
 little by little and you're going to see what's left of you 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.480
 I like you more, particularly 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.050
 I like more is now what we are going to 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.280
 to do is to pass it to a pastry bag 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.630
 to decorate some cupcakes that 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.320
 I have done with a small 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.530
 spatula let's fill in a bit the 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.320
 cupcake that I had already done does not 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.650
 reign always with great care as 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.170
 you see is a fine toilet was super 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.730
 we believe milestone very soft and these like 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.580
 a lot because when it comes to eating it's going to 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.690
 be like a cheese type creame well 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.690
 super soft 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.340
 It is quite nice to the palate 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.199
 let's make the rosette that is going to be a 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:30.740
 type of flower let's start from the 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:33.580
 center and we rotate around 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.580
 and 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.350
 now let's do the spiral towards 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.300
 up starting from the outside in 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.300
 and up outside 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:06:01.590
 in and up and to finish 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.110
 these delicious cupcakes only we 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.410
 it is necessary to put a little bit of sugar 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.410
 colour 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.800
 Y 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.360
 well we have our cupcakes 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:24.300
 decorated the recipe of toilet cream 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.789
 classic remember that you can replace 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.059
 the taste for different flavors of 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:32.159
 fruits in pasta that I love all 

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:34.499
 I have weakness my chubby and I 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:37.319
 by the strawberry but hey you can 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:38.849
 use of violet of orange rose 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.029
 of mandarin what you want 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.559
 even the transparent essences 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.749
 they also go pretty well and then 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:47.339
