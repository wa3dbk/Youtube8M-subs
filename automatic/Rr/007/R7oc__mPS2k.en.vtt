I<00:04:05.459> tend<00:04:06.060> to<00:04:06.150> agree<00:04:06.750> with<00:04:06.840> David<00:04:07.320> wolf<00:04:07.500> when<00:04:07.860> he

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
I tend to agree with David wolf when he

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.680 
I tend to agree with David wolf when he
talks<00:04:08.190> about<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.580> noble<00:04:08.910> mushrooms<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:09.600> how

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
talks about the noble mushrooms and how

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.260 
talks about the noble mushrooms and how
they<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:09.900> have<00:04:10.200> antifungal<00:04:11.130> properties<00:04:11.760> to

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
they do have antifungal properties to

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.760 
they do have antifungal properties to
them<00:04:12.450> so<00:04:12.720> I<00:04:12.750> think<00:04:12.900> mushrooms<00:04:13.380> are<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> good

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
them so I think mushrooms are a good

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.860 
them so I think mushrooms are a good
thing<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.310> in<00:04:14.580> your<00:04:14.610> diet<00:04:14.760> when<00:04:15.660> they're

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
thing to have in your diet when they're

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.530 
thing to have in your diet when they're
wild<00:04:16.470> because<00:04:17.250> mushrooms<00:04:17.730> in<00:04:17.850> nature<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.419> to

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
wild because mushrooms in nature have to

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.570 
wild because mushrooms in nature have to
fight<00:04:18.810> against<00:04:19.260> other<00:04:19.470> mushrooms<00:04:20.040> in<00:04:20.340> order

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
fight against other mushrooms in order

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.430 
fight against other mushrooms in order
to<00:04:20.730> live<00:04:20.910> on<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.299> tree<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:21.959> of<00:04:22.019> course<00:04:22.230> they

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
to live on the tree so of course they

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.070 
to live on the tree so of course they
have<00:04:22.680> natural<00:04:23.060> antifungal<00:04:24.060> properties<00:04:24.630> in

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
have natural antifungal properties in

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.320 
have natural antifungal properties in
them<00:04:25.290> so<00:04:25.770> don't<00:04:25.890> be<00:04:26.040> afraid<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.580> be<00:04:26.730> mushrooms

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330
