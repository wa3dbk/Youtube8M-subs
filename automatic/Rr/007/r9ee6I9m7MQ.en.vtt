00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
absolutely terrifying I felt just like a

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.250 
absolutely terrifying I felt just like a
new<00:02:18.740> boy<00:02:19.460> been<00:02:20.240> taken<00:02:20.600> down<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.870> his<00:02:20.990> new

lounge and I heard all this laughter and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.570 
lounge and I heard all this laughter and
all<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.270> chatter<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.260> people<00:02:27.740> say<00:02:27.980> ho<00:02:28.130> Billy

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
all this chatter and people say ho Billy

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.970

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.040 
is totally deaf and no eyes and I
thought<00:02:33.590> well<00:02:33.950> perhaps<00:02:34.280> blindness<00:02:34.940> isn't<00:02:35.420> as

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
thought well perhaps blindness isn't as

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.260 
thought well perhaps blindness isn't as
bad<00:02:36.410> as<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:36.830> cracked<00:02:37.100> out<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:37.580> be<00:02:37.760> and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
bad as it's cracked out to be and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.910 
bad as it's cracked out to be and
actually<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.690> really<00:02:39.260> was<00:02:39.440> when<00:02:39.620> they<00:02:39.739> might

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
actually that really was when they might

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.650 
actually that really was when they might
begin<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.310> shine<00:02:40.790> at<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.060> end<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.450> tunnel

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
begin to shine at the end of the tunnel

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.220 
begin to shine at the end of the tunnel
for<00:02:42.020> me<00:02:42.250> it<00:02:43.250> represented<00:02:43.910> hope<00:02:44.230> and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
for me it represented hope and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.880 
for me it represented hope and
reassurance<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.630> think<00:02:48.200> looking<00:02:48.500> back<00:02:48.560> it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
reassurance and I think looking back it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970 
reassurance and I think looking back it
took<00:02:49.070> me<00:02:49.190> two<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.640> three<00:02:49.880> years<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.739> accept

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
took me two to three years not to accept

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.890 
took me two to three years not to accept
the<00:02:52.130> blindness<00:02:52.550> that<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:53.120> straight<00:02:53.390> away<00:02:53.660> but

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
the blindness that was straight away but

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.720 
the blindness that was straight away but
