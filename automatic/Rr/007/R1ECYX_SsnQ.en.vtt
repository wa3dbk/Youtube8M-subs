time next thing we really need to do is

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.210 
time next thing we really need to do is
actually<00:04:33.699> get<00:04:33.970> some<00:04:34.120> compression<00:04:35.039> lucky<00:04:36.039> for

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
actually get some compression lucky for

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.850 
actually get some compression lucky for
you<00:04:38.039> wonderful<00:04:39.039> pair<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:40.060> compression<00:04:40.570> tights

you wonderful pair of compression tights

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.180 
you wonderful pair of compression tights
so<00:04:41.860> they<00:04:42.009> are<00:04:42.099> really<00:04:42.430> really<00:04:43.030> tight<00:04:43.800> C<00:04:44.800> stands

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
so they are really really tight C stands

so they are really really tight C stands
for<00:04:45.280> compression<00:04:45.789> compression<00:04:46.599> brings<00:04:47.169> down

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
for compression compression brings down

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.260 
for compression compression brings down
swelling<00:04:47.800> by<00:04:47.919> stopping<00:04:48.280> fluid<00:04:48.729> collecting

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
swelling by stopping fluid collecting

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.420 
swelling by stopping fluid collecting
around<00:04:49.389> the<00:04:49.720> injury<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:50.349> there's<00:04:50.979> one<00:04:51.190> last

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
around the injury and there's one last

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.320 
around the injury and there's one last
step<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:53.440> at<00:04:53.530> night<00:04:53.740> I'll<00:04:54.340> elevate<00:04:55.180> this

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
step so at night I'll elevate this

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.060 
step so at night I'll elevate this
little<00:04:55.599> pillow<00:04:55.780> exactly<00:04:56.349> but<00:04:56.680> this<00:04:56.770> one<00:04:56.949> are

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
little pillow exactly but this one are

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.130 
little pillow exactly but this one are
just<00:04:57.099> people<00:04:57.639> perfect<00:04:58.030> as<00:04:58.360> is

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
just people perfect as is

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.920 
just people perfect as is
e<00:04:59.490> means<00:05:00.490> elevate<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.120> injury<00:05:01.450> above<00:05:01.780> the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
e means elevate the injury above the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.260 
e means elevate the injury above the
heart<00:05:02.170> so<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:02.800> any<00:05:02.980> fluid<00:05:03.430> moves<00:05:03.670> down<00:05:03.970> and

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
heart so that any fluid moves down and

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.880 
heart so that any fluid moves down and
away<00:05:04.660> from<00:05:04.720> the<00:05:05.080> injury<00:05:06.840> following<00:05:07.840> rice<00:05:08.380> can

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
away from the injury following rice can

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.130 
away from the injury following rice can
reduce<00:05:09.160> swelling<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.790> therefore<00:05:10.720> reduce

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
reduce swelling and therefore reduce

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.970 
reduce swelling and therefore reduce
pain<00:05:11.470> quickly<00:05:11.920> and<00:05:12.310> effectively

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.370
