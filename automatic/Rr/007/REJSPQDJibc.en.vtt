keeping<00:00:35.199> that<00:00:35.289> cool<00:00:35.559> I<00:00:36.539> got<00:00:37.539> four<00:00:37.809> inverters

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
keeping that cool I got four inverters

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.849 
keeping that cool I got four inverters
running<00:00:38.440> back<00:00:38.589> so<00:00:38.769> I<00:00:38.800> got<00:00:38.949> 500<00:00:39.609> and<00:00:39.699> 600<00:00:40.859> 250

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
running back so I got 500 and 600 250

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.799 
running back so I got 500 and 600 250
and<00:00:42.159> a<00:00:44.069> 308<00:00:45.100> I<00:00:45.370> mean<00:00:45.729> doesn't<00:00:46.089> do<00:00:46.179> much<00:00:46.359> more<00:00:46.629> to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
pumps working out well the hey were to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.590 
pumps working out well the hey were to
ego<00:01:59.259> pump<00:01:59.500> pretty<00:01:59.890> quiet<00:02:00.179> you<00:02:01.179> can<00:02:01.300> sell<00:02:01.479> it's
