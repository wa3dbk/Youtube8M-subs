also notice differences in application

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.799 
also notice differences in application
and<00:00:52.069> we<00:00:52.190> have<00:00:52.370> noticed<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.179> white<00:00:53.569> it's

and we have noticed it is white it's

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.509 
and we have noticed it is white it's
much<00:00:53.989> whiter<00:00:54.260> than<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.589> old<00:00:55.010> gloss<00:00:55.190> we<00:00:55.370> used

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
much whiter than the old gloss we used

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.369 
much whiter than the old gloss we used
to<00:00:55.639> use<00:00:55.850> when<00:00:56.359> the<00:00:56.479> painting<00:00:56.839> would<00:00:56.989> work<00:00:57.199> we

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
to use when the painting would work we

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.529 
to use when the painting would work we
find<00:00:57.799> that<00:00:57.949> it<00:00:58.069> covers<00:00:58.609> much<00:00:58.909> better

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
find that it covers much better

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.539 
find that it covers much better

we love it it's done the gloss gives a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.230 
we love it it's done the gloss gives a
