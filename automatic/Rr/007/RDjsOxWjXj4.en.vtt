00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.820
 hello that such friends are welcome to 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.110
 a new video tutorial of white without 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.059
 tourist and then on this occasion 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.010
 we will be bringing a browser later 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.260
 unattended that is a browser is 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.680
 attended good is a much more navigator 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.270
 much more fluid is based at the speed 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.910
 because they are removed 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.190
 characteristics that some others do not 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.890
 they have like that as the google 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.640
 chrome mozilla firefox internet explorer 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.890
 opera etc. not good since after 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.840
 these characteristics are removed as it 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.420
 it makes this browser a little faster 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.760
 now let's try it because that is the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.100
 porn browser is this lung 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.410
 is an unattended browser that 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.680
 I told them how to remove features 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.840
 and a lot of weight why because they arrive if 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.150
 right now I have the google chrome virtue and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.530
 we go to my task manager and 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.260
 well here it shows me that google 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.190
 chrome me from memory memory me 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.440
 grab 73.0 megabytes that's a lot is not 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.900
 a lot for a pc right now 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.040
 well the branch is very running 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.050
 because because I'm also doing 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.940
 that also that also has to do and 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.250
 well, in this comb, I'm a lot 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.410
 less will you spend from memory than in the 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.030
 google chrome like in this case then 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.650
 well, this is a browser 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.930
 totally unattended with some 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.940
 pretty good features to your 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.360
 speed then good this is the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.310
 32-bit 60-bit installer of all 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.900
 ways I bring you the 64 bit out there 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 I have it and I put the description 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.880
 to download it then good 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.770
 let's open the 32's installer 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.350
 bits and well I only want them 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.780
 give a warning once 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.480
 Only then, well, we're going to 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.690
 have new series that of the trailer of the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.700
 new series will be available 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.209
 available so they speak very very informally 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.330
 then good 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.520
 the trailer could be between 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.860
 a few days and a few days I do not tell 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.500
 exactly how but well then 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.390
 will be the trailer of the new series here 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.070
 we have the installer lemon pay serup 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.290
 good will be standard standard forgiveness 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.990
 standard installation would be 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.600
 by default not ending is in your 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.070
 local disk and the custom is for you 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.050
 you put the route where you want it 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.500
 install for example here from this 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.840
 address folder the destination folder to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.400
 stay in blogs and here in search in 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.560
 folder so here you look where the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.740
 you want to install then, well, good 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.630
 I'm going to give it back back and in standard 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.180
 as it would be by default today 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.430
 in next and prepare for installation 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.070
 here it gives you because it tells you where I'm going 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.410
 to install on that occasion then 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.840
 but not nothing else you give in great and you already 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.580
 they are installing to pay lehman then 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.520
 we are going to open this super browser 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.950
 unattended without much speed and 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.750
 Well, some features that are 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.150
 they remove that it is being then some 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.280
 unnecessary then well here we open 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.110
 the pedemonte now 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.459
 here it does not matter what lashes you have 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.220
 open let's say you have twitter 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.569
 open facebook or blog 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.670
 google + microsoft youtube etc. not and 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.310
 Well, well , down here, if you're going to 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.900
 task manager and here moves you 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.100
 Here he shows me what was coming 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.060
 pedemonte 59.2 megabytes and what 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.200
 it would be goingogle chrome 73 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.959
 it's a lot of difference then also what 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.090
 who brings this browser here 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.640
 as you can see it looks a lot like google 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.040
 mozilla firefox because let's see 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.620
 mozilla on this side already fixed as 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.900
 comes the mont then well this good 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.599
 is the mozilla then there is not much 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.690
 difference nothing more than that he is the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.209
 lemon is an unattended browser 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.220
 so then well let's see your 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.050
 characteristics what it has is the same 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.389
 only that I already told you that you 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.790
 remove features the moment 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.620
 Ivan and you sail a little faster 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.800
 because I'm going to show it 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.780
 in the case in mozilla or google chrome 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.389
 charge a little bit slower then 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.710
 here loads a little more fluid not 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.900
 so here we are going to search also 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.389
 youtube and as you can see it is a little 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.229
 faster faster they take off 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.210
 characteristics as I had already told you 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.460
 speed and so on is the same then 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.560
 here he gives you here they can put him also 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.479
 extensions or applications like mine 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.060
 I'll leave the description of all 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.949
 ways and well many more things 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.020
 like here in your downloads and so on 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.900
 well here I'm going to close because I'm going 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.400
 to open an advertisement that I do not want 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.100
 so for good this would be 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.320
 the pedemonte hope you like a 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.750
 browser totally unattended with 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.590
 impressive features in 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.229
 for speed and not many things that 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.300
 that would be taken into account then 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.520
 well this was all for today's video 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.320
 I hope you liked it and well 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.880
 if you do not notice the difference in what 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.820
 I would be the administrator of 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.979
 tasks like now you see and not no 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.960
 they are only taken in the administrator 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.700
 of tasks but they are taken in the 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.919
 speed also from the internet are going to 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.039
 say no but that almost the same as what 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.050
 that they make me some clone yes but what 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.720
 would be being in this browser because it is 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:56.580
 totally different for example 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:59.500
 back to google metro goal.com 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.330
 well it locked me up and so good here in 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.520
 Google, you can look for many things 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.580
 more than very fast of the seek 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.260
 then afterwards it called well for a 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.080
 unattended browser like this guy 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.550
 so then well this was all for the 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.289
 video tutorial I hope you have them 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.630
 liked is not going to notice so much of the 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.789
 difference in memory but yes in the 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.860
 speed then well then this was 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.599
