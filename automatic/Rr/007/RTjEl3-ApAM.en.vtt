click on the M to select it move it and
holding<00:03:00.930> down<00:03:00.990> shift<00:03:01.440> click<00:03:01.770> one<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.370> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
holding down shift click one of the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.509 
holding down shift click one of the
corner<00:03:02.730> nodes<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.180> drag<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.720> out<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.020> resize

corner nodes and drag it out to resize

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.009 
corner nodes and drag it out to resize
you<00:03:05.519> want<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.730> hold<00:03:05.880> down<00:03:06.030> shift<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:06.870> if

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
you want to hold down shift because if

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.210 
you want to hold down shift because if
you<00:03:07.170> don't<00:03:07.320> you'll<00:03:07.709> end<00:03:07.739> up<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.070> something

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
you don't you'll end up with something

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.500 
you don't you'll end up with something
like<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:09.290> or<00:03:10.290> like<00:03:10.560> this

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
like this or like this

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.030 
like this or like this
so<00:03:12.510> hold<00:03:12.690> down<00:03:12.720> shift<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.650> doesn't<00:03:13.920> get

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
so hold down shift so it doesn't get

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.600 
so hold down shift so it doesn't get
distorted<00:03:15.980> next<00:03:16.980> we're<00:03:17.100> gonna<00:03:17.160> move<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
distorted next we're gonna move the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.530 
distorted next we're gonna move the
couples<00:03:18.060> names<00:03:18.720> down<00:03:20.180> that's<00:03:21.180> actually<00:03:21.480> a

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
couples names down that's actually a

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.120 
couples names down that's actually a
pretty<00:03:21.690> good<00:03:21.810> size<00:03:22.019> already<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.890> I'm<00:03:22.980> going

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
pretty good size already but I'm going

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
pretty good size already but I'm going
to<00:03:23.160> make<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.670> little<00:03:23.700> bit<00:03:23.940> bigger

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
to make it just a little bit bigger

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.300 
to make it just a little bit bigger
holding<00:03:25.110> down<00:03:25.200> shift<00:03:25.470> again<00:03:28.010> finally<00:03:29.010> we'll

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
holding down shift again finally we'll

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:37.100 
holding down shift again finally we'll
want<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.549> move<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.820> date<00:03:30.000> into<00:03:30.330> place

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.620 

and<00:03:37.560> adjust<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.610> position<00:03:39.030> just<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.420> little

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
and adjust the position just a little

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.930 
and adjust the position just a little
bit<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:42.300> think<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.720> looks<00:03:42.930> pretty<00:03:43.020> good

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
bit and I think that looks pretty good

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.280 
bit and I think that looks pretty good
