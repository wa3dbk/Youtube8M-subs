00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that we couldn't find when we started at

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.360 
that we couldn't find when we started at
coin<00:01:01.170> assisted<00:01:01.559> learning<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.920> couldn't<00:01:02.190> find

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
coin assisted learning we couldn't find

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.799 
coin assisted learning we couldn't find
a<00:01:02.520> course<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.030> teach<00:01:03.210> us<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> do

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
a course that would teach us how to do

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.469 
a course that would teach us how to do
this<00:01:03.960> we<00:01:04.470> wanted<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.309> badly<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.360> we

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this we wanted to do it so badly so we

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.670 
this we wanted to do it so badly so we
thought<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.200> we're<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
thought you know what we're going to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
thought you know what we're going to
actually<00:01:08.280> develop<00:01:08.490> our<00:01:08.729> own<00:01:08.760> program<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
actually develop our own program and

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.179 
actually develop our own program and
we're<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.320> make<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.010> we

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
we're going to make it just the way we

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.600 
we're going to make it just the way we
want<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.360> based<00:01:12.689> in

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
want it and it's going to be based in

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.480 
want it and it's going to be based in
learning<00:01:14.610> objectives<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.420> outcomes<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.920> so

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
learning objectives and outcomes and so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.859 
learning objectives and outcomes and so
the<00:01:17.610> curriculum<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.330> easy<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.630> follow

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the curriculum is very easy to follow

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
the curriculum is very easy to follow
and<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> makes<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> unique<00:01:20.939> because

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and I think it makes you unique because

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
and I think it makes you unique because
anyone<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> ok<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.799> you're<00:01:23.040> gonna

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
anyone can do it ok and you're gonna

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.630 
anyone can do it ok and you're gonna
find<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.640> long<00:01:23.850> rope<00:01:24.950> find<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.159> long<00:01:26.340> rope

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
find the long rope find the long rope

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210 
find the long rope find the long rope
own<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> hold<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.439> put<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> in

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
own there you go and hold that put it in
