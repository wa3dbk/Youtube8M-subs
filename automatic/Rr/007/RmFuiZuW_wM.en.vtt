there's<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.369> whole<00:01:11.610> game<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> he

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
there's a whole game here I like that he

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.190 
there's a whole game here I like that he

so<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.830> Super<00:01:17.369> Nintendo<00:01:17.460> version<00:01:17.759> has<00:01:18.090> better

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so the Super Nintendo version has better

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
so the Super Nintendo version has better
graphics<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:19.049> wanted<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.439> version<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.340 
graphics but he wanted a version that
was<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.820> weird<00:01:21.540> thing<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.229> you're

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
was right weird thing to do where you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.630 
was right weird thing to do where you're
just<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.890> wonder<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.610> look

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just like I wonder what this would look

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
just like I wonder what this would look
like<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.210> yeah

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
like which yeah

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
like which yeah
it's<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.979> very<00:01:26.189> specific<00:01:26.700> niche<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it's a very specific niche you know I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.450

think<00:01:27.900> he's<00:01:28.080> called<00:01:28.380> Donkey<00:01:28.860> Kong<00:01:29.100> because

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
think he's called Donkey Kong because

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280
