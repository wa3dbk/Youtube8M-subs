00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 I want to greet you on this 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.259
 unscheduled video somehow unexpectedly on 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.809
 these thoughts flooded me quite logically 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.599
 but still pretty sharp and today I 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.849
 I would like to share them with you 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.570
 If you ask a question, why do you play 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.940
 this game 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 most will answer for fun 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 just spend your free time 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.170
 getting some positive 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 emotions i started the bird also module 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.699
 warfare 2 positive emotions studied 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.219
 play a lot of closed games with friends 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.020
 there are hundreds of excellent hours spent 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 of time 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.030
 then I more or less learn how to play mv3 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.800
 this already big ambitions went there 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.809
 some old people can sometimes hunt 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.649
 stuff some good match and then 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.260
 black ops 2 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.000
 it's just the pinnacle of aggression that you 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.920
 see on my channel actually 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 only positive tip of the iceberg 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.140
 everything goes smooth gameplay with great 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.690
 the pieces there are the perfect game all that but 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.930
 how does all this stuff know 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.070
 this is most friends 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.770
 I listen to soup and skype obscene 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.049
 replica during game two again 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.450
 put not very little pleasure 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.820
 the game of positive emotions is almost 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.909
 completely changed the game to the result 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.580
 changed very much yes maybe i want 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.049
 too much and that's what 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.259
 caused such a result because 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.200
 for example, I think that game is a bad match 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.380
 that 60 percent of players never 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.300
 will play and that's why probably 95 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.850
 percent of playing time is nerves 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.360
 nerves they buzz which logically should 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.720
 carry 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.940
 games of particular peaks this has reached in 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.190
 the last time can be what caused 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.659
 This video I even decided to somehow 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.390
 to tie something with the game 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.890
 certainly not one hundred percent but at least 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.960
 somehow reduce the amount of gaming 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.069
 time to slow down which I 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.369
 spend in the game 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.740
 but now if you think about what caused 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.539
 until most cases are some 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.509
 plucked scarce tricky by someone 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.530
 incomprehensible completely ridiculous death 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.470
 which happens some my 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.530
 serious mistakes but also quite often 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.140
 situations when the way of playing is annoying and 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.110
 this or that person now we are with you 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.480
 let's talk about this of course the game itself 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.060
 involves the use of all that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.489
 it has just been added nobody forbade 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.220
 take it 2 but let's sort it out 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.110
 the most annoying people of those from whom 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.700
 just involuntarily begins to burn and 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.430
 wild hate begins 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.500
 I think some will agree even more 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.470
 only many will agree with my selection 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.629
 at least some of its points 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.890
 while we watch my you clear gameplay 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.560
 by itself 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.720
 gandalf well 33 Hans track and at the end 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.970
 we make bets with a separate analysis 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.260
 every moment of what is now 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.180
 I will say for now let's get down to it 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.340
 the first is guys specialist machine guns 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.200
 who shoot with a laser absolutely 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.100
 all while not aiming station 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.720
 principled 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.610
 laurel as I said you can 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.290
 can be used differently 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.680
 so that he helped you a little 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.540
 in the game when it comes to aiming 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.140
 it's up to you to decide a ringlet on the far 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.180
 distances 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.190
 and some shoot drop 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.959
 fundamentally at any distance as if 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.970
 he is completely missing the right button 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.330
 mice here are honest enough 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.030
 straining strong second is the machine guns with 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.630
 sights trades pfander and thermal not 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.090
 especially distinguished 2 on 1 it really 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.459
 very annoying as such guys 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.680
 As a rule, they do not move at all. 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.959
 starts ruthlessly spray well or so 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.600
 moving barely again for the right 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.870
 I have any cases with the investor yes 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.690
 nothing illegal who promised 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.709
 the robot spoke but the greatest gusts 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.650
 i have my rage just such 3 min and 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.390
 betty tents furnished nothing for 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.310
 this again I do not have with what 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.470
 problems don't really arise because i 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.450
 I use tactical brain but in my opinion 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.220
 pretty ugly game technique by 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.299
 against the opponent use it 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.970
 you are in mines shockers and all that and but exactly 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.780
 at the same time part 4 these are mines on 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.209
 stairs 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.070
 I think it is unfinished or something 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.440
 moment of the game since practically 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.600
 impossible to survive cancellations be those lying 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.030
 on the stairs you lay she you all but 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.750
 killed there is purely a matter of luck 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.870
 annoying this moment 5 yes it sure 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.700
 same integral attribute of the game is one of 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.760
 ordinary weapons that can 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.560
 use but I often just have a pair 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.770
 furious when i kill with 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.800
 shotgun remington 870 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.470
 weapons based exclusively on luck 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.840
 don't need any main time skills 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.449
 the knife 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.550
 someone will say the left mouse button but how 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.070
 same skipjack cage weapon circulation 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.960
 which requires from you very strong 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.720
 game skills yes there to some extent 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.740
 also have rubber but play with it much 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.050
 more difficult 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.120
 and with the same shotgun its during 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.910
 click on the left mouse button 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.370
 if you 're lucky killed if not then you're cool 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:08.330
 stupid very imbalance i thing not 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.699
 requiring no skill playing clinton 6 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.889
 my collection will go drone hunter and 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.290
 machine again the speed of the river for 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.750
 novice players of course yes and they neither 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.970
 what is more and not stuffed but somehow 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.490
 hurt you know when you're tearing in there 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.300
 one murder swarm stupid because that 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.460
 someone could protect 30 annoying this 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.360
 moment seventh point 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:35.419
 special greetings to these guys without pain 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.430
 100 cap 40 on additional weapons in 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.770
 general runs such a guy portrays from 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.460
 yourself super sniper even now by 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.410
 take 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.780
 but misses you with a sniper 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.940
 rifle and the project begins quickly 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.669
 delivery on 40 okay if this happened 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.220
 once there was no luck guy well 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.690
 happens but no you go match there 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.789
 such a sniper and he time after time 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:58.070
 continues to miss and get like 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.380
 40 that there is quite a logical question 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.060
 why do you even use a sniper 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.690
 rifle on this class 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.760
 that's 8 last point try it 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.830
 means to run away from the enemy when injured 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.570
 or just hurry somewhere for example 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.750
 there kill opponents on the spawn and all 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.639
 Other there is a danger you have 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.410
 thinking about running into this house now and 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.889
 hide well or just in some sort 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.889
 pass 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:26.040
 but no, there is your teammate in the doorway 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.770
 who does not intend to move left and 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.050
 right not back him rush 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.210
 absolutely not where he lives absolutely 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.950
 measured life it means 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.470
 continues to stand pass you into it 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.350
 time being killed and shot doing with 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.690
 you anything in general guys blockers 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.760
 too much strain and now 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.580
 let's move on to examples of everything 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:52.050
 the above of which i am now 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:55.500
 I said I will not understand all situations here 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:07:03.320
 but here are the first days of this pp plan romance 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:06.740
 and now we have everybody's turn 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.740
 about 40 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.810
 I knock the map and of course how are we 

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.130
 do without bettina ladder 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.130
 furnished with shockers 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:35.639
 but on the queue and the gunner stargate 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:35.639
 fander 

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.479
 but especially smart guys who kim period 

00:07:56.289 --> 00:08:04.389
 guess even to the point that you are now 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:06.729
 You will see, and on this I have to finish everything 

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.409
 I would like to say these guys 

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:11.250
 let's not take a friend's game 

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:11.250
 let's live in peace
