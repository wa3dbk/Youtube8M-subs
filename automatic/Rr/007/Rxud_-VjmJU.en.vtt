00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.009
 I sincerely never thought that the process 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.639
 it was so simple and simple 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.090
 Here I show you android and the living 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.090
 running in my experience 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.910
 the new lock screen in 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.200
 I particularly like 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:28.000
 what have you been sliding 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.000
 down or up 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.630
 good 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.940
 we are going to adjustments 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.420
 we go to phone information 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.530
 and here you can see 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.990
 Android version 41.4 point 1.2 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.110
 we give it hot 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.110
 Y 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 the new options that it has then 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.740
 they improved in this part of here I do not know 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.740
 what is your name 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.149
 to install the widgets 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.460
 they added 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 option for you to last a little longer the 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 battery in mine mode 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.439
 the mode of this mine is when 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.479
 deactivates the wave turns off the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 Mobile data 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.700
 if I'm not mistaken the bluetooth also and 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.530
 quite pretty is this stuff that you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.490
 They consume energy when on the screen 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.490
 of your cell phone is blocked 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.270
 the advantage the advantage is that it saves you 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.549
 quite a pretty battery and the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.890
 disadvantages that you can not or are not going to 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.530
 to be able to receive the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.530
 notifications if you have the whatsapp 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.370
 and facebook twitter or any other 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.790
 application that connects internet 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.980
 but you are going to continue 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.440
 receiving your calls from a message from 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.850
 text 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.220
 the basics what matters most to us in this 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.190
 Android version is to have the permissions 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:36.350
 of superuser or root access 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.600
 I have permission, take out the supervisor and you 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.550
 I'll prove we enter the end 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.500
 and we wrote the south command 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.829
 I do not know if you see we write your 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.010
 people 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.010
 but I am 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.459
 I have permission from his person 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.540
 like how I had that good as I said to the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.370
 start I never thought it would be so ever 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.969
 I thought it would be process is so simple 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.280
 and simple the only thing I did was 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:15.489
 update update the system 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.239
 operative android connected to a network 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.390
 wifi does not authorize it and nothing else to do it 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.950
 update do not lose root do not delay 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.389
 of ruth and how can they update it 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.810
 I suppose here up 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.319
 in the panel shows that there is 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.829
 a new one there is a new version of 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.639
 android 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:39.930
 that is, if it does not appear you are going to 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.930
 menu go 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.810
 if they go to the menu and look for the center 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.810
 to update 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.080
 it's in law and they go to the system there 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.270
 to have to appear 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.730
 There is a new version of Android 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.420
 update and update it always be 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.460
 connected by a good wifi network I what 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.130
 actor and dry state connected new no 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.880
 you lost it from the computer you did not 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:22.630
 I can say if it works 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.220
 updating the software from the same 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.760
 computer I do not know 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.760
 but 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.710
 but if you are connected in the network 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.610
 Wifi 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:39.439
 do not lose the root 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:44.479
 well that would be that would be all apologize 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:48.080
 for delaying me so much in uploading the video and 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:51.379
 well thank you very much I will try to compensate 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.189
 the lost time and goodbye until a 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.189
 new opportunity
