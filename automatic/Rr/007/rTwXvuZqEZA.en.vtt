a<00:01:22.870> good<00:01:23.080> syrup<00:01:23.500> device<00:01:23.800> let's<00:01:24.190> take<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> bite<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
a good syrup device let's take a bite it

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.440 
a good syrup device let's take a bite it
was<00:01:27.550> actually<00:01:27.790> crispier<00:01:28.120> than<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.300> thought<00:01:28.390> it

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
was actually crispier than I thought it

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.780 
was actually crispier than I thought it
would<00:01:28.510> be<00:01:28.690> like<00:01:29.050> inside<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.470> waffle<00:01:29.800> it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
would be like inside the waffle it

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.730 
would be like inside the waffle it
worked<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.240> because<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.630> bacon<00:01:32.500> was<00:01:32.530> only

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
worked and because the bacon was only

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.740 
worked and because the bacon was only
partially<00:01:33.010> cooked<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.790> sleek<00:01:34.420> tizzalicious

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
partially cooked it sleek tizzalicious

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.590 
partially cooked it sleek tizzalicious
bacony<00:01:35.380> goodness<00:01:35.530> into<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.220> waffle<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.880> think

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
bacony goodness into the waffle I think

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.210 
bacony goodness into the waffle I think
in<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.750> future<00:01:37.780> we<00:01:38.110> want<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.380> bacon<00:01:38.920> be<00:01:39.010> even

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
in the future we want the bacon be even

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.950 
in the future we want the bacon be even
crispier<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.880> think<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.270> could<00:01:40.390> also<00:01:40.510> stand<00:01:40.780> for

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
crispier I think it could also stand for

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.570 
crispier I think it could also stand for
it<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.110> have<00:01:41.200> more<00:01:41.440> bacon<00:01:41.800> there<00:01:42.280> can<00:01:42.460> always

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
it to have more bacon there can always

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.280 
it to have more bacon there can always
happen<00:01:42.820> for<00:01:43.030> me<00:01:43.120> yeah<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.300> mean<00:01:43.540> how<00:01:43.840> often<00:01:44.050> do

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
happen for me yeah I mean how often do

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.050 
happen for me yeah I mean how often do
you<00:01:44.320> say<00:01:44.530> that<00:01:44.740> every<00:01:44.920> day<00:01:45.190> I<00:01:45.430> wonder<00:01:45.820> what

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
you say that every day I wonder what

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.670 
you say that every day I wonder what
else<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.540> could<00:01:46.810> do<00:01:46.930> with<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.200> technique

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
else you could do with this technique

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.560 
else you could do with this technique
yeah<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.860> didn't<00:01:54.100> use<00:01:54.280> actual<00:01:54.850> fried<00:01:55.210> chicken

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
yeah we didn't use actual fried chicken

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.880 
yeah we didn't use actual fried chicken
because<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.840> bones<00:01:55.990> would<00:01:56.260> be<00:01:56.350> a<00:01:56.380> problem<00:01:56.620> so

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
because the bones would be a problem so

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.620 
because the bones would be a problem so
we<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.130> have<00:01:57.220> some<00:01:57.490> chicken<00:01:57.730> finger<00:01:58.240> type

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
we just have some chicken finger type
