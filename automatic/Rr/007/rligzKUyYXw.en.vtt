so<00:00:00.870> i<00:00:01.319> just<00:00:01.829> thought<00:00:02.220> i<00:00:02.250> would<00:00:02.550> do<00:00:02.730> another

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
so i just thought i would do another

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.820 
so i just thought i would do another
theory<00:00:03.419> video<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.810> last<00:00:04.020> theory<00:00:04.319> video<00:00:04.589> i<00:00:04.650> did

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
theory video the last theory video i did

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.179 
theory video the last theory video i did

mention has been brought up several

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.019 
mention has been brought up several

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
times in a few videos here and there but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
times in a few videos here and there but
I<00:00:27.210> want<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> give<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.869> own<00:00:28.279> not<00:00:29.279> only<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.580> own

I want to give my own not only my own

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.999 
I want to give my own not only my own
theory<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.779> also<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.230> version<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.769> this

theory on it but also my version of this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.389 
theory on it but also my version of this
theory<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.730> how<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> could<00:00:34.200> possibly<00:00:34.320> work<00:00:34.800> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
theory and how I could possibly work so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.479 
theory and how I could possibly work so
keep<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> mind<00:00:36.030> um<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.850> uh<00:00:39.649> this<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:41.280> tha

this<00:00:41.670> story<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:43.350> theory<00:00:43.590> excuse<00:00:44.040> me<00:00:44.190> again

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
this story this theory excuse me again

this story this theory excuse me again
revolves<00:00:45.450> around<00:00:45.539> lapis<00:00:46.079> Lasley<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> how<00:00:47.670> she

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
revolves around lapis Lasley and how she

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450 
revolves around lapis Lasley and how she
got<00:00:48.270> trapped<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> mirror<00:00:49.200> now<00:00:49.770> she<00:00:50.250> did

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
got trapped in the mirror now she did

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
got trapped in the mirror now she did
say<00:00:50.730> once<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.329> know<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.070> one

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
say once that you know that one the one

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.889 
say once that you know that one the one
big<00:00:53.399> thing<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:54.210> for<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.480> theory<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
big thing I have for this theory is that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.500 
big thing I have for this theory is that
she<00:00:55.620> said<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.370> know<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.000> gems<00:00:57.270> never

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
she said that you know the gems never

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.029 
she said that you know the gems never
care<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.899> know<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.199> gems<00:00:58.440> only<00:00:58.710> cared<00:00:58.949> about

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
care you know the gems only cared about

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.799 
care you know the gems only cared about
the<00:00:59.250> earth<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.789> she<00:01:00.000> never<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.480> believed

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
the earth but she never really believed

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.560 
the earth but she never really believed
in<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.109> place<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:02.219> theory<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.879> she<00:01:03.329> was

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
in this place my theory is that she was

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
in this place my theory is that she was
part<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.140> crystal<00:01:04.530> gem<00:01:04.769> she<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.339> part<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
part of the crystal gem she was part of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
part of the crystal gem she was part of
roses<00:01:06.119> faction<00:01:06.630> during<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> during<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.619> gym

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
roses faction during the during the gym

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.120 
roses faction during the during the gym
war<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.970> what<00:01:09.180> happened<00:01:09.689> was<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.650> rut<00:01:11.100> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
war but what happened was that rut that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
war but what happened was that rut that
a<00:01:11.430> lapis<00:01:12.119> didn't<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> lot<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
a lapis didn't really have a lot of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.200 
a lapis didn't really have a lot of
faith<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.590> lapis<00:01:14.040> didn't<00:01:14.280> Laden<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
faith in it lapis didn't Laden have a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.960 
faith in it lapis didn't Laden have a
lot<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> faith<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.170> earth<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:17.040> Rose<00:01:17.430> did

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
lot of faith in the earth like Rose did

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.510 
lot of faith in the earth like Rose did
alongside<00:01:18.390> pearl<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.080> garnet<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:20.400> know

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
alongside pearl and garnet and you know

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.120 
alongside pearl and garnet and you know
amethyst<00:01:21.119> well<00:01:21.299> amethyst<00:01:21.750> didn't<00:01:21.930> really<00:01:22.130> go

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
amethyst well amethyst didn't really go

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.609 
amethyst well amethyst didn't really go
into<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.490> war<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> assume<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
into the war that we kind of assume that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.200 
into the war that we kind of assume that
amethyst<00:01:26.009> wasn't<00:01:26.400> part<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> war<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
amethyst wasn't part of the war for a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
amethyst wasn't part of the war for a
long<00:01:27.420> time<00:01:27.720> if<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.950> she<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
long time if at all or was she at the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.140 
long time if at all or was she at the
end<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.570> tail<00:01:30.780> end<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.200> it

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
end of it you know the tail end of it

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.569 
end of it you know the tail end of it
but<00:01:33.150> anyway<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.740> my<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.340> thinking

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
but anyway so that's my kind of thinking

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.050 
but anyway so that's my kind of thinking
right<00:01:35.850> here<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:36.360> lapis<00:01:36.840> was<00:01:37.680> part<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
right here is that lapis was part of the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
right here is that lapis was part of the
you<00:01:39.540> know<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.840> crystal<00:01:40.200> gem<00:01:40.439> faction

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you know the crystal gem faction

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.100 
you know the crystal gem faction
fighting<00:01:41.369> against<00:01:41.640> homeworld<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.689> really

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
fighting against homeworld but really

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.850 
fighting against homeworld but really
she<00:01:43.770> felt<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.939> I

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
she felt like I

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.550 
she felt like I
this<00:01:46.730> does<00:01:46.970> not<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.510> know<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.990> whole<00:01:48.050> this

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
this does not you know this whole this

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.950 
this does not you know this whole this
seems<00:01:48.980> like<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.130> lost<00:01:49.370> cause<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.060> how<00:01:50.510> she<00:01:50.570> kind

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
seems like a lost cause and how she kind

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.170 
seems like a lost cause and how she kind
of<00:01:51.050> work<00:01:51.350> paces<00:01:51.950> herself<00:01:52.310> around<00:01:52.550> homeworld

X amount of time to heal themselves kind

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.540 
X amount of time to heal themselves kind
of<00:02:39.380> like<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.680> that's<00:02:39.980> what<00:02:40.160> I'm<00:02:40.250> kind<00:02:40.489> of

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
of like that that's what I'm kind of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.430 
of like that that's what I'm kind of
thinking<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.000> she<00:02:41.330> went<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.750> kind<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.290> her

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
thinking is that she went it kind of her

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.030 
thinking is that she went it kind of her
version<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:42.920> stasis<00:02:43.250> lock<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.770> that's<00:02:45.770> what

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
version of stasis lock and that's what

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.620 
version of stasis lock and that's what
was<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.430> everyone<00:02:46.700> just<00:02:46.850> kind<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.390> forgot

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
was and everyone just kind of forgot

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.150 
was and everyone just kind of forgot
about<00:02:47.690> her<00:02:48.080> she<00:02:48.410> was<00:02:48.530> just<00:02:48.560> kind<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.860> put<00:02:49.070> in

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
about her she was just kind of put in

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.699 
about her she was just kind of put in
that<00:02:49.310> mirror<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.290> everyone<00:02:51.290> just<00:02:51.320> seemed<00:02:51.590> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
that mirror and everyone just seemed to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.140 
that mirror and everyone just seemed to
forget<00:02:51.830> about<00:02:52.070> her<00:02:52.280> because<00:02:53.049> that<00:02:54.049> or<00:02:55.150> lapis

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
tried to turn against the crystal gems

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.140 
tried to turn against the crystal gems
tried<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.130> get<00:02:58.280> back<00:02:58.400> with<00:02:58.549> homeworld<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
tried to get back with homeworld and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.259 
tried to get back with homeworld and
Rose<00:03:00.160> along<00:03:01.160> with<00:03:01.310> pearl<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:01.820> garden<00:03:02.120> and

Rose along with pearl and garden and
several<00:03:02.570> other<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.930> crystal<00:03:03.260> gems<00:03:03.500> had<00:03:04.220> to

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
several other the crystal gems had to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.600 
several other the crystal gems had to
put<00:03:05.360> her<00:03:05.450> down<00:03:05.660> they<00:03:05.989> had<00:03:06.140> to<00:03:06.290> crack<00:03:07.100> her<00:03:07.280> gem

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
put her down they had to crack her gem

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.449 
put her down they had to crack her gem
keep<00:03:08.420> her<00:03:08.570> from<00:03:08.750> regenerating<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.680> sealer<00:03:10.370> in

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
keep her from regenerating and sealer in

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.020 
keep her from regenerating and sealer in
that<00:03:10.580> mirror<00:03:11.350> so<00:03:12.350> that's<00:03:13.010> kind<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.610> theory

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
that mirror so that's kind of the theory

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.360 
that mirror so that's kind of the theory
I'm<00:03:14.120> working<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:14.570> right<00:03:14.630> now<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.320> again<00:03:15.980> this

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
I'm working on right now but again this

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.490 
I'm working on right now but again this
is<00:03:16.549> just<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.850> theory<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:17.630> it's<00:03:17.810> wrong<00:03:18.110> then

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
is just a theory and if it's wrong then

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.410 
is just a theory and if it's wrong then
yeah<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.790> then<00:03:20.060> by<00:03:20.420> all<00:03:20.450> means<00:03:20.600> I

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
yeah it then by all means I

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.010 
yeah it then by all means I
I<00:03:22.620> fully<00:03:23.620> admit<00:03:23.770> I<00:03:23.950> was<00:03:24.190> wrong<00:03:24.370> i<00:03:24.610> willfully

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
I fully admit I was wrong i willfully

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.089 
I fully admit I was wrong i willfully
absolutely<00:03:26.020> one<00:03:26.200> hundred<00:03:26.230> percent<00:03:26.470> MIT<00:03:26.860> I<00:03:26.950> was

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
absolutely one hundred percent MIT I was

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.670 
absolutely one hundred percent MIT I was
wrong<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.810> know<00:03:28.870> some<00:03:29.319> people<00:03:29.349> would<00:03:29.620> say

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
wrong and I know some people would say

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.670 
wrong and I know some people would say
well<00:03:30.150> Eddie's<00:03:31.150> dead<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.989> does<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.349> mean<00:03:32.560> the

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
well Eddie's dead so does that mean the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.920 
well Eddie's dead so does that mean the
cobalt<00:03:33.040> blue<00:03:33.130> theories<00:03:33.610> is<00:03:33.910> gone<00:03:34.209> too<00:03:34.480> not

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
cobalt blue theories is gone too not

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.720 
cobalt blue theories is gone too not
necessarily<00:03:35.500> just<00:03:35.980> want<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.280> touch<00:03:36.489> on<00:03:36.670> that

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
necessarily just want to touch on that

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.760 
necessarily just want to touch on that
real<00:03:37.030> quick<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.360> cobalt<00:03:37.870> blue<00:03:37.989> theory<00:03:38.500> is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
real quick the cobalt blue theory is

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.229 
real quick the cobalt blue theory is
kind<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.160> still<00:03:39.370> there<00:03:39.550> with<00:03:39.670> Eddie<00:03:39.850> because

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
kind of still there with Eddie because

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.699 
kind of still there with Eddie because
some<00:03:40.450> people<00:03:40.660> are<00:03:40.690> speculating<00:03:41.080> that<00:03:41.440> Eddie

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
some people are speculating that Eddie

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.400 
some people are speculating that Eddie
may<00:03:41.980> come<00:03:42.220> back<00:03:42.370> in<00:03:42.700> season<00:03:42.940> do<00:03:43.270> that<00:03:44.020> could<00:03:44.260> be

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
may come back in season do that could be

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.199 
may come back in season do that could be
a<00:03:44.650> possibility<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.610> that's<00:03:45.819> enough<00:03:46.030> about

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
a possibility so that's enough about

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.000 
a possibility so that's enough about
that<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:47.200> yeah<00:03:47.319> that's<00:03:47.470> what<00:03:47.650> I'm<00:03:47.739> kind<00:03:47.950> of

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
that but yeah that's what I'm kind of

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.949 
that but yeah that's what I'm kind of
the<00:03:48.160> but<00:03:48.310> getting<00:03:48.489> back<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.670> lapis<00:03:49.150> lazuli<00:03:49.450> I

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
the but getting back to lapis lazuli I

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.809 
the but getting back to lapis lazuli I
think<00:03:50.410> that's<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.500> that's<00:03:54.370> my

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
think that's the that's the that's my

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.670 
think that's the that's the that's my
theory<00:03:55.090> that's<00:03:55.390> my<00:03:55.630> goat<00:03:55.989> my<00:03:56.230> going<00:03:56.560> on

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
theory that's my goat my going on

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.650 
theory that's my goat my going on
theories<00:03:57.100> that<00:03:57.310> she<00:03:57.580> was<00:03:57.790> on<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> side<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.420> the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
theories that she was on the side of the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.890 
theories that she was on the side of the
rose<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.410> others<00:03:59.680> lost<00:04:00.370> her<00:04:00.580> nerve<00:04:00.900> went

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
rose and the others lost her nerve went

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.930 
rose and the others lost her nerve went
crawling<00:04:02.200> back<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.530> homeworld<00:04:03.100> homeworld

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
crawling back to homeworld homeworld

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.979 
crawling back to homeworld homeworld
tried<00:04:04.299> to<00:04:04.420> give<00:04:04.540> her<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.690> chance<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.319> yeah

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
tried to give her a chance and yeah

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.960 
tried to give her a chance and yeah
shenanigans<00:04:07.989> ensue<00:04:08.459> because<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.580> see<00:04:09.790> her

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
shenanigans ensue because you see her

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.880 
shenanigans ensue because you see her
she's<00:04:10.269> very<00:04:10.360> terrified<00:04:11.080> of<00:04:11.230> homeworld<00:04:11.650> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
she's very terrified of homeworld and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.740 
she's very terrified of homeworld and
wants<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.730> even<00:04:13.090> though<00:04:13.239> she<00:04:13.299> wants<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:13.660> go

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
wants to even though she wants to go

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.780 
wants to even though she wants to go
back<00:04:13.900> to<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:14.319> because<00:04:14.620> she's<00:04:14.950> very<00:04:15.130> even

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
back to it because she's very even

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.740 
back to it because she's very even
though<00:04:15.880> she's<00:04:16.150> probably<00:04:16.419> one<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.630> those

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
though she's probably one of those

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.650 
though she's probably one of those
powerful<00:04:17.169> gems<00:04:17.560> we've<00:04:17.769> seen<00:04:18.040> pretty<00:04:18.729> much<00:04:18.790> she

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
powerful gems we've seen pretty much she

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.360 
powerful gems we've seen pretty much she
would<00:04:19.750> get<00:04:19.900> probably<00:04:20.229> give<00:04:20.380> Katara<00:04:20.769> run<00:04:21.160> for

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
would get probably give Katara run for

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.650 
would get probably give Katara run for
her<00:04:21.430> money<00:04:22.860> but<00:04:23.860> she's<00:04:24.250> still<00:04:24.580> very<00:04:24.880> scared<00:04:25.570> of

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
her money but she's still very scared of

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.990 
her money but she's still very scared of
homeworld<00:04:26.080> and<00:04:26.260> what<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.700> especially<00:04:27.700> what

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
homeworld and what the especially what

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.930 
homeworld and what the especially what
the<00:04:28.120> diamonds<00:04:28.479> would<00:04:28.900> do<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.770> her<00:04:29.950> in<00:04:30.370> this

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the diamonds would do to her in this

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.230 
the diamonds would do to her in this
kind<00:04:31.180> of<00:04:31.240> predicament<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.880> that's<00:04:33.880> kind<00:04:34.180> of

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
kind of predicament so that's kind of

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.640 
kind of predicament so that's kind of
that's<00:04:34.390> what<00:04:34.690> I'm<00:04:34.720> kind<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.110> thinking<00:04:35.289> is<00:04:35.590> that

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
that's what I'm kind of thinking is that

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.969 
that's what I'm kind of thinking is that
uh<00:04:36.630> despite<00:04:37.630> all<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:37.840> her<00:04:37.990> powers<00:04:38.350> she's<00:04:38.650> still

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
uh despite all of her powers she's still

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.520 
uh despite all of her powers she's still
scared<00:04:39.520> of<00:04:39.700> homeworld<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.479> just<00:04:40.810> went<00:04:41.050> yeah

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
scared of homeworld and just went yeah

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.779 
scared of homeworld and just went yeah
I'll<00:04:41.860> fight<00:04:42.190> for<00:04:42.460> Earth<00:04:43.020> right<00:04:44.020> oh<00:04:44.289> oh<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.640> is

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
I'll fight for Earth right oh oh this is

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.159 
I'll fight for Earth right oh oh this is
what<00:04:45.940> happens<00:04:46.270> when<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.750> is<00:04:46.810> what<00:04:46.930> they<00:04:47.110> do

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
what happens when this is what they do

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.860 
what happens when this is what they do
to<00:04:47.380> traitors<00:04:47.590> I'm<00:04:48.070> just<00:04:48.370> gonna<00:04:48.660> can<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.690> come

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
to traitors I'm just gonna can I come

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.940 
to traitors I'm just gonna can I come
back<00:04:50.080> guys<00:04:50.350> ok<00:04:51.630> so<00:04:52.630> that's<00:04:53.169> my<00:04:53.380> working<00:04:53.740> theory

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
back guys ok so that's my working theory

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.980 
back guys ok so that's my working theory
again<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.580> could<00:04:54.880> be<00:04:55.000> completely<00:04:55.210> wrong<00:04:55.630> on

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
again I could be completely wrong on

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.800 
again I could be completely wrong on
this<00:04:56.229> and<00:04:56.580> I'll<00:04:57.580> be<00:04:58.000> cool<00:04:58.390> with<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.750> was

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
this and I'll be cool with it it was

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.830 
this and I'll be cool with it it was
just<00:04:59.080> a<00:04:59.200> little<00:04:59.500> fan<00:04:59.830> theory<00:05:00.280> anyway<00:05:01.120> but<00:05:01.720> you

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
just a little fan theory anyway but you

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.480 
just a little fan theory anyway but you
guys<00:05:01.960> tell<00:05:02.260> me<00:05:02.289> what<00:05:02.680> do<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.830> guys<00:05:02.979> think<00:05:03.039> is
