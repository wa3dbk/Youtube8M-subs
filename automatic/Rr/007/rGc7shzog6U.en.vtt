00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.110
 hi i will show you today how 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.250
 pass yourself an end and you can 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.630
 for example, use next week 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.949
 before Easter 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.350
 seems to say this is really one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.960
 cooking technique that I never did well 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 you can really use all possible tactics and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 techniques used and tips 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.859
 it makes me add to vortex 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.529
 when women are in the cooking water 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 try of pleasure from egg sachet 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.950
 I succeeded and I finally have one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.110
 technology found that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.520
 is fool proof and who I almost do 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.170
 ca n't fail and I'll go today 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.370
 show you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.350
 the only thing you need is 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.010
 little bit of nature there are of course 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.930
 a tire with with water and ice and 2 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.340
 tablespoons and those tablespoons whole 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.329
 important because that is certainly possible 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.710
 the cat succeeds 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 well we were going to start it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.730
 a large pan that we set up Coming up 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 fire pub some boiling water with you 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 in a little bit the end is that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.480
 I am going to use I have broken in my 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
 mug in the egg yolk is still that money 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.479
 is very important 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.010
 once the ai breaks through you you have nothing 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.180
 more your poached egg because then it works 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 Just no 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.650
 this is a big one that i fear it again 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.570
 and there I am about to leave her 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.570
 one and a half boiling water 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.810
 and so we bring you very gently 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.370
 boil it is important at it 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.980
 passing eggs that you do not water 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.290
 very wild bubble so not very coarse 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:42.000
 just buy that you're happy to blaze 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.620
 boil by the water for an hour 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.120
 we add about a tablespoon of nature 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.970
 and this ensures that it will later 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:53.820
 protein fast stops such a poached egg 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.950
 only needs a moment and of course 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.690
 if we were to protein so long 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 then your own is very hard and 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.220
 That is precisely why you can bleed 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.000
 one passed its so chic start it 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.530
 water thus very small fine yesterday 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.820
 a little softer because I think so 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.560
 without going much harder and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.560
 meanwhile bakkum so 2 tablespoons 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.100
 and with these tablespoons I go for it 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.540
 make sure I get that protein because it runs 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.670
 of course a bit off like that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.830
 in this water I pour that protein one 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.590
 bit to fold the egg yolk so that the 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.690
 nice package 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.810
 well the water 7 pleasure bubbles 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.610
 very slightly so still league the end 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.570
 and then I go with the out or 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.570
 with the tablespoons in progress 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:49.650
 very carefully and fry the tablespoons 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.780
 We made a mistake very carefully it 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.780
 protein to one's own youth 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.480
 where you think it 's your own good 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.870
 enough is four minutes I think is the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.670
 max 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.670
 then I remove it with a skimmer 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.150
 bank miss I now use a spaghetti 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.060
 10 very carefully see rios you look 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.290
 then I put it on a piece 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.239
 kitchen roll to drain though 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.879
 careful because the egg yolk is 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.430
 of course very fragile 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.870
 so meanwhile you herd the sandra 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.739
 to correct whether its going with the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.420
 rest of the dish 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.220
 well this egg has been corrected I see 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.269
 okay to me but it is 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.400
 of course it meant 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.370
 actually the from stein god once you get that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.079
 he turns to it in half so cuts 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.310
 we are going to test it now, just him 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.139
 I put your skill on a plate 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.150
 poached egg naturally everywhere 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.519
 but I want to use you now only 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.829
 place your bid so that moment here 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.000
 people very submissively met it must 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.000
 the egg yolk run out 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.430
 he is perfect the protein is a bit 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.319
 say a little bit of elastic laughter 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.579
 little common with the yolk so 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.239
 still completely liquid that is exactly 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.239
 what you want 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.590
 that was one you could see it 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.030
 making or passing one actually 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.949
 very easy and with this 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.780
 technology I could even do it and 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:18.840
 and like king beginning of the video already 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.329
 I said, I have tried this many times 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.310
 this is maybe well maybe the 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.900
 tenth time I import an a then 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.789
 finally succeeded and that was with the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.260
 technology I just showed 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.229
 use it for example next week 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.760
 surprise for about tasty salad 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.740
 at least enough recipes will come 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.050
 from soon on which I have a 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.909
 use poached egg and now you can 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.110
 also for now thank you for it 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.860
 and I'll see you next time 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.860
 again
