00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.720 

so<00:00:11.850> what<00:00:12.000> I'm<00:00:12.120> drawing<00:00:12.330> here<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:13.730> centerline

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
so what I'm drawing here is centerline

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.600 
so what I'm drawing here is centerline
because<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.619> plan<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.920> effectively

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
because the plan is effectively

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.500 
because the plan is effectively
symmetrical<00:00:18.510> I'm<00:00:19.470> putting<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.610> dashed<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
symmetrical I'm putting a dashed and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.650 
symmetrical I'm putting a dashed and
dotted<00:00:21.810> line<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.260> through<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.680> center<00:00:23.099> and

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
dotted line up through the center and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
dotted line up through the center and
it's<00:00:24.660> around<00:00:25.430> this<00:00:26.430> line<00:00:27.109> that<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.640> sections

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
it's around this line that the sections

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
it's around this line that the sections
the<00:00:30.470> elevation<00:00:31.470> views<00:00:32.180> will<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.300> based<00:00:33.570> be

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the elevation views will be based be

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
the elevation views will be based be
based<00:00:34.680> from<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:38.370> views<00:00:39.050> up<00:00:40.430> looking<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.580> the

in the front the front wall the section
of<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> will<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:53.940> stepped<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.700> it<00:00:56.700> comes

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of that will be stepped so that it comes

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.560 
of that will be stepped so that it comes
halfway<00:00:57.840> through<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.039> arch<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.640> left<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the right of the plan so if you follow

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.430 
the right of the plan so if you follow
that<00:01:06.180> line<00:01:06.450> across<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.590> steps<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.160> on<00:01:08.580> the

that line across and a steps up on the
centerline<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.640> come<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.180> part

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
centerline and then come to a part

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.140 
centerline and then come to a part
across<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:15.799> take<00:01:16.799> those<00:01:17.070> two<00:01:18.170> views<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
across and we take those two views and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
across and we take those two views and
composite<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.270> together<00:01:21.450> around<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
composite them together around the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.460 
composite them together around the
centerline<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.299> detail<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
centerline and you then get detail and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.010 
centerline and you then get detail and
you<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> extra<00:01:26.640> detail<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.780> need

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
you get the extra detail that you need

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.649 
you get the extra detail that you need
and<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.530> help<00:01:29.450> construction<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and that will help construction of the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
and that will help construction of the
project<00:01:30.869> later<00:01:31.170> on

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.310 

I<00:01:38.390> better<00:01:39.390> label<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> project<00:01:40.340> now<00:01:41.930> plan<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
I better label the project now plan and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.500 
I better label the project now plan and
as<00:01:43.680> always<00:01:44.580> with<00:01:44.820> labels<00:01:45.210> put<00:01:45.659> into<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:48.210> soft

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
as always with labels put into the soft

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.070 
as always with labels put into the soft
construction<00:01:49.110> lines<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:51.080> the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
construction lines so that the the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.480 
construction lines so that the the
lettering<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.680> always<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.580> same<00:01:57.450> size

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
lettering is always the the same size

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.290 
lettering is always the the same size
depending<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.610> importance<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
depending on the importance of the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.230 
depending on the importance of the
lettering<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.910> regular<00:02:02.910> if<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.960> don't<00:02:04.200> use

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
lettering and regular if you don't use

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.070 
lettering and regular if you don't use
construction<00:02:06.240> lines<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.690> lettering

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
construction lines for the lettering

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
construction lines for the lettering
then<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> will<00:02:07.770> start<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.160> get<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:09.950> bit<00:02:10.950> messy

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.339 

you

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.690 

so<00:02:28.040> now<00:02:28.219> you<00:02:28.280> can<00:02:28.489> see<00:02:30.099> at<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.280> end<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.519> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
so now you can see at the end of the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.000 
so now you can see at the end of the
this<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.599> section<00:02:32.959> lines<00:02:33.170> those<00:02:33.530> dashed<00:02:33.829> and

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
this the section lines those dashed and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.030 
this the section lines those dashed and
dotted<00:02:34.250> lines<00:02:35.439> I've<00:02:36.609> drawn<00:02:37.609> some<00:02:37.640> circles<00:02:39.040> and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
dotted lines I've drawn some circles and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.369 
dotted lines I've drawn some circles and
now<00:02:40.310> what<00:02:40.519> I'm<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.239> do<00:02:41.719> with<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
now what I'm going to do with the

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.690 
now what I'm going to do with the
circles<00:02:42.890> is<00:02:43.819> connect<00:02:44.450> them<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.010> lies<00:02:46.250> and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
circles is connect them to the lies and

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:58.600 
circles is connect them to the lies and
in<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.239> direction<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.900> they're<00:02:48.170> going

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.440 

now<00:02:59.330> what<00:02:59.480> I'm<00:02:59.630> doing<00:02:59.660> is<00:03:01.150> turning<00:03:02.150> those

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
now what I'm doing is turning those

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.320 
now what I'm doing is turning those
circles<00:03:02.990> into<00:03:03.470> arrows<00:03:05.500> you<00:03:06.500> can<00:03:06.680> point<00:03:07.100> in

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
circles into arrows you can point in

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.910 
circles into arrows you can point in
directions<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:09.260> sections<00:03:09.770> will<00:03:10.010> indicate

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
directions the sections will indicate

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.050 
directions the sections will indicate
when<00:03:15.070> that's<00:03:16.070> complete<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:19.400> I'll<00:03:19.550> start<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
when that's complete what I'll start to

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.160 
when that's complete what I'll start to
do<00:03:20.210> is<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:21.020> instil<00:03:21.560> label<00:03:22.060> sections<00:03:25.000> using<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
do is to instil label sections using the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.520 
do is to instil label sections using the
interior<00:03:27.530> two<00:03:27.650> circles<00:03:28.960> so<00:03:29.960> that<00:03:30.200> what<00:03:30.500> you

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
interior two circles so that what you

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.860 
interior two circles so that what you
have<00:03:32.140> indicated<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.410> on<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:33.980> plan<00:03:34.270> is<00:03:35.270> a

have indicated on the on the plan is a
set<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.590> arrows<00:03:37.459> pointing<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.300> particular

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
set of arrows pointing in particular

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.260 
set of arrows pointing in particular
directions<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:40.700> they<00:03:40.910> will<00:03:41.090> pair<00:03:41.450> up<00:03:41.530> and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
directions that they will pair up and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.830 
directions that they will pair up and
the<00:03:44.270> labeled<00:03:45.100> inch<00:03:46.100> kind<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.150> labeled<00:03:47.540> pair

as if we've taken that building we cut

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.290 
as if we've taken that building we cut
along<00:04:51.080> those<00:04:51.350> lines<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.460> move<00:04:52.760> those<00:04:53.030> pieces

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
section being is as if we cut along the

through the right-hand side of the plan
this<00:05:17.990> is<00:05:18.170> if<00:05:18.320> we<00:05:18.470> move<00:05:19.060> elements<00:05:20.060> of<00:05:20.300> the

this is if we move elements of the
object<00:05:22.360> we're<00:05:23.360> drawing<00:05:23.510> away<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:27.280> look

object we're drawing away and look
directly<00:05:28.490> at<00:05:28.700> it<00:05:28.760> and<00:05:29.060> what<00:05:29.180> I'm<00:05:29.300> just<00:05:29.960> drawn

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
directly at it and what I'm just drawn

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.470 
directly at it and what I'm just drawn
now<00:05:30.380> doorways<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.370> what<00:05:31.550> I've<00:05:31.700> done<00:05:32.090> with<00:05:32.390> the

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:32.480 
now doorways and what I've done with the

now doorways and what I've done with the
camera<00:05:32.780> looking<00:05:33.050> up<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:34.570> designed<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:35.690> doors

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
camera looking up I designed the doors

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.100 
camera looking up I designed the doors
that<00:05:36.020> they<00:05:36.350> open<00:05:36.820> away<00:05:37.820> from<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.300> camera<00:05:38.750> and

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
that they open away from the camera and

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.760 
that they open away from the camera and
that<00:05:39.590> they're<00:05:39.770> hiding<00:05:40.100> what's<00:05:40.910> behind<00:05:41.120> if<00:05:41.840> I'm

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
that they're hiding what's behind if I'm

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.440 
that they're hiding what's behind if I'm
if<00:05:43.100> the<00:05:43.190> doors<00:05:43.550> are<00:05:43.640> used<00:05:43.820> on<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.090> other<00:05:44.210> side

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
if the doors are used on the other side

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.560 
if the doors are used on the other side
as<00:05:44.780> they<00:05:45.110> open<00:05:45.440> back<00:05:45.670> then<00:05:46.670> the<00:05:47.060> camera<00:05:47.390> would

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
as they open back then the camera would

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.180 
as they open back then the camera would
have<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.750> clear<00:05:48.080> view<00:05:48.290> into<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.740> room<00:05:48.770> which
