00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.840
 because we are in front of life 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.840
 two 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.770
 time are touches 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.289
 the world 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.800
 I considered this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.649
 without cooperation 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.460
 but I have pictures that I had seen 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.570
 to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.860
 and the ram did not have the strength to 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.860
 stand in front of him 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.100
 the social path 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.970
 when 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.520
 here the great choir 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.989
 towards the four winds of heaven 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.920
 it is clear who the Romans are 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.840
 our days what nation has a 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.200
 military superiority over the rest of the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.200
 world 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.129
 but like the Romans the USA 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.319
 understand that military force alone 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:31.319
 serves when everyone else knows her 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.120
 and the fear our question is whether the 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.370
 Roman Empire is or not in some way 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.900
 as the American empire believe that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.730
 the influence of usa is so 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.340
 widespread as the one that had Rome in 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.349
 his time'm sure yes yes 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.000
 I'm sure for example in the form of 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.120
 dress of the people in the world and that of 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.530
 the Americans and of course the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.359
 English is the language that everyone 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.940
 you need to learn to communicate and 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.790
 for commerce as was the Latin yes 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.769
 exactly these school teachers 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 Americans are visiting in Rome 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.900
 in your country they teach Latin history 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.700
 ancient if the Romans spent all their 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.920
 philosophy of conquering the world in the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.510
 desire for peace they wanted the borders 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.090
 they were calm and that their citizens 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.829
 could trade and that's why all 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.289
 that would pose an obstacle to this 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.639
 they were in trouble and to what extent 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.910
 they seemed equal to politics 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.910
 American, I think it's very similar 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.470
 they are all in agreement in fact usa has 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.760
 achieved a military command that the 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.889
 Romans would have dreamed 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.660
 although the Romans lived 2000 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.660
 years they knew that it was what 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.070
 advantage to an empire over others not 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.380
 it was enough to be a superpower 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.810
 military had to lead the world in 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.060
 all the other fields and the more 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.249
 excels in an area more advantage is 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.429
 have for others 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:49.139
 technology is a perfect example 

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:50.999
 how well the Romans understood a 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.279
 innovation initially designed to 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:56.629
 a military use may end up driving 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.629
 business and commerce 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.949
 what really kept rome together 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.819
 was the traditional idea that we have of 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:13.129
 roma the one of its roads when it 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.699
 conquered a territory was built 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.699
 a system
