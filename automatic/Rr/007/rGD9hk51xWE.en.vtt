00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
know that's a classic kind of eggnog

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.230 
know that's a classic kind of eggnog
combination

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
combination

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.270 
combination
and<00:01:43.510> tequila<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.260> nothing<00:01:44.979> more<00:01:45.070> than

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
basically it gotta be brandy so we use

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.290 
basically it gotta be brandy so we use

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.010 
key to this is just adding things slowly
to<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.550> mix<00:02:00.759> so<00:02:00.940> that<00:02:00.970> you're<00:02:01.600> not<00:02:01.720> making<00:02:01.810> a

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
to the mix so that you're not making a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.050 
to the mix so that you're not making a
mess<00:02:02.229> basically<00:02:02.649> you<00:02:03.280> got<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.430> blender<00:02:03.790> running

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
mess basically you got a blender running

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.450 
mess basically you got a blender running
with<00:02:04.149> no<00:02:04.180> top<00:02:04.479> on<00:02:04.830> next<00:02:05.830> I'm<00:02:05.920> just<00:02:06.100> gonna<00:02:06.220> add

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
with no top on next I'm just gonna add

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.090 
with no top on next I'm just gonna add

I like to put the whole milk in first
get<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.300> incorporated<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.230> then<00:02:20.410> kind<00:02:20.709> of

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
get that incorporated and then kind of

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.680 
get that incorporated and then kind of
do<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.010> heavy<00:02:21.430> cream<00:02:21.700> last<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.360> doesn't

do the heavy cream last so that doesn't

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.830 
do the heavy cream last so that doesn't
like<00:02:23.019> whip<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.620> expand<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.310> there<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:25.510> what

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
like whip and expand in there so what

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.250

slowly and then

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.170 
slowly and then
you<00:02:33.590> know<00:02:33.709> as<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.010> final<00:02:34.730> touch<00:02:34.909> we're<00:02:35.090> gonna

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
you know as a final touch we're gonna
