00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.689
 spine you don't want a little oblivion 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.400
 hello to all dear friends of me 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.230
 Name is Sergey and I without goal in general in 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.960
 anyway let's start our review 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 mods and the first thing I want to give 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 your attention is the armor for think 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.189
 leave them yes because it means to tighten 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.080
 such an intrigue well, in general, let's show 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.200
 all immediately open all the cards it 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.890
 called radio headless horseman by 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.540
 Essentially this only armor the rest and 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.660
 steel armor that is how you see steel 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.969
 parts of the body are normal but unusual. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.160
 perry is named firstly secondly she 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.649
 mouth hides the helmet is worn and too Zion 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 head at the same time that is essentially you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 become 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.870
 headless the rest of the net you 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.969
 can do as you like for example the same 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.789
 the most steel armor friend already 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 ordinary by the way when I repeat something that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.300
 helmet he also hides that is to me 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:14.060
 the moment is not tundra 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:19.400
 and shits but so pierce they will not merge 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.020
 So he, that is, he brings a helmet and touches 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.150
 actually I was wrong to take into apologizing 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.010
 dear friends, I did not notice it just 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.110
 to checked I think what he leaves in 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.110
 peace oh well even so already not bad 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.910
 tom case now we are a headless horseman 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.450
 let's get down to arms from 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.130
 oblivion that I promised you and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.890
 today / from this 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.290
 dark background and pen let's start mora 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.690
 madness forges the whole thing out of 15 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.480
 ebonite ingot yes exactly 15 palm 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 expensive and something else there they are important 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.950
 damn something somewhere bad damage 44 by 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.380
 compared for example u 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.930
 bone set bone two-handed sword 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.850
 two times more that is well from dragon 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.310
 the bones that is here to work on 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.590
 protection that requires 15 ebonite ingots 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.570
 Nevertheless, everything looks very good to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.510
 the same author plans to add a recipe 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.700
 I will be madness for it is taken not just for 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.350
 left on and from addition rising in price 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.400
 Islands in my opinion there it is like this and 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.860
 powerful sword was 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.860
 but actually I am 9 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.280
 Doroshina actually here will be the staff 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.870
 magician 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.269
 it's the same myself usually after my 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.590
 is in goblins revives stepfather 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.840
 calculate which will be spinning 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.079
 fight in your country for 300 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.249
 seconds that is equivalent to about 5 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:46.909
 minute and toplag 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:50.920
 let's see very much I can and style 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.920
 dead wherever 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.010
 looking like an ordinary dead person decided dead 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.290
 wait is all very powerful 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.900
 wait i don't understand why 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.819
 does not work but it does not work on saber 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.170
 it is possible to go to work only with me and 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.569
 let's try to run this 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.620
 guard and 8 st she will become very 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:20.230
 mighty dead him cry well in 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.000
