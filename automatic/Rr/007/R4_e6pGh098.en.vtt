this<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.730> and<00:02:59.880> your<00:03:00.090> your<00:03:00.510> urinary<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.290> you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
this in and your your urinary and you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.380 
this in and your your urinary and you
know<00:03:01.739> salivary<00:03:02.250> pH<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:02.760> fluctuate<00:03:02.970> quite<00:03:03.209> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
know salivary pH can fluctuate quite a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.910 
know salivary pH can fluctuate quite a
bit<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:03.690> your<00:03:03.840> blood<00:03:04.080> pH<00:03:04.350> has<00:03:04.560> sustained<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
bit but your blood pH has sustained a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.759 
bit but your blood pH has sustained a
very<00:03:05.160> narrow<00:03:05.340> range<00:03:05.660> so<00:03:06.660> what<00:03:07.050> happens<00:03:07.530> is

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
very narrow range so what happens is

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.400 
very narrow range so what happens is
when<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.250> drink<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.900> substance<00:03:09.900> or<00:03:10.080> eat<00:03:10.290> it

acidifying to your body and so to

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.319 
acidifying to your body and so to
counteract<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:17.190> your<00:03:17.430> body<00:03:17.640> will<00:03:17.820> leach

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
counteract this your body will leach

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.850 
counteract this your body will leach
alkaline<00:03:19.079> minerals<00:03:19.590> from<00:03:20.340> your<00:03:20.730> bones<00:03:21.030> and

the rest of your body your spinal fluid

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.680 
the rest of your body your spinal fluid
even<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:25.590> gonna<00:03:25.920> dump<00:03:26.459> these<00:03:27.060> alkaline

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
even it's gonna dump these alkaline

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.009 
even it's gonna dump these alkaline
minerals<00:03:28.200> into<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:29.640> blood<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.390> regulate

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
minerals into your blood to regulate

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.569 
minerals into your blood to regulate
your<00:03:31.170> blood<00:03:31.350> pH<00:03:31.829> so<00:03:32.190> what<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.549> basically

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
your blood pH so what you're basically

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.740 
your blood pH so what you're basically
doing<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.900> you're<00:03:34.079> demineralizing<00:03:34.829> yourself

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
doing is you're demineralizing yourself

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.449 
doing is you're demineralizing yourself
so<00:03:36.750> maybe<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:37.440> you're<00:03:37.680> gonna<00:03:37.769> see<00:03:37.980> also<00:03:38.100> why

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
so maybe now you're gonna see also why

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.000 
so maybe now you're gonna see also why
the<00:03:38.880> mineral<00:03:39.390> aspect<00:03:39.900> comes<00:03:40.140> in<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.560> much<00:03:40.799> when

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the mineral aspect comes in so much when

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.310 
the mineral aspect comes in so much when
you<00:03:41.100> look<00:03:41.220> at<00:03:41.340> any<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.519> these<00:03:41.609> cancer<00:03:42.060> cures

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
you look at any of these cancer cures

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.990 
you look at any of these cancer cures
talk<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> lot<00:03:43.500> about<00:03:43.650> remineralizing<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.730> even

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
talk a lot about remineralizing you even

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.640 
talk a lot about remineralizing you even
more<00:03:45.209> important<00:03:45.660> than<00:03:45.840> just<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.230> vitamins

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
more important than just the vitamins

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.789 
more important than just the vitamins
the<00:03:46.829> minerals<00:03:47.010> as<00:03:47.310> well<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.480> your<00:03:48.930> body<00:03:49.230> dumps

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
the minerals as well so your body dumps

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.660 
the minerals as well so your body dumps
all<00:03:49.980> these<00:03:50.450> minerals<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.950> regulate<00:03:53.459> your

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
all these minerals just to regulate your

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.690 
all these minerals just to regulate your
pH<00:03:54.269> because<00:03:55.170> your<00:03:55.440> blood<00:03:55.590> has<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.980> stay<00:03:56.220> you

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
pH because your blood has to stay you

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.699 
pH because your blood has to stay you
know<00:03:56.820> within<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.660> narrow<00:03:57.870> range<00:03:58.109> although<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
know within a narrow range although you

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.920 
know within a narrow range although you
can<00:03:59.040> still<00:03:59.340> do<00:03:59.519> more<00:03:59.790> on<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> acidic<00:04:00.480> or<00:04:00.660> more

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
can still do more on the acidic or more

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.090 
can still do more on the acidic or more
on<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.140> alkaline<00:04:01.620> side<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:04.100> alkalizing

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
on the alkaline side so the alkalizing

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.550 
on the alkaline side so the alkalizing
diet<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.000> things<00:04:06.450> like<00:04:06.660> kombucha<00:04:07.260> which<00:04:07.290> also

diet and things like kombucha which also

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.979 
diet and things like kombucha which also
alkalizes<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.519> zapper<00:04:08.760> also<00:04:09.269> alkalizes

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
alkalizes the zapper also alkalizes

alkalizes the zapper also alkalizes
certain<00:04:10.560> supplements<00:04:11.160> like<00:04:11.310> calcium

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
certain supplements like calcium

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.250 
certain supplements like calcium
minerals<00:04:14.060> alkalis<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.390> so<00:04:15.780> that'll<00:04:15.989> that'll

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
minerals alkalis so so that'll that'll

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.250 
minerals alkalis so so that'll that'll
all<00:04:16.500> help<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:17.370> stabilize<00:04:17.940> your<00:04:18.090> ph

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
all help to to stabilize your ph

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.180 
all help to to stabilize your ph
and<00:04:19.520> the<00:04:20.520> alkaline<00:04:21.210> pH<00:04:21.540> is<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:21.930> important<00:04:22.530> this

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
and the alkaline pH is so important this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.500 
and the alkaline pH is so important this
is<00:04:23.280> where<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.520> cancer<00:04:23.970> thing<00:04:24.090> comes<00:04:24.360> in

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
is where the cancer thing comes in

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.500 
is where the cancer thing comes in
because<00:04:25.520> your<00:04:26.520> healthy<00:04:26.910> cells<00:04:27.180> need<00:04:27.390> oxygen

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
because your healthy cells need oxygen

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.420 
because your healthy cells need oxygen
to<00:04:28.320> function<00:04:29.040> properly<00:04:29.750> cancer

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
to function properly cancer

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.610 
to function properly cancer
it<00:04:32.430> grows<00:04:33.030> in<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.420> and<00:04:33.660> in<00:04:34.080> an<00:04:34.290> anaerobic

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
it grows in it and in an anaerobic

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.490 
it grows in it and in an anaerobic
environment<00:04:35.550> it's<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.270> partial<00:04:36.570> anaerobe<00:04:37.230> but

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
environment it's a partial anaerobe but

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.770 
environment it's a partial anaerobe but
really<00:04:38.070> what<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.520> does<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.180> doesn't<00:04:39.390> grow

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
really what it does is it doesn't grow

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.110 
really what it does is it doesn't grow
well<00:04:40.050> in<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.290> presence<00:04:40.650> of<00:04:40.740> oxygen<00:04:41.120> when

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
well in the presence of oxygen when

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.830 
well in the presence of oxygen when
you're<00:04:42.540> acidic<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:44.120> again<00:04:45.120> I'm<00:04:45.300> not<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.540> doctor

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
you're acidic and again I'm not a doctor

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.020 
you're acidic and again I'm not a doctor
this<00:04:46.200> is<00:04:46.320> only<00:04:46.500> from<00:04:46.860> my<00:04:47.310> understanding<00:04:47.910> from

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
this is only from my understanding from

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.600 
this is only from my understanding from
what<00:04:48.120> I've<00:04:48.480> been<00:04:48.510> reading<00:04:49.020> from<00:04:49.920> books<00:04:50.280> and

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
what I've been reading from books and

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.130 
what I've been reading from books and
from<00:04:50.820> medical<00:04:51.180> articles<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:51.930> things<00:04:51.990> like

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
from medical articles and things like

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.550 
from medical articles and things like
that<00:04:52.640> when<00:04:53.640> you're<00:04:53.820> acidic<00:04:54.360> your<00:04:54.870> cells<00:04:55.350> don't

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
that when you're acidic your cells don't

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.500 
that when you're acidic your cells don't
transport<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.190> oxygen<00:04:56.310> as<00:04:56.790> well<00:04:56.820> so<00:04:57.330> you're

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
transport the oxygen as well so you're

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.950 
transport the oxygen as well so you're
giving<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.960> cancer<00:04:58.410> a<00:04:58.440> good<00:04:58.890> environment

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
giving the cancer a good environment

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.480 
giving the cancer a good environment
because<00:05:00.960> it's<00:05:01.200> oxygen<00:05:01.770> depleted<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:02.370> what

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
because it's oxygen depleted so what

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.130 
because it's oxygen depleted so what
this<00:05:02.610> all<00:05:02.820> comes<00:05:03.150> down<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.510> oxygen

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
this all comes down to is oxygen

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.290 
this all comes down to is oxygen
that's<00:05:04.440> why<00:05:04.650> alkalizing<00:05:05.520> through<00:05:05.730> diet<00:05:06.030> or

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
that's why alkalizing through diet or

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.270 
that's why alkalizing through diet or
whatever<00:05:06.450> else<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.900> do<00:05:07.080> is<00:05:07.410> going<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.100> help

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
whatever else you do is going to help

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.550 
whatever else you do is going to help
because<00:05:08.610> it's<00:05:08.850> gonna<00:05:09.000> make<00:05:09.090> your<00:05:09.570> cells

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
because it's gonna make your cells

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.330 
because it's gonna make your cells
transport<00:05:11.310> oxygen<00:05:11.430> better<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:13.160> bring<00:05:14.160> oxygen

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
transport oxygen better and bring oxygen

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.220 
transport oxygen better and bring oxygen
to<00:05:14.790> where<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.150> cancer<00:05:15.360> is<00:05:15.600> which<00:05:15.720> the<00:05:15.960> cancer

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
to where the cancer is which the cancer

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.880 
to where the cancer is which the cancer
doesn't<00:05:16.350> want

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
doesn't want

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.470 
doesn't want
that's<00:05:17.280> that<00:05:17.670> also<00:05:17.790> explains<00:05:18.000> why<00:05:18.450> a

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
that's that also explains why a

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.510 
that's that also explains why a
hyperbarics<00:05:19.380> or<00:05:19.530> ozone<00:05:19.980> therapy<00:05:20.160> work

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
hyperbarics or ozone therapy work

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.230 
hyperbarics or ozone therapy work
because<00:05:21.180> they're<00:05:21.420> gonna<00:05:21.510> help<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:23.240> oxygenate

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
because they're gonna help to oxygenate

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.390 
because they're gonna help to oxygenate
you<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:25.230> it's<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.560> oxygen<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:26.190> kills

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
you and that it's the oxygen that kills

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.870 
you and that it's the oxygen that kills
cancer<00:05:26.930> okay<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:27.960> cooperative<00:05:28.620> effort

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
cancer okay a cooperative effort

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.110 
cancer okay a cooperative effort
survivors<00:05:29.880> present<00:05:30.480> understanding<00:05:31.320> cancer

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
survivors present understanding cancer

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.190 
survivors present understanding cancer
but<00:05:33.120> one<00:05:33.330> thing<00:05:33.510> they<00:05:33.630> mentioned<00:05:34.020> is<00:05:34.170> that

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
but one thing they mentioned is that

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.900 
but one thing they mentioned is that
cancer<00:05:34.800> doesn't<00:05:34.980> just<00:05:35.250> develop<00:05:35.580> for<00:05:35.760> some

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
cancer doesn't just develop for some

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.030 
cancer doesn't just develop for some
unknown<00:05:36.120> reason<00:05:36.690> and<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.170> also<00:05:37.380> we<00:05:37.890> all

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
unknown reason and that also we all

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.070 
unknown reason and that also we all
produce<00:05:38.310> cancer<00:05:38.850> cells<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.300> kill<00:05:39.840> cancer

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
produce cancer cells and kill cancer

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.810 
produce cancer cells and kill cancer
cells<00:05:40.230> you<00:05:40.710> know<00:05:40.800> in<00:05:41.040> our<00:05:41.100> lifetime

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
cells you know in our lifetime

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.970 
cells you know in our lifetime
it's<00:05:42.540> just<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:42.900> sometimes<00:05:43.140> you're<00:05:43.710> not<00:05:43.770> able

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
it's just that sometimes you're not able

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.920 
it's just that sometimes you're not able
to<00:05:44.100> keep<00:05:44.370> up<00:05:44.430> with<00:05:44.670> it<00:05:45.030> and<00:05:45.120> then<00:05:45.210> they<00:05:45.420> they'll

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
to keep up with it and then they they'll

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.750 
to keep up with it and then they they'll
you<00:05:46.410> know<00:05:46.440> over<00:05:46.800> proliferate<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.430> then<00:05:47.670> you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
you know over proliferate and then you

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.640 
you know over proliferate and then you
get<00:05:47.970> cancer<00:05:48.450> like<00:05:48.600> you'll<00:05:48.720> get<00:05:48.840> tumors<00:05:49.170> they

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
get cancer like you'll get tumors they

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.990 
get cancer like you'll get tumors they
say<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.890> must<00:05:50.100> change<00:05:50.370> your<00:05:50.490> internal

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
say you must change your internal

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.880 
say you must change your internal
environment<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.720> one<00:05:51.870> in<00:05:52.110> which<00:05:52.290> cancer<00:05:52.680> can't

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
environment to one in which cancer can't

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.390 
environment to one in which cancer can't
thrive<00:05:54.380> cancer<00:05:55.380> can't<00:05:55.620> exist<00:05:55.980> in<00:05:56.130> cells

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
thrive cancer can't exist in cells

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.630 
thrive cancer can't exist in cells
whether<00:05:56.670> it<00:05:56.850> is<00:05:56.970> enough<00:05:57.500> oxygen<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:58.890> oxygen<00:05:59.340> is

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
whether it is enough oxygen so oxygen is

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.000 
whether it is enough oxygen so oxygen is
really<00:05:59.970> key<00:06:00.260> and<00:06:01.260> they<00:06:01.350> going<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.680> mention

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
really key and they going to mention

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.650 
really key and they going to mention

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
that the underlying cause of all cancer

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.120 
that the underlying cause of all cancer
no<00:06:03.810> matter<00:06:03.990> what<00:06:04.200> type<00:06:04.440> may<00:06:04.740> have<00:06:04.950> been

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
cells by a fermentation of sugar so I

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.200 
cells by a fermentation of sugar so I
just<00:06:47.280> wanted<00:06:47.460> to<00:06:47.550> share<00:06:47.700> with<00:06:47.850> you<00:06:47.910> what<00:06:48.180> I

again it's not medical advice and I just

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.700 
again it's not medical advice and I just
like<00:06:50.730> to<00:06:50.850> point<00:06:51.000> out<00:06:51.150> that<00:06:51.330> I<00:06:51.570> used<00:06:51.990> to<00:06:52.200> work<00:06:52.500> as

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
like to point out that I used to work as

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.530 
like to point out that I used to work as
a<00:06:52.740> medical<00:06:53.220> transcriptionist<00:06:53.850> actually<00:06:54.360> in

a medical transcriptionist actually in

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.280 
a medical transcriptionist actually in
an<00:06:54.720> oncology<00:06:55.380> department<00:06:55.500> and<00:06:56.510> so<00:06:57.510> I<00:06:57.540> had<00:06:57.960> full

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
an oncology department and so I had full

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.010 
an oncology department and so I had full
confidence<00:06:58.650> in<00:06:59.280> mainstream<00:06:59.940> medicine<00:07:00.240> I<00:07:00.600> was

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
confidence in mainstream medicine I was

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.500 
confidence in mainstream medicine I was
really<00:07:01.440> a<00:07:01.470> tough<00:07:01.800> nut<00:07:02.040> to<00:07:02.070> crack<00:07:02.220> when<00:07:03.210> it<00:07:03.360> came

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:03.510 
really a tough nut to crack when it came

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:04.850 
really a tough nut to crack when it came
to<00:07:03.660> changing<00:07:03.840> my<00:07:04.140> views<00:07:04.410> on<00:07:04.530> this<00:07:04.650> I<00:07:04.770> was

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
to changing my views on this I was

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.400 
to changing my views on this I was
extremely<00:07:05.370> skeptical<00:07:05.940> of<00:07:06.330> all<00:07:06.840> this<00:07:06.990> stuff<00:07:07.290> on

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
extremely skeptical of all this stuff on

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.220 
extremely skeptical of all this stuff on
the<00:07:07.470> internet<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:08.490> you<00:07:09.300> know<00:07:09.390> people<00:07:09.870> saying

that<00:07:10.380> they<00:07:10.500> were<00:07:10.560> alternative<00:07:11.460> cures<00:07:11.670> I<00:07:11.760> mean

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
that they were alternative cures I mean

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.190 
that they were alternative cures I mean
to<00:07:11.940> me<00:07:12.060> what<00:07:12.690> they<00:07:12.810> were<00:07:12.870> doing<00:07:13.080> at<00:07:13.170> the

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.200

hospital<00:07:13.650> that<00:07:13.800> was<00:07:14.010> true<00:07:14.430> cure<00:07:14.700> and<00:07:14.910> I<00:07:14.970> got

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
hospital that was true cure and I got

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.380

being declared cancer-free and I was

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.280 
being declared cancer-free and I was
convinced<00:07:21.210> that<00:07:21.240> wow<00:07:21.420> look<00:07:21.660> at<00:07:21.780> all<00:07:21.960> the<00:07:22.110> great

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.290 
convinced that wow look at all the great

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.620 
convinced that wow look at all the great
work<00:07:22.590> they're<00:07:22.830> doing<00:07:23.120> never<00:07:24.120> occurred<00:07:24.450> to<00:07:24.480> me

work they're doing never occurred to me

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.390 
work they're doing never occurred to me
that<00:07:24.750> I<00:07:24.900> don't<00:07:25.020> get<00:07:25.170> the<00:07:25.350> files<00:07:25.680> of<00:07:25.980> the<00:07:26.070> people

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
that I don't get the files of the people

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.230 
that I don't get the files of the people
who<00:07:26.670> you<00:07:27.570> know<00:07:28.190> didn't<00:07:29.190> respond<00:07:29.670> to<00:07:29.790> treatment

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
who you know didn't respond to treatment

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.330 
who you know didn't respond to treatment
because<00:07:30.420> those<00:07:30.540> files<00:07:30.840> go<00:07:31.110> to<00:07:31.140> the<00:07:31.320> morgue<00:07:31.560> not

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
because those files go to the morgue not

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.040 
because those files go to the morgue not
only<00:07:32.580> occur<00:07:32.760> to<00:07:32.880> me<00:07:32.940> much<00:07:33.060> later<00:07:33.300> but<00:07:33.810> I<00:07:33.840> had

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
only occur to me much later but I had

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.990 
only occur to me much later but I had
absolute<00:07:34.710> full<00:07:34.890> confidence<00:07:35.310> it<00:07:35.640> really<00:07:35.820> took

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
absolute full confidence it really took

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.490 
absolute full confidence it really took
a<00:07:36.120> lot<00:07:36.240> for<00:07:36.510> me<00:07:36.570> to<00:07:36.600> change<00:07:36.810> my<00:07:36.930> views<00:07:37.230> but<00:07:37.410> in

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
a lot for me to change my views but in

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.530 
a lot for me to change my views but in
the<00:07:37.590> end<00:07:37.710> I<00:07:37.770> had<00:07:37.950> to<00:07:37.980> because<00:07:38.520> what<00:07:39.090> I<00:07:39.120> see

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540 
the end I had to because what I see

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.850 
the end I had to because what I see
happening<00:07:39.990> here<00:07:40.050> is<00:07:40.410> that<00:07:40.560> they're<00:07:40.740> really

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
happening here is that they're really

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.460 
happening here is that they're really
putting<00:07:41.480> profits<00:07:42.480> above<00:07:42.840> everything<00:07:43.170> else

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.470 
putting profits above everything else

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.250 
putting profits above everything else
and<00:07:43.890> that<00:07:44.240> what<00:07:45.240> we're<00:07:45.360> offered<00:07:45.690> as<00:07:45.810> medicine

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260 
and that what we're offered as medicine

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.750 
and that what we're offered as medicine
is<00:07:46.440> really<00:07:46.980> what's<00:07:47.280> good<00:07:47.520> for<00:07:47.640> the

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:47.760 
is really what's good for the

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.610 
is really what's good for the
corporations<00:07:48.270> and<00:07:48.480> not<00:07:48.780> what's<00:07:49.050> good<00:07:49.320> for<00:07:49.440> us

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
corporations and not what's good for us

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.340 
corporations and not what's good for us
necessarily<00:07:49.980> so<00:07:50.700> if<00:07:51.090> I<00:07:51.330> ever<00:07:51.510> got<00:07:51.810> sick<00:07:52.140> I

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:52.350 
necessarily so if I ever got sick I

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.930 
necessarily so if I ever got sick I
would<00:07:52.590> go<00:07:52.770> to<00:07:52.860> the<00:07:52.980> doctor<00:07:53.130> but<00:07:53.460> really<00:07:53.790> only

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 
would go to the doctor but really only

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.670 
would go to the doctor but really only
to<00:07:54.090> be<00:07:54.210> diagnosed<00:07:54.720> and<00:07:54.960> then<00:07:54.990> probably<00:07:55.470> seek

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 
to be diagnosed and then probably seek

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.490 
to be diagnosed and then probably seek
some<00:07:55.890> other<00:07:56.070> kind<00:07:56.760> of<00:07:56.880> treatment<00:07:57.420> but<00:07:58.320> that's

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 
some other kind of treatment but that's

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.020 
some other kind of treatment but that's
just<00:07:58.770> what<00:07:58.920> I<00:07:58.950> would<00:07:59.070> do<00:07:59.310> I'm<00:07:59.430> not<00:07:59.550> saying<00:07:59.880> what
