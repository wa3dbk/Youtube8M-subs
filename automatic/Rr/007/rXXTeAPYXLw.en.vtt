00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
start with what that dropped I got two

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.959 
start with what that dropped I got two
samples<00:01:57.579> of<00:01:57.849> the<00:01:58.919> three<00:01:59.919> sisters<00:02:00.159> of<00:02:00.549> nature

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969

natural<00:02:01.450> curling<00:02:02.229> jello<00:02:02.529> and<00:02:03.459> I<00:02:03.520> think<00:02:03.849> this

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
natural curling jello and I think this

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:05.249 
natural curling jello and I think this
is<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.299> one<00:02:04.539> that's<00:02:04.719> supposed<00:02:04.899> to<00:02:05.229> be

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
is the one that's supposed to be

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.180 
is the one that's supposed to be
comparable<00:02:06.099> to<00:02:06.489> kinky<00:02:07.389> curly<00:02:07.869> not<00:02:08.770> sure<00:02:09.009> how

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
comparable to kinky curly not sure how

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.919

much<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.610> sample<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.149> but<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.630> should<00:02:10.899> be

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
much the sample is but it should be

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.740 
much the sample is but it should be
enough<00:02:11.110> for<00:02:11.410> my<00:02:11.800> hair<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:13.060> this<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
enough for my hair so this is the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.320 
enough for my hair so this is the
product

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
product

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.340
