as<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.500> kid<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.190> mean<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.760> kind<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
as a kid I mean it was kind of

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.949 
as a kid I mean it was kind of
interesting<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:22.360> don't<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.600> be<00:02:23.720> real

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
interesting you don't have to be real

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.600 
interesting you don't have to be real
exact<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.800> want<00:02:24.980> your<00:02:25.130> measurements

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
exact but you want your measurements

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.520 
exact but you want your measurements
pretty<00:02:25.880> exact<00:02:26.330> that's<00:02:26.570> why<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.780> used<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.200> scale

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
pretty exact that's why I used to scale

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.050 
pretty exact that's why I used to scale
to<00:02:28.489> do<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.980> yeah<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.550> miss<00:02:32.030> it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
to do it so but yeah you just miss it

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.570 
to do it so but yeah you just miss it
around<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:33.019> don't<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.620> about<00:02:33.950> oh<00:02:34.310> I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
around you don't you have about oh I

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.580 
around you don't you have about oh I
know<00:02:34.760> now<00:02:35.000> 10<00:02:35.360> minutes<00:02:35.600> not<00:02:36.140> even<00:02:36.380> 10<00:02:36.560> minutes

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
know now 10 minutes not even 10 minutes

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.640 
know now 10 minutes not even 10 minutes
I<00:02:36.980> think<00:02:37.160> it's<00:02:37.280> 5<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.870> steps<00:02:39.200> up<00:02:41.049> it<00:02:42.049> cures<00:02:42.440> in

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
I think it's 5 it steps up it cures in

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.020 
I think it's 5 it steps up it cures in
20<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.640> you<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.750> start<00:02:44.959> molding<00:02:46.030> pretty

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
20 and you have to start molding pretty

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.550 
20 and you have to start molding pretty
much<00:02:47.209> when<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.540> all<00:02:47.720> together<00:02:47.959> because

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
much when it's all together because

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.490 
much when it's all together because
that's<00:02:48.680> when<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.070> they<00:02:49.549> both<00:02:49.730> get<00:02:49.940> together

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
that's when the they both get together

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.390 
that's when the they both get together
so<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.799> have<00:02:52.130> enough<00:02:52.400> here<00:02:52.579> to<00:02:52.610> probably<00:02:53.120> do<00:02:53.390> two

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
so I have enough here to probably do two

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.500 
so I have enough here to probably do two
so<00:02:55.400> what<00:02:55.549> I'm<00:02:55.640> going<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:56.299> going<00:02:56.329> to

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.530 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:56.780> into<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.049> ball<00:02:57.320> and<00:03:01.329> then<00:03:02.329> I'm<00:03:02.420> gonna

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.170 

and<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:18.200> will<00:03:18.500> have<00:03:18.710> a<00:03:18.950> shell<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.670> was<00:03:22.850> one

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
and I will have a shell so that was one

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.270 
and I will have a shell so that was one
