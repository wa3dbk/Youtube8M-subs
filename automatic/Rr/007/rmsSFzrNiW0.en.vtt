00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.990
 then immediately declare i am mountains 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.379
 I guess too 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.639
 his episode 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.869
 real men don't eat cheese 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:16.779
 in which he has a number 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.570
 great doubt attracted anything 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.659
 a thing 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.480
 under par was very clear 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.080
 I didn't read the book 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.759
 I have no opinion or command 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.069
 or not where they are 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.089
 I do have some reservations about how the episode worked 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.390
 First of all the fragment is shown and Peter de Vries draws how much time Maria 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.940
 would have 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.300
 when she would travel from zwolle na rotterdam to have sex with men there 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.000
 to have 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.949
 in this he assumes 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.050
 that the normal school day has a school for six hours 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.150
 he just calculates very easily 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.799
 that when twice 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.100
 have two hours of travel time because of the case against the government 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.860
 for the activities she said to do in Rotterdam and then 8 hours from 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.000
 school is leaving and back at five 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.579
 17 min 8 is 9 mindy four hours 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.189
 then you have not lost much 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.250
 that is two hours that peter that the government 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.640
 then the charge 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.770
 at minute 37 of the episode he says it was not a rape 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.010
 6 in a minor's store 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.940
 that is an act much less traumatizing than a unique one comes in 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:26.460
 statue 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.010
 a friend of maria 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.950
 and that godfather has discovered in the book 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.090
 she tells 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 that it could never have been that she could have been stoned 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.270
 because she had never seen her with a joint how many stones people do you know 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.640
 be so stupid to leave a cash offer 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.150
 then nicky told 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.360
 that Maria had just been in touch with that so-called loverboy for a while 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480
 manou 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.630
 that is not believing what you want to believe where peter it at the start in the 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.910
 episode was over 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.110
 then there is simply an image 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.439
 she is also one 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.440
 friend of maria because they can be seen together in a number of places 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.839
 and she tells 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.349
 Amg searching days already told 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.349
 and like sitting side by side in the classroom 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.079
 according to peter you can say that you are quite a lot of girlfriends you are not 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.590
 next to everyone in the class 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.009
 and as long as you are super important friends for each other 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.129
 then why do you break into a book 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.510
 then its bears that it can't be that maria so neglected school she can 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.789
 don't remember mary unitas 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:37.439
 if you do not immediately feel that maria was there 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.439
 rachel tells Peter when it really comes through 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.089
 that they have made up a story against her grandmother 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.100
 every child does that if you are so sure about it 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.169
 why then i have you with your eyes 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.139
 percy your lips together 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.129
 I am not sure 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 super nervous impression 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.889
 say things like 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.889
 the hammer usually yes 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.379
 Peter then says that he finds it amazing 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.079
 that she does not make a declaration 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.079
 that is not one of the problems surrounding the loverboy problem 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.919
 a specialist can talk about that 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.749
 Peter gives you the choice between 0 very unlikely 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.889
 top 10 very truthful 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:27.929
 one of the people told me that they found to be 4 internally and five 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.599
 Peter draws the conclusion from this 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.710
 that is, according to him, the hero of a book 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.169
 sheer nonsense 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.400
 when I say 50 to 60 percent of the events in the book 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.839
 unlikely 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:43.569
 then it doesn't have to mean that they didn't happen 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.069
 it is unlikely 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.409
 and that does not mean that it is or is not the truth you cannot do it there 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.259
 conclude and when 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:53.840
 fifty to sixty 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.430
 percent of the events unlikely to reach the cut 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.950
 that he thinks he finds half of the book unlikely 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.549
 no he talked about the events in the book 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.919
 that every event has been given the same amount of space in the book 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.919
 then this will call but the mother of maria 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.440
 empire may always let her talk out better 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.320
 she says she has always spoken the truth 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.450
 and therefore do not have to think of a strategy 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.879
 for what she says and how she says with 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.349
 that is quite painful for a strategically deployed game 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.439
 from m tv presenter after peter had finished the conversation with the mother of 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.220
 maria 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.330
 he quickly draws the conclusion 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.749
 in this way 

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:40.949
 he doesn't get any further 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.360
 means that is not the same as 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.550
 you don't get what they want to hear 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.529
 also that he is the publisher of the book 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:50.580
 enschede conversation is about 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.300
 that he would rather emphasize 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.099
 we are making a problem of it 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.409
 and he is not satisfied with one leg 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.739
 said beforehand that it was a special and significant conversation 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.880
 that was also what m 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.740
 as vity 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.029
 would like to give you the following advice 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.990
 ask the pope questions 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.960
 occasionally drop some silences 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.809
 try to focus on a person-to-person conversation 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.189
 it can do you more 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.219
 and give these answers 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.019
 it made him a sympathetic person
