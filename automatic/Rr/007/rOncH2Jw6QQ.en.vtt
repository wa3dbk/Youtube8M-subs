00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello how about with a new section in the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.960
 channel called network tutorials are like 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.250
 always if it is a new section that then 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.410
 let's implement here in the channel 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.990
 because then many people in particular 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.430
 some friends asked me afterwards what's up 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.690
 with this network they are like venues that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 use and well I come to do a 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.920
 tutorial in one of the small ways 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 if you like it, leave your like to 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.699
 that more people arrive and then they comment 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.310
 if they like this series that I'm going to 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.949
 be starting then because most 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 of people in my case because he does not know how 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.360
 the rest will be used right now because 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.030
 be a little more no and well then here 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
 I'm going to teach how to make a 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 Arrow machine gun at a thousand per hour 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.329
 the arrows will shoot them like a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.860
 angel ice cream then let's start 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.809
 what we are going to put 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.489
 we are going to have to do is put stone 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.420
 here may be another material may be 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.059
 this this is wood could be 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.329
 block as you can put materials 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.590
 except ice and glass which 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.070
 we are going to do is put this in 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.780
 way of then cubes xd and here we are going to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.810
 put our dispensation to the point 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.940
 towards here where is our room 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 tests let's say now here we are going to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.690
 put the network this not now here comes what 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.100
 well let's put here redstone in 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.229
 this way contributing everything here and then 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
 well let's put here the torch of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.770
 network are like you see here in this in this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.450
 If it is going to melt torch 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.700
 rector and why they will say because if the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.460
 I do not have the slightest idea 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.630
 but let's start with the tutorial and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.490
 Well, here we are going to put another 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.670
 Redstone torch and here again 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.009
 torch and here another torch and then 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 as they saw then because they all go 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.429
 to be passing the ball as well as 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.970
 thou bring not this bring them the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:50.340
 I bring no but in the following way 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.729
 now as they saw we already did 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.250
 our little as this network this 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.860
 nothing for you to activate this as 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.990
 they listened if the zealand activating but 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 they do not walk it activating as fast as 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.010
 we want not what we are going to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.090
 do is activate this here 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:11.400
 is going to put a torch or my god uncle 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.410
 but where good that we do not know normal 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.480
 if you do not explode me in the face and then 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.550
 how they heard is right now 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.160
 pushing these things to me for now not 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.980
 and now to stop all this we are going 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.470
 to put it here another way and then 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.300
 let's put a lever and then the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.920
 let's put here and then we were stopped 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.230
 all this is what is going to control then 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.950
 the network path this here we can put 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.480
 since I do not know since artificial games 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.800
 up arrows in this case let's put 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.870
 arrow and then I'll show you how 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.220
 do it with artificial games what 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.950
 let's deactivate this and then as 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.930
 they listen or how they see this is shooting 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.150
 the arrows to very for now that after 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.010
 is what all this network path does 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.110
 with since they all go through 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.000
 the ball and here because from the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.580
 supporting because then if it's a new 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.050
 explode zacatillo because if this does not 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.210
 it is therefore going to be 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.520
 if you are going to eject the arrows but not 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.290
 let's say a little slower slower than 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.440
 expected what we want 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.190
 in our in my case defend my house and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.300
 go with brings the mods let's not say a 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.580
 zombie attack or something like that and 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.230
 Well, they heard it, as well as 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.120
 we will go a thousand per hour now we are going to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.580
 make another one another way that you can 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.440
 make it a little easier for me what I feel 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.900
 we are going to take out the repeaters of 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.030
 network this because we're going to need a lot 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.090
 well not much repeated network this is 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.550
 one of the easiest ways to do 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.090
 this that serves us well let's put 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.070
 here a repeater on this side and then 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.620
 this one of the other that look like this with 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.630
 carlos 2 and we are going to put remains of these 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.090
 two sides this in which our 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.550
 circuit now this is the hardest thing 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.260
 might not leave me the first as such 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.660
 once you do not get the first one 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.580
 and we're going to put on your tablet to not 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.860
 break nothing also tells us about the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.020
 first bicha we are no no no no no no 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.730
 no no no no no no no no no no no explode 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 not explode explode explode not not exploit 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.750
 of protection and forgotten having a se 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940
 I had forgotten this can not be 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.670
 explodes ended up exploiting manches wake 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.100
 epic fail see when we're going to put the 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.290
 survival and here we are going to have to put 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.510
 and quickly remove this torch that 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.700
 I have in my hand it will be a little more 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.170
 not because difficult because you may not 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.350
 come out the first one I never got the 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.750
 end see how we are doing right now 1 2 3 and 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.430
 we got the first one and it comes and as 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.080
 they saw then we got the first one that was 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.240
 beginner's luck and we're going to 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.130
 put this as you saw it is like a 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.930
 type vectra yagÃ¼e shoot and you're me 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.530
 interrupting in my tutorial or talk 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.120
 for there is water we are going to put this here and 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.340
 let's put a dispenser on that side 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.500
 is a little closer to what 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.210
 thought well because if I did not realize 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.520
 of the dimensions that this could bring 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.850
 there is tv that is going up today 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.850
 head 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.520
 and well 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:04.000
 to put it here to make it a bit 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.000
 more look a little faster sometimes 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.260
 and well now what we are going to do 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.240
 is how they saw this because it is not 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.420
 transporting nothing you do not hear anything 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.030
 here not to activate this we are going to 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.400
 need the need for a lever and 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.660
 here we are going to put on some eggs 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.340
 artificial way some fires 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.090
 artificial here in this case just like 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.290
 you can put then let's say arrows but 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.880
 in this case the montoneros game 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.740
 artificial to brighten the day in 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.200
 minecraft we are not going to put you here to 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.520
 that activates and then we see like this 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.650
 it's the same shooting the fires 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.780
 artificial at a thousand per hour in this case 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.460
 see how they are pulling you 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.320
 pulling this would not work well 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.820
 mostly as not to be a 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.860
 Christmas here we are going to celebrate 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.200
 minecraft a new year and then 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.510
 quickly this will serve us well as 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.580
 to throw artificial eggs 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.580
 it also serves us as a response 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.699
 eggs do not tell us about 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.560
 wey zombies here we want to troll a 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.479
 friend and we put you there in your house the 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.460
 zombies a respond here from zombies well 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:11.490
 past or ender mans as it says 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.800
 for this one has the mind as 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.669
 more teachers go to a thousand per hour 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.680
 like 64 days the mouse to sell more than 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.229
 it was being formed and so 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.050
 same can be made of several eggs or 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.060
 what comes to mind also 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.370
 I think of lava because you can not and then 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.400
 I'm already going a bit of the water to see 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.139
 we are going away and I hope that 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.780
 you liked this little tutorial 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.669
 I do not know, well, let's say I do not know so much about this 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.740
 network are but I'm learning step by 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:42.750
 step if you liked this tutorial 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:45.419
 so leave in the comments if you want 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.039
 more of this so that I can make them 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.460
 more cultural about this if it's that 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:54.379
 like to give your like comment and give 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.379
 favorites and see you next bye
