and<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:44.070> much<00:00:44.219> heat<00:00:44.670> these<00:00:44.940> things<00:00:45.300> put<00:00:45.600> off

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and how much heat these things put off

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.139 
and how much heat these things put off
because<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.010> such<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.219> dry<00:00:47.430> product<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
because it's such a dry product so it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
because it's such a dry product so it
gets<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:49.320> only<00:00:49.469> does<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.770> get<00:00:49.980> dry<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
gets not only does it get dry in the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.790 
gets not only does it get dry in the
summertime<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> winter<00:00:51.960> when<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> rains

summertime in the winter when it rains

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
summertime in the winter when it rains
or<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> live<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.480> an<00:00:54.570> area<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> moist

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
or if you live in an area with a moist

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.689 
or if you live in an area with a moist
climate<00:00:55.980> they<00:00:56.850> will<00:00:57.120> absorb<00:00:57.809> water<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.129> they

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
climate they will absorb water so they

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
climate they will absorb water so they
absorb<00:01:00.239> water<00:01:02.180> when<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.300> rains<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> moist

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
absorb water when it rains or in a moist

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.890 
absorb water when it rains or in a moist
climate<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.150> will<00:01:06.330> actually<00:01:06.479> cause

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
climate and this will actually cause

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.530 
climate and this will actually cause
them<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> expand<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:07.950> bit<00:01:08.420> that's<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
them to expand a little bit that's the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
them to expand a little bit that's the
reason<00:01:09.659> why<00:01:09.840> they're<00:01:10.170> spaced<00:01:10.619> apart<00:01:11.100> they

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
reason why they're spaced apart they

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.710 
reason why they're spaced apart they
have<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.580> little<00:01:11.729> they've<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> quarter

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
have a little they've about a quarter

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.280 
have a little they've about a quarter
inch<00:01:12.750> space<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.470> between<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.390> allow<00:01:15.900> for

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
inch space in between them to allow for

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
inch space in between them to allow for
moisture<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.180> these

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
moisture if you put all of these

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
moisture if you put all of these
shingles<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:19.020> next<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.409> gether<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.400> wood

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
shingles right next to gether the wood

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.160 
shingles right next to gether the wood
shingles<00:01:21.119> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.420> put<00:01:21.630> them<00:01:21.720> next<00:01:21.930> together

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
shingles if you put them next together

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
shingles if you put them next together
and<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:23.549> lay<00:01:23.729> them<00:01:23.939> out<00:01:24.030> they<00:01:24.240> would<00:01:24.360> actually

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and you lay them out they would actually

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.490 
and you lay them out they would actually
buckle<00:01:25.549> once<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.909> wet<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.200> shake

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
buckle once they got wet and the shake

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
buckle once they got wet and the shake
shingles<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.400> cram<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:29.700> next<00:01:30.180> together

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
shingles you cram them next together

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
shingles you cram them next together
you'd<00:01:30.600> probably<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> same<00:01:31.350> problem

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you'd probably have the same problem

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.789 
you'd probably have the same problem
cedar<00:01:32.280> shingles<00:01:33.060> for<00:01:33.450> sure<00:01:33.930> I've<00:01:34.530> actually

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
cedar shingles for sure I've actually

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.480 
cedar shingles for sure I've actually
seen<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.400> happen<00:01:36.799> but<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> biggest<00:01:38.040> problem

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
seen that happen but the biggest problem

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
seen that happen but the biggest problem
with<00:01:38.640> wood<00:01:38.850> shingles<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
with wood shingles is that they are a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.840 
with wood shingles is that they are a
fire<00:01:40.619> hazard<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:42.320> be<00:01:43.320> aware<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.579> would

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
fire hazard so be aware of that I would

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.450 
fire hazard so be aware of that I would
imagine<00:01:45.119> i've<00:01:45.689> seen<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.229> shake<00:01:46.740> roofs<00:01:47.070> last

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
imagine i've seen these shake roofs last

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.960 
imagine i've seen these shake roofs last
about<00:01:47.909> 50<00:01:48.420> years<00:01:48.689> shocking<00:01:49.649> i<00:01:50.460> would<00:01:50.880> imagine

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
about 50 years shocking i would imagine

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.950 
about 50 years shocking i would imagine
most<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.689> them<00:01:51.780> last<00:01:52.020> about<00:01:52.290> 30<00:01:52.740> years<00:01:53.869> but<00:01:54.869> if

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
most of them last about 30 years but if

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
most of them last about 30 years but if
you<00:01:55.049> took<00:01:55.229> care<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.799> lived<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> right

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you took care of them lived in the right

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.490 
you took care of them lived in the right
climate<00:01:58.610> i<00:01:59.610> don't<00:02:00.210> really<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.540> long<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
climate i don't really know how long you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.959 
climate i don't really know how long you
know<00:02:01.619> who<00:02:01.829> knows<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.189> long<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.579> could<00:02:02.729> last

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
know who knows how long they could last

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.539 
know who knows how long they could last
i<00:02:03.119> don't<00:02:03.450> i<00:02:03.659> should<00:02:03.899> say<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.890> video<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.430> about

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the shake shingles I figured that fire

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160 
the shake shingles I figured that fire
retardant<00:02:36.520> meant<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.750> wouldn't<00:02:37.930> catch

on<00:02:38.380> fire<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:39.010> took<00:02:39.580> him<00:02:39.850> home<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.180> did<00:02:40.330> my<00:02:40.480> own

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
on fire I took him home and did my own

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.350 
on fire I took him home and did my own
little<00:02:40.750> test<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:42.250> could<00:02:42.370> hardly<00:02:42.820> tell<00:02:43.210> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
little test and I could hardly tell the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.050 
little test and I could hardly tell the
difference<00:02:43.390> between<00:02:44.430> them<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.850> other

difference between them and the other
wood<00:02:46.390> shingles<00:02:46.840> once<00:02:47.050> they<00:02:47.230> started<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.710> fire

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
them anyway so and be careful using them

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.950 
them anyway so and be careful using them
on<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.350> outside<00:03:47.710> of<00:03:47.890> your<00:03:48.010> building<00:03:48.190> too
