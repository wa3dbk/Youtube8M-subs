in<00:00:55.149> your<00:00:55.570> technique<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.280> there<00:00:57.460> are

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
in your technique so there are

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.500 
in your technique so there are

definitely some truths that are somewhat
universal<00:01:02.230> now<00:01:02.320> I<00:01:02.350> say<00:01:02.590> somewhat<00:01:03.070> I<00:01:03.250> must

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
universal now I say somewhat I must

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.990 
universal now I say somewhat I must
qualify<00:01:04.019> why<00:01:05.070> because<00:01:06.070> there<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.460> more<00:01:06.820> than

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
qualify why because there is more than

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.149 
qualify why because there is more than
one<00:01:07.240> way<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.479> approach<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:08.049> piano<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.799> if<00:01:09.070> you

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
one way to approach the piano and if you

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.500 
one way to approach the piano and if you
look<00:01:09.370> at<00:01:09.490> different<00:01:09.580> pianists<00:01:10.120> you'll<00:01:10.240> see

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
that there are different techniques now

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.219 
father's concept of playing the piano is
what<00:01:30.580> he<00:01:30.729> would<00:01:30.850> describe<00:01:31.150> is<00:01:31.420> with<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> quiet

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
what he would describe is with a quiet

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.340 
what he would describe is with a quiet

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.550 
hand that is a minimal amount of motion
and<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.580> was<00:01:36.909> trained<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.479> play<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.990> piano<00:01:38.290> with

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
and I was trained to play the piano with

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.890 
and I was trained to play the piano with
just<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.220> minimal<00:01:39.729> amount<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.360> mood<00:01:40.659> of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
just the minimal amount of mood of

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.380 
just the minimal amount of mood of
movement<00:01:41.380> necessary<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.189> order<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.760> produce

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
movement necessary in order to produce

movement necessary in order to produce
the<00:01:43.840> results<00:01:44.409> desired<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:46.060> made

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the results desired and that made

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.640 
the results desired and that made
perfect<00:01:46.630> sense<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:46.960> me<00:01:47.049> now<00:01:47.290> there<00:01:47.439> are<00:01:47.500> other

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
perfect sense to me now there are other

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.679 
perfect sense to me now there are other
aspects<00:01:48.250> with<00:01:48.759> wrist<00:01:49.030> technique<00:01:49.299> for

started<00:02:04.479> studying<00:02:04.570> with<00:02:04.900> her<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.530> she

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
started studying with her and she

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.560 
started studying with her and she
encouraged<00:02:06.280> me<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.430> loosen<00:02:06.909> up<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.299> allow

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
encouraged me to loosen up and allow

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.650 
encouraged me to loosen up and allow
more<00:02:07.930> movement<00:02:08.739> on<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.610> keyboard<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.360> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
more movement on the keyboard and the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.500 
more movement on the keyboard and the
arms<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.349> get<00:02:11.500> more<00:02:11.800> into<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> mix<00:02:12.640> as<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
in other videos there are different

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.970 
in other videos there are different

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
approaches that are necessary for

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
approaches that are necessary for
different<00:02:17.640> types<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.360> physical<00:02:18.930> structures

different types of physical structures

different types of physical structures
different<00:02:21.000> people<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.599> more<00:02:21.989> strength<00:02:22.379> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
different people have more strength and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.640 
different people have more strength and
more<00:02:22.829> power<00:02:23.159> more<00:02:23.939> mass<00:02:24.329> bigger<00:02:25.110> hands

more power more mass bigger hands

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.970 
more power more mass bigger hands
smaller<00:02:26.189> hands<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.420> there<00:02:27.629> are<00:02:27.840> many<00:02:28.290> right

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
smaller hands so there are many right

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.580

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
things that could be done and many wrong

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
things that can be done but there is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.009 
things that can be done but there is
also<00:02:33.959> an<00:02:34.079> area<00:02:34.319> between<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.819> combines<00:02:36.629> both

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
also an area between that combines both

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.160 
also an area between that combines both
right<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.040> wrong<00:02:38.280> in<00:02:38.640> some<00:02:39.120> instances<00:02:39.720> these

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
right and wrong in some instances these

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
right and wrong in some instances these
same<00:02:40.500> techniques<00:02:40.980> may<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.280> dismissed<00:02:41.879> by<00:02:42.060> some

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
same techniques may be dismissed by some

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.190 
same techniques may be dismissed by some
and<00:02:42.810> embraced<00:02:43.590> by<00:02:43.859> others<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:45.209> there's<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.870> gray

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
and embraced by others so there's a gray

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.449 
and embraced by others so there's a gray
area<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:48.060> these<00:02:48.450> techniques<00:02:49.079> of

area and in these techniques of

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
area and in these techniques of
questionable<00:02:50.459> value<00:02:50.760> where<00:02:51.269> some<00:02:51.569> people<00:02:51.720> may

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
questionable value where some people may

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.009 
questionable value where some people may

the application of a technique makes it

you're<00:03:21.030> using<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.230> yes<00:03:22.560> there<00:03:22.829> are<00:03:22.859> some

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you're using it so yes there are some

you're using it so yes there are some
right<00:03:23.549> techniques<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> there<00:03:24.419> are<00:03:24.480> some

right techniques and there are some
wrong<00:03:24.840> techniques<00:03:25.290> but<00:03:26.040> more<00:03:26.730> than<00:03:26.910> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
wrong techniques but more than that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.699 
wrong techniques but more than that
there<00:03:27.449> are<00:03:27.569> many<00:03:27.840> techniques<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.620> be

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
there are many techniques that can be

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.800 
there are many techniques that can be
