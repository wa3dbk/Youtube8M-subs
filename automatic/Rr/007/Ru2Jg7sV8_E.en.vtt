and<00:03:40.440> look<00:03:40.650> what<00:03:40.680> we<00:03:40.860> found<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.819> American

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770

signal crayfish now there are lots of
ways<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.380> can<00:03:46.470> tell<00:03:46.650> they're<00:03:46.890> American

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
crayfish which are the invaders which we

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.449 
crayfish which are the invaders which we
don't<00:03:50.220> want<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:50.580> our<00:03:50.790> rivers<00:03:52.280> largely<00:03:53.280> it's

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
don't want in our rivers largely it's

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.589 
don't want in our rivers largely it's
the<00:03:53.580> way<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.940> they<00:03:54.030> have<00:03:54.150> these<00:03:54.300> red

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
the way that they have these red

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.420 
the way that they have these red
undersized<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.560> their<00:03:55.709> claws<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:56.250> these

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
undersized to their claws with these

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
undersized to their claws with these
white<00:03:56.730> bits<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.540> they<00:03:57.660> flush<00:03:57.989> them<00:03:58.230> up<00:03:58.349> and

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
white bits and they flush them up and

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.250 
white bits and they flush them up and
down<00:03:58.680> like<00:03:58.860> this<00:03:59.040> that's<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.090> signal<00:04:01.080> like

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
down like this that's the signal like

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.710 
down like this that's the signal like
semaphore<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.910> one's<00:04:03.120> this<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
semaphore and this one's this is the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.160 
semaphore and this one's this is the
bigger

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
bigger

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.720 
bigger
that's<00:04:04.530> quite<00:04:04.739> small<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.220> crayfish<00:04:05.430> I

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
that's quite small for a crayfish I

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.360 
that's quite small for a crayfish I
think<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.420> that's<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.750> baby<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:08.100> stream

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
think but that's a baby one this stream

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.680 
think but that's a baby one this stream
probably<00:04:08.730> would<00:04:08.850> have<00:04:08.910> had<00:04:09.090> native<00:04:09.480> crayfish

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
probably would have had native crayfish

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.539 
probably would have had native crayfish
at<00:04:10.019> one<00:04:10.200> stage<00:04:10.610> but<00:04:11.610> these<00:04:12.170> little<00:04:13.170> invaders<00:04:13.739> I

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
at one stage but these little invaders I

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.539 
at one stage but these little invaders I
suspect<00:04:15.480> wipe<00:04:15.690> them<00:04:15.810> all<00:04:15.930> out<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.079> here<00:04:16.549> which

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
suspect wipe them all out of here which

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.219 
suspect wipe them all out of here which
is<00:04:17.669> great<00:04:17.760> shame<00:04:18.060> although<00:04:18.510> these<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.930> taste

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
is great shame although these do taste

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:28.100 
is great shame although these do taste
very<00:04:19.500> good

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.300 

this<00:04:29.110> is<00:04:29.230> great<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.830> nice<00:04:30.070> or

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
this is great this is like a nice or

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.780 
this is great this is like a nice or
wild<00:04:30.640> West<00:04:30.910> cattle<00:04:31.720> ranch<00:04:32.170> that<00:04:32.380> has<00:04:32.890> been

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
wild West cattle ranch that has been

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.690 
wild West cattle ranch that has been
abandoned<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:35.380> feels<00:04:35.620> like<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:35.980> in<00:04:36.070> this<00:04:36.220> heat

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
abandoned it feels like it in this heat

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.730 
abandoned it feels like it in this heat
and<00:04:36.850> this<00:04:37.030> dry<00:04:37.420> kind<00:04:38.050> of<00:04:38.110> Prairie<00:04:38.350> we're<00:04:38.620> up

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
and this dry kind of Prairie we're up

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.620 
and this dry kind of Prairie we're up
here<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.610> Cotswolds<00:04:40.060> plateau<00:04:40.300> so

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
here on this is the Cotswolds plateau so

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.270 
here on this is the Cotswolds plateau so
we've<00:04:40.750> come<00:04:40.900> out<00:04:40.990> of<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.260> valley<00:04:41.440> now<00:04:41.770> and

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
we've come out of the valley now and

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.980 
we've come out of the valley now and
we're<00:04:42.610> up<00:04:42.700> on<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.940> top<00:04:43.210> so<00:04:43.450> it's<00:04:43.570> all<00:04:43.690> dry

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
we're up on the top so it's all dry

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.920 
we're up on the top so it's all dry
stone<00:04:44.320> walls<00:04:44.910> little<00:04:45.910> country<00:04:46.240> lanes<00:04:46.480> and

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
stone walls little country lanes and

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.570 
stone walls little country lanes and
it's<00:04:47.170> quite<00:04:47.350> flat<00:04:47.650> like<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.920> lot<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:48.280> top<00:04:48.460> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
it's quite flat like a lot of the top of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.430 
it's quite flat like a lot of the top of
the<00:04:48.640> Cotswolds<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.600> actually<00:04:49.990> massively

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
the Cotswolds not actually massively

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.970 
the Cotswolds not actually massively
exciting<00:04:51.480> topographically<00:04:52.480> I<00:04:52.630> suppose<00:04:52.990> it's

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
exciting topographically I suppose it's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.160 
exciting topographically I suppose it's
so<00:04:54.250> we<00:04:54.790> were<00:04:54.880> wandering<00:04:55.390> back<00:04:55.600> towards<00:04:56.050> the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
so we were wandering back towards the

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.680 
so we were wandering back towards the
village<00:04:56.410> now<00:04:56.730> along<00:04:57.730> this<00:04:57.880> long<00:04:58.660> dusty<00:04:59.350> Lane

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
village now along this long dusty Lane

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.659 
village now along this long dusty Lane
so<00:05:01.690> yeah<00:05:01.900> it's<00:05:02.230> been<00:05:02.290> a<00:05:02.440> lovely<00:05:03.040> day<00:05:03.160> we're

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
so yeah it's been a lovely day we're

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:04.860 
so yeah it's been a lovely day we're
beginning<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.030> feel<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.210> heat<00:05:04.480> now<00:05:04.510> and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
beginning to feel the heat now and

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.180 
beginning to feel the heat now and
running<00:05:05.440> out<00:05:05.560> of<00:05:05.590> water

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
running out of water

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.130 
running out of water
so<00:05:06.370> make<00:05:06.730> make<00:05:07.000> our<00:05:07.150> way<00:05:07.270> back<00:05:07.480> to<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.720> cars<00:05:07.930> I

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
so make make our way back to the cars I

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.169 
so make make our way back to the cars I
think
