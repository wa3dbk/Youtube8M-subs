00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and we do that then we'll select some

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.890 
and we do that then we'll select some
edging<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.140> we're<00:02:01.229> gonna<00:02:01.350> put

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
edging that we're gonna put

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.960 
edging that we're gonna put
okay<00:02:02.530> an<00:02:02.710> edging<00:02:03.100> what<00:02:03.610> are<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:03.760> going<00:02:03.880> to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
okay an edging what are we going to

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.130 
okay an edging what are we going to
engine<00:02:04.330> we're<00:02:04.480> going<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.780> use<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.790> ultra<00:02:06.790> edge

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
engine we're going to use is ultra edge

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.990 
engine we're going to use is ultra edge
ultra<00:02:08.140> edge<00:02:08.290> is<00:02:08.500> a<00:02:08.619> composite<00:02:09.070> made<00:02:09.580> of<00:02:09.729> wood

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
ultra edge is a composite made of wood

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.960 
ultra edge is a composite made of wood
flour<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.810> resin<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.100> it's<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.490> nice<00:02:12.670> deep

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
flour and resin and it's a nice deep

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.580 
flour and resin and it's a nice deep
profile<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.720> we'll<00:02:13.840> keep<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.110> grass<00:02:14.320> from

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
profile so we'll keep the grass from

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.040 
profile so we'll keep the grass from
moving<00:02:14.950> in<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.730> has<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.850> nice<00:02:16.090> natural<00:02:16.750> look

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
moving in and it has a nice natural look

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.290 
moving in and it has a nice natural look
so<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.410> looks<00:02:17.620> better<00:02:17.860> than<00:02:18.550> some<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
so it looks better than some of the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.930 
so it looks better than some of the
black<00:02:19.480> plastic<00:02:19.750> edges<00:02:20.350> absolutely<00:02:21.220> okay<00:02:21.700> good

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
black plastic edges absolutely okay good

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.430 
black plastic edges absolutely okay good

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:44.190 
first to determine the shape we're gonna
use<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> garden<00:02:36.040> hose<00:02:40.830> that's<00:02:41.830> good<00:02:42.300> okay<00:02:43.300> now

these weeds you come across these little

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.270 
these weeds you come across these little
creatures<00:03:28.440> some<00:03:29.440> other<00:03:29.560> shows<00:03:29.830> out<00:03:29.980> there<00:03:30.010> eat

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.649 

so<00:03:35.400> by<00:03:35.640> looking<00:03:35.849> at<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.209> difference<00:03:36.510> between

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
so by looking at the difference between

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.240 
so by looking at the difference between
Richard<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.379> you<00:03:37.439> can<00:03:37.709> see<00:03:37.859> who's<00:03:38.069> doing

most<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.579> work<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:39.180> think<00:03:39.689> we<00:03:40.170> need<00:03:40.469> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
most of the work I think we need to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.860 
most of the work I think we need to
we've<00:03:41.519> got<00:03:41.670> our<00:03:41.700> edge<00:03:41.939> down<00:03:42.209> now<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.689> if<00:03:42.780> we

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
we've got our edge down now and if we

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.449 
we've got our edge down now and if we
need<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.049> pull<00:03:43.319> up<00:03:43.439> the<00:03:43.560> hose<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.769> prepare<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
need to pull up the hose and prepare to

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.030 
need to pull up the hose and prepare to
put<00:03:44.730> our<00:03:44.879> edging<00:03:45.510> border<00:03:45.810> okay<00:03:46.319> sounds<00:03:46.859> good

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
put our edging border okay sounds good

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.339 
put our edging border okay sounds good
my<00:03:47.879> major<00:03:48.060> concern<00:03:48.209> really<00:03:48.689> has<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.019> do<00:03:49.200> with

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
my major concern really has to do with

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.170 
my major concern really has to do with
the<00:03:49.469> edging<00:03:49.920> around<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.310> garden<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.939> where

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
the edging around the garden of where

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.599 
the edging around the garden of where
the<00:03:51.420> garda<00:03:52.290> meets<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.680> grass<00:03:52.950> because<00:03:53.459> I've

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
the garda meets the grass because I've

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.190 
the garda meets the grass because I've
seen<00:03:53.639> some<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.150> my<00:03:54.359> neighbors<00:03:54.420> where<00:03:55.079> they

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
seen some of my neighbors where they

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.530 
seen some of my neighbors where they
have<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.650> black<00:03:55.889> rubber<00:03:56.189> I've<00:03:56.730> seen<00:03:56.939> plastic

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
have the black rubber I've seen plastic

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.059 
have the black rubber I've seen plastic
and<00:03:57.959> I'm<00:03:58.019> really<00:03:58.139> not<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.409> fond<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.010> that<00:04:04.069> the
