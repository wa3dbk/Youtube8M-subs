00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
goes to about over here and that should

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.499 
goes to about over here and that should
give<00:01:10.840> it<00:01:10.960> plenty<00:01:11.290> of<00:01:11.560> stability<00:01:11.860> and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
withstand a lot of no's crashes because

withstand a lot of no's crashes because
as<00:01:16.570> you<00:01:16.689> know<00:01:16.720> this<00:01:16.930> plane<00:01:17.229> kind<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.680> floats

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
as you know this plane kind of floats

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440 
as you know this plane kind of floats
and<00:01:18.310> if<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.520> don't<00:01:18.640> have<00:01:18.790> air<00:01:18.910> lines<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.420> it

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
and if you don't have air lines on it

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.910 
and if you don't have air lines on it
it's<00:01:19.720> kind<00:01:19.870> of<00:01:19.900> tough<00:01:20.110> to<00:01:20.290> lean<00:01:20.440> without<00:01:20.800> it

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
it's kind of tough to lean without it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.000 
it's kind of tough to lean without it
dip<00:01:21.130> into<00:01:21.280> one<00:01:21.490> side<00:01:22.050> and<00:01:23.050> depending<00:01:23.770> on<00:01:23.860> where

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
dip into one side and depending on where

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.040 
dip into one side and depending on where
you<00:01:24.100> live<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.730> know<00:01:24.850> up<00:01:25.720> here<00:01:25.900> in<00:01:25.990> the

well um thanks Billy and so yeah so this
is<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.010> great<00:01:54.190> plane<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.640> fly<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:55.090> love<00:01:55.510> it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
is a great plane to fly and I love it's

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.390 
is a great plane to fly and I love it's
a<00:01:55.750> lot<00:01:55.900> of<00:01:55.930> fun<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.680> you're<00:01:56.890> not<00:01:57.010> afraid<00:01:57.130> to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
a lot of fun and you're not afraid to

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.980 
a lot of fun and you're not afraid to
crash<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:57.970> if<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.120> do<00:01:58.240> crash<00:01:58.510> it<00:01:58.690> you<00:01:58.810> can

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
crash it and if you do crash it you can

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.360 
crash it and if you do crash it you can
most<00:01:59.409> likely<00:01:59.500> fix<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.810> know<00:02:01.930> and<00:02:02.370> actually

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
most likely fix it you know and actually

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.660 
most likely fix it you know and actually
this<00:02:03.880> little<00:02:04.680> rear<00:02:05.680> wheel<00:02:05.950> actually<00:02:06.460> works

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
this little rear wheel actually works

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.300 
this little rear wheel actually works
fairly<00:02:06.909> well<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.270> cement<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.799> landing<00:02:09.129> gear

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
fairly well in cement the landing gear

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.280 
fairly well in cement the landing gear
actually<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.390> know<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.569> kind<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.929> take<00:02:11.110> off<00:02:11.260> a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
actually you know you kind of take off a

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.800 
actually you know you kind of take off a
lot<00:02:11.560> because<00:02:11.860> you're<00:02:12.280> flying<00:02:12.700> in<00:02:13.090> fields<00:02:13.599> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
lot because you're flying in fields and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.199 
lot because you're flying in fields and
just<00:02:14.379> lands<00:02:14.650> better<00:02:14.890> without<00:02:15.610> landing<00:02:16.060> gear

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
just lands better without landing gear

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.759 
just lands better without landing gear
but<00:02:16.390> I've<00:02:16.480> happened<00:02:16.659> I<00:02:16.870> I've<00:02:17.140> landed<00:02:17.440> it

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
but I've happened I I've landed it

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.520 
but I've happened I I've landed it
plenty<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.489> times<00:02:18.549> on<00:02:19.510> cement<00:02:20.049> and<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.319> lands

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
plenty of times on cement and it lands

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.599 
plenty of times on cement and it lands
very<00:02:20.830> well<00:02:21.599> when<00:02:22.599> you<00:02:22.959> have<00:02:23.109> no<00:02:23.290> wind<00:02:23.469> and<00:02:23.980> it

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
very well when you have no wind and it

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.849 
very well when you have no wind and it
takes<00:02:24.790> off<00:02:24.969> very<00:02:25.209> well<00:02:25.299> also<00:02:25.629> so<00:02:26.529> it's<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.739> great

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
takes off very well also so it's a great

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:27.809 
takes off very well also so it's a great
plane<00:02:27.189> i<00:02:27.219> love<00:02:27.430> it

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
plane i love it

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.479 
plane i love it
and<00:02:27.969> a<00:02:28.780> lot<00:02:29.109> of<00:02:29.170> guys<00:02:29.379> out<00:02:29.590> there<00:02:29.650> having<00:02:30.159> fun

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
and a lot of guys out there having fun

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.410 
and a lot of guys out there having fun
with<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.939> and<00:02:32.280> we'll<00:02:33.280> see<00:02:33.430> how<00:02:33.519> it<00:02:33.549> goes<00:02:33.670> this

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
with it and we'll see how it goes this

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.479 
with it and we'll see how it goes this
is<00:02:34.599> another<00:02:35.200> modification<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:36.069> I'm<00:02:36.219> doing

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
is another modification that I'm doing

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.970 
is another modification that I'm doing
so<00:02:37.079> I'm<00:02:38.079> actually<00:02:38.290> thinking<00:02:38.650> about<00:02:38.829> putting

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
so I'm actually thinking about putting

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.559 
so I'm actually thinking about putting
higher<00:02:39.340> but<00:02:39.519> carbon<00:02:39.849> fiber<00:02:40.060> right<00:02:40.299> down<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
higher but carbon fiber right down the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.720 
higher but carbon fiber right down the
center<00:02:40.719> of<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.959> fuselage<00:02:41.530> over<00:02:42.489> time<00:02:42.700> it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
center of that fuselage over time it

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.809 
center of that fuselage over time it
does<00:02:42.999> weekend<00:02:43.389> because<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.930> foam<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.819> you

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
does weekend because it is foam so you

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.759 
does weekend because it is foam so you
know<00:02:45.909> I'll<00:02:46.060> probably<00:02:46.269> do<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.719> I<00:02:47.349> don't<00:02:47.709> know

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
know I'll probably do that I don't know

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.490 
know I'll probably do that I don't know
it's<00:02:48.670> not<00:02:48.879> it's<00:02:49.060> not<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.299> necessity<00:02:49.810> right<00:02:50.319> now

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
it's not it's not a necessity right now

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.110 
it's not it's not a necessity right now
but<00:02:50.799> eventually<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.700> future<00:02:51.760> I'll

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
but eventually in the future I'll

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.119 
but eventually in the future I'll
probably<00:02:52.329> do<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:52.599> if<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.409> don't<00:02:53.590> crash<00:02:53.799> and<00:02:54.010> burn

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
probably do it if I don't crash and burn

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.429 
probably do it if I don't crash and burn
it<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.239> an<00:02:55.329> easy<00:02:55.419> for<00:02:55.780> easy<00:02:56.019> plane<00:02:56.290> to

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
it but it's an easy for easy plane to

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.879 
it but it's an easy for easy plane to
fly<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:57.659> along<00:02:58.659> with<00:02:58.689> everyone<00:02:59.079> else<00:02:59.319> recommend

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
fly I along with everyone else recommend

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.339 
fly I along with everyone else recommend
this<00:03:00.010> as<00:03:00.189> your<00:03:00.459> first<00:03:00.730> plane<00:03:01.030> I've<00:03:01.900> had<00:03:02.139> plenty

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
this as your first plane I've had plenty

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.550 
this as your first plane I've had plenty
of<00:03:02.500> planes<00:03:02.859> on<00:03:03.219> the<00:03:03.250> past<00:03:04.109> mostly<00:03:05.109> all<00:03:05.260> gasp

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
of planes on the past mostly all gasp

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.640 
of planes on the past mostly all gasp
and<00:03:06.180> these<00:03:07.180> electric<00:03:07.810> ones<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.109> just<00:03:08.139> fun<00:03:08.500> to

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
and these electric ones I just fun to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.490 
and these electric ones I just fun to
fly<00:03:08.859> you<00:03:09.699> know<00:03:09.819> they<00:03:10.120> easy<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.719> assemble<00:03:11.109> it

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
fly you know they easy to assemble it

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.189 
fly you know they easy to assemble it
easy<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.859> build<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.189> easy<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.549> modify<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.930> you

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:14.199 
easy to build the easy to modify and you

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.649 
easy to build the easy to modify and you
know<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.949> all<00:03:15.099> foam<00:03:15.489> planes<00:03:15.909> are<00:03:16.239> just<00:03:16.449> great

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
know the all foam planes are just great

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:17.909 
know the all foam planes are just great
because<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.989> can<00:03:17.109> just<00:03:17.230> fix<00:03:17.530> them<00:03:17.680> with<00:03:17.799> some

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
because you can just fix them with some

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.629 
because you can just fix them with some
hot<00:03:18.040> glue<00:03:18.219> and<00:03:18.400> epoxy<00:03:18.639> so<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.400> that's<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.609> I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
hot glue and epoxy so and that's it I

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.220 
hot glue and epoxy so and that's it I
have<00:03:22.000> another<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:22.299> up<00:03:22.480> there<00:03:22.689> too<00:03:22.900> that's<00:03:23.049> a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
have another one up there too that's a

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.619 
have another one up there too that's a
little<00:03:23.409> Cessna<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.980> flies<00:03:24.730> very<00:03:24.849> Paulie<00:03:25.329> I

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
little Cessna that flies very Paulie I

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.629 
little Cessna that flies very Paulie I
actually<00:03:25.810> scrap<00:03:26.290> that<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.769> took<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.159> guts

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
actually scrap that and took the guts

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.699 
actually scrap that and took the guts
out<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.819> it<00:03:28.060> used<00:03:28.659> it<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.840> another<00:03:29.079> plane<00:03:29.409> but

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
out of it used it on another plane but

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.309 
out of it used it on another plane but
yeah<00:03:30.669> it's<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.090> lot<00:03:31.209> of<00:03:31.239> fun<00:03:31.329> hope<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.109> see<00:03:32.229> you

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
yeah it's a lot of fun hope to see you
