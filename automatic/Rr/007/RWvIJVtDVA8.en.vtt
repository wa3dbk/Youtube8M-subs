we're<00:01:07.260> adapted<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.830> air<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:08.700> quite

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
we're adapted for air so we're not quite

we're adapted for air so we're not quite
so<00:01:09.390> good<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.020> water<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> take

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
so good in water so if you take

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.460 
so good in water so if you take
something<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> dolphin<00:01:12.479> where<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
backflip oh is really well designed for

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.170 
backflip oh is really well designed for
imparting<00:01:16.439> momentum<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> water<00:01:17.759> and

imparting momentum to the water and
pushing<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> body<00:01:18.990> forward<00:01:19.530> also<00:01:20.119> sharks

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
pushing the body forward also sharks

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.690 
pushing the body forward also sharks
have<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> skin<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> adapted<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:23.009> decrease

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
have a skin which is adapted to decrease

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.810 
have a skin which is adapted to decrease
the<00:01:24.060> coefficient<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.990> drag<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.549> water

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the coefficient of drag of the water

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
the coefficient of drag of the water
over<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> body<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.810> give<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> nice

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
over the body and give a nice

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
over the body and give a nice
streamlined<00:01:29.040> flow<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> water

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
streamlined flow to the water

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.550 
streamlined flow to the water
particularly<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.110> reduce<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
particularly the back and reduce the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.310 
particularly the back and reduce the
drag<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.610> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.479> at<00:01:33.600> me<00:01:33.720> I've<00:01:33.900> got<00:01:34.110> quite

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
drag so if you look at me I've got quite

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109 
drag so if you look at me I've got quite
spindly<00:01:34.890> arms<00:01:34.920> not<00:01:35.549> particularly

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
spindly arms not particularly

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.480 
spindly arms not particularly
well-suited<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.720> pushing<00:01:37.680> against<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> water

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
well-suited to pushing against the water

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
well-suited to pushing against the water
and<00:01:39.450> imparting<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.170> momentum<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.710> I'm

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and imparting that momentum so I'm

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
and imparting that momentum so I'm
putting<00:01:41.100> rubbish<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.610> swimming<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.960> looking

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
putting rubbish at swimming so looking

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
putting rubbish at swimming so looking
at<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.530> important<00:01:44.040> self<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.640> events

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
at it so important self but for events

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.300 
at it so important self but for events
and<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.600> designed<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.290> such<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> way<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
and is it designed in such a way to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.999 
and is it designed in such a way to
maximize<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> speed<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.810> swimmers<00:01:49.140> yeah

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
maximize the speed of swimmers yeah

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.700 
maximize the speed of swimmers yeah
you'll<00:01:50.310> hear<00:01:50.579> people<00:01:50.759> talk<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.659> fast<00:01:52.229> pools

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you'll hear people talk about fast pools

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
you'll hear people talk about fast pools
or<00:01:52.979> fast<00:01:53.340> water<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.210> generally<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
or fast water and generally what that

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.200 
or fast water and generally what that
means<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.770> means<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> design<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> pool<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
means it means the design of the pool is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.450 
means it means the design of the pool is
quite<00:01:57.479> wide<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.810> quite<00:01:58.380> deep<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.310> what

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
quite wide and quite deep and what

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.940 
quite wide and quite deep and what
you'll<00:01:59.610> see<00:01:59.670> nowadays<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:01.049> perhaps<00:02:01.649> eight

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you'll see nowadays is perhaps eight

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980 
you'll see nowadays is perhaps eight
lanes<00:02:02.490> down<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.060> middle<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.450> two<00:02:03.719> outer

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
lanes down the middle with two outer

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.530 
lanes down the middle with two outer
lanes<00:02:04.439> not<00:02:04.740> being<00:02:05.009> used<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.329> water

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
lanes not being used and the water

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.059 
lanes not being used and the water
lapping<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> top<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.429> surface<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
lapping right to the top or surface of

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.640 
lapping right to the top or surface of
of<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.549> pool<00:02:10.789> itself<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:12.019> what<00:02:12.409> that<00:02:12.499> does

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
of the pool itself so what that does

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.800 
of the pool itself so what that does
that<00:02:12.680> reduces<00:02:13.549> the<00:02:13.670> reflections<00:02:14.329> of<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
that reduces the reflections of the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.869 
that reduces the reflections of the
waves<00:02:15.109> coming<00:02:15.439> off<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.739> front<00:02:15.920> of<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
waves coming off the front of the

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.059 
waves coming off the front of the
athletes<00:02:17.239> from<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.200> sides<00:02:18.439> of<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.739> pool<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
athletes from the sides of the pool and

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.770 
athletes from the sides of the pool and
coming<00:02:19.340> back<00:02:19.519> and<00:02:19.849> slowing<00:02:20.150> them<00:02:20.329> down

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
coming back and slowing them down

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.569 
coming back and slowing them down
and<00:02:20.900> equally<00:02:21.319> if<00:02:21.469> it<00:02:21.590> got<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.739> nice<00:02:21.950> deep<00:02:22.280> pool

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
and equally if it got a nice deep pool

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.830 
and equally if it got a nice deep pool
you<00:02:22.700> don't<00:02:22.879> get<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.180> getting<00:02:23.420> these<00:02:23.510> waves

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
you don't get it getting these waves

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.629 
you don't get it getting these waves
going<00:02:24.079> downwards<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:24.889> coming<00:02:25.129> back<00:02:25.280> up<00:02:25.489> and

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:25.639 
going downwards and coming back up and

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.610 
going downwards and coming back up and
Sloane<00:02:25.879> athlete<00:02:26.269> down<00:02:26.450> there's<00:02:27.409> a<00:02:27.469> lot<00:02:27.560> of

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
Sloane athlete down there's a lot of

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.929 
Sloane athlete down there's a lot of
excitement<00:02:27.889> a<00:02:28.069> few<00:02:28.219> years<00:02:28.370> ago<00:02:28.459> as<00:02:28.639> well<00:02:28.819> about

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
excitement a few years ago as well about

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.149 
excitement a few years ago as well about
these<00:02:29.239> all<00:02:29.599> body<00:02:29.930> suits<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.650> people<00:02:30.859> started

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
these all body suits that people started

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.879 
these all body suits that people started
wearing<00:02:31.340> which<00:02:31.609> led<00:02:32.359> to<00:02:32.389> a<00:02:32.689> load<00:02:33.290> of<00:02:33.409> records

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:33.889 
wearing which led to a load of records

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:36.099 
wearing which led to a load of records
falling<00:02:34.280> at<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.459> same<00:02:34.489> time<00:02:34.900> why<00:02:35.900> were<00:02:36.019> they

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
falling at the same time why were they

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.890 
falling at the same time why were they
so<00:02:36.290> effective<00:02:36.739> well<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.000> full<00:02:38.359> bodysuits

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
so effective well the full bodysuits

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.199 
so effective well the full bodysuits
they<00:02:39.019> started<00:02:39.499> out<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.889> half<00:02:40.310> body<00:02:40.639> suits<00:02:40.969> they

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
they started out as half body suits they

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.089 
they started out as half body suits they
went<00:02:41.389> to<00:02:41.510> full<00:02:41.780> body<00:02:42.019> suits<00:02:42.379> and<00:02:42.739> then<00:02:42.919> they

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
went to full body suits and then they

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.339 
went to full body suits and then they
had<00:02:43.340> polyurethane<00:02:44.239> panels<00:02:44.689> down<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.109> sides

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
had polyurethane panels down the sides

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.589 
had polyurethane panels down the sides
and<00:02:45.769> then<00:02:45.889> they<00:02:45.980> became<00:02:46.250> full<00:02:46.639> body<00:02:47.000> poly

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
and then they became full body poly

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.099 
and then they became full body poly
polyurethane<00:02:48.409> suits<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.239> those<00:02:50.239> final<00:02:50.810> suits

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
polyurethane suits and those final suits

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.830 
polyurethane suits and those final suits
were<00:02:51.319> very<00:02:51.889> very<00:02:52.129> stiff<00:02:52.579> material<00:02:52.819> so<00:02:53.510> yeah

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
were very very stiff material so yeah

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.659 
were very very stiff material so yeah
actually<00:02:54.079> took<00:02:54.439> quite<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.739> long<00:02:54.949> time<00:02:55.159> to<00:02:55.219> stuff

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:55.669 
actually took quite a long time to stuff

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.490 
actually took quite a long time to stuff
your<00:02:55.849> body<00:02:55.969> into<00:02:56.569> them<00:02:56.719> and<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.349> had<00:02:57.469> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
your body into them and that had a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.039 
your body into them and that had a
number<00:02:58.099> of<00:02:58.219> effects<00:02:58.579> first<00:02:59.449> of<00:02:59.659> all<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> bit

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
number of effects first of all a bit

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.920 
number of effects first of all a bit
like<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.319> shark<00:03:00.560> skin<00:03:00.829> it<00:03:01.299> improved<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.629> flow

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
like the shark skin it improved the flow

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.240 
like the shark skin it improved the flow
of<00:03:02.959> water<00:03:03.290> over<00:03:04.189> the<00:03:04.280> body<00:03:04.459> but<00:03:05.419> it<00:03:05.540> also

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
of water over the body but it also

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.500 
of water over the body but it also
squashed<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.400> body<00:03:07.609> into<00:03:08.090> more<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.389> a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
squashed the body into more of a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.569 
squashed the body into more of a
cylinder<00:03:08.840> so<00:03:09.409> that<00:03:09.439> the<00:03:09.620> cross-sectional

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
cylinder so that the cross-sectional

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.520 
cylinder so that the cross-sectional
area<00:03:10.669> presented<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.419> the<00:03:11.510> water<00:03:11.719> was<00:03:12.169> smaller

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
area presented to the water was smaller

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.780 
area presented to the water was smaller
and<00:03:12.859> if<00:03:12.919> the<00:03:13.010> cross-sectional<00:03:13.549> area<00:03:13.609> is

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
and if the cross-sectional area is

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.610 
and if the cross-sectional area is
smaller<00:03:14.090> than<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.359> drag<00:03:14.569> as'<00:03:14.750> is<00:03:14.959> smaller<00:03:15.379> as

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
smaller than the drag as' is smaller as

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.679 
smaller than the drag as' is smaller as
well<00:03:15.769> there<00:03:16.699> was<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.819> couple<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.060> other<00:03:17.120> effects

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
well there was a couple of other effects

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.869 
well there was a couple of other effects
there's<00:03:18.139> these<00:03:18.290> transient<00:03:19.040> effects<00:03:19.579> because

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
there's these transient effects because

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.990 
there's these transient effects because
the<00:03:20.030> body<00:03:20.239> is<00:03:20.359> quite<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> wobbly<00:03:21.319> mass<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:22.609> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
the body is quite a wobbly mass and the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.399 
the body is quite a wobbly mass and the
suits<00:03:23.239> were<00:03:23.359> so<00:03:23.509> stiff<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:23.959> stopped<00:03:24.229> that

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
suits were so stiff it's stopped that

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.499 
suits were so stiff it's stopped that
wobbling<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.129> stopped<00:03:25.519> any<00:03:25.639> transient<00:03:26.150> drag

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:26.509 
wobbling and stopped any transient drag

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.330 
wobbling and stopped any transient drag
appearing<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:27.169> then<00:03:27.229> there's<00:03:27.949> a<00:03:28.009> final

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
appearing and then there's a final

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.009 
appearing and then there's a final
effect<00:03:28.699> which<00:03:28.819> people<00:03:29.150> talked<00:03:29.389> about<00:03:29.689> which

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
effect which people talked about which

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.309 
effect which people talked about which
was<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.889> buoyancy<00:03:31.699> effect<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:33.109> it<00:03:33.169> was

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
was the buoyancy effect and and it was

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.439 
was the buoyancy effect and and it was
said<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.650> some<00:03:34.129> of<00:03:34.159> these<00:03:34.310> suits<00:03:34.699> allowed<00:03:35.419> a

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
said that some of these suits allowed a

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.990 
said that some of these suits allowed a
little<00:03:35.810> bit<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.019> buoyancy<00:03:36.909> particularly<00:03:37.909> at

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
little bit of buoyancy particularly at

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.670 
little bit of buoyancy particularly at
the<00:03:38.120> rear<00:03:38.569> of<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.810> body<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.319> if<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.409> think

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
the rear of the body and if you think

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.069 
the rear of the body and if you think
about<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:40.129> lot<00:03:40.430> of<00:03:40.519> your<00:03:40.639> effort<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.209> spent<00:03:41.959> in

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
about a lot of your effort is spent in

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.749 
about a lot of your effort is spent in
trying<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.379> keep<00:03:42.530> your<00:03:42.709> legs<00:03:42.979> up<00:03:43.250> so<00:03:43.519> that

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:43.759 
trying to keep your legs up so that

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.069 
trying to keep your legs up so that
you're<00:03:44.000> more<00:03:44.180> horizontally<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.870> water

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
you're more horizontally in the water

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.689 
you're more horizontally in the water
and<00:03:45.439> that<00:03:45.500> reduces<00:03:45.979> this<00:03:46.099> cross<00:03:46.340> sectional

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
and that reduces this cross sectional

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.699 
and that reduces this cross sectional
area<00:03:47.060> reduces<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.659> drag<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.470> if<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.590> got<00:03:48.680> a

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
area reduces the drag so if you got a

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.050 
area reduces the drag so if you got a
little<00:03:48.979> bit<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.159> buoyancy<00:03:49.519> at<00:03:49.759> the<00:03:49.849> rear

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
little bit of buoyancy at the rear

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.659 
little bit of buoyancy at the rear
keeping<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.109> rear<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.650> your<00:03:51.680> body<00:03:51.949> up<00:03:52.250> then

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
keeping the rear of your body up then

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.610 
keeping the rear of your body up then
it's<00:03:52.819> easier<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.449> do<00:03:53.629> so<00:03:53.659> perhaps<00:03:54.379> less

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
it's easier to do so perhaps less

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.890 
it's easier to do so perhaps less
fatiguing<00:03:55.280> and<00:03:55.519> allowing<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.209> put<00:03:56.359> more<00:03:56.599> force

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
fatiguing and allowing to put more force

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.050 
fatiguing and allowing to put more force
into<00:03:57.379> the<00:03:57.469> swim<00:03:57.650> itself<00:03:57.979> a<00:03:58.219> lot<00:03:58.639> of<00:03:58.699> excitement

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
into the swim itself a lot of excitement

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.449 
into the swim itself a lot of excitement
around<00:03:59.449> swimming<00:03:59.900> at<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.139> time<00:04:00.379> but<00:04:00.650> despite

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
around swimming at that time but despite

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.550 
around swimming at that time but despite
that<00:04:01.489> FINA<00:04:02.060> had<00:04:02.209> decided<00:04:02.479> to<00:04:02.719> ban<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.290> suits

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
that FINA had decided to ban the suits

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.309 
that FINA had decided to ban the suits
why<00:04:04.129> do<00:04:04.189> you<00:04:04.310> think<00:04:04.400> they<00:04:04.549> did<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:04.959> well<00:04:05.959> they

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
why do you think they did that well they

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.459 
why do you think they did that well they
didn't<00:04:06.620> like<00:04:06.849> the<00:04:07.849> world<00:04:08.479> records<00:04:09.079> the<00:04:09.229> number

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
didn't like the world records the number

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.199 
didn't like the world records the number
of<00:04:09.680> World<00:04:09.829> Records<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.430> being<00:04:10.639> broken<00:04:10.939> in

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
of World Records that being broken in

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.370 
of World Records that being broken in
2008<00:04:11.930> into

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
2008 into

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.370 
2008 into
thousand<00:04:12.740> nine<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.850> they<00:04:14.570> felt<00:04:14.900> that<00:04:15.170> perhaps

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
thousand nine so they felt that perhaps

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.680 
thousand nine so they felt that perhaps
the<00:04:15.770> swimsuit<00:04:16.250> was<00:04:16.570> dominating<00:04:17.570> the

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
the swimsuit was dominating the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.270 
the swimsuit was dominating the
performance<00:04:18.200> as<00:04:18.350> opposed<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.770> the<00:04:18.920> athlete

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
performance as opposed to the athlete

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.810 
performance as opposed to the athlete
and<00:04:19.520> and<00:04:20.000> we<00:04:20.330> as<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:21.170> audience<00:04:21.560> like<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.340> think

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
and and we as the audience like to think

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.250 
and and we as the audience like to think
that<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.180> athlete<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.810> that's

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
that it's the athlete that that's

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.410 
that it's the athlete that that's
winning<00:04:24.500> so<00:04:24.800> FINA<00:04:25.070> came<00:04:25.400> down<00:04:25.640> said<00:04:25.880> okay

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
winning so FINA came down said okay

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.690 
winning so FINA came down said okay
no<00:04:26.780> more<00:04:27.050> from<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.350> first<00:04:27.590> of<00:04:27.740> January<00:04:27.950> we're

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
no more from the first of January we're

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.690 
no more from the first of January we're
going<00:04:28.730> to<00:04:28.880> ban<00:04:29.150> these<00:04:29.330> suits<00:04:30.070> 2010<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.580> we'll

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
going to ban these suits 2010 and we'll

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.520 
going to ban these suits 2010 and we'll
see<00:04:31.850> them<00:04:32.000> no<00:04:32.120> more<00:04:32.270> only<00:04:33.170> does<00:04:33.290> that<00:04:33.380> mean

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
see them no more only does that mean

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.830 
see them no more only does that mean
that<00:04:33.680> all<00:04:33.770> the<00:04:33.980> records<00:04:34.490> FLV<00:04:35.150> void<00:04:35.360> or<00:04:35.660> they

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
that all the records FLV void or they

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.720 
that all the records FLV void or they
reset<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.350> world<00:04:36.740> records<00:04:37.250> oh<00:04:37.280> hell<00:04:37.400> yeah

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
reset the world records oh hell yeah

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.880 
reset the world records oh hell yeah
that<00:04:38.480> was<00:04:38.600> interesting<00:04:38.810> they<00:04:39.140> didn't<00:04:39.440> reset

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
that was interesting they didn't reset

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.740 
that was interesting they didn't reset
any<00:04:40.070> records<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:40.910> records<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.540> were

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
any records so the records that were

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.010 
any records so the records that were
broken<00:04:42.110> in<00:04:42.350> 2008<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:43.190> 2009<00:04:43.700> will<00:04:44.540> still<00:04:44.780> stand

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
broken in 2008 and 2009 will still stand

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.050 
broken in 2008 and 2009 will still stand
but<00:04:45.770> what<00:04:45.950> that<00:04:46.070> means<00:04:46.370> is<00:04:46.640> we've<00:04:46.820> got<00:04:47.030> some

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
but what that means is we've got some

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.970 
but what that means is we've got some
records<00:04:47.690> in<00:04:47.960> particularly<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.650> Sprint

events the 50 meters 100 meters which

events the 50 meters 100 meters which

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
will not be broke for quite some years

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:07.390 
will not be broke for quite some years
to<00:04:54.110> come<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.680> we<00:04:54.980> just<00:04:55.130> have<00:04:55.250> to<00:04:55.340> live<00:04:55.460> with<00:04:55.490> up
