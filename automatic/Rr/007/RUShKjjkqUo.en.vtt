00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 A Ritmo rests in the Sunshine 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 By surprise, stiletto in the words 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.000
 I WAS SURPRISED AT NIGHT BY MY BOSTEZOS 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000

 AND LET THAT PLANT GROW AND FLOURISH 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 IT IS SO FRAGILE THE FEAR SO I ENJOY IT 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 WHEN THE JOY WITHOUT EFFORT WINS THE DISPUTE 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.500
 BETTER HOPE FOR GOD TO COME FOR HER 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
 SO WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL ALSO NOT ANSWER 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 THE INTERROGANT BEHIND THE FRAME OF A DOOR 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 IN A CLOUD SO SOFT, FROM ACÁ IF IT SEES SOFT 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.000
 DRAW A BED, REST YOUR SOULS, 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 TO TALK ABOUT THE THEMES THAT CONSOLAR US 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.500
 THAT THEY WERE OPENING WAYS, DIFFICULT AND SOMETHING STRANGE 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
