off but not that's just off the surface
the<00:01:44.960> Krylon<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.620> actually<00:01:46.040> bonded<00:01:46.580> to<00:01:47.020> the

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the Krylon is actually bonded to the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.490 
the Krylon is actually bonded to the
polycarbonate<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:49.450> can't<00:01:50.450> remove<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.290> in

polycarbonate I can't remove it just in

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.120 
polycarbonate I can't remove it just in
just<00:01:51.740> as<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.979> whole<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:54.410> Krylon<00:01:54.680> I

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
just as a whole like I can the Krylon I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.710 
just as a whole like I can the Krylon I
mean<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.760> rust-oleum<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.450> rust-oleum

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
mean the the rust-oleum the rust-oleum

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.230 
mean the the rust-oleum the rust-oleum
comes<00:01:57.050> right<00:01:57.320> off<00:01:57.850> let's<00:01:58.850> do<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.060> again

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.080 

back<00:02:05.240> to<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.450> Krylon<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.860> can<00:02:10.280> tell<00:02:10.520> on

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
back to the Krylon and it I can tell on

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.270 
back to the Krylon and it I can tell on
the<00:02:11.239> surface<00:02:11.690> when<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.870> do<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.560> can't<00:02:12.920> feel

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
the surface when I do that I can't feel

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.170 
the surface when I do that I can't feel
my<00:02:14.080> scratch<00:02:15.080> marks<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:16.100> looks<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.760> me<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
my scratch marks it looks like to me the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.760 
my scratch marks it looks like to me the
matte<00:02:17.450> finish<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:19.190> Krylon<00:02:20.320> is<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.590> kind

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770

use<00:04:08.840> krylon<00:04:11.049> alright<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.170> give<00:04:12.290> you<00:04:12.379> a<00:04:12.440> quick

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
use krylon alright to give you a quick

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.069 
use krylon alright to give you a quick
gun<00:04:13.250> old<00:04:13.519> test<00:04:13.760> this<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.360> what<00:04:14.540> I<00:04:14.569> use<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.870> lot

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
gun old test this is what I use a lot

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.080 
gun old test this is what I use a lot
like<00:04:15.349> rim<00:04:15.799> oil<00:04:16.039> with<00:04:16.190> Teflon<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:19.000> we'll<00:04:20.000> just

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
like rim oil with Teflon so we'll just

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.740 
like rim oil with Teflon so we'll just
give<00:04:20.239> it<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.389> good<00:04:20.510> squirt<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:23.360> I'll<00:04:23.449> let<00:04:23.630> this

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
give it a good squirt and I'll let this

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:36.090 
give it a good squirt and I'll let this
sit<00:04:24.020> on<00:04:24.169> here<00:04:24.380> for<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.710> while<00:04:24.889> we'll<00:04:25.130> come<00:04:25.340> back

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.180 

I'm<00:04:37.100> not<00:04:37.250> even<00:04:37.460> worried<00:04:37.790> about<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:39.040> about<00:04:40.040> the

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
I'm not even worried about the about the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:52.300 
I'm not even worried about the about the
rust-oleum<00:04:41.740> I'm<00:04:42.740> not<00:04:42.860> going<00:04:43.010> to<00:04:43.070> use<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:51.310> as

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
rust-oleum I'm not going to use it as

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.600 
rust-oleum I'm not going to use it as
you<00:04:52.520> can<00:04:52.670> see<00:04:53.560> krylon<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.800> impervious<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.400> the

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
you can see krylon is impervious to the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.090 
you can see krylon is impervious to the
rim<00:04:55.790> wall<00:04:56.000> and<00:04:56.540> that's<00:04:57.350> what<00:04:57.470> I'll<00:04:57.560> be<00:04:57.710> using<00:04:57.740> a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
rim wall and that's what I'll be using a

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.350 
rim wall and that's what I'll be using a
little<00:05:01.100> different<00:05:01.400> angle<00:05:01.550> here<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:01.910> think<00:05:02.270> you

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
little different angle here I think you

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.180 
little different angle here I think you
can<00:05:02.510> see<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.870> better<00:05:05.710> it's<00:05:06.710> been<00:05:06.830> on<00:05:06.980> here

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
can see that better it's been on here

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.180 
can see that better it's been on here
for<00:05:07.250> about<00:05:07.580> 30<00:05:07.880> minutes<00:05:08.300> now<00:05:10.570> nothing<00:05:12.190> they

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
for about 30 minutes now nothing they

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.100 
for about 30 minutes now nothing they
got<00:05:13.370> a<00:05:13.400> flake<00:05:13.790> on<00:05:13.970> my<00:05:14.120> finger<00:05:14.480> of<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.990> old

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
got a flake on my finger of the old

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.860 
got a flake on my finger of the old
stuff<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.440> scratched<00:05:15.740> off<00:05:16.040> but<00:05:16.430> it's<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:17.030> it

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
stuff I scratched off but it's a it

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.270 
stuff I scratched off but it's a it
would<00:05:17.990> be<00:05:18.080> turning<00:05:18.290> my<00:05:18.440> fingers<00:05:18.740> black<00:05:18.950> if<00:05:19.160> it

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
would be turning my fingers black if it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.500 
would be turning my fingers black if it
was<00:05:19.400> actually<00:05:19.820> dissolving<00:05:20.360> it<00:05:20.450> but<00:05:20.570> it's<00:05:20.720> not

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
was actually dissolving it but it's not

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.260 
was actually dissolving it but it's not
okay<00:05:23.510> so<00:05:23.890> this<00:05:24.890> is<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.310> polymer<00:05:25.610> lower<00:05:25.880> that

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
okay so this is the polymer lower that

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.980 
okay so this is the polymer lower that
has<00:05:26.360> been<00:05:26.540> painted<00:05:26.750> with<00:05:27.470> the<00:05:27.650> Krylon<00:05:28.090> and<00:05:29.090> you

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
has been painted with the Krylon and you

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.990 
has been painted with the Krylon and you
can<00:05:30.140> see<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.620> oil<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:31.070> mean<00:05:31.100> I've<00:05:31.340> old<00:05:31.550> up<00:05:31.790> my

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
can see the oil I mean I've old up my

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.250 
can see the oil I mean I've old up my
hammers<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.290> springs<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:35.080> detents<00:05:36.080> and
