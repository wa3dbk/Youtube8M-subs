 developing 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.380
 one that is still in process but two that are already holding one is 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.670
 a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:36.859
 the short film

 who directs cinema 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.920

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.110
 and now the project that is called strong inside, fragile on the outside 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.909
 this same question the campaign 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.559

 if it is that the premier and we will be presenting this product by all means 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.860

 they serve for certain chodos by the way certain 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.520
 lifestyle but also 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.320
 they are families that get married 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.599
