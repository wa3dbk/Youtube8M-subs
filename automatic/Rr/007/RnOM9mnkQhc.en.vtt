did try students we know completely life

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.690

as<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.350> see<00:02:40.500> at<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.860> start<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.280> had<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
as you can see at the start a I had a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300 
as you can see at the start a I had a
horrendous<00:02:42.030> start<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:43.110> absolutely<00:02:43.920> screwed<00:02:44.190> up

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
horrendous start I absolutely screwed up

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.530 
horrendous start I absolutely screwed up
on<00:02:44.400> these<00:02:44.520> cars<00:02:44.790> probably<00:02:45.030> cost<00:02:45.330> me<00:02:45.450> around

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
on these cars probably cost me around

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.210 
on these cars probably cost me around
about<00:02:45.780> 10<00:02:46.080> seconds<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.830> actually<00:02:46.950> looked

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
about 10 seconds and I actually looked

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.130 
about 10 seconds and I actually looked
back<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.580> really<00:02:47.970> did<00:02:48.450> cost<00:02:48.660> me<00:02:48.810> amazing

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
back and it really did cost me amazing

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.750 
back and it really did cost me amazing
good<00:02:49.320> profit<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.250> will<00:02:50.400> show<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.670> minute

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
good profit and I will show in a minute

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.370 
good profit and I will show in a minute
exactly<00:02:51.180> what<00:02:51.300> I've<00:02:51.390> made<00:02:51.570> but<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.080> think<00:02:52.320> this

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
exactly what I've made but I think this

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.170 
exactly what I've made but I think this
is<00:02:52.440> probably<00:02:52.830> lost<00:02:53.220> me<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> tasks<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:53.880> first

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
is probably lost me the tasks that first

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.390 
is probably lost me the tasks that first
10<00:02:54.390> seconds<00:02:54.840> I'll<00:02:55.530> take<00:02:55.800> lets<00:02:56.010> me<00:02:56.100> write<00:02:56.250> about

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
10 seconds I'll take lets me write about

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.460 
10 seconds I'll take lets me write about
maybe<00:02:56.700> five<00:02:57.060> or<00:02:57.090> six<00:02:57.540> cards<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.020> could<00:02:58.230> have<00:02:58.320> got

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
maybe five or six cards I could have got

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.840 
maybe five or six cards I could have got
gun<00:02:58.710> at<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> place<00:02:59.070> i'm<00:02:59.250> at<00:02:59.370> here<00:02:59.550> i<00:02:59.580> was<00:02:59.700> doing

it very quickly and that definitely will

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.650 
it very quickly and that definitely will
make<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.250> difference<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.880> saw<00:03:03.330> done<00:03:03.480> quite

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
correctly this is a good method probably

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.750 
correctly this is a good method probably
not<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.680> best<00:03:25.710> one<00:03:25.980> actually<00:03:26.280> I<00:03:26.310> probably<00:03:26.460> may

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
not the best one actually I probably may

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.340 
not the best one actually I probably may
have<00:03:26.880> changed<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.450> little<00:03:27.750> bit<00:03:27.960> more<00:03:28.080> time

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
have changed it a little bit more time

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.530 
have changed it a little bit more time
to<00:03:28.560> think<00:03:28.740> about<00:03:29.100> what<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.430> was<00:03:29.520> doing<00:03:29.580> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
to think about what I was doing the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.330 
to think about what I was doing the
perseus<00:03:30.900> video<00:03:31.140> at<00:03:31.380> really<00:03:31.830> really<00:03:31.980> well<00:03:32.160> so

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
perseus video at really really well so

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.070 
perseus video at really really well so
can<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.520> back<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.730> live<00:03:33.030> recordings<00:03:33.540> now<00:03:33.690> I'm

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
can go back to live recordings now I'm

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.930 
can go back to live recordings now I'm
going<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.350> show<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.500> exactly<00:03:34.800> how<00:03:35.190> i<00:03:35.640> got'em

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
going to show you exactly how i got'em

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.330 
going to show you exactly how i got'em
when<00:03:36.270> everything<00:03:36.600> sold<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.220> my

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
when everything sold and that is my

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.650 
when everything sold and that is my
clock<00:03:38.640> going<00:03:38.820> off<00:03:38.940> now<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:39.360> i'll<00:03:39.450> leave<00:03:39.510> that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
clock going off now so i'll leave that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.080 
clock going off now so i'll leave that
one<00:03:39.900> when<00:03:40.560> okay<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:40.920> screwed<00:03:41.550> up<00:03:41.700> probably<00:03:41.940> a

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
one when okay I screwed up probably a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.150 
one when okay I screwed up probably a
couple<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.450> seconds<00:03:42.840> at<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> start<00:03:44.010> there

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
couple of seconds at the start there

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.980 
couple of seconds at the start there
which<00:03:44.250> wasn't<00:03:44.460> too<00:03:44.670> good<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.750> I'm<00:03:45.810> gonna<00:03:45.900> have

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
which wasn't too good so I'm gonna have

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.030 
which wasn't too good so I'm gonna have
a<00:03:46.050> look<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.290> minute<00:03:46.440> see<00:03:46.710> how<00:03:46.770> many<00:03:46.920> we've

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
a look in a minute see how many we've

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.400 
a look in a minute see how many we've
got<00:03:47.250> our<00:03:47.700> comeback<00:03:48.120> when<00:03:48.420> all<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.990> these<00:03:49.260> of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
got our comeback when all of these of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.170 
got our comeback when all of these of
either<00:03:49.560> outbid<00:03:49.980> or<00:03:50.280> they've<00:03:50.520> expired<00:03:50.880> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
either outbid or they've expired and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.730 
either outbid or they've expired and
then<00:03:51.750> we'll<00:03:51.870> work<00:03:52.020> out<00:03:52.170> exactly<00:03:52.320> how<00:03:52.710> much

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
then we'll work out exactly how much

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.830 
then we'll work out exactly how much

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
have got that it's around about 1.5 k if

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.350

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
i had not screwed up at the start so we
