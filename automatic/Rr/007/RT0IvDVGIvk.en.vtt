00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone and welcome to another day 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.629
 to the chronic channel of a mediator today 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.630
 I come with the reaction to the teaser trailer 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.219
 I just left mckinley park 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.630
 so I'm going to look for it and I'm going to 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.630
 react to it 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.890
 good will start green screen hello 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.529
 in all this elevator 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 Y 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.470
 this is favorite 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.770
 but no 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.630
 of very rare sight 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.630
 in 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.690
 I'm listening 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.939
 of civilians 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.939
 to 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.710
 just like we go another 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.500
 because all 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.899
 again I need to see it again 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.090
 they all dance awaits them later 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.900
 at 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.710
 the world 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.670
 and us 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.670
 President 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.210
 Where is 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.910
 or 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.810
 I do not mean any spoiler but I 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.810
 it seems so sad that people who 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.230
 are going to die this trailer and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.310
 he said it 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.720
 well the trailer is very, very, very cool 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.819
 I expected it to be golden in a 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.220
 thing of nothing of 15 seconds because 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.150
 they said teaser and it's not a trailer for 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.700
 one minute 46 seconds and it's like how many 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.349
 months are left for November to see June 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.390
 in July 2 October position I'm not going 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.090
 hungry almost six months because they make us 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.220
 this six months in advance because 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.560
 and now of course they are going to start to get more 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.120
 teasers more trailers more images like 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.129
 those who have left with the president is 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.020
 not totally destroyed with the symbol 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:41.180
 by zinsa otros 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:43.580
 and I'm dying but they're very, very cool and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.290
 I really do not want to see how it's done in 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.120
 reality of a death that is in the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.940
 book and that surely that is 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.890
 surely totally safe appear 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.450
 in the movie I think I'm not 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.760
 talking about the one that everyone is 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.620
 thinking that it's like the last one I'm 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.750
 talking about one that is going to happen more or 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.660
 less about half of the second part 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.520
 of his essay part 2 but well that's not 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.440
