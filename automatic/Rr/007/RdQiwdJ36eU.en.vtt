00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 I like dealing with people and 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.350
 I have here much on that was a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.210
 winter an elderly lady actually 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.730
 a very different question really had 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.130
 a travel connection they came with 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 a small tray where for all coffee 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.109
 it was to the recordings that was total 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.109
 dear 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.090
 so at the beginning so either way not alone 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.590
 turn the code on whether you open 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.759
 but the right decline is going on 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.750
 you are really on your own 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.150
 put and trust 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.449
 we are not like that in situ 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.190
 quite nice is the first one 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.900
 situations it is understandable that they 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.460
 be upset with not being upset 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.589
 what I got then we are 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.540
 the first ones get it and 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.220
 Of course somehow they try again 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.710
 to do well but there are also people 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.960
 if you notice ok I have to do that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.549
 Colleague will answer two key questions 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.409
 They say yes, do not take your time 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.540
 everyone has probably attack something already 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.229
 there you are already relieved that 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.229
 they understand that, too 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.640
 beyond that 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.350
 The reception so if you from 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.570
 thing from a train first come up 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
 a dividend and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.049
 transported further we take the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.540
 wounds to heal register in 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.220
 big lost system found that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.220
 nationwide is visible 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.560
 colleague colleague then, so to speak 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.640
 I do not want to say that I am like that 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.560
 down to earth and so predictable that I can 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 absolutely must know what is in how 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 many years but it is just fine too 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 know in the back of the head that can think 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.520
 nothing happens my workplace is 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.450
 sure so I 'm actually doing so well 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.190
 how everything will be and yes I like to laugh 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.810
 and a lot and also with my friends 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.240
 I always have something to do 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.830
 always have an issue when it comes to traveling 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 sometimes my friend is on the way 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.890
 call or what else is that so 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.890
 always funny no matter what i do
