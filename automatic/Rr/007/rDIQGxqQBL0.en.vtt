00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:01.930
 Yes Yes Yes Yes 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.620
 yes yes yes yes yes yes yes your silences 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.289
 Friday but with analysts 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.729
 he achieved on November 2 

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:13.409
 at two in the afternoon 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.400
 and he used the camera of his telescopes 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.330
 he and his dad with amateur astronomy have a telescope and they 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.400
 I've known them for four years 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.550
 and the engineer Victor gave me the apartment in the neighborhood 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.960
 it seems nothing more impressive lula I do not believe that colloquially I like 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.550
 very much this video 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.630
 and you are going to see a little bit later on, we are a movement like 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.719
 country go through the clouds 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.159
 before the truth that is something very interesting I think it is one of the best 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.809
 videos that are for sale in texas if they generalize gonzález has been highlighted 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.360
 by this almost permanent observation that the sky has 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.060
 make a situation that they commented 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.490
 in associated companies 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.030
 it was as well as this object 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.360
 then types in the health career for the colors efe 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.580
 a face to face metallic studs that sell giant parks do not 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.510
 because throughout the past week 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.580
 but I see my son who is waiting for the word because he also 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060
 we are seeing with the bed of a telescope 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.130
 port st 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 one each artist so that you can see in detail 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.820
 we explain with filter schooling where you can see what an 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.460
 field of magnetism around this is a deeper approach to it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.330
 in the relief 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.450
 Several claims are applied or it is healthy to determine what it is about 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.830
 how could we not explain 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.530
 we classify it as 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.909
 four years ago tepexpan specifically attended the house crime because 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.050
 he did not deliver lives very constantly 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.410
 well these scams the telescope that they use so much to their family since 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.730
 they all have this custom observe the sky 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.730
 skins the engineer víctor gabriel gonzález gonzález 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.490
 on Thursday day 4 5 years delivering many of them even on one occasion 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.520
 serious 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.700
 simultaneously put a flying object there from their houses 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.129
 just now we will see others that presented in 2004 gave me this 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:15.079
 of a spherical object near the power transformers 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.969
 of how it seems that sometimes it's a constant although for a matter of 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.639
 perspective can be so close 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.119
 friends and share 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.330
 is what we like the most 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.590
 thank you very much thank you
