00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
know land on my front foot if I land
front<00:01:50.189> foot<00:01:50.340> first<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> doesn't<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.180> drop

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
front foot first it doesn't just drop

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.450 
front foot first it doesn't just drop
because<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.470> mess<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.860> trick<00:01:53.189> what

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
because that can mess up the trick what

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.020 
because that can mess up the trick what
I<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.960> swing<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.350> leg<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.790> just

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
I do is I swing my leg out and I just

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.300 
I do is I swing my leg out and I just
try<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> land<00:01:57.540> with<00:01:58.200> both<00:01:58.229> feet<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
try to land with both feet on at the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.429 
try to land with both feet on at the
same<00:01:59.490> time<00:01:59.549> whenever<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.450> was<00:02:00.659> learning<00:02:00.869> them<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
same time whenever I was learning them I

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
same time whenever I was learning them I
was<00:02:01.890> told<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.250> focus<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.329> getting<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
was told to focus more on getting the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.550 
was told to focus more on getting the
hand<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.399> seat<00:02:05.670> onto<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> bars<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
hand from the seat onto the bars and I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.910 
hand from the seat onto the bars and I
think

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
think

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.139 
think
it's<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.069> good<00:02:08.220> motion<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.610> kind<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:08.970> down

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it's a good motion to kind of have down

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.780 
it's a good motion to kind of have down
to<00:02:09.360> kind<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.599> just<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.490> just

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
to kind of just like you know you just

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.390 
to kind of just like you know you just
become<00:02:12.209> second<00:02:12.690> nature<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.920> kind<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.190> put

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
become second nature just to kind of put

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.540 
become second nature just to kind of put
your<00:02:14.640> hand<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.630> handlebars<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.590> think<00:02:17.250> I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
your hand on the handlebars I think I

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:28.990 
your hand on the handlebars I think I
bet<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.569> lot<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> people<00:02:19.140> who<00:02:23.300> do<00:02:24.300> them<00:02:27.980> because

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
bet a lot of people who do them because

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.580 
bet a lot of people who do them because
like<00:02:30.000> lambing<00:02:30.420> flat<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.810> general<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.500> of

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
like lambing flat in general kind of

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.100 
like lambing flat in general kind of
sucks<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.340> many<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.209> know<00:02:33.239> it's<00:02:33.780> kind<00:02:34.019> of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
sucks as many of you know it's kind of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.380 
sucks as many of you know it's kind of
hard<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.470> land<00:02:34.620> back<00:02:34.830> tire<00:02:35.220> first<00:02:35.580> on<00:02:36.030> a

caveman

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.990 
caveman
you'll<00:02:37.290> probably<00:02:37.650> land<00:02:38.069> double<00:02:38.459> tire<00:02:38.670> just

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you'll probably land double tire just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.550 
you'll probably land double tire just
about<00:02:39.180> every<00:02:39.450> time<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:40.140> whenever<00:02:40.319> you're

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
about every time but whenever you're

wheelchair Bank it's going to feel a lot

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.270 
wheelchair Bank it's going to feel a lot
better<00:02:47.069> than<00:02:47.310> landing<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:48.660> flat<00:02:49.280> basically

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
better than landing on flat basically

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.580 
better than landing on flat basically
the<00:02:50.430> best<00:02:50.970> way<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.209> do<00:02:51.420> caveman<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.140> might<00:02:52.440> not

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the best way to do caveman you might not

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.630 
the best way to do caveman you might not
have<00:02:52.680> been<00:02:52.739> able<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.220> whenever<00:02:53.489> I<00:02:53.549> was

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
doing on that Bank over there it is best

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
doing on that Bank over there it is best
to<00:02:56.370> land<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.120> your<00:02:57.480> bike<00:02:57.690> before<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.350> hit<00:02:58.470> the

you're just getting started it can help
you<00:03:08.880> learn<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.750> trick<00:03:10.230> whenever<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.280> first

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you learn the trick whenever I first

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.699 
you learn the trick whenever I first
started<00:03:12.060> doing<00:03:12.180> cavemen<00:03:12.750> what<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.079> would<00:03:13.320> do<00:03:13.470> is

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
started doing cavemen what I would do is

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.800 
started doing cavemen what I would do is
I<00:03:13.890> wouldn't<00:03:14.220> swing<00:03:14.609> my<00:03:14.850> back<00:03:15.090> end<00:03:15.359> around<00:03:15.690> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
I wouldn't swing my back end around I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.900 
I wouldn't swing my back end around I
actually<00:03:16.019> learned<00:03:16.530> how<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:17.310> do<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.670> or<00:03:17.850> I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
actually learned how to do that or I

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.610 
actually learned how to do that or I
taught<00:03:18.150> myself<00:03:18.329> how<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:18.989> after

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
taught myself how to do that after

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.830 
taught myself how to do that after
watching<00:03:19.769> some<00:03:20.280> park<00:03:20.579> rat<00:03:20.850> do<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.239> in<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.810> a

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
watching some park rat do it in like a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.750 
watching some park rat do it in like a
wheel<00:03:22.200> mill<00:03:22.470> edit<00:03:22.980> or<00:03:23.100> something<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.579> just

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
wheel mill edit or something I just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.160 
wheel mill edit or something I just
watched<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.299> caveman<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:24.900> this

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
watched you to do a caveman like this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.020 
watched you to do a caveman like this
and<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.920> thought<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.250> would<00:03:26.310> be<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.850> way

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
and I thought it would be you know way

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.770 
and I thought it would be you know way
better<00:03:27.209> than<00:03:27.690> then<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.470> trying<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.920> like

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
better than then just trying to like

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.750 
better than then just trying to like
jump<00:03:30.780> on<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.170> all<00:03:31.290> at<00:03:31.440> once<00:03:31.620> like<00:03:31.739> that<00:03:31.890> where

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
jump on it all at once like that where

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.759 
jump on it all at once like that where
you<00:03:32.910> can<00:03:33.150> like<00:03:33.299> kick<00:03:33.540> your<00:03:33.750> seat<00:03:34.049> or<00:03:34.380> miss

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
you can like kick your seat or miss

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.680 
you can like kick your seat or miss
paddle<00:03:35.340> or<00:03:35.519> whatever<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.090> possibly<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.660> know

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
right above it's like a small little

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.040 
right above it's like a small little
ledge<00:04:15.980> it's<00:04:16.610> into<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:16.940> little<00:04:17.210> bag<00:04:17.390> if<00:04:17.660> I<00:04:17.840> were

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
feet on at the same time I think as you

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.750 
feet on at the same time I think as you
do<00:05:06.050> cavemen<00:05:06.620> more<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.100> more<00:05:07.280> you'll<00:05:07.550> be<00:05:07.640> able

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
do cavemen more and more you'll be able

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.430 
do cavemen more and more you'll be able
to<00:05:07.910> teach<00:05:08.060> yourself<00:05:08.450> to<00:05:08.480> do<00:05:08.660> that<00:05:08.840> as<00:05:08.990> well

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
to teach yourself to do that as well

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.230 
to teach yourself to do that as well
like<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:09.980> said<00:05:10.220> it's<00:05:10.370> not<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.520> trick<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.000> cures

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
like I said it's not a trick that cures

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.720 
like I said it's not a trick that cures
cancer<00:05:11.330> but<00:05:12.290> then<00:05:12.740> again<00:05:12.860> it's<00:05:13.130> not<00:05:13.190> something

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
cancer but then again it's not something
