coral<00:02:12.740> in<00:02:13.040> my<00:02:13.820> camera<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:14.420> noticing<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.290> it

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
coral in my camera I'm noticing that it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.410 
coral in my camera I'm noticing that it
is<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.980> real<00:02:16.580> life<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:19.700> definitely<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> lot

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
is in real life it's definitely a lot

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.140 
is in real life it's definitely a lot
more<00:02:20.480> has<00:02:21.350> more<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.800> like<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.100> rose<00:02:22.490> petal

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
more has more of like that rose petal

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.380 
more has more of like that rose petal
undertone<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.460> but<00:02:25.460> as<00:02:25.610> seriously<00:02:26.210> it's

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
undertone to it but as seriously it's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.670 
undertone to it but as seriously it's
quite<00:02:26.930> quite<00:02:27.200> lovely

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
quite quite lovely

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.310 
quite quite lovely
I<00:02:27.860> really<00:02:28.460> think<00:02:28.610> honestly<00:02:29.090> any<00:02:29.450> skin<00:02:30.110> tone

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
I really think honestly any skin tone

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.770 
I really think honestly any skin tone
could<00:02:30.980> use<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.730> color<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.150> maybe<00:02:32.600> if<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
could use this color in maybe if you

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.430 
could use this color in maybe if you
think<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:34.940> little<00:02:35.060> bit<00:02:35.300> too<00:02:35.660> pink<00:02:36.230> for<00:02:36.260> you

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
think it's a little bit too pink for you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.840 
think it's a little bit too pink for you
