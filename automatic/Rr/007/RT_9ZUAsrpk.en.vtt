00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
with water-based so we're going to be

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
with water-based so we're going to be
using<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.880> common<00:01:09.330> white<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.689> green<00:01:09.869> galaxy

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
using the common white from green galaxy

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.690 
using the common white from green galaxy
the<00:01:10.740> reason<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.040> prefer<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> print<00:01:11.580> with

the reason i prefer to print with
water-based<00:01:12.119> even<00:01:12.360> though<00:01:12.510> there<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.659> fat

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
water-based even though there are fat

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.870 
water-based even though there are fat
like<00:01:13.140> free<00:01:13.470> plastic<00:01:13.710> sauce<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.369> softer

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
like free plastic sauce it's just softer

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.219 
like free plastic sauce it's just softer
it's<00:01:15.000> eco-friendly<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.720> i<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.080> feels

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's eco-friendly and i think it feels

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.370 
it's eco-friendly and i think it feels
way<00:01:16.500> better<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.759> safer<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.380> infant

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
way better so it's much safer for infant

you<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.079> need<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> leave<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> screen<00:01:31.710> flooded

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
you do need to leave the screen flooded

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.870 
you do need to leave the screen flooded
like<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:34.140> it's<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.280> printing

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
like so and it's really not the printing

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
like so and it's really not the printing
that<00:01:36.030> changes<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> documentation<00:01:37.740> so

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that changes it's the documentation so

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
that changes it's the documentation so
we'll<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> quick<00:01:38.460> flash<00:01:38.880> then<00:01:39.810> we'll

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
we'll just do a quick flash then we'll

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.190 
we'll just do a quick flash then we'll
show<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.170> how<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> document<00:01:40.710> it

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:58.300 

so<00:01:46.200> we're<00:01:46.350> ready<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.590> print<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> second<00:01:47.399> one

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.230 

need<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> guy<00:01:59.640> Flay

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
need that guy Flay

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.030 
need that guy Flay
all<00:02:00.660> right<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.870> the<00:02:00.960> print<00:02:01.170> looks<00:02:01.320> great<00:02:01.590> comma

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
all right so the print looks great comma

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
all right so the print looks great comma
white<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.430> nice<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.940> soft<00:02:03.150> once<00:02:03.510> we<00:02:03.630> cure<00:02:03.930> it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
white is nice and soft once we cure it

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.630 
white is nice and soft once we cure it
so<00:02:04.290> let's<00:02:04.680> go<00:02:04.800> ahead<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.190> that<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.580> then

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
so let's go ahead and do that and then

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.000 
so let's go ahead and do that and then
go<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.910> labeling<00:02:09.380> all<00:02:10.380> right<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> print<00:02:10.860> looks

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
go to labeling all right the print looks

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.770 
go to labeling all right the print looks
great<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.430> feels<00:02:11.610> great<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> before<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.600> app

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
great it feels great and before this app

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.360 
great it feels great and before this app
we<00:02:12.960> could<00:02:13.110> actually<00:02:13.260> just<00:02:13.440> go<00:02:13.590> ahead<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.130> sell

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
we could actually just go ahead and sell

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.640 
we could actually just go ahead and sell
this<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.550> a<00:02:14.670> client<00:02:15.000> however<00:02:15.930> after<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> act

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
this to a client however after the act

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.260 
this to a client however after the act
we<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.040> need<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> do<00:02:17.430> some<00:02:17.610> things<00:02:17.820> differently

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
we do need to do some things differently

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.790 
we do need to do some things differently
first<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.810> all<00:02:18.900> obviously<00:02:19.050> we<00:02:19.350> needed<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.650> use

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
first of all obviously we needed to use

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.040 
first of all obviously we needed to use
a<00:02:19.830> compliant<00:02:20.400> ink<00:02:20.520> which<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.120> did<00:02:21.300> ecofriendly

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
a compliant ink which we did ecofriendly

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.690 
a compliant ink which we did ecofriendly
common<00:02:22.530> white<00:02:22.680> no<00:02:23.070> problem

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
common white no problem

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.670 
common white no problem
but<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.240> prove<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.320> way<00:02:25.500> we

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
but we have to prove that the way we

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.950 
but we have to prove that the way we
prove<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.370> insert<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> label<00:02:27.120> into<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
prove that is we insert a label into the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.110 
prove that is we insert a label into the
print<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:28.770> track<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.100> label<00:02:29.610> internally

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
print and we track that label internally

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.420 
print and we track that label internally
that<00:02:30.540> label<00:02:30.900> needs<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> have<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:32.040> ink<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.310> we

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that label needs to have the ink that we

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.010 
that label needs to have the ink that we
printed<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.300> specific<00:02:33.750> alotta

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
printed with and the specific alotta

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.960 
printed with and the specific alotta
number<00:02:34.350> which<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.890> case<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.400> one<00:02:35.700> four

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
number which in this case is one four

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.590 
number which in this case is one four
zero<00:02:36.000> two<00:02:36.650> one<00:02:37.650> two<00:02:37.950> nine<00:02:38.610> seven<00:02:39.030> that's<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.420> lot

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
zero two one two nine seven that's a lot

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.120 
zero two one two nine seven that's a lot
number<00:02:39.930> now<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.140> label<00:02:40.500> doesn't<00:02:40.830> need<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
number now the label doesn't need to

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.010 
number now the label doesn't need to
have<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.580> particularly<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.720> needs<00:02:42.870> to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
have that particularly but it needs to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.080 
have that particularly but it needs to
basically<00:02:43.680> reference<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.550> back<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
basically reference that back in the

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.840 
basically reference that back in the
back<00:02:45.240> end<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.410> could<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.730> can

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
back end so what you could do is you can

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.180 
back end so what you could do is you can
print<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> label<00:02:48.570> or<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.290> use<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.830> heat

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
print the label or you can use a heat

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.250 
print the label or you can use a heat
transfer<00:02:50.430> or<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.570> can<00:02:51.720> use<00:02:51.840> something<00:02:52.080> as

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
transfer or you can use something as

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.990 
transfer or you can use something as
simple<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.710> pee<00:02:53.040> touch<00:02:53.310> which<00:02:53.970> is

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
simple as a pee touch which is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
simple as a pee touch which is
essentially<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.720> garment<00:02:55.350> transfer<00:02:55.800> label

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
essentially a garment transfer label

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.100 
essentially a garment transfer label
that<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.460> can<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.910> turn<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.360> guy<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.600> and

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that I can just turn this guy on and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.930 
that I can just turn this guy on and
then<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.770> can<00:02:58.920> put<00:02:59.070> any<00:02:59.250> type<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.610> code<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.880> can

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
then I can put any type of code it can

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.150 
then I can put any type of code it can
be<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> date<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:01.020> be<00:03:01.170> your<00:03:01.470> phone<00:03:01.800> number

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
be the date it can be your phone number

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.770 
be the date it can be your phone number
it<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.520> anything<00:03:02.850> but<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.570> have<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it can be anything but you have to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.020 
it can be anything but you have to
reference<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.260> specific<00:03:04.830> code<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.580> job

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
reference that specific code to that job

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.729 
reference that specific code to that job
through<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.750> ink<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.200> use<00:03:07.410> for<00:03:07.650> that

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
through the ink that you use for that

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.360 
through the ink that you use for that
job

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
job

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.040 
job
very<00:03:08.910> simple<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.300> do<00:03:09.390> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.630> either<00:03:09.660> do<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
very simple to do you can either do that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.449 
very simple to do you can either do that
in<00:03:10.110> your<00:03:10.170> software<00:03:10.590> your<00:03:10.830> QuickBooks<00:03:11.250> put

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
in your software your QuickBooks put

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.920 
in your software your QuickBooks put
that<00:03:11.580> right<00:03:11.820> on<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:12.090> invoice<00:03:12.390> or<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.810> can

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
that right on the invoice or you can

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.390 
that right on the invoice or you can
start<00:03:13.110> something<00:03:13.320> separately<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> Google

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
start something separately like a Google

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.729 
start something separately like a Google
Drive<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:15.270> once<00:03:15.450> again<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.110> label<00:03:16.470> needs<00:03:16.590> to

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
Drive so once again the label needs to

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.729 
Drive so once again the label needs to
