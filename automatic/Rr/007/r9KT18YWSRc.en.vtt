00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.270 
go through there cuz it's gonna take me
a<00:02:29.180> lot<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.420> time<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.810> make<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.560> like<00:02:30.830> shine

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
a lot of time to make it like shine

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.760 
a lot of time to make it like shine
because<00:02:32.000> if<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.390> scrub<00:02:32.840> up<00:02:32.870> right<00:02:33.230> here<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
because if you scrub up right here you

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.800 
because if you scrub up right here you
have<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:34.040> scrub<00:02:34.280> all<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.670> way<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.060> you're

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
take a little more time it's got to be

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.140 
take a little more time it's got to be
nice<00:02:44.150> well<00:02:45.080> done

okay what else what else need to cover
here<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:50.600> was<00:02:50.810> pretty<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.320> stay<00:02:51.470> forward

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
here this was pretty to stay forward

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.400 
here this was pretty to stay forward
that's<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:54.760> looks<00:02:55.760> really<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.630> naked

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's it looks really like a naked

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.610 
that's it looks really like a naked
engine<00:02:58.840> let's<00:02:59.840> focus<00:03:00.050> here

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
engine let's focus here

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.490 
engine let's focus here
oh<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.340> close<00:03:02.709> there<00:03:03.709> you<00:03:03.890> go<00:03:04.420> this<00:03:05.420> bar<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
oh so close there you go this bar a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.580 
oh so close there you go this bar a
little<00:03:07.160> concern<00:03:07.640> about<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:08.530> thing<00:03:09.530> you

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
little concern about this thing you

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.800 
little concern about this thing you
shouldn't<00:03:09.860> be<00:03:09.950> like<00:03:10.130> this<00:03:10.310> black<00:03:10.580> very<00:03:11.540> school

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
shouldn't be like this black very school

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.530 
shouldn't be like this black very school
I<00:03:12.050> take<00:03:12.350> that<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:13.700> engine<00:03:13.940> is<00:03:14.120> feeling<00:03:14.390> good

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
I take that that engine is feeling good

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.840 
I take that that engine is feeling good
is<00:03:14.840> strong<00:03:15.170> like<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.830> champ<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:17.900> said

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
is strong like a champ like you said

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.900 
is strong like a champ like you said
3.30<00:03:19.850> no<00:03:20.209> no<00:03:21.370> 3.0<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:23.769> okay<00:03:24.769> alright<00:03:25.760> guys

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
3.30 no no 3.0 I okay alright guys

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.979 
3.30 no no 3.0 I okay alright guys
hopefully<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.480> helps<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:28.600> it's<00:03:29.600> very<00:03:29.900> easy

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
hopefully that helps and it's very easy

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.400 
hopefully that helps and it's very easy
to<00:03:30.170> do<00:03:30.440> doesn't<00:03:31.340> take<00:03:31.430> all<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.730> time<00:03:32.410> probably

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
to do doesn't take all the time probably

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.670 
to do doesn't take all the time probably
two<00:03:33.739> hours<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:34.220> most<00:03:34.900> because<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.110> mean<00:03:36.470> I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
two hours the most because I mean I

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.220 
two hours the most because I mean I
didn't<00:03:37.220> have<00:03:37.400> I<00:03:37.670> didn't<00:03:38.090> have<00:03:38.209> a<00:03:38.239> hard<00:03:39.080> time

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
didn't have I didn't have a hard time

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.380 
didn't have I didn't have a hard time
taking<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.650> off<00:03:39.890> because<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:41.000> was<00:03:41.209> like

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
taking this off because it was like

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.140 
taking this off because it was like
recently<00:03:42.079> replaced<00:03:42.640> rational<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.760> replace

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
recently replaced rational it replace

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.420 
recently replaced rational it replace
like<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.600> said<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:45.500> sometimes<00:03:46.100> when<00:03:46.280> you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
like I said and sometimes when you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.190 
like I said and sometimes when you
replacing<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.269> is<00:03:47.450> that<00:03:47.720> really<00:03:48.049> really

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
replacing this is that really really

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.490 
replacing this is that really really
hard<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.620> come<00:03:48.799> out<00:03:48.829> from<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.790> little<00:03:50.500> edges

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
hard to come out from the little edges

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.340 
hard to come out from the little edges
here<00:03:51.890> because<00:03:52.160> they're<00:03:52.310> so<00:03:52.579> crisp<00:03:53.140> then<00:03:54.140> let's

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
here because they're so crisp then let's

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.170 
here because they're so crisp then let's
take<00:03:54.590> these<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.670> trying<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.940> pull

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
take these so that you trying to pull

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.340 
take these so that you trying to pull
out<00:03:56.239> they're<00:03:56.450> gonna<00:03:56.570> break<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.079> break<00:03:57.290> and

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
out they're gonna break and break and

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.830 
out they're gonna break and break and
break<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.709> on<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.100> on<00:03:58.160> and<00:03:58.340> on<00:03:58.420> but<00:03:59.420> not<00:03:59.690> in

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
break and on and on and on but not in

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.759 
break and on and on and on but not in
this<00:03:59.959> case<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:01.360> got<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.600> got<00:04:03.590> lucky<00:04:04.280> maybe<00:04:04.820> we'll
