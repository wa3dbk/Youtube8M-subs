excited<00:00:36.059> he<00:00:36.300> did<00:00:36.510> encounter<00:00:36.930> quite<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> few

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
excited he did encounter quite a few

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.750 
excited he did encounter quite a few
problems<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.430> want<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> highlight

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
problems and the one I want to highlight

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
problems and the one I want to highlight
is<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:39.980> step<00:00:41.090> five<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.390> six<00:00:42.809> when

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
is I think it's step five or six when

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.010 
is I think it's step five or six when
you<00:00:43.320> start<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> download<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.430> game<00:00:45.020> because

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you start to download the game because

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.119 
you start to download the game because
it's<00:00:46.170> all<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.410> Russian<00:00:46.739> because<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> haven't

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it's all in Russian because you haven't

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.520 
it's all in Russian because you haven't
changed<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.520> texture<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> top<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.289> it's
