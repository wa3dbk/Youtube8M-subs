threats among them you're running like

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.660 
threats among them you're running like
three<00:01:56.930> Elspeth<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.530> believe<00:01:57.860> you've<00:01:58.340> got<00:01:58.370> the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
three Elspeth I believe you've got the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.840 
three Elspeth I believe you've got the
full<00:01:58.940> four<00:01:59.510> bloodiest<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.530> barons<00:02:01.010> to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
full four bloodiest of barons to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.160 
full four bloodiest of barons to
supplement<00:02:02.210> your<00:02:02.240> creature<00:02:02.600> based<00:02:02.780> strategy

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
supplement your creature based strategy

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.230 
supplement your creature based strategy
and<00:02:03.350> that<00:02:03.620> enables<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.370> really<00:02:04.910> get<00:02:05.150> to

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
and that enables you to really get to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.460 
and that enables you to really get to
the<00:02:05.330> board<00:02:05.510> pretty<00:02:05.750> aggressively<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.230> thing

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
the board pretty aggressively I thing

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.620 
the board pretty aggressively I thing
yeah<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.400> basically<00:02:07.550> i<00:02:08.030> think<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.360> deck<00:02:08.600> is

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
yeah so basically i think this deck is

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.359 
yeah so basically i think this deck is
extremely<00:02:09.440> well-positioned<00:02:09.710> Game<00:02:10.160> one

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
extremely well-positioned Game one

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.860 
extremely well-positioned Game one
against<00:02:10.610> every<00:02:10.970> deck<00:02:11.150> that's<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.570> a

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
against every deck that's not a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.650 
against every deck that's not a
revelation<00:02:12.380> duck<00:02:12.790> because<00:02:13.790> Elspeth<00:02:14.420> and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
revelation duck because Elspeth and

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.850 
revelation duck because Elspeth and
blood<00:02:14.810> baron<00:02:14.990> are<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.350> good<00:02:15.590> against<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
blood baron are so good against the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.410 
blood baron are so good against the
entire<00:02:16.130> format<00:02:16.580> pretty<00:02:16.760> much<00:02:16.940> outside<00:02:17.240> of

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
entire format pretty much outside of

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.170 
entire format pretty much outside of
those<00:02:17.540> stacks<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:19.250> basically<00:02:19.700> built<00:02:20.060> my

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
those stacks and I basically built my

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660 
those stacks and I basically built my
main<00:02:20.390> decks<00:02:20.660> you<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:21.100> like<00:02:22.100> try<00:02:22.370> to<00:02:22.400> never

main decks you just like try to never

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.670 
main decks you just like try to never
lose<00:02:22.940> game<00:02:23.210> once<00:02:23.390> against<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> decks<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.590> any

ever getting to that point and the way I

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.900 
ever getting to that point and the way I
do<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.260> is<00:05:51.320> I<00:05:51.590> use<00:05:51.920> like<00:05:52.310> sim<00:05:52.520> collector<00:05:52.820> and

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
do that is I use like sim collector and

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.880 
do that is I use like sim collector and

every single time I thought scenes were

every single time I thought scenes were
single<00:05:59.030> after<00:05:59.240> them<00:05:59.390> because<00:06:00.380> I<00:06:00.440> don't<00:06:00.620> care

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680

about<00:06:00.920> their<00:06:01.130> counter<00:06:01.430> spells<00:06:01.670> I'm<00:06:02.510> going<00:06:02.630> to

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
about their counter spells I'm going to

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.800 
about their counter spells I'm going to
run<00:06:02.840> them<00:06:02.990> out<00:06:03.080> eventually<00:06:03.380> or<00:06:04.630> force<00:06:05.630> them<00:06:05.660> to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
run them out eventually or force them to

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.880 
run them out eventually or force them to
counter<00:06:06.140> stuff<00:06:06.260> they<00:06:06.380> don't<00:06:06.440> really<00:06:06.590> want<00:06:06.830> to

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
counter stuff they don't really want to

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.250 
counter stuff they don't really want to
counter<00:06:07.100> like<00:06:07.220> a<00:06:07.250> night<00:06:07.430> Vale<00:06:07.580> Specter<00:06:07.940> and<00:06:08.260> so

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
counter like a night Vale Specter and so

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.360 
counter like a night Vale Specter and so
I'm<00:06:09.350> not<00:06:09.500> I'm<00:06:09.590> not<00:06:09.620> too<00:06:09.830> worried<00:06:10.010> about<00:06:10.070> that<00:06:10.190> I

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
I'm not I'm not too worried about that I

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.980 
I'm not I'm not too worried about that I
just<00:06:10.700> don't<00:06:10.970> want<00:06:11.180> them<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.390> draw<00:06:11.570> extra<00:06:11.870> cards

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
just don't want them to draw extra cards

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.380 
just don't want them to draw extra cards
and<00:06:12.560> I'm<00:06:13.100> fine<00:06:13.310> like<00:06:13.490> one<00:06:13.730> for<00:06:13.880> wanting<00:06:14.210> them

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:14.390 
and I'm fine like one for wanting them

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.140 
and I'm fine like one for wanting them
to<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:15.410> because<00:06:15.710> I<00:06:15.800> just<00:06:15.860> have<00:06:16.100> such<00:06:16.760> a<00:06:16.790> higher

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
to the because I just have such a higher

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.000 
to the because I just have such a higher
threat<00:06:17.510> density<00:06:17.900> than<00:06:17.990> they<00:06:18.110> do<00:06:18.170> that<00:06:18.770> makes<00:06:18.920> a

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.010 
threat density than they do that makes a

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.680 
threat density than they do that makes a
lot<00:06:19.040> of<00:06:19.160> sense<00:06:19.250> one<00:06:20.150> of<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.270> things<00:06:20.330> I<00:06:20.510> find

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
lot of sense one of the things I find

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.790 
lot of sense one of the things I find
pretty<00:06:20.870> interesting<00:06:20.960> about<00:06:21.290> this<00:06:21.410> plan<00:06:21.590> is

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
pretty interesting about this plan is

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.500 
pretty interesting about this plan is
that<00:06:22.190> we've<00:06:22.520> seen<00:06:22.730> players<00:06:22.970> actually<00:06:23.120> playing

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:23.510 
that we've seen players actually playing

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.880 
that we've seen players actually playing
like<00:06:23.660> kind<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.840> an<00:06:23.960> esper<00:06:24.260> e<00:06:24.290> deck<00:06:24.530> with<00:06:24.710> pack

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
like kind of an esper e deck with pack

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.820 
like kind of an esper e deck with pack
rats<00:06:25.130> in<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.310> main

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
rats in the main

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.020 
rats in the main
and<00:06:25.950> in<00:06:26.100> that<00:06:26.190> matchup<00:06:26.400> it's<00:06:26.730> still<00:06:26.910> not

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
and in that matchup it's still not

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.790 
and in that matchup it's still not
really<00:06:27.210> that<00:06:27.390> good<00:06:27.720> that's<00:06:28.380> my<00:06:28.530> mattress

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
really that good that's my mattress

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.020 
really that good that's my mattress
specifically<00:06:29.160> because<00:06:29.280> you<00:06:29.640> know<00:06:29.730> they<00:06:29.850> still

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
specifically because you know they still

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.460 
specifically because you know they still
have<00:06:30.210> lots<00:06:30.330> of<00:06:30.450> ways<00:06:30.600> to<00:06:30.630> deal<00:06:30.810> with<00:06:30.930> macro<00:06:31.170> 30s

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
have lots of ways to deal with macro 30s

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.200 
have lots of ways to deal with macro 30s
to<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:31.740> but<00:06:32.100> in<00:06:32.190> post<00:06:32.430> board<00:06:32.670> games<00:06:32.880> they're

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
to it but in post board games they're

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.310 
to it but in post board games they're
actually<00:06:33.450> taking<00:06:33.600> out<00:06:33.900> a<00:06:33.930> lot<00:06:34.170> of<00:06:34.260> those

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
actually taking out a lot of those

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.630 
actually taking out a lot of those
solutions<00:06:34.560> when<00:06:34.860> they<00:06:34.920> see<00:06:34.980> your<00:06:35.160> deck<00:06:35.370> like

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
solutions when they see your deck like

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.830 
solutions when they see your deck like
it's<00:06:36.090> going<00:06:36.210> to<00:06:36.270> be<00:06:36.330> difficult<00:06:36.510> for<00:06:36.660> them<00:06:36.780> to

it's going to be difficult for them to

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.850 
it's going to be difficult for them to
convince<00:06:37.170> themselves<00:06:37.320> I<00:06:37.560> should<00:06:37.680> be<00:06:37.740> keeping
