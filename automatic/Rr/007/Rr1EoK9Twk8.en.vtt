00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790 

these<00:00:00.120> dodges<00:00:00.659> some<00:00:00.960> of<00:00:01.079> them<00:00:01.199> have<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.439> ball

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
these dodges some of them have a ball

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.460 
these dodges some of them have a ball
mount<00:00:02.010> hitch<00:00:02.370> and<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:02.909> of<00:00:03.060> them<00:00:03.179> do<00:00:03.480> not<00:00:03.510> but

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
mount hitch and some of them do not but

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.840 
mount hitch and some of them do not but
you<00:00:04.589> have<00:00:04.710> to<00:00:04.859> get<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.250> off<00:00:05.460> regardless

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
you have to get that off regardless

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.639 
you have to get that off regardless
because<00:00:06.420> it's<00:00:06.629> in<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.810> way<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.170> bumper<00:00:07.410> in

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
because it's in the way of the bumper in

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.650 
because it's in the way of the bumper in
this<00:00:07.830> case<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.340> just<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.639> plate<00:00:08.940> not<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.420> ball

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
this case it's just a plate not a ball

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.049 
this case it's just a plate not a ball
hitch<00:00:10.010> but<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.190> ball<00:00:11.370> hitch<00:00:11.610> ones<00:00:11.849> will<00:00:12.030> be

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
hitch but the ball hitch ones will be

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.520 
hitch but the ball hitch ones will be
similar<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.900> you<00:00:12.990> need<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.380> make

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
similar to that and you need to make

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.680 
similar to that and you need to make
this<00:00:13.799> where<00:00:14.280> it's<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.820> tube<00:00:15.059> nice<00:00:15.420> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
this where it's just the tube nice and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.590 
this where it's just the tube nice and
smooth<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.760> bumper<00:00:18.270> can

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
smooth like that so that the bumper can

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.090 
smooth like that so that the bumper can
accept<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> winch<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.710> point<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.070> time

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
accept the winch at some point in time

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.920 
accept the winch at some point in time
because<00:00:20.550> all<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.760> our<00:00:21.000> rear<00:00:21.270> bumpers<00:00:21.689> can

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
because all of our rear bumpers can

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.689 
because all of our rear bumpers can
accept<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.410> winch<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.430> got<00:00:23.519> that

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
accept the winch so if you got that

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.519 
accept the winch so if you got that
plate<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.420> or<00:00:24.600> anything<00:00:24.779> else<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.289> there

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
plate on there or anything else on there

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.470 
plate on there or anything else on there
you<00:00:25.920> got<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.580> cutting<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.300> or

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
you got to get it up cutting it or

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.330 
you got to get it up cutting it or
grinding<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> however<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> get<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
grinding it however you got to get it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.120 
grinding it however you got to get it
off<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.990> leave<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> frame<00:00:31.380> mounts<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.980> like

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
off and leave the frame mounts just like

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.790 
off and leave the frame mounts just like
that<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.050> then<00:00:34.050> you'll<00:00:34.260> be<00:00:34.380> able<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> mount

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that and then you'll be able to mount

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.360 
that and then you'll be able to mount
our<00:00:35.719> brackets<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.739> next<00:00:37.980> view<00:00:38.250> i'll

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
our brackets to it the next view i'll

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.400 
our brackets to it the next view i'll
show<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.910> our<00:00:39.030> brackets<00:00:39.510> mounted<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.930 

when<00:00:43.410> installing<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> rear<00:00:44.250> brackets<00:00:44.789> you'll

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
when installing the rear brackets you'll

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.850 
when installing the rear brackets you'll
notice<00:00:45.329> there's<00:00:45.660> bolts<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.320> side<00:00:46.620> that

and there you go the bolts off there's
another<00:01:13.320> nut<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.860> right<00:01:14.010> now<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.340> missed

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
another nut on there right now I missed

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.890 
another nut on there right now I missed
it<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:17.759> rear<00:01:17.909> sensor<00:01:18.390> holes<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it on the rear sensor holes and the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.200 
it on the rear sensor holes and the
bumpers<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:19.590> Dodge<00:01:19.770> has<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.400> use<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
bumpers if your Dodge has that use the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.210 
bumpers if your Dodge has that use the
grommet<00:01:21.750> there's<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.470> sensor<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.180> there

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
grommet there's a sensor which is there

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.859 
grommet there's a sensor which is there
but<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.250> grommet<00:01:26.759> comes<00:01:27.030> apart<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
but the grommet comes apart which is

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.499 
but the grommet comes apart which is
here<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> install<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:30.329> goes

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
here and when you install that just goes

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.730 
here and when you install that just goes
in<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> hole<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.170> may<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.710> some

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
in the hole you may have to do some

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100 
in the hole you may have to do some
filing<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> thickness<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
filing on it because of the thickness of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
filing on it because of the thickness of
the<00:01:34.200> metal<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:36.060> stock

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the metal in that but because your stock

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.140 
the metal in that but because your stock
bumper<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.930> flat<00:01:37.350> you'll<00:01:38.159> need<00:01:38.340> an<00:01:38.520> angle<00:01:39.030> on

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
bumper was flat you'll need an angle on

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.530 
bumper was flat you'll need an angle on
this<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> little<00:01:40.020> bit<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.540> you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this one a little bit like so and you

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
this one a little bit like so and you
can<00:01:42.780> caulk<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.079> glue<00:01:43.470> around<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.100> bit

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
can caulk or glue around a little bit
