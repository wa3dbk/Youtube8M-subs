when I was cleaning out my closet

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.479 
when I was cleaning out my closet

and I realized I had this really pretty
clutch<00:00:21.790> that<00:00:22.090> I've<00:00:22.180> only<00:00:22.689> used<00:00:22.960> like<00:00:23.079> once<00:00:23.470> and

really like jewelry findings the little
the<00:02:05.799> o-rings<00:02:06.369> in<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.789> hook<00:02:07.830> but<00:02:08.830> you<00:02:08.950> know<00:02:09.069> I

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
the o-rings in the hook but you know I

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.499 
the o-rings in the hook but you know I
don't<00:02:09.700> know<00:02:09.759> how<00:02:09.849> long<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.239> going<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.390> hold

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
don't know how long it's going to hold

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.580 
don't know how long it's going to hold
up<00:02:10.690> before<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.989> don't<00:02:11.080> know<00:02:11.230> if<00:02:11.319> it's<00:02:11.440> going<00:02:11.530> to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
up before I don't know if it's going to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.410 
up before I don't know if it's going to
be<00:02:11.739> really<00:02:11.890> strong<00:02:12.040> enough<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:12.910> I'm<00:02:13.180> willing

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
be really strong enough but I'm willing

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.970 
be really strong enough but I'm willing
to<00:02:13.450> try<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.780> because<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.920> those

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to try it because it's just one of those

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.620 
to try it because it's just one of those
makeshift<00:02:15.489> things<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.940> like<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.239> know<00:02:16.360> oh<00:02:16.600> I

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
makeshift things that like you know oh I

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.320 
makeshift things that like you know oh I
have<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.019> in<00:02:17.260> my<00:02:17.400> my<00:02:18.400> box<00:02:18.640> this<00:02:18.850> will<00:02:19.090> work

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
have this in my my box this will work

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.100 
have this in my my box this will work
you<00:02:19.630> know<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.319> not<00:02:20.500> perfection<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:22.110> don't

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
you know it's not perfection so don't

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.220 
you know it's not perfection so don't
judge<00:02:23.319> me<00:02:24.209> we'll<00:02:25.209> see<00:02:25.450> if<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.660> works<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.140> I'll

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
judge me we'll see if it works and I'll

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.370 
judge me we'll see if it works and I'll
let<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.680> how<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.340> all<00:02:27.459> pans<00:02:27.640> out<00:02:27.910> but

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
let you know how it all pans out but

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.300 
let you know how it all pans out but
that's<00:02:29.380> why<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> said<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:29.799> was<00:02:29.980> just<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.280> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
that's why I said this was just like a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.309 
that's why I said this was just like a
quick<00:02:30.610> little<00:02:30.910> do-it-yourself<00:02:31.090> thing<00:02:31.540> so

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
quick little do-it-yourself thing so

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.699 
quick little do-it-yourself thing so
that's<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.940> like<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.959> there<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.140> go<00:02:35.380> so

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
that's on like that and there you go so

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.690 
that's on like that and there you go so
now<00:02:35.739> we're<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.010> going<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> same

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
now we're just going to do the same

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:46.069 
now we're just going to do the same
thing<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.480> other<00:02:37.510> end

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.530 

okay<00:02:47.079> so<00:02:47.140> then<00:02:47.379> we<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:47.650> take<00:02:47.860> your<00:02:48.540> clutch

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
okay so then we just take your clutch

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.670 
okay so then we just take your clutch
and<00:02:50.319> hook<00:02:51.040> on<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:52.060> little<00:02:52.299> rims<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.560> know

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and hook on the little rims and you know

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.470 
and hook on the little rims and you know
these<00:02:53.829> rings<00:02:54.099> were<00:02:54.340> really<00:02:54.610> thin<00:02:54.939> so<00:02:55.299> that's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
these rings were really thin so that's

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.420 
these rings were really thin so that's
how<00:02:55.720> I<00:02:55.750> kind<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.230> tested<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:56.769> out<00:02:56.950> first<00:02:57.220> if

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
how I kind of tested this out first if

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.130 
how I kind of tested this out first if
they<00:02:57.849> were<00:02:57.909> thicker<00:02:58.269> than<00:02:58.599> I<00:02:58.629> would<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:58.900> just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
they were thicker than I would have just

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.890 
they were thicker than I would have just
bought<00:02:59.290> bigger<00:02:59.700> ones<00:03:00.700> either<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.720> or<00:03:01.750> I

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
bought bigger ones either that or I

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.630 
bought bigger ones either that or I
would<00:03:02.049> have<00:03:02.140> just<00:03:02.260> hooked<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.859> right<00:03:03.280> onto

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
would have just hooked this right onto

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.059 
would have just hooked this right onto
this<00:03:03.819> because<00:03:04.810> there<00:03:04.959> are<00:03:05.109> little<00:03:05.379> seams<00:03:05.799> that

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
this because there are little seams that

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.160 
this because there are little seams that
you<00:03:06.159> can<00:03:06.310> open<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.819> at<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:08.760> know<00:03:09.760> this<00:03:10.750> isn't

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
you can open that at I know this isn't

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.949 
you can open that at I know this isn't
rocket<00:03:12.040> science<00:03:12.640> or<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.849> great<00:03:13.269> idea<00:03:13.659> or<00:03:13.780> a<00:03:13.810> new

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
rocket science or a great idea or a new

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.020 
rocket science or a great idea or a new
idea<00:03:14.349> or<00:03:14.470> anything<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:14.859> that<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.400> really

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
idea or anything like that but really

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.240 
idea or anything like that but really
just<00:03:16.209> did<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.629> show<00:03:16.840> guys<00:03:17.379> that<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:18.099> can

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
just did it to show guys that you can

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.740 
just did it to show guys that you can
take<00:03:18.459> things<00:03:18.670> from<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.180> closet<00:03:19.569> that<00:03:19.659> you

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
take things from the closet that you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.539 
take things from the closet that you
think<00:03:19.959> might<00:03:20.200> be<00:03:20.230> broken<00:03:20.709> or<00:03:20.859> done<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.430> you

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
think might be broken or done and you

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.180 
think might be broken or done and you
can<00:03:21.730> think<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.180> new<00:03:22.389> ideas<00:03:22.420> for<00:03:23.079> them<00:03:23.260> see<00:03:24.069> that

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
can think of new ideas for them see that

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.300 
can think of new ideas for them see that
works<00:03:24.340> perfectly<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.739> can<00:03:26.889> still<00:03:27.069> use<00:03:27.190> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
works perfectly and I can still use it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.780 
works perfectly and I can still use it
as<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> clutch<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.150> take<00:03:28.629> these<00:03:28.840> off<00:03:28.989> so

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
