00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.860 

the<00:00:12.690> story<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.320> far<00:00:13.890> when<00:00:14.730> mattered<00:00:15.180> in<00:00:15.360> any<00:00:15.720> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the story so far when mattered in any of

the story so far when mattered in any of
its<00:00:16.020> three<00:00:16.230> states<00:00:16.560> gets<00:00:17.130> hot<00:00:17.369> its<00:00:18.090> molecules

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
its three states gets hot its molecules

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.679 
its three states gets hot its molecules
go<00:00:18.930> faster<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.650> take<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.160> more<00:00:20.400> space<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:21.060> the

gets<00:00:25.830> cold<00:00:26.160> its<00:00:26.910> molecules<00:00:27.540> go<00:00:27.810> slower<00:00:28.110> and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
gets cold its molecules go slower and

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.340 
gets cold its molecules go slower and
take<00:00:28.920> up<00:00:29.070> less<00:00:29.310> space<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.630> solid<00:00:31.050> liquid

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.350 
take up less space and the solid liquid

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
take up less space and the solid liquid
or<00:00:31.650> gas<00:00:32.059> contracts<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.890> now<00:00:35.239> measuring

temperature<00:00:39.140> can<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.260> tell<00:00:40.470> whether

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
temperature can you tell whether

something is hot or cold

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.290 
something is hot or cold
hey<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.530> case<00:00:44.070> decide<00:00:44.670> which<00:00:44.970> of<00:00:45.000> these

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
hey in that case decide which of these

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.680 
hey in that case decide which of these
three<00:00:45.360> bathtubs<00:00:46.320> you'd<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.040> to<00:00:47.220> step<00:00:47.430> into

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
three bathtubs you'd like to step into

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
three bathtubs you'd like to step into
this<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.910> which<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:50.940> freezing<00:00:51.630> cold<00:00:52.340> or<00:00:53.340> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this one which is freezing cold or this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.430 
this one which is freezing cold or this
one<00:00:54.710> which<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.860> boiling<00:00:56.370> hot<00:00:56.520> or<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:58.230> one

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
one which is boiling hot or this one

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.090 
one which is boiling hot or this one
which<00:00:59.040> is<00:00:59.190> neither<00:00:59.370> too<00:00:59.670> hot<00:00:59.879> nor<00:00:59.910> too<00:01:00.570> cold

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
which is neither too hot nor too cold

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.609 
which is neither too hot nor too cold
it's<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.280> easy<00:01:02.430> choice<00:01:02.670> isn't<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.440> well<00:01:04.440> go<00:01:04.559> on

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it's an easy choice isn't it well go on

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.240 
it's an easy choice isn't it well go on
step<00:01:05.550> into<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.910> middle<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.979> feels<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.160> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
step into the middle one feels just a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730 
step into the middle one feels just a
bit<00:01:08.399> too<00:01:08.580> hot<00:01:08.789> doesn't<00:01:09.149> it<00:01:09.440> try<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.500> other

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
bit too hot doesn't it try the other

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420 
bit too hot doesn't it try the other
foot<00:01:10.800> oh<00:01:12.110> now<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.289> feels<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.649> bit<00:01:13.680> too<00:01:13.950> cold

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
foot oh now it feels a bit too cold

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
foot oh now it feels a bit too cold
well<00:01:15.210> perhaps<00:01:15.420> judging<00:01:15.990> whether<00:01:16.140> something

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
well perhaps judging whether something

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.300 
well perhaps judging whether something
is<00:01:16.649> not<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.100> cold<00:01:17.429> isn't<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.880> easy<00:01:18.090> after<00:01:18.360> all

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
is not or cold isn't so easy after all

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
is not or cold isn't so easy after all
this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> because<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.880> human<00:01:21.179> body<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.690> only

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
this is because the human body can only

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.359 
this is because the human body can only
notice<00:01:22.289> differences<00:01:22.709> in<00:01:22.860> hotness<00:01:23.220> or

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
notice differences in hotness or

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.150 
notice differences in hotness or
coldness<00:01:23.450> how<00:01:24.450> hot<00:01:24.750> or<00:01:24.990> cold<00:01:25.050> something<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.920> in

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
coldness how hot or cold something is in

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.570 
coldness how hot or cold something is in
comparison<00:01:26.580> with<00:01:27.179> something<00:01:27.539> else<00:01:28.190> but<00:01:29.190> even

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
comparison with something else but even

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.669 
comparison with something else but even
your<00:01:29.700> own<00:01:29.880> feet<00:01:30.179> can't<00:01:30.690> agree<00:01:30.959> about<00:01:31.110> how<00:01:31.410> hot

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
your own feet can't agree about how hot

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.650 
your own feet can't agree about how hot
or<00:01:31.860> cold<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.459> water<00:01:32.670> in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> middle<00:01:33.119> bathtub

or cold the water in the middle bathtub

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.919 
or cold the water in the middle bathtub
is<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:35.490> must<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.910> better<00:01:36.149> way<00:01:36.300> to<00:01:36.539> measure

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
is there must be a better way to measure

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.199 
is there must be a better way to measure
degree<00:01:37.289> of<00:01:37.679> hotness<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:38.250> temperature<00:01:38.940> as<00:01:39.090> we

degree of hotness or temperature as we

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:44.410 
degree of hotness or temperature as we
usually<00:01:39.569> say<00:01:42.830> what<00:01:43.830> do<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.099> know<00:01:44.310> about
