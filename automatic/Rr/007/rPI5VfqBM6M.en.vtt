and I figured it'd be a good time to

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.209 
and I figured it'd be a good time to
start<00:00:08.960> doing<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.200> tutorial<00:00:10.380> probably<00:00:11.130> not

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
start doing a tutorial probably not

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.430 
start doing a tutorial probably not
gonna<00:00:11.340> make<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.690> habit<00:00:12.690> out<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:12.990> doing<00:00:13.290> these

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
gonna make a habit out of doing these

generated and add in new biomes like

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.819 
generated and add in new biomes like
some<00:00:37.980> hardened<00:00:38.460> clay<00:00:38.640> mountains<00:00:39.239> some<00:00:39.829> taiga

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
some hardened clay mountains some taiga

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.270 
some hardened clay mountains some taiga
mountains<00:00:41.550> not<00:00:42.450> taiga<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.200> tiger<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
mountains not taiga like tiger like the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
mountains not taiga like tiger like the
animal<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.059> like<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> snowy<00:00:46.980> place<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.079> some

deserts some realistic temperature

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
deserts some realistic temperature
shifts<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> won't<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:53.940> like<00:00:54.180> desert

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
shifts so you won't get like desert

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.200

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
program meant to render Minecraft world

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.039 
program meant to render Minecraft world
into<00:02:46.829> like<00:02:47.069> 3d<00:02:47.459> renders<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.120> with<00:02:48.720> shaders

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.629 
and shadows and stuff and make them look
fantastic<00:02:51.319> but<00:02:52.319> it's<00:02:52.680> actually<00:02:53.220> very<00:02:53.519> useful

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
fantastic but it's actually very useful

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.860 
fantastic but it's actually very useful
for<00:02:54.150> deleting<00:02:54.510> chunks<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.189> I<00:02:56.629> just<00:02:57.629> got<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
for deleting chunks so I just got to

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.470 
for deleting chunks so I just got to
find<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.169> world<00:02:58.319> here<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.620> Nate's<00:02:59.090> so<00:03:00.090> as<00:03:00.359> you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
find that world here is Nate's so as you

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.539 
find that world here is Nate's so as you
can<00:03:00.599> see<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.260> gives<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> mini-map

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
can see here it gives you a mini-map

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.330 
can see here it gives you a mini-map
view<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.599> entire<00:03:03.840> world<00:03:04.109> so<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.099> thing

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
view of the entire world so that thing

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.949 
view of the entire world so that thing
is<00:03:05.459> obviously<00:03:05.879> what<00:03:06.359> we're<00:03:06.510> trying<00:03:06.629> to<00:03:06.750> keep

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
is obviously what we're trying to keep

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.929 
is obviously what we're trying to keep
so<00:03:07.620> what<00:03:07.709> you're<00:03:07.799> gonna<00:03:07.859> do<00:03:08.099> normally<00:03:08.639> you<00:03:08.849> can

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
so what you're gonna do normally you can

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.610 
so what you're gonna do normally you can
just<00:03:08.970> select<00:03:09.239> chunks<00:03:09.689> by<00:03:09.780> clicking<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.439> it'll

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
just select chunks by clicking and it'll

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.649 
just select chunks by clicking and it'll
pick<00:03:10.799> out<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.099> chunks<00:03:11.310> but<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.180> quicker<00:03:12.450> if

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
pick out the chunks but it's quicker if

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.379 
pick out the chunks but it's quicker if
you<00:03:12.750> hold<00:03:12.930> down<00:03:13.049> shift<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:13.620> go<00:03:13.950> like<00:03:14.129> that

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
you hold down shift and go like that

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:19.159 
you hold down shift and go like that
it'll<00:03:15.389> select<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:16.019> whole<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.889> whole<00:03:17.040> area<00:03:18.169> so

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
it'll select a whole a whole area so

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.409 
it'll select a whole a whole area so
what<00:03:20.129> we're<00:03:20.250> gonna<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.549> is<00:03:20.729> just<00:03:21.269> select

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
what we're gonna do is just select

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:27.890 
what we're gonna do is just select
everything<00:03:22.519> around<00:03:24.079> where<00:03:26.720> where<00:03:27.720> your

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
everything around where where your

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.309 
everything around where where your
object<00:03:28.319> is<00:03:28.609> like<00:03:29.609> select<00:03:30.090> everything<00:03:30.510> around

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
object is like select everything around

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.710 
object is like select everything around
what<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.709> want<00:03:31.859> delete<00:03:32.449> so<00:03:33.449> once<00:03:33.599> we've<00:03:33.690> got

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
what you want delete so once we've got

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.270 
what you want delete so once we've got
like<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.079> basic<00:03:34.409> area<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.829> want<00:03:34.979> to<00:03:35.040> keep

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
like the basic area we want to keep

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.039 
like the basic area we want to keep
we're<00:03:35.909> gonna<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.540> go<00:03:37.310> zoom<00:03:38.310> out<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.729> like

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
we're gonna do is go zoom out to like

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:45.649 
we're gonna do is go zoom out to like
one<00:03:40.049> maybe<00:03:43.819> so<00:03:44.819> this<00:03:44.940> world<00:03:45.150> isn't<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.419> bit

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
one maybe so this world isn't this bit

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.569 
one maybe so this world isn't this bit
isn't<00:03:46.079> this<00:03:46.349> big<00:03:46.560> isn't<00:03:46.979> that<00:03:47.190> big

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
isn't this big isn't that big

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.069 
isn't this big isn't that big
yours<00:03:48.030> are<00:03:48.180> probably<00:03:48.419> bigger<00:03:48.629> if<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.870> played

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
yours are probably bigger if you played

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.319 
yours are probably bigger if you played
it<00:03:49.199> for<00:03:49.229> a<00:03:49.319> long<00:03:49.470> time<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.879> may<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.120> to

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
it for a long time so you may have to

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.059 
it for a long time so you may have to

take a while and then what you're gonna
do<00:03:53.250> is<00:03:53.400> just<00:03:53.519> select<00:03:53.720> everything<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.859> isn't

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
do is just select everything that isn't

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:02.360 
do is just select everything that isn't
your<00:03:59.180> the<00:04:00.180> build<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.569> want<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> keep<00:04:01.370> so

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
your the build that you want to keep so

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.069 
your the build that you want to keep so
just<00:04:02.549> go<00:04:02.639> through<00:04:02.699> everything<00:04:02.939> just<00:04:03.870> keep

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
just go through everything just keep

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.429 
just go through everything just keep
selecting<00:04:05.329> yeah<00:04:06.329> that's<00:04:06.510> some<00:04:06.720> that's<00:04:07.019> some

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
selecting yeah that's some that's some

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.229 
selecting yeah that's some that's some
buggy<00:04:07.769> world<00:04:08.129> generation<00:04:08.430> right<00:04:08.819> there<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
buggy world generation right there the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.719 
buggy world generation right there the
chunks<00:04:09.540> are<00:04:09.629> loading<00:04:10.159> before<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.459> chunks

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
chunks are loading before the chunks

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.229 
chunks are loading before the chunks
closest<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.329> us<00:04:12.359> have<00:04:12.989> loaded<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:14.120> once<00:04:15.120> we

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
closest to us have loaded so once we

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.520 
closest to us have loaded so once we
have<00:04:15.329> everything<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.810> we<00:04:15.989> want<00:04:16.199> to<00:04:16.229> delete

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
have everything that we want to delete

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.740 
have everything that we want to delete
selected<00:04:17.099> which<00:04:17.729> is<00:04:17.849> everything<00:04:18.120> except<00:04:18.599> for

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
selected which is everything except for

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.709 
selected which is everything except for
that<00:04:19.489> we're<00:04:20.489> gonna<00:04:20.549> go<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.789> chunks<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> chunks

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
that we're gonna go to chunks the chunks

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.500 
that we're gonna go to chunks the chunks
tab<00:04:21.870> over<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.650> go<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.130> delete<00:04:23.580> selected

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
tab over here and go to delete selected

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.420 
tab over here and go to delete selected
chunks<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.169> then<00:04:25.320> delete<00:04:25.620> them

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
chunks and then delete them

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.400 
chunks and then delete them
boom<00:04:26.669> everything's<00:04:27.060> gone<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.600> just<00:04:28.289> close

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
boom everything's gone so just close

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.650 
boom everything's gone so just close
that<00:04:28.470> a<00:04:28.620> chunky<00:04:29.009> and<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.880> close<00:04:30.090> out<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.389> and

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
that a chunky and you close out this and

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.100 
that a chunky and you close out this and
now<00:04:30.780> we're<00:04:30.900> gonna<00:04:30.990> start<00:04:31.259> minecraft<00:04:31.470> up<00:04:31.860> again

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
now we're gonna start minecraft up again

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.090 
now we're gonna start minecraft up again
so<00:04:34.110> what<00:04:34.199> you're<00:04:34.289> gonna<00:04:34.380> want<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.590> do<00:04:34.710> go<00:04:35.039> to

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
so what you're gonna want to do go to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.100 
so what you're gonna want to do go to
your<00:04:35.340> old<00:04:35.520> profile<00:04:36.000> which<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:36.840> named<00:04:36.990> my

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
your old profile which I just named my

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.610 
your old profile which I just named my
default<00:04:37.590> go<00:04:38.009> to<00:04:38.100> edit<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.460> profile<00:04:38.880> and<00:04:39.180> then

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
default go to edit the profile and then

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.969 
default go to edit the profile and then
change<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.949> the<00:04:41.520> newest<00:04:41.850> snapshot<00:04:42.330> which<00:04:42.630> is

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
change to the newest snapshot which is

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:48.650 
change to the newest snapshot which is
13w<00:04:43.979> 36b<00:04:44.699> as<00:04:45.419> of<00:04:45.600> now<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.050> then<00:04:47.479> log<00:04:48.479> into

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
13w 36b as of now and then log into

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:55.460 
13w 36b as of now and then log into
minecraft<00:04:53.509> so<00:04:54.509> now<00:04:54.960> you<00:04:55.020> can<00:04:55.229> see<00:04:55.350> we're

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
minecraft so now you can see we're

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.730 
minecraft so now you can see we're
running<00:04:55.680> 13<00:04:55.860> w<00:04:56.310> 36<00:04:56.759> b<00:04:56.970> or<00:04:57.240> minecraft<00:04:57.870> 106<00:04:58.590> when

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
running 13 w 36 b or minecraft 106 when

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.490 
running 13 w 36 b or minecraft 106 when
it<00:04:58.830> comes<00:04:58.979> out<00:04:59.160> they<00:04:59.910> may<00:05:00.060> add<00:05:00.210> more<00:05:00.500> train

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
it comes out they may add more train

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.920 
it comes out they may add more train
generation<00:05:02.009> so<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:03.240> can<00:05:03.389> do<00:05:03.479> this<00:05:03.660> more<00:05:03.870> than

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
generation so you can do this more than

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.370 
generation so you can do this more than
once<00:05:04.520> go<00:05:05.520> back<00:05:05.699> into<00:05:05.940> Nate's<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.570> now<00:05:07.199> what

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
once go back into Nate's and now what

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.580 
once go back into Nate's and now what
it'll<00:05:07.530> do<00:05:07.710> is<00:05:07.919> it<00:05:08.310> will<00:05:08.460> start<00:05:09.289> generating<00:05:10.289> it

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
it'll do is it will start generating it

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.730 
it'll do is it will start generating it
with<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:11.250> snapshot<00:05:11.550> terrain<00:05:12.120> instead<00:05:12.810> of<00:05:12.930> 1.6

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
with the snapshot terrain instead of 1.6

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.189 
with the snapshot terrain instead of 1.6
so<00:05:14.520> effectively<00:05:15.030> keeping<00:05:15.570> everything<00:05:16.050> you

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
so effectively keeping everything you

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.629 
so effectively keeping everything you
want<00:05:16.349> to<00:05:16.440> keep<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.720> just<00:05:18.720> replacing

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
want to keep and just replacing

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.719 
want to keep and just replacing
everything<00:05:20.639> else<00:05:20.940> with<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.330> brand-new<00:05:21.630> train

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
everything else with the brand-new train

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.529 
everything else with the brand-new train
so<00:05:23.729> let's<00:05:23.849> see<00:05:23.940> if<00:05:24.000> we<00:05:24.090> can<00:05:24.210> get<00:05:24.300> some<00:05:24.419> good

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
so let's see if we can get some good

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.700 
so let's see if we can get some good
examples<00:05:24.660> here<00:05:26.990> wait<00:05:27.990> for<00:05:28.139> the<00:05:28.199> world<00:05:28.349> to<00:05:28.530> load

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
examples here wait for the world to load

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.290 
examples here wait for the world to load
sometimes<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.490> takes<00:05:29.639> a<00:05:29.729> while<00:05:29.759> since<00:05:30.180> you

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
sometimes it takes a while since you

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.810 
sometimes it takes a while since you
know<00:05:30.419> you're<00:05:30.539> loading<00:05:30.840> so<00:05:30.960> many<00:05:30.990> new<00:05:31.289> chunks

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
know you're loading so many new chunks

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.219 
know you're loading so many new chunks
and<00:05:32.840> there<00:05:33.840> we<00:05:33.930> go

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
and there we go

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.980 
and there we go
okay<00:05:34.590> umm<00:05:34.919> a<00:05:35.159> little<00:05:36.150> bit<00:05:36.240> of<00:05:36.360> a<00:05:36.449> glitch<00:05:36.960> there

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
okay umm a little bit of a glitch there

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
okay umm a little bit of a glitch there
sometimes

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
sometimes

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.279 
sometimes
you<00:05:38.699> might<00:05:38.849> have<00:05:38.909> to<00:05:39.030> work<00:05:39.180> with<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:39.510> bit<00:05:39.690> you

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
you might have to work with it a bit you

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.810 
you might have to work with it a bit you
can<00:05:40.349> kind<00:05:40.620> of<00:05:40.740> smooth<00:05:41.070> this<00:05:41.310> out<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.550> little<00:05:41.699> bit

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
can kind of smooth this out a little bit

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.790 
can kind of smooth this out a little bit
but<00:05:42.510> as<00:05:42.599> you<00:05:42.720> can<00:05:42.810> see<00:05:42.870> what<00:05:43.110> it's<00:05:43.229> done<00:05:43.380> is<00:05:43.620> it

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
but as you can see what it's done is it

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.490 
but as you can see what it's done is it
has<00:05:43.830> kept<00:05:44.190> this<00:05:44.970> area<00:05:45.419> right<00:05:45.599> here<00:05:45.659> it<00:05:46.289> works

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
has kept this area right here it works

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.790 
has kept this area right here it works
works<00:05:47.159> better<00:05:47.400> than<00:05:47.639> others<00:05:48.169> sometimes<00:05:49.169> so

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
works better than others sometimes so

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.399 
works better than others sometimes so
here<00:05:50.010> you<00:05:50.099> go<00:05:50.220> you<00:05:50.280> got<00:05:50.610> your<00:05:51.210> little<00:05:51.539> space

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
here you go you got your little space

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.219 
here you go you got your little space
you<00:05:52.650> wanted<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.919> keep<00:05:53.099> as<00:05:53.370> well<00:05:54.120> as<00:05:54.360> all<00:05:54.810> the

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
you wanted to keep as well as all the
