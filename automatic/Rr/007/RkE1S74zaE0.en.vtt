ventilation<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.320> process<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.890> breathing

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
ventilation is the process of breathing

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.450 
ventilation is the process of breathing
when<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.809> inspire<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> intercostal<00:00:50.129> muscles

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
when we inspire the intercostal muscles

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.799 
when we inspire the intercostal muscles
between<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> ribs<00:00:50.940> contract

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
between the ribs contract

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.420 
between the ribs contract
this<00:00:52.079> makes<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> ribs<00:00:52.710> move<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
this makes the ribs move up and out the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.160 
this makes the ribs move up and out the
diaphragm<00:00:56.430> muscles<00:00:56.850> contract<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.809> pull<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
diaphragm muscles contract and pull the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.880 
diaphragm muscles contract and pull the
diaphragm<00:00:58.620> down<00:00:59.960> both<00:01:00.960> these<00:01:01.199> processes

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
diaphragm down both these processes

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
diaphragm down both these processes
increase<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> volume<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> thoracic

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
increase the volume in the thoracic

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.450 
increase the volume in the thoracic
cavity<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.769> reduces<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.760> pressure<00:01:07.460> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
cavity which reduces the pressure the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.730 
cavity which reduces the pressure the
air<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> atmosphere<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.320> more<00:01:10.590> than

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
air in the atmosphere is then more than

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
air in the atmosphere is then more than
in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> lungs<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.000> air<00:01:12.150> then<00:01:12.390> rushes<00:01:12.780> into

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
in the lungs so the air then rushes into

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.740 
in the lungs so the air then rushes into
the<00:01:13.200> lungs<00:01:13.470> until<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.340> pressures<00:01:14.820> are<00:01:15.299> useful

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the lungs until the pressures are useful

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.789 
the lungs until the pressures are useful
when<00:01:16.970> we<00:01:17.970> explore<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.750> intercostal<00:01:19.470> muscles

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
when we explore the intercostal muscles

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
when we explore the intercostal muscles
then<00:01:20.009> relax<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.850> ribcage<00:01:21.060> drops<00:01:21.689> down

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
then relax and the ribcage drops down

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.030 
then relax and the ribcage drops down
and<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:27.299> diaphragm<00:01:27.630> muscles<00:01:28.229> also<00:01:28.530> relax

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and in the diaphragm muscles also relax

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.260 
and in the diaphragm muscles also relax
and<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> diaphragm<00:01:29.759> moves<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:32.270> these

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
and the diaphragm moves up these

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
and the diaphragm moves up these
processes<00:01:33.990> reduce<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> area<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.100> the

processes reduce the area in the

processes reduce the area in the
thoracic<00:01:35.759> cavity<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.479> increase<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
thoracic cavity and increase the
