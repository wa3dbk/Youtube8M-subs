00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello welcome my actions 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.380
 There is one word from me today 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.900
 Turkish video 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.580
 I'll do that and this video 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.260
 I have already in my old throw 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.970
 This was sometime in the autumn 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.170
 But somehow I forgot that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.070
 for you to cut together and 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.779
 upload 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.240
 Of course I want you to have this recipe 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.310
 Do not be deprived and become you 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.179
 so now the ingredients 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.730
 imagine 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.110
 but maybe very short in advance 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.150
 There is a natural kitchen here 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.400
 quite often there is one 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.830
 vegetarian variation and one with 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.510
 minced meat i will be using this today 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.820
 minced imagine that with me 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.460
 personally better and while it is 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.430
 actually pretty much yes and to the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.440
 ingredients go immediately 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.560
 for this you need paprika and that 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.790
 is it so small round paprika you to 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.310
 example in turkish supermarkets 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.380
 I now have eight of them 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.170
 That's about 800 grams 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.610
 There are also smaller variants and who 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.950
 who does not want to be able to do the whole thing 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.180
 normal red or yellow greens 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.460
 take chilies 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.950
 then I have minced beef 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.370
 Minced meat 500 grams of some olive oil 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.140
 about two tablespoons 100 grams rice 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.159
 I already washed it with 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.820
 two tablespoons hot tomato tomato 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.590
 and a teaspoon of paprika likes a big one 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.610
 onion I have already in small 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.310
 cut dice 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.100
 you need salt and pepper and something 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.540
 Parsley is also a good match 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.850
 can you chop them up too ? 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.290
 Unfortunately I do not have and who wants 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.950
 you can have a few tomatoes with pure 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.750
 give 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.090
 with the ingredients can of course also 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.310
 always vary with the herbs with the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.290
 spices her because if you have 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.150
 no tomatenmark've since got so the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.280
 do not like the dino paprika mark or 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.110
 liszt let it off you can to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.690
 For example , fresh tomatoes in the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.150
 enter filling so experimented there 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.950
 Just for fun and tried 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.890
 just from what you like best 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.140
 I like it so much and that's why 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.259
 I show you how I like my dorma 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.849
 manufacturer First we take you the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.549
 paprika they are all already 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.090
 washed and there you cut from above 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.090
 this way 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.000
 once around they do the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.420
 Carefully away and can now here 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.950
 this core housing remove the cover 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.299
 you do not throw away we need 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.299
 to cover again later 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.269
 by gently turning and the rest 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.269
 I'm knocking out now 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.420
 you can already do that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.970
 put in your big pot here 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.520
 then you can also see if everyone else 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.470
 fit in 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.760
 just imagine that 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.880
 they will be the same if then all in there 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.080
 later everything is so pure here 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.240
 the opening upwards 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.870
 then I could easily do it later 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.870
 heartstrings 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.040
 that put then briefly to the side and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.880
 prepares the filling for so long 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.540
 for filling take by the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.780
 minced meat 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.490
 because then comes the rice has then the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.810
 sticks now but is still wet from 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:36.680
 then wash tomatoes and peppers like the 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:40.900
 onions and two tablespoons of olive oil 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:46.100
 or tasteless oil slightly better 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.750
 and about a teaspoon of salt and now 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.030
 we take this again daily or 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.709
 just not a small cup and fill it 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.400
 halfway with water and that comes 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.400
 also with pure 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.170
 that will be all together 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.170
 mixed 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.870
 I had no parsley here 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:10.200
 still so this 7 herbal mixture with pure 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:12.560
 parsley chervil is also under construction 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.530
 of the state in the court no further 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.230
 then you take the peppers and give 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:33.930
 each something of fulfillment in each 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:36.090
 Peppers left a lot of so much stuffing 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.080
 would have three to four peppers 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.630
 can fill with it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.860
 But that's not bad for her 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.419
 because the filling can be quite good 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.979
 freeze and later the next time 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.110
 used very little there is still each 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.110
 are tomato pieces with it 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:57.009
 and strong 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:00.809
 now the lids on top just 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.529
 give the matching lid with on top 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:07.659
 does not have to be perfect anymore 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:11.219
 you do not need to remember it 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:13.300
 which lids are so worldly paprika 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.039
 just like that 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.860
 then just come here again 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.939
 a glass of water with a small one 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.710
 The culprit is the olive oil and then it can 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.360
 are already cooked, he is now 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.490
 still the lid on it and then 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.870
 the peppers about an hour completely 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.870
 gone low heat 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.790
 Of course, the stuffed peppers too 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.070
 cook a little shorter 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.530
 I think half an hour will be there too 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.870
 However , I like very much and 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.669
 it is my personal taste though 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.460
 the peppers are soft 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.919
 I do not like that at this dish 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.500
 like to firm but as said because it 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:00.570
 she just wants to cook 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.740
 half an hour and everyone else 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.740
 they can wait a little longer 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.840
 Rejoice with this recipe again 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.660
 a little insight into the Turkish 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.750
 kitchen will give me but of course 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.039
 happy about feedback and about 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.650
 people who cook this dish 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.240
 and then I'm looking forward to mine 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.220
 next video is looking forward to your 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.360
 comments and ratings and 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.720
 then say goodbye to you next 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.720
 times
