with the fragrance mix 4 to 1 for
polysorbate<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:13.500> fragrance<00:00:14.509> and<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:16.170> we're

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
polysorbate one fragrance and what we're

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.790 
polysorbate one fragrance and what we're
going<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:17.570> this<00:00:18.570> mixture<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.260> ready<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
going to do is this mixture is ready and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.720 
going to do is this mixture is ready and
we<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.490> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> prepare<00:00:22.310> two<00:00:23.310> different

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
we are going to prepare two different

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.710 
we are going to prepare two different
water<00:00:23.820> based<00:00:24.150> solutions<00:00:24.810> we'll<00:00:25.710> add<00:00:25.890> water<00:00:26.720> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
water based solutions we'll add water to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:44.990 
water based solutions we'll add water to
both<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:36.170> we<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
both and we will to one it's going to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.260 
both and we will to one it's going to
just<00:00:45.239> remain<00:00:45.570> water<00:00:46.399> to<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> other<00:00:47.670> we're

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
just remain water to the other we're

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.139 
just remain water to the other we're
going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> introduce<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:50.070> dite<00:00:50.489> clear

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
going to introduce the dite clear

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
going to introduce the dite clear
solution<00:00:59.510> agitation<00:01:00.510> while<00:01:00.719> stirring<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
solution agitation while stirring it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.890 
solution agitation while stirring it
will<00:01:02.250> thicken<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:02.789> bit<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.110> normal

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
will thicken a little bit this is normal

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:15.539 
will thicken a little bit this is normal
but<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> solution<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.830> solidify

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.090 

so<00:01:16.390> over<00:01:16.570> here<00:01:16.750> we<00:01:16.810> have<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.350> site<00:01:17.619> clear

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
so over here we have the site clear

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.749 
so over here we have the site clear
solution<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.770> we<00:01:20.979> will<00:01:21.100> add<00:01:21.310> the

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
solution and to that we will add the

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:33.719 
solution and to that we will add the
polysorbate<00:01:22.359> fragrance<00:01:23.289> mix<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:33.490> will

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
polysorbate fragrance mix which will

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:51.410 
polysorbate fragrance mix which will
upon<00:01:34.060> entry<00:01:34.479> turn<00:01:35.459> immediately<00:01:36.459> turn<00:01:36.759> white

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.010 

and<00:01:52.420> on<00:01:53.349> the<00:01:53.409> other<00:01:53.709> side<00:01:55.289> we<00:01:56.289> will<00:01:56.500> just<00:01:56.799> add

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
and on the other side we will just add

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
and on the other side we will just add
polysorbate<00:01:59.020> fragrance<00:01:59.799> mix<00:02:00.069> to<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.700> water

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:17.160 

which<00:02:04.270> will<00:02:04.509> definitely<00:02:05.200> turn<00:02:05.439> it<00:02:05.619> white<00:02:16.170> it's

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
which will definitely turn it white it's

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.440 
which will definitely turn it white it's
good<00:02:17.440> to<00:02:17.590> agitate<00:02:18.190> for<00:02:18.610> at<00:02:18.700> least<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:19.030> couple<00:02:19.269> of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
good to agitate for at least a couple of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.210 
good to agitate for at least a couple of
minutes<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.609> this<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.920> this

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
minutes but in this in this

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.629 
minutes but in this in this
demonstration<00:02:24.910> I'll<00:02:25.329> just<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:26.340> jeté<00:02:27.340> tit<00:02:27.489> for

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
demonstration I'll just a jeté tit for

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:35.370 
demonstration I'll just a jeté tit for
just<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.030> couple<00:02:29.579> 30<00:02:30.579> to<00:02:30.760> 40<00:02:31.090> seconds<00:02:33.389> and<00:02:34.389> as

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
just a couple 30 to 40 seconds and as

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.120 
just a couple 30 to 40 seconds and as
you<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.769> see<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:37.569> solution<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:39.250> pretty<00:02:40.120> milky

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
you can see the solution is pretty milky

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.539 
you can see the solution is pretty milky
however<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.340> not<00:02:42.519> as<00:02:42.700> milky<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.980> just

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
however it's not as milky as the just

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.110 
however it's not as milky as the just
the<00:02:45.700> water<00:02:46.000> polysorbate<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:47.109> fragrance<00:02:47.590> mix

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
the water polysorbate in fragrance mix

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.270 
the water polysorbate in fragrance mix
so<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.239> one<00:02:49.450> here<00:02:49.690> has<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:49.900> dight<00:02:50.319> clear

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
so this one here has the dight clear

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.100 
so this one here has the dight clear
solution

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.690 

and<00:02:59.110> what<00:02:59.290> we're<00:02:59.439> going<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.739> do<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.099> clean<00:03:00.489> this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and what we're going to do is clean this

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.039 
and what we're going to do is clean this
up<00:03:00.939> here<00:03:03.209> what<00:03:04.209> we're<00:03:04.360> going<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.599> do<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.870> we're

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
up here what we're going to do is we're

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.059 
up here what we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.230> let<00:03:05.409> this<00:03:05.650> sit<00:03:07.560> I'm<00:03:08.560> going<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.829> pause

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
going to let this sit I'm going to pause

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.330 
going to let this sit I'm going to pause
the<00:03:09.370> video<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:10.590> we'll<00:03:11.590> let<00:03:11.769> this<00:03:11.950> solution

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the video and we'll let this solution

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.180 
the video and we'll let this solution
sit<00:03:12.819> for<00:03:13.060> about<00:03:13.150> three<00:03:13.599> minutes<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.190> we'll

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
sit for about three minutes and we'll

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.740 
sit for about three minutes and we'll
come<00:03:15.220> right<00:03:15.430> back<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:16.000> take<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.239> look<00:03:16.329> at<00:03:16.569> where

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
come right back to take a look at where

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.630 
come right back to take a look at where
it's<00:03:16.900> at<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:20.440> we<00:03:20.560> are<00:03:20.590> after<00:03:20.890> about<00:03:21.250> three

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
it's at here we are after about three

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:31.490 
it's at here we are after about three
minutes<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:24.129> solution<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.970> clearing<00:03:25.480> up<00:03:28.920> and

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
minutes the solution is clearing up and

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.550 
minutes the solution is clearing up and
give<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.620> another<00:03:33.750> another<00:03:34.750> view<00:03:35.200> from<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
give you another another view from the

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.740 
give you another another view from the
top<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> that<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.840> can<00:03:38.049> see<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.569> from

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
top so that you can see what I see from

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:49.530 
top so that you can see what I see from
up<00:03:40.959> here

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.520 

okay<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.180> solution<00:03:52.720> has<00:03:52.930> cleared<00:03:53.379> up

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
okay so the solution has cleared up

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.860 
okay so the solution has cleared up
quite<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.860> bit<00:03:54.129> and<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:58.000> about<00:03:58.269> two<00:03:58.659> more

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
quite a bit and in about two more

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.780 
quite a bit and in about two more
minutes<00:03:59.140> here<00:03:59.709> we<00:03:59.799> are<00:03:59.829> after<00:04:00.129> about<00:04:00.430> three

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
minutes here we are after about three

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.750 
minutes here we are after about three
minutes<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.709> about<00:04:02.709> two<00:04:02.980> more<00:04:03.250> minutes

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
minutes and about two more minutes

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.680 
minutes and about two more minutes
this<00:04:04.030> will<00:04:04.269> be<00:04:05.670> 100%<00:04:07.319> crystal-clear<00:04:08.760> or<00:04:09.760> about

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
this will be 100% crystal-clear or about

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.520 
this will be 100% crystal-clear or about
a<00:04:10.720> hundred<00:04:11.079> percent<00:04:11.200> anyway<00:04:13.110> but<00:04:14.110> as<00:04:14.260> you<00:04:14.409> can

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
a hundred percent anyway but as you can

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.250 
a hundred percent anyway but as you can
see<00:04:14.590> if<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.129> use<00:04:15.159> the<00:04:15.840> conventional<00:04:16.840> method

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
see if you use the conventional method

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.360 
see if you use the conventional method
without<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.979> Dyck<00:04:18.220> clear<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:20.859> is<00:04:21.039> what<00:04:21.220> you

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
without the Dyck clear this is what you

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.750 
without the Dyck clear this is what you
would<00:04:21.519> be<00:04:21.669> left<00:04:21.850> with<00:04:23.010> so<00:04:24.010> we'll<00:04:24.190> come<00:04:24.370> back<00:04:24.580> in

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
would be left with so we'll come back in

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.610 
would be left with so we'll come back in
about<00:04:25.000> two<00:04:25.419> minutes<00:04:25.630> and<00:04:25.990> I'll<00:04:26.080> show<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.380> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
about two minutes and I'll show you the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.700 
about two minutes and I'll show you the
end<00:04:26.650> result<00:04:29.520> okay<00:04:30.520> here<00:04:30.820> we<00:04:30.910> are<00:04:30.940> after<00:04:31.710> five

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
end result okay here we are after five

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.460 
end result okay here we are after five
minutes<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:35.169> can<00:04:35.410> see<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:37.690> this<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.199> a

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
minutes and you can see that this is a

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.320 
minutes and you can see that this is a
crystal-clear<00:04:39.010> solution<00:04:39.990> and<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.970> one<00:04:43.210> is

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
crystal-clear solution and this one is

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:52.200 
crystal-clear solution and this one is
not<00:04:44.490> at<00:04:45.490> all<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:48.070> both<00:04:48.340> have<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:52.000> same

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
not at all and they both have the same

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.650 
not at all and they both have the same
smell<00:04:52.860> or<00:04:53.860> very<00:04:54.250> close<00:04:54.960> but<00:04:55.960> you<00:04:56.169> there<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.650> no

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
smell or very close but you there is no
