galaxy s4 mini the box out of the way it
will<00:01:07.320> unpack<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.670> battery<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:11.180> our<00:01:12.180> battery

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
will unpack the battery and our battery

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.499 
will unpack the battery and our battery
is<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:14.299> 1900<00:01:15.299> milliamp<00:01:15.689> hour<00:01:15.840> battery<00:01:17.270> go<00:01:18.270> ahead

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
is a 1900 milliamp hour battery go ahead

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.649 
is a 1900 milliamp hour battery go ahead
and<00:01:18.630> peel<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.229> plastic<00:01:19.890> off<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.060> galaxy

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and peel this plastic off in the galaxy

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.230 
and peel this plastic off in the galaxy
s4<00:01:25.080> mini<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.500> looks<00:01:25.799> identical<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.790> galaxy

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
s4 mini it looks identical to the galaxy

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
s4 mini it looks identical to the galaxy
s4<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> regular<00:01:28.710> galaxy<00:01:29.369> s4<00:01:29.790> this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
s4 so this is the regular galaxy s4 this

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.999 
s4 so this is the regular galaxy s4 this
is<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.570> s4<00:01:30.930> mini<00:01:30.960> obviously<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.860> see

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
is the s4 mini obviously you can see

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
is the s4 mini obviously you can see
it's<00:01:32.130> considerably<00:01:32.610> smaller<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.939> looks<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> be

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it's considerably smaller it looks to be

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.249 
it's considerably smaller it looks to be
about<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.290> same<00:01:37.530> thickness<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
about the same thickness so just in a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.620 
about the same thickness so just in a
smaller<00:01:40.650> package<00:01:41.000> let's<00:01:42.000> go<00:01:42.150> ahead<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.329> solve

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
smaller package let's go ahead and solve

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.280 
smaller package let's go ahead and solve
our<00:01:42.810> battery<00:01:44.390> does<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> removable<00:01:45.780> back

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
our battery does have a removable back

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.230 
our battery does have a removable back
cover<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.860> like<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> regular<00:01:47.310> s4<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.119> have

down<00:02:29.540> here<00:02:29.750> at<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.870> bottom<00:02:29.930> obviously<00:02:30.680> have

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
down here at the bottom obviously have

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.009 
down here at the bottom obviously have
your<00:02:30.890> physical<00:02:31.099> key<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.819> then<00:02:32.390> your<00:02:32.569> two

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
your physical key and then your two

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.050 
your physical key and then your two
virtual<00:02:33.500> keys<00:02:33.769> so<00:02:33.980> back<00:02:34.250> key<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.760> like<00:02:34.910> your

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
virtual keys so back key and like your

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.850 
virtual keys so back key and like your
menu<00:02:35.390> key<00:02:35.660> as<00:02:35.810> well<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:36.110> your<00:02:36.230> home<00:02:36.379> button<00:02:36.680> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
menu key as well as your home button and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.479 
menu key as well as your home button and
on<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.940> front<00:02:38.180> there<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:39.250> 1.9<00:02:40.250> megapixel

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
on the front there is a 1.9 megapixel

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.539 
on the front there is a 1.9 megapixel
front-facing<00:02:41.239> camera<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:46.040> back<00:02:46.190> camera<00:02:46.489> is

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
front-facing camera the back camera is

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.339 
front-facing camera the back camera is
an<00:02:46.640> 8<00:02:46.819> megapixel<00:02:46.970> camera<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:47.870> is<00:02:47.959> different

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
an 8 megapixel camera so it is different

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.160 
an 8 megapixel camera so it is different
than<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.650> regular<00:02:48.890> galaxy<00:02:49.519> s4s<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.180> believe<00:02:50.750> 13

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
than the regular galaxy s4s I believe 13

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.990 
than the regular galaxy s4s I believe 13
megapixel<00:02:51.799> primary<00:02:52.010> camera<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:52.849> is

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
megapixel primary camera so it is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.830 
megapixel primary camera so it is
slightly<00:02:53.299> smaller<00:02:55.030> but<00:02:56.030> as<00:02:56.150> we<00:02:56.299> all<00:02:56.329> know<00:02:56.480> it's

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
slightly smaller but as we all know it's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.539 
slightly smaller but as we all know it's
not<00:02:57.019> really<00:02:57.349> about<00:02:57.530> megapixel<00:02:58.190> count<00:02:58.340> it's

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
not really about megapixel count it's

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.800 
not really about megapixel count it's
about<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.849> quality<00:02:59.209> of<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.329> picture<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.720> a

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
about the quality of the picture and a

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.630 
about the quality of the picture and a
lot<00:02:59.959> of<00:02:59.989> that<00:03:00.170> has<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.319> do<00:03:00.560> with<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.829> software

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
lot of that has to do with the software

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.539 
lot of that has to do with the software
that<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.910> phone<00:03:02.120> is<00:03:02.150> running<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.709> galaxy<00:03:03.890> s4
