like<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.100> before<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.760> Skyrim<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:37.930> a

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
like this before in Skyrim so it's a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.140 
like this before in Skyrim so it's a
really<00:01:38.110> cool<00:01:38.320> fact<00:01:38.650> but<00:01:39.220> as<00:01:39.460> you<00:01:39.820> noticed<00:01:40.060> in

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
really cool fact but as you noticed in

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.310 
really cool fact but as you noticed in
the<00:01:40.210> background<00:01:40.570> we're<00:01:40.720> trapped<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.170> this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
the background we're trapped in this

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.140 
the background we're trapped in this
room<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.190> only<00:01:42.280> way<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.460> get<00:01:42.670> by<00:01:42.820> is<00:01:42.880> by

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
room and the only way to get by is by

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.789 
room and the only way to get by is by
using<00:01:43.330> this<00:01:43.570> weapon<00:01:43.750> against<00:01:44.650> this

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
using this weapon against this

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.370 
using this weapon against this
mysterious<00:01:45.250> doorway<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.390> here's<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.229> third

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
mysterious doorway so here's the third

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.020 
mysterious doorway so here's the third
person<00:01:47.619> look<00:01:47.860> at<00:01:48.040> what<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.340> weapon<00:01:48.610> does<00:01:48.790> and

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
person look at what the weapon does and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.940 
person look at what the weapon does and
how<00:01:49.150> it<00:01:49.180> works<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.690> as<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.409> can<00:01:50.470> tell<00:01:50.590> it

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
how it works and as you can tell it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.520 
how it works and as you can tell it
works<00:01:51.280> like<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.549> magic<00:01:51.850> wand<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.450> sends<00:01:53.049> a<00:01:53.110> red

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
works like a magic wand it sends a red

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.980 
works like a magic wand it sends a red
wave<00:01:53.710> of<00:01:53.860> energy<00:01:54.040> out<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.450> open<00:01:55.690> wherever

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
wave of energy out in the open wherever

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.870 
wave of energy out in the open wherever
you're<00:01:56.140> aiming<00:01:56.409> at<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:57.549> you'll<00:01:57.700> notice

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you're aiming at so if you'll notice

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.670 
you're aiming at so if you'll notice
these<00:01:58.030> horizontal<00:01:58.600> lines<00:01:58.780> on<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.350> pillars

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
these horizontal lines on the pillars

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.560 
these horizontal lines on the pillars
we're<00:02:00.310> going<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.490> want<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.700> do<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> power<00:02:01.150> swing

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
we're going to want to do a power swing

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.320 
we're going to want to do a power swing
on<00:02:01.840> these<00:02:02.380> pillars<00:02:02.650> in<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.549> exact<00:02:03.850> direction

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
on these pillars in the exact direction

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.120 
on these pillars in the exact direction
that<00:02:04.420> these<00:02:04.570> lines<00:02:04.810> are<00:02:04.930> facing<00:02:05.320> so<00:02:05.799> since

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
that these lines are facing so since

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.070 
that these lines are facing so since
this<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.400> horizontal<00:02:06.760> line<00:02:07.030> we're<00:02:07.930> going<00:02:08.019> to

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
this is a horizontal line we're going to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.719 
this is a horizontal line we're going to
want<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.349> hold<00:02:08.590> the<00:02:08.679> left<00:02:08.860> analog<00:02:09.190> stick<00:02:09.250> left

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
want to hold the left analog stick left

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.940 
want to hold the left analog stick left
or<00:02:09.880> right<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.300> perform<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.230> power<00:02:11.410> swing<00:02:11.709> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
or right and perform a power swing and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.980 
or right and perform a power swing and
every<00:02:12.880> time<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.120> do<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.450> then

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
every time you do that then

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.420 
every time you do that then
next<00:02:14.110> part<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.410> puzzle<00:02:14.710> will<00:02:14.830> pop<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
next part of the puzzle will pop up and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.390 
next part of the puzzle will pop up and
since<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.600> vertical<00:02:17.280> you're<00:02:18.280> going

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
since this one is vertical you're going

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490 
since this one is vertical you're going
to<00:02:18.460> do<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> vertical<00:02:19.000> power<00:02:19.420> tank<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.350> order

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
to do a vertical power tank so in order

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.070 
to do a vertical power tank so in order
to<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.710> vertical<00:02:21.220> power<00:02:21.550> attack<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.510> use<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
to a vertical power attack just use a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.560 
to a vertical power attack just use a
regular<00:02:23.470> power<00:02:23.860> attack<00:02:24.220> without<00:02:24.760> moving<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
regular power attack without moving the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.170 
regular power attack without moving the
left<00:02:25.750> analog<00:02:26.110> stick<00:02:26.170> at<00:02:26.530> all<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.700> every<00:02:27.940> time

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
left analog stick at all but every time

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.600 
left analog stick at all but every time
it'll<00:02:28.420> alternate<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.530> every<00:02:30.430> time<00:02:30.550> it

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
it'll alternate so every time it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.510 
it'll alternate so every time it
switches<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:31.420> keep<00:02:31.630> doing<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.520> vertical

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
switches just keep doing a vertical

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.460 
switches just keep doing a vertical
power<00:02:33.940> tank<00:02:34.270> or<00:02:34.450> horizontal<00:02:35.050> power<00:02:35.170> tag

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
power tank or horizontal power tag

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.950 
power tank or horizontal power tag
depending<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.250> what<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.460> line<00:02:36.640> indicates<00:02:37.270> so

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
depending on what the line indicates so

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.720 
depending on what the line indicates so
right<00:02:38.170> here<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.500> last<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.490> vertical

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
right here is the last one it's vertical

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.430 
right here is the last one it's vertical
so<00:02:40.240> we're<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.510> do<00:02:40.720> just<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.200> straight-up

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
so we're going to do just a straight-up

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.650 
so we're going to do just a straight-up
power<00:02:42.100> attack<00:02:42.490> without<00:02:42.700> moving<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.450> left

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
power attack without moving the left

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.870 
power attack without moving the left
analog<00:02:43.870> stick<00:02:44.050> at<00:02:44.380> all<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.890> once<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.700> do<00:02:45.850> that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
analog stick at all and once you do that

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.150 
analog stick at all and once you do that
you're<00:02:46.240> free<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.870> on<00:02:47.050> your<00:02:47.230> way<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.410> go<00:02:47.650> but
