00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
first evolution animation and here it is

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.140 
first evolution animation and here it is
in<00:02:15.069> its<00:02:15.280> second<00:02:15.970> form<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:21.040> as<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:21.849> see<00:02:21.910> he

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.270 
for the animation the second floor I'm
gonna<00:02:52.450> evolve<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> final<00:02:53.709> form<00:02:54.040> and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
