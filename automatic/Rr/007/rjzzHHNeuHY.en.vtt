00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.050
 I understand the shit hello to everybody here 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:12.490
 I will be commenting on the place of events 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:16.630
 and I wanted to talk to you about a topic that 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:20.890
 yesterday came to light and is the launch 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.010
 of the new ds of the family of the three 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.100
 times he's going to call two of that he was going to 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:32.079
 leave the same day as a pokÃ©mon x and the 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:38.289
 October 12th good here in this picture 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:41.590
 you can see the design of this new ds and 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:44.440
 well, this is going to be a criticism 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.450
 is going to be critical criticism of the whole 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.020
 but I did want to give my opinion about 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:55.540
 this new one of that good 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.730
 and if it came out yesterday they announced it because I do not know 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.010
 if they advertised it zealand 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.530
 they made an announcement and what there is not in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.530
 a video but I think that by having 100 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.200
 has not yet come out and well, well, they 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.600
 came out and the truth is that we out 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.780
 quite not yesterday was the birthday of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.880
 satoshi tajiri and believe me at least 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.290
 I think it's a fake that he does not speak 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.960
 more everyone and Tangier and his birthday 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.100
 but if not, I wanted to talk to you about 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.920
 this new from that the nintendo ds as already 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.790
 I said it will come out on October 12 and it's going to 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.530
 bring a novelty as it says nintendo that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.540
 it's like one of those that does not close and does not 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.149
 includes the option of 3d of the nintendo 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.710
 3ds very well 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:46.479
 first I wanted to talk to you about the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.580
 tried 3ds the nintendo 3ds came out in 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.260
 2012 I think 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:56.680
 in early 2013 I do not know when it came out and 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.590
 it's late it will be very very new already 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.390
 which included in the option of 3d without glasses 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.460
 3d and you could regulate the 3d thanks to a 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.090
 regulator that has to the right 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.209
 and well, after that, a 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.590
 biggest version called nintendo 3ds 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.010
 xl 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.350
 and well, well, that was also the case 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.670
 as very well not and well then 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.270
 that's not 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.360
 what's better in this image you can see 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.620
 a comparison of the three times 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.340
 first it is in order of departure first 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:47.310
 will be nintendo 3ds that included the new 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.310
 stylus included the new home button and for 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 course the 3d controller after is the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.040
 nintendo 3ds xl which is bigger what 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.840
 includes a much better game mode and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 the screen after developing the one that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.840
 then be to attempts of that that goes to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.160
 be like these last two but it's not going 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.489
 to include regulator therefore not 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.950
 there will be two or three of those the nintendo 3ds 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.720
 without three and is from the family of three 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.050
 it's so good 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.650
 what I wanted to tell you is also that I 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.190
 I see this as quite bad because the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.860
 3ds can include both in 3d and not 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.920
 include it because you lower the regulator and already 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.150
 you do not have 3d and I also wanted to talk to you 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.900
 about this new nintendo that the truth 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.140
 is that it's a little weird because you look 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.970
 Look, look, this is the image and I'm going to 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.460
 speak to them about the disposition of 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.430
 buttons because my god that is what 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:58.420
 demons look first are the buttons 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.330
 lry the buttons and xv that looks how 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.020
 They are located 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.050
 on the top screen in all my life 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.030
 I had not seen this or we always have 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.320
 played with the buttons down now 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.950
 because they put it up I do not know and look 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.859
 you control what you see and it is that this is 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.740
 as you imagine there or how are we going to 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.350
 catch is , if you buy Imagine 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.860
 I checked, I have two of that good 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.690
 although I have the 3ds and like lame 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.020
 so that I do not fall and 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.500
 also in some games, you have to 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.260
 use the one below or imagine 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.860
 you are that you have to use the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.020
 stylus and buttons or the style use 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.240
 the tactile stick of all life that is 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.229
 how 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:55.039
 as you do it is also impossible that 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:57.580
 at the bottom is the home menu 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:02.349
 who have included it 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:05.080
 and also what is good what 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.020
 that always the power button that's there 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.620
 in a little way the micro that I have not 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.300
 pointed out but this is seen there if you look 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.460
 if there is this time the micro is there 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.940
 the micro is there 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.550
 If you are fine, I do not know how 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.729
 old ones like the old ones where 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.949
 I had not even the micro there in the little screen and 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.650
 then they have included the buttons 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:35.180
 sharp and select that have turned them into 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.710
 buttons again you do not know why 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.919
 good and because it has screwed us so much 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:45.949
 it does not include anything new that is 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:50.509
 ok is a compact nintendo is a 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:53.300
 new but I do not know whether it's also the 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:56.539
 nintendo ds is going to cost I think 30 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.850
 euros less I do not know how there is of this 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.820
 but I know it's worth a few euros less 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.490
 there are attempts and he says 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.860
 and well, it does not include any 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.140
 novelty I would have liked that 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.140
 first I would have left nintendo dsi 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.500
 then the 3ds because it would have been like that 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:17.230
 how is it worth the console can play 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.430
 then of try and games of nintendo 3ds 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:24.280
 but it does not have 3d and then day and good 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.440
 this has been months later we take out the 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.750
 new nintendo 3ds these are included 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.960
 3d option and we would have all been 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:36.850
 like oh god hate me 3d but I do not know or 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:39.460
 in 13 you can regulate 3d mode 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:42.880
 and you can play unfair try games 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:46.270
 and nintendo ds or is worth about 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:49.950
 euros less but it has not convinced me 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:55.030
 I was in nintendo I think not 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:59.610
 They have annoyed her a lot so good 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:03.220
 I'm going to do as well as a trend 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:06.040
 that you do not know if this is still going to be 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:10.450
 the most is but if it's going to be the 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.730
 Nintendo will have many many complaints 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:16.390
 and will also have very few sales of 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.310
 is nintendo 3d 2d that forgiveness that is 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:22.230
 included in the family of the none 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:25.340
 3ds and well then up to here the criticism 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:29.490
 I want to tell you that 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:33.480
 it's okay it 's nintendo but it's your 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:35.700
 arrangement is somewhat rare and in addition though 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.880
 be compact I did not like it 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.370
 because I do not know does not include any news 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.400
 that is, it is a thesis opening interest 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:48.180
 3d will be so regular so good me 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.550
 I would prefer to buy a 3ds that I can 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:54.480
 say good I do not want three of quito in 

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.540
 3d I want in 3d I put it to buy 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.930
 the one on the side of that that does not include 

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:04.620
 the 3d mode so good up here is 

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:07.710
 it lasts me and give me a like also favorites 

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:10.430
 and we'll see you in the next video 

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.430
 goodbye
