00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello friends in this video I want 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
 give some practical advice as 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.889
 improve your gait the thing is that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.900
 gait talks a lot about man and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 when we see a man who is easy 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 It seems to us that yes it is probably 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.590
 very easy pleasant person to communicate 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.039
 and when we see the cargo coming 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 such a heavy human we have a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 feeling that life is probably very 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 heavy somehow not really want him 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.960
 communicate and therefore it is very important how we 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.370
 we walk in a famous song I'm sweet 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.980
 learn by gait 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.079
 well actually there are certain 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 views even on gait 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.910
 with different diseases but today I 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.700
 I won't say that there 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.079
 let's say 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.180
 gait duck with dysplasia 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.789
 hip but today we don't 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.129
 about it today we are about healthy people 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.109
 those who want to improve their walk and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.859
 who wants to make it part of his 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.409
 image and in my trainings I give 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.490
 some exercises that people then 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.990
 perform i'm filming this on camera and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.810
 then show the person from the side 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.610
 he looks like sometimes people very much 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.820
 surprised they think they are completely 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 walk differently and so in order to 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.990
 walk well above all you must 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 be vertical axis straight that is it 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.189
 should not break 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 there should not be such that for example legs 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.790
 you lag behind your body goes forward 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.509
 or vice versa, legs forward and torso 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.490
 lag behind for this you can mentally 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.439
 hold this axis from one head to 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.420
 straight down to the floor down that is to say 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.610
 spine and down and so here when you 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.580
 go straight to try it feel 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.510
 straight or 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.640
 such 3 is the easiest of course to ask 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.740
 someone to shoot you on video and then you 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.250
 just look exactly not face 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 shoot in profile as you go 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.720
 but if this is not possible, not all 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.899
 there is a camera not everyone has friends with 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.910
 cameras then you can do 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.340
 otherwise there is a personal easy way 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.860
 how to determine and if you let it 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 straight whether she you take the book yes 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.020
 heavier and put it to your advantage I 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.600
 About this method told format 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.280
 posture formation video 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.120
 gait formation is the same exercise 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.190
 only you will not become exactly a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.880
 try to go with this book 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.160
 unless your axis is straight a 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.290
 somewhere a curved book will fall right there 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.830
 it will be a symptom of what you start 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.410
 engage your and align your 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.209
 his posture align his torso 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.910
 if you have some time after c 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.770
 first get to walk right with the book 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.660
 on the head then you can go to 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.670
 the next step is only concerned 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.920
 women first both for men and for 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.650
 women and the second so only for women 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.269
 you can find bring your own 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.940
 the most favorite shoes there are boots that 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.959
 want high heels on the platform 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.300
 at night what you wear and shoes and 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.190
 try to have them like just 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.390
 same with a book on his head because it happens 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.980
 so that girl and this is stylish beautiful 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.959
 it seems to be right 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.700
 or when if pompously right 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.360
 okay but as soon as it happens 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.790
 heels, I think you have encountered yet it 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.650
 starts somehow strangely crooked in his side 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.860
 some sort or forward or backward 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.480
 This is a very important moment too. 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.019
 do you know how to walk on 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.590
 heels 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.530
 it's such a first main 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.150
 how would this this and diagnostics how are you 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.110
 walk correctly and learning and second 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:59.819
 very important rule is that we are each 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:03.470
 us man is not just organs and 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.450
 Systems that rely on our legs and 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.599
 we have a very strong good 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.269
 the muscular system and every muscle has 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.769
 right to keep myself 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.060
 and not fall to the underlying departments this 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.790
 it is probably easier to understand and feel 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.380
 those people who play sports 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.840
 fitness to those who are not 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.970
 deal harder to understand well i think everything 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.930
 equally possible but imagine 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.600
 your neck she should not and head not 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.479
 should press down on the shoulders 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.350
 she should strive up she should 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:44.190
 feel that with every muscle of itself 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.500
 holds on shoulder girdle muscles of the chest 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.440
 and the back muscles all these muscles too 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.440
 able to behave and not pressure on 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.990
 Atas on the abdominal muscles of the lumbar 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:05:00.630
 the pelvic muscle department all these muscles they too 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.620
 self- sufficiently they are heavy 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.930
 settle to their feet 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.030
 what then turns out if they are heavy 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.169
 settle on gait legs so obtained 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.630
 each step seemed to have driven in to go out 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.539
 minted earth and as if you are something 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:19.289
 you want to prove it creates a feeling 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:21.599
 heavy man on the leg muscles muscles 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.270
 thighs and muscles aches they too 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.750
 can not put pressure on the ground but just themselves 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.960
 support yourself if you feel this 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.240
 catch 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.370
 then you will feel as if you are 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.490
 don't go about practically flying ie you 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.669
 do not press to take 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.160
 come off no wonder fly but i 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.849
 I think that you certainly do not soar 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.970
 not less 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:46.539
 feeling light walk you will feel 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:48.789
 and one more tip is very simple if you 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:52.300
 go in athletic shoes this 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:54.550
 wonderful modern sneakers 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.069
 stocked with such a nice shock absorbing 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.490
 Sole this adidas and nike this 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:03.360
 here is this firm very good sole maan 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.370
 amortizes you sort of make a start from 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.000
 earth spring and turn springy 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.199
 gait 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.050
 if you enter some marks there 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:20.669
 shoes then put on a visit to the successful 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.659
 shock absorber not only with the calculation of the arches 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.669
 longitudinal and transverse and yet 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.099
 residual shock absorber helps a lot 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.680
 shaping gait if you wear 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.330
 Shoes with a heel that is such 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.970
 special semi insoles for shoes with 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.949
 heel they are not so cushioning already 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.289
 of course but nevertheless it is also 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:41.740
 helps to achieve a good gait but also 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:43.479
 very important rule that is definitely worth it 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.750
 comply or if you want to have 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:48.699
 good gait this shoes should be 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.469
 spacious it should not be close 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.330
 if you close any shoes 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:54.370
 tricks will not help not formed 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.020
 good walk about should be 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:00.229
 free leather better over 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.120
 sick and you should not be comfortable and 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.009
 comfortable in my sophia lore is 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.889
 said that the dress should be on 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:09.199
 size smaller than necessary and shoes size 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.840
 more than you need to subscribe to each 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:14.900
 her word I because it is really 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.789
 so a good one is formed 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.919
 beautiful gait but that's what 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:20.569
 regarding women about clothes and for 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:22.789
 men clothes should be just 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:26.120
 size and shoes are still better 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:28.039
 it was quite spacious thank you 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.479
 for your attention there was a doctor psychologist 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.490
 Tatyana Mikhailovna Khava if you 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:33.949
 interesting similar plots subscribe 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.690
 on my channel I will be very happy and on my 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.940
 the channel is really a lot of different 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.370
 plots and on the topic of psychology and on topics 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.120
 medicine and on the topic of their combination 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.120
 thanks again
