could<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.930> shipping<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.710> less<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
could do this shipping for that less so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.569 
could do this shipping for that less so
unfortunately<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.530> connectors<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.340> came

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
unfortunately the connectors that came

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.230 
unfortunately the connectors that came
with<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:43.640> controller<00:01:44.640> didn't<00:01:45.060> work<00:01:45.210> for

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
with the this controller didn't work for

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
with the this controller didn't work for
me<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.829> backward<00:01:47.189> engineer

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
me so I had a kind of backward engineer

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.870 
me so I had a kind of backward engineer
find<00:01:48.000> out<00:01:48.240> where<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.220> where<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
find out where the you know where I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.460 
find out where the you know where I
needed<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> basically<00:01:51.390> turn<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
needed to basically turn the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.440 
needed to basically turn the
potentiometer<00:01:52.790> yeah<00:01:53.790> basically<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
potentiometer yeah basically when you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.810 
potentiometer yeah basically when you
turn<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> way<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.369> high

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
turn it all the way up when it's on high

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.569 
turn it all the way up when it's on high
it's<00:01:57.119> basically<00:01:57.570> creates<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.899> short<00:01:58.460> but<00:01:59.460> when

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
it's basically creates a short but when

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.600 
it's basically creates a short but when
you<00:01:59.640> turn<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.180> low<00:02:00.509> position<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.740> adds<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.520> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you turn it to low position it adds in a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
you turn it to low position it adds in a
hundred<00:02:02.909> ohms<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.450> resistance<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.500> basically

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
hundred ohms of resistance so basically

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
hundred ohms of resistance so basically
you<00:02:05.759> don't<00:02:05.790> even<00:02:06.060> need<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> buy<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> controller

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you don't even need to buy a controller

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.630 
you don't even need to buy a controller
you<00:02:07.079> could<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.469> go<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.740> buy<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.459> know

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you could just go out and buy a you know

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.790 
you could just go out and buy a you know
a<00:02:08.879> few<00:02:09.360> pennies<00:02:09.720> would<00:02:10.020> cost<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.560> buy<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
a few pennies would cost you to buy a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.490 
a few pennies would cost you to buy a
hundred<00:02:11.190> ohm<00:02:11.900> resistor<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> just

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
hundred ohm resistor and just

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
hundred ohm resistor and just
run<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.010> series<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.180> high-lead

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
run it in series with the high-lead

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.050 
run it in series with the high-lead
going<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.800> fan<00:02:17.010> from<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> power<00:02:17.670> supply

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
going to the fan from the power supply

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.390 
going to the fan from the power supply
on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.330> card<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.320> should<00:02:19.530> work<00:02:19.710> so

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
on the card and that should work so

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.430 
on the card and that should work so
basically<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.820> decided<00:02:21.210> up<00:02:21.420> before<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> did<00:02:22.200> that

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
basically I decided up before I did that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.800 
basically I decided up before I did that
I<00:02:22.710> had<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.400> test<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.090> find<00:02:24.330> out<00:02:24.480> where<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
I had to test to find out where the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.930 
I had to test to find out where the
temperature<00:02:25.230> would<00:02:25.380> be<00:02:25.620> when<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.580> was<00:02:26.730> running

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
temperature would be when it was running

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.520 
temperature would be when it was running
at<00:02:27.180> full<00:02:27.390> because<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.780> fan<00:02:27.990> was<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.350> running

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
at full because the fan was just running

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.790 
at full because the fan was just running
as<00:02:28.740> high<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> could<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.800> tried

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
as high as it could and so I tried

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.490 
as high as it could and so I tried
YouTube<00:02:32.220> videos<00:02:32.850> Vimeo<00:02:33.540> videos<00:02:33.900> -<00:02:34.080> high<00:02:34.260> def

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
YouTube videos Vimeo videos - high def

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.990 
YouTube videos Vimeo videos - high def
fullscreen<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.400> everything<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.880> was

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
fullscreen and everything and I was

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.900 
fullscreen and everything and I was
watching<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.390> temperature<00:02:36.810> rise<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.400> GPU

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
watching the temperature rise on the GPU

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.280 
watching the temperature rise on the GPU
and<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.750> would<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.990> know<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.140> hit<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:40.800> 50

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
and it would you know like hit like 50

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.530 
and it would you know like hit like 50
degrees<00:02:43.290> centigrade<00:02:43.730> 55<00:02:44.730> degrees<00:02:45.090> centigrade

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
degrees centigrade 55 degrees centigrade

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.330 
degrees centigrade 55 degrees centigrade
and<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:46.260> wasn't<00:02:46.410> really<00:02:46.680> working<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.100> super

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
and it wasn't really working it's super

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.949 
and it wasn't really working it's super
hard<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.700> then<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:47.940> went<00:02:48.150> into<00:02:48.270> premiere<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.900> I

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
hard and then I went into premiere and I

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.240 
hard and then I went into premiere and I
was<00:02:49.080> like<00:02:49.200> well<00:02:49.380> this<00:02:49.590> should<00:02:49.770> work<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.040> really

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
was like well this should work it really

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.430 
was like well this should work it really
hard<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.630> did<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:52.080> brought<00:02:52.320> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
hard and and it did it brought the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.820 
hard and and it did it brought the
temperature<00:02:52.770> up<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.950> about<00:02:53.570> 63<00:02:54.570> degrees<00:02:55.020> now

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
temperature up to about 63 degrees now

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.530 
temperature up to about 63 degrees now
here's<00:02:56.130> something<00:02:56.550> really<00:02:56.850> interesting<00:02:57.180> was

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
here's something really interesting was

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.220 
here's something really interesting was
when<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:58.709> had<00:02:58.980> like<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> yellow<00:03:00.060> line<00:03:00.300> but<00:03:01.140> you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
when you had like a yellow line but you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.730 
when you had like a yellow line but you
didn't<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.590> render<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.160> in<00:03:02.550> Premiere<00:03:03.150> and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
didn't have to render it in Premiere and

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.040 
didn't have to render it in Premiere and
the<00:03:04.740> temperature<00:03:05.520> went<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.300> 63<00:03:07.020> degrees

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
the temperature went up to 63 degrees

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.010 
the temperature went up to 63 degrees
and<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.800> was<00:03:07.920> using<00:03:08.400> 40%<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:11.000> GPU<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.840> was

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
and it was using 40% of the GPU that was

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.660 
and it was using 40% of the GPU that was
really<00:03:13.260> interesting<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.860> when<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.040> added<00:03:14.610> a

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
really interesting is when I added a

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.090 
really interesting is when I added a
bunch<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.030> effects<00:03:16.020> on<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> already<00:03:16.980> had

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
bunch of effects on there I already had

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.860 
bunch of effects on there I already had
effects<00:03:17.430> but<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> added<00:03:17.910> more<00:03:18.269> effects<00:03:18.660> on

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
effects but I added more effects on

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.250 
effects but I added more effects on
there<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.830> were<00:03:20.100> not<00:03:20.450> GPU<00:03:23.030> capable<00:03:24.260> meaning

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
there that were not GPU capable meaning

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.190 
there that were not GPU capable meaning
it<00:03:25.500> turned<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.890> line<00:03:26.190> red<00:03:26.580> when<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.570> ran<00:03:27.900> that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it turned the line red when I ran that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.350 
it turned the line red when I ran that
test<00:03:28.260> again<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.459> temperature<00:03:29.670> kind<00:03:30.239> of

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
test again the temperature kind of

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.380 
test again the temperature kind of
decreased<00:03:30.870> slightly<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.489> GPU<00:03:33.120> usage

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
decreased slightly and the GPU usage

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.020 
decreased slightly and the GPU usage
went<00:03:33.870> down<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.230> 8%<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.950> was<00:03:35.040> like<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.760> kind<00:03:35.940> of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
went down to 8% it was like that kind of

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.250 
went down to 8% it was like that kind of
totally<00:03:36.269> didn't<00:03:36.480> make<00:03:36.600> sense<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.989> was<00:03:37.080> like

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
totally didn't make sense it was like

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.009 
totally didn't make sense it was like
the<00:03:37.860> GPU<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.519> gave<00:03:38.670> up<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.030> said<00:03:39.180> hey<00:03:39.330> CPU

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
the GPU just gave up and said hey CPU

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.530 
the GPU just gave up and said hey CPU
you<00:03:40.260> take<00:03:40.470> care<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.769> everything<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.510> so<00:03:42.510> that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you take care of everything and so that

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.259 
you take care of everything and so that
was<00:03:42.780> kind<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.110> interesting<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:44.209> after<00:03:45.209> I

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
was kind of interesting so after I

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.110 
was kind of interesting so after I
installed<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.500> ran<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.670> turned<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.030> all

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
installed it I ran that I turned it all

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.990 
installed it I ran that I turned it all
the<00:03:48.209> way<00:03:48.299> down<00:03:48.420> below<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.470> fan<00:03:49.709> noise

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
the way down below and the fan noise

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.360 
the way down below and the fan noise
pretty<00:03:51.000> much<00:03:51.180> went<00:03:51.420> away<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:52.709> matched<00:03:53.040> all<00:03:53.340> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
pretty much went away it matched all the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.640 
pretty much went away it matched all the
other<00:03:53.580> fans<00:03:53.850> inside<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.690> case<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.590> don't

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
other fans inside the case and I don't

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.840 
other fans inside the case and I don't
know<00:03:55.799> if<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.920> can<00:03:55.980> hear<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.549> let<00:03:56.760> me

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
know if you can hear this but let me

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.759 
know if you can hear this but let me
I'll<00:03:56.970> cut<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.540> right<00:03:57.690> now<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.650> can

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
I'll cut to it right now and you can

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.870 
I'll cut to it right now and you can
hear<00:03:59.010> me<00:03:59.130> turn<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.459> up<00:03:59.610> and<00:03:59.760> down

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.740 

[Music]

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.070 

so<00:04:12.590> basically<00:04:12.950> now<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.510> have<00:04:14.510> this<00:04:14.660> installed

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
so basically now I have this installed

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.020 
so basically now I have this installed
and<00:04:15.350> I<00:04:15.410> ran<00:04:15.740> that<00:04:15.890> same<00:04:16.160> test<00:04:16.489> with<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.880> yellow

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
and I ran that same test with the yellow

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.690 
and I ran that same test with the yellow
line<00:04:17.360> for<00:04:17.660> 30<00:04:18.350> minutes<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:18.980> just<00:04:19.070> let<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.459> run

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
line for 30 minutes I just let it run

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.080 
line for 30 minutes I just let it run
loop<00:04:20.180> over<00:04:20.480> this<00:04:20.600> one<00:04:20.810> video<00:04:21.019> on<00:04:21.170> playback<00:04:21.739> and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
loop over this one video on playback and

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.490 
loop over this one video on playback and
the<00:04:23.090> temperature<00:04:23.480> went<00:04:23.690> up<00:04:23.780> slightly<00:04:23.960> went<00:04:24.410> to

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
the temperature went up slightly went to

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.030 
the temperature went up slightly went to
66<00:04:25.130> degrees<00:04:25.460> centigrade<00:04:26.120> but<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.560> know<00:04:27.680> my

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
66 degrees centigrade but you know my

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.090 
66 degrees centigrade but you know my
fan<00:04:28.280> now<00:04:28.880> my<00:04:29.180> computer<00:04:29.630> is<00:04:29.840> really<00:04:30.470> really

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100
