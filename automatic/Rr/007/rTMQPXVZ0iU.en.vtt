today<00:00:00.930> we're<00:00:01.110> going<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.290> take<00:00:01.530> a<00:00:01.560> MIDI<00:00:01.979> file

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
today we're going to take a MIDI file

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.579 
today we're going to take a MIDI file
which<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> computer<00:00:03.959> file<00:00:04.200> that<00:00:04.470> has

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
which is a computer file that has

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.289 
which is a computer file that has
instructions<00:00:05.190> inside<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.970> would<00:00:06.089> make<00:00:06.270> a

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
instructions inside that would make a

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.720 
instructions inside that would make a
synthesizer<00:00:06.990> play<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.350> song<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.859> we're<00:00:08.610> going

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
synthesizer play a song and we're going

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.390 
synthesizer play a song and we're going
to<00:00:08.760> create<00:00:09.059> an<00:00:09.420> mp3<00:00:10.080> which<00:00:10.740> actually<00:00:11.219> has

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
to create an mp3 which actually has

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.549 
to create an mp3 which actually has
music<00:00:12.000> data<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.570> which<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.320> played<00:00:13.530> in

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
music data in it which can be played in

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.400 
music data in it which can be played in
an<00:00:13.799> iPod<00:00:14.719> which<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.870> kind<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> goal<00:00:16.379> here

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
an iPod which is kind of the goal here

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.200 
an iPod which is kind of the goal here
to<00:00:16.680> admit<00:00:16.890> make<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> MIDI<00:00:17.430> file<00:00:17.670> play<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.090> an

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
to admit make a MIDI file play in an

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.599 
to admit make a MIDI file play in an
iPod<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:19.590> let's<00:00:19.770> take<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.920> listen<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> MIDI

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
iPod first let's take a listen to a MIDI

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.269 
iPod first let's take a listen to a MIDI
file<00:00:24.350> so<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.410> probably<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.920> recognized

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
file so you probably have recognized

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
file so you probably have recognized
that<00:00:26.490> as<00:00:26.699> dancing<00:00:27.510> queen<00:00:27.720> by<00:00:28.019> ABBA

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that as dancing queen by ABBA

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.900 
that as dancing queen by ABBA
but<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.890> actually<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.340> synthesizer

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
but that was actually the synthesizer

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.429 
but that was actually the synthesizer
version<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.539> app<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.140> actually

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
version because app is not actually

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.780 
version because app is not actually
playing<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.510> so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:34.250> opened<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.550> in

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
playing that so I opened this up in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.729 
playing that so I opened this up in
QuickTime<00:00:36.390> Pro<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.860> gonna<00:00:38.010> export<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.940> as

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
QuickTime Pro and I'm gonna export it as

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.819 
QuickTime Pro and I'm gonna export it as
an<00:00:40.739> AI<00:00:40.950> FF<00:00:41.579> file<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.840> PC<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> may

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
an AI FF file if you're on a PC it may

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.569 
an AI FF file if you're on a PC it may
be<00:00:44.120> exporting<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> WAV<00:00:45.719> file<00:00:46.340> either<00:00:47.340> one

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
be exporting it as a WAV file either one

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.490 
be exporting it as a WAV file either one
of<00:00:47.610> those<00:00:47.760> file<00:00:48.030> formats<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:48.809> uncompressed

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
of those file formats are uncompressed

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.979 
of those file formats are uncompressed
so<00:00:50.190> they're<00:00:50.340> gonna<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.610> make<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.879> huge<00:00:51.480> music

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so they're gonna be make a huge music

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
so they're gonna be make a huge music
file<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.920> they're<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> huge<00:00:53.219> music<00:00:53.730> file<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
file but they're a huge music file that

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.240 
file but they're a huge music file that
will<00:00:54.210> play<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.629> iTunes<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.980> going<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
will play in iTunes but we're going to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.270 
will play in iTunes but we're going to
convert<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.570> second<00:00:57.989> into<00:00:58.920> an

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
convert that in just a second into an

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.209 
convert that in just a second into an
mp3<00:01:00.210> which<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> nice<00:01:01.020> small<00:01:01.350> file<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.100> you

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
large file we're going to convert it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
large file we're going to convert it
under<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> Advanced<00:01:24.330> tab<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.780> to

under the Advanced tab we're going to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.120 
under the Advanced tab we're going to
create<00:01:25.320> mp3<00:01:25.710> version<00:01:27.080> yours<00:01:28.080> may<00:01:28.320> say<00:01:28.619> convert

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
create mp3 version yours may say convert

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.480 
create mp3 version yours may say convert
to<00:01:29.280> AAC<00:01:30.049> that<00:01:31.049> works<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.860> well<00:01:32.040> both<00:01:32.280> of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
to AAC that works just as well both of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.090 
to AAC that works just as well both of
those<00:01:32.670> formats<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.960> small<00:01:34.350> files<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.979> they

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
those formats are small files and they

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.990 
those formats are small files and they
will<00:01:35.250> play<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.850> your<00:01:36.479> iPod<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> after<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> do

that you'll see you have two copies of
your<00:01:42.270> MIDI<00:01:42.720> file<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> right-click<00:01:44.250> on

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
your MIDI file if you right-click on

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.830 
your MIDI file if you right-click on
either<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.479> them

either one of them

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.620 
either one of them
they'll<00:01:46.020> show<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.100> your

they'll show them to you in your
directory<00:01:48.630> structure<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:50.340> erase<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.850> AIFF

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
directory structure just erase the AIFF

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.840 
directory structure just erase the AIFF
file<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> you're<00:01:53.009> left<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> mp3

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
