00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
quints I copied them already just to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.230 
quints I copied them already just to
make<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.990> bit<00:00:19.230> easier<00:00:19.550> I'll<00:00:20.550> include<00:00:21.119> them

for<00:00:25.439> demonstrating<00:00:26.099> purpose<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:27.029> into

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
for demonstrating purpose I will go into

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.890 
for demonstrating purpose I will go into
a<00:00:27.420> public<00:00:27.990> game<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:29.220> mean<00:00:29.699> those<00:00:30.000> almost<00:00:30.539> game

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
a public game I mean those almost game

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.620 
a public game I mean those almost game
because<00:00:31.289> public<00:00:31.710> takes<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.070> bit<00:00:32.250> longer<00:00:32.630> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because public takes a bit longer so

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
because public takes a bit longer so
yeah<00:00:33.750> let's<00:00:34.530> load<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> does<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
yeah let's load it up but it does it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170 
yeah let's load it up but it does it
removes<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.020> flesh<00:00:40.260> completely<00:00:41.180> sometimes

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
removes the flesh completely sometimes

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
removes the flesh completely sometimes
it<00:00:42.390> won't<00:00:42.510> work<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.379> got<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> like

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it won't work so you got a like

00:00:43.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
it won't work so you got a like
reconnect<00:01:03.650> just<00:01:04.650> enable<00:01:05.159> cheats

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.530 

just<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.290> repeating

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
just like that it's just a repeating

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.030 
just like that it's just a repeating
process<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.750> don't<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:22.140> why<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.409> works<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
process I don't know why it works the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.320 
process I don't know why it works the
one<00:01:23.130> time<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> time<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> doesn't

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
one time and all the time it doesn't

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:35.950 
one time and all the time it doesn't
it's<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.350> annoying

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:44.630 

ya<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.320> like<00:01:37.680> no<00:01:38.160> flesh<00:01:43.340> I'll<00:01:44.340> show<00:01:44.580> you

one<00:01:59.460> try<00:01:59.729> not<00:02:00.060> sure<00:02:00.590> let's<00:02:01.590> try<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
one try not sure let's try that what it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.030 
one try not sure let's try that what it
does<00:02:02.940> is<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.479> makes<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.900> smoke<00:02:04.229> Hollow<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
does is it makes the smoke Hollow so you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.810 
does is it makes the smoke Hollow so you
can<00:02:05.190> see<00:02:05.370> through<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:07.340> there's<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> stand

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
can see through it there's one you stand

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.210 
can see through it there's one you stand
in<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> gets<00:02:09.479> great<00:02:09.709> it<00:02:10.709> gets<00:02:10.979> great

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
in it it gets great it gets great

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.310 
in it it gets great it gets great
because<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.730> don't<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> material<00:02:12.420> files
