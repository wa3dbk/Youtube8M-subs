00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.270 

let's<00:00:10.780> take<00:00:11.019> a<00:00:11.049> look<00:00:11.230> now<00:00:11.290> at<00:00:11.710> how<00:00:11.740> we<00:00:11.980> would

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
let's take a look now at how we would

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.609 
let's take a look now at how we would
create<00:00:12.549> an<00:00:12.849> in-camera<00:00:13.719> depth<00:00:14.289> of<00:00:14.440> field

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:14.619 
create an in-camera depth of field

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
that option and of course we do want to

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.590 
that option and of course we do want to

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
moment in time but we're going to want

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.380 
moment in time but we're going to want
to<00:00:38.320> change<00:00:38.470> that<00:00:38.680> and<00:00:38.890> essentially<00:00:39.730> return<00:00:40.239> it

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
to change that and essentially return it

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.209 
to change that and essentially return it
to<00:00:40.510> its<00:00:40.540> original<00:00:40.750> state<00:00:41.199> which<00:00:41.680> was<00:00:41.950> just

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
to its original state which was just

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.729 
to its original state which was just
that<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:42.700> a<00:00:43.000> standard<00:00:43.450> Maya<00:00:43.840> camera<00:00:44.350> well

that of a standard Maya camera well
there<00:00:44.950> are<00:00:45.070> a<00:00:45.100> couple<00:00:45.399> of<00:00:45.550> ways<00:00:45.789> we<00:00:46.270> could<00:00:46.629> do

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
there are a couple of ways we could do

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.350 
there are a couple of ways we could do
this<00:00:46.989> inside<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.739> our<00:00:47.949> extra<00:00:48.489> v-ray<00:00:48.820> attribute

rollout<00:00:49.750> we<00:00:50.170> could<00:00:50.379> just<00:00:50.530> uncheck<00:00:51.010> the<00:00:51.219> treat

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
rollout we could just uncheck the treat

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.029 
rollout we could just uncheck the treat
as<00:00:51.850> v-ray<00:00:52.420> physical<00:00:52.629> camera<00:00:52.899> option<00:00:53.559> if<00:00:53.770> we

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
as v-ray physical camera option if we

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
were going to come back to it if we want

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.450 
were going to come back to it if we want

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
bit of a problem in that we have now

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.180 
bit of a problem in that we have now

killed our exposure control mechanism we

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.650 
killed our exposure control mechanism we
were<00:01:12.340> compensating<00:01:13.119> for<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.450> lighting

to<00:01:42.759> make<00:01:42.850> some<00:01:43.060> changes<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.840> make<00:01:43.990> our

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
to make some changes to make our

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.800 
to make some changes to make our
lighting<00:01:44.890> levels<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.369> little<00:01:45.729> more<00:01:45.880> acceptable

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
lighting levels a little more acceptable

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.440 
lighting levels a little more acceptable
so<00:01:47.259> let's<00:01:47.439> come<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:47.979> our<00:01:48.189> window<00:01:48.700> menu<00:01:48.909> let's

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
so let's come to our window menu let's

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.630 
so let's come to our window menu let's
come<00:01:49.689> down<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.320> open<00:01:50.799> up<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.009> outliner<00:01:51.430> for

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
come down and open up the outliner for

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.249 
come down and open up the outliner for
ourselves<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:52.180> course<00:01:52.420> make<00:01:52.659> certain<00:01:52.899> that

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
ourselves of course make certain that

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.080 
ourselves of course make certain that
you<00:01:53.350> are<00:01:53.380> filtering<00:01:53.950> by<00:01:54.100> lights<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:54.700> light

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
you are filtering by lights and light

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.090 
you are filtering by lights and light
sets<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.689> you<00:01:55.990> should<00:01:56.200> see<00:01:56.380> all<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.860> light

render<00:02:17.320> we<00:02:17.410> would<00:02:17.560> get<00:02:17.739> you<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.340> see<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.579> have

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
render we would get you can see we have

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.340 
render we would get you can see we have
a<00:02:18.760> much<00:02:19.000> more<00:02:19.030> acceptable<00:02:19.840> level<00:02:20.230> of

a much more acceptable level of
illumination<00:02:21.130> in<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.609> scene<00:02:21.790> what

illumination in the scene what

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.380 
illumination in the scene what
to<00:02:22.989> do<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:23.319> of<00:02:23.590> course<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:24.069> enable<00:02:24.730> our<00:02:25.030> depth

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
to do now of course is enable our depth

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.240 
to do now of course is enable our depth
of<00:02:25.569> field<00:02:25.750> effect<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.800> want<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.069> pull<00:02:27.220> up

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
of field effect so we want to pull up

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.100 
of field effect so we want to pull up
our<00:02:27.459> render<00:02:28.000> settings<00:02:28.030> window<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.780> let's<00:02:28.930> use

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
our render settings window so let's use

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.140 
our render settings window so let's use
the<00:02:29.260> icon<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.890> toolbar<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.940> for

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the icon on the toolbar to do that for

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.870 
the icon on the toolbar to do that for
ourselves<00:02:31.270> into<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.380> v-ray<00:02:32.650> tab<00:02:32.890> let's<00:02:33.550> close

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
ourselves into the v-ray tab let's close

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.760 
ourselves into the v-ray tab let's close
up<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.209> image<00:02:34.510> sampler<00:02:34.870> rollout<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.410> come

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
up the image sampler rollout and come

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.910 
up the image sampler rollout and come
instead<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.580> our<00:02:36.880> camera<00:02:37.480> roll<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:38.590> here

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
instead to our camera roll out in here

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.160 
instead to our camera roll out in here
you<00:02:39.130> can<00:02:39.280> see<00:02:39.310> we<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.970> number<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.300> camera

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
you can see we have a number of camera

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.199 
you can see we have a number of camera
effect<00:02:41.560> options<00:02:42.040> one<00:02:42.220> of<00:02:42.250> which<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.700> depth<00:02:43.060> of

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
effect options one of which is depth of

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.390 
effect options one of which is depth of
field<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.690> if<00:02:44.110> we<00:02:44.230> just<00:02:44.380> put<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.769> check<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.280> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
field so if we just put a check in the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.240 
field so if we just put a check in the
unbox<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.420> system<00:02:46.900> now<00:02:47.200> becomes<00:02:47.590> active<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
unbox that system now becomes active and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.670 
unbox that system now becomes active and
the<00:02:48.430> parameters<00:02:48.940> are<00:02:49.120> available<00:02:49.900> for<00:02:50.230> editing

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the parameters are available for editing

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.860 
the parameters are available for editing
three<00:02:51.459> particular<00:02:51.760> parameters<00:02:52.360> are<00:02:52.540> of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
three particular parameters are of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.199 
three particular parameters are of
greatest<00:02:53.470> interest<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.280> us<00:02:54.459> first<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:54.910> all<00:02:54.970> the

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
greatest interest to us first of all the

greatest interest to us first of all the
aperture<00:02:55.720> setting<00:02:56.019> this<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.920> equivalent

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
aperture setting this is the equivalent

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.090 
aperture setting this is the equivalent
of<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:58.090> f-stop<00:02:58.630> in<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:59.290> real<00:02:59.500> camera<00:02:59.860> or<00:03:00.010> the

the values in this aperture setting we

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.350 
the values in this aperture setting we
will<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.830> smaller<00:03:09.190> aperture<00:03:09.549> if<00:03:10.180> we

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
will get a smaller aperture if we

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.030 
will get a smaller aperture if we
increase<00:03:10.630> them<00:03:10.840> we<00:03:11.140> will<00:03:11.290> get<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.590> larger

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
increase them we will get a larger

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.620 
increase them we will get a larger
aperture<00:03:12.220> that<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.700> course<00:03:12.849> is<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.209> opposite

working in scene unit so we're working

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.650 
working in scene unit so we're working
at<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.440> centimeter<00:03:24.280> value<00:03:24.519> here<00:03:25.090> so<00:03:25.299> whatever

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
at a centimeter value here so whatever

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.099 
perspective viewport this value is set
that<00:03:30.430> is<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.640> focal<00:03:31.150> point<00:03:31.180> for<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.900> scene

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
that is the focal point for the scene

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.590 
that is the focal point for the scene
and<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:33.040> course<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.370> have<00:03:33.549> our<00:03:33.760> subdivs<00:03:34.269> value

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
and of course we have our subdivs value

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.500 
and of course we have our subdivs value
that<00:03:34.870> will<00:03:35.109> work<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.799> control<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.579> quality<00:03:36.970> of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
that will work to control the quality of

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.210 
that will work to control the quality of
our<00:03:37.750> final<00:03:38.230> depth<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.560> field<00:03:38.739> effect<00:03:39.069> of

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
our final depth of field effect of

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.710 
our final depth of field effect of
course<00:03:39.370> working<00:03:39.640> along<00:03:40.030> with<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.329> image

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
course working along with the image

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.800 
course working along with the image
sampling<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.829> MC<00:03:41.950> sampler<00:03:42.549> controls<00:03:42.970> so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
sampling and the MC sampler controls so

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.449 
sampling and the MC sampler controls so
let's<00:03:44.109> work<00:03:44.290> with<00:03:44.500> some<00:03:44.680> settings<00:03:45.010> and<00:03:45.220> see

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
let's work with some settings and see

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.250 
let's work with some settings and see
what<00:03:45.609> kind<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.910> effect<00:03:46.269> we<00:03:46.569> can<00:03:46.600> get<00:03:46.959> using

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
what kind of effect we can get using

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.170 
what kind of effect we can get using
this<00:03:47.500> system<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.130> I'll<00:03:48.250> just<00:03:48.459> set<00:03:48.609> an<00:03:48.819> aperture

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
this system so I'll just set an aperture

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.270 
this system so I'll just set an aperture
setting<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.720> one<00:03:50.590> centimeter

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
setting of one centimeter

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240 
setting of one centimeter
we'll<00:03:51.940> set<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.299> focus<00:03:52.569> distance<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.410> 40

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
we'll set a focus distance of 40

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.979 
we'll set a focus distance of 40
centimeters<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.000> we're<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.569> going<00:03:55.750> to<00:03:55.810> set

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
centimeters and we're just going to set

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.710 
centimeters and we're just going to set
a<00:03:56.139> subdivisions<00:03:56.739> parameter<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.430> 12<00:03:58.150> in<00:03:58.450> there

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
a subdivisions parameter of 12 in there

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.360 
a subdivisions parameter of 12 in there
just<00:03:58.870> so<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.230> we<00:03:59.350> can<00:03:59.560> get<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.889> little<00:04:00.069> bit<00:04:00.220> of

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
just so that we can get a little bit of

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.940 
just so that we can get a little bit of
quality<00:04:00.760> out<00:04:01.209> of<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.690> system<00:04:02.049> with<00:04:02.709> those

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
quality out of the system with those

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.099 
quality out of the system with those
settings<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.549> there<00:04:03.819> we<00:04:04.060> would<00:04:04.239> get<00:04:04.420> this

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
settings in there we would get this

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.349 
settings in there we would get this
depth<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.739> field<00:04:05.920> effect<00:04:06.250> for<00:04:06.430> ourselves<00:04:06.519> so

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
depth of field effect for ourselves so

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.539 
depth of field effect for ourselves so
as<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.720> can<00:04:07.840> see<00:04:07.900> we<00:04:08.319> have<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.799> very<00:04:08.950> nice<00:04:09.220> depth

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
as you can see we have a very nice depth

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.490 
as you can see we have a very nice depth
of<00:04:09.670> field<00:04:09.850> effect<00:04:10.090> very<00:04:10.269> narrow<00:04:10.540> as<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:11.139> go<00:04:11.260> up

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
of field effect very narrow as we go up

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.050 
of field effect very narrow as we go up
towards<00:04:11.799> this<00:04:11.950> yellow<00:04:12.130> ball<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.579> is<00:04:12.880> out<00:04:13.030> of

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
towards this yellow ball it is out of

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.569 
towards this yellow ball it is out of
focus<00:04:13.299> our<00:04:13.690> first<00:04:14.230> row<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.650> pool<00:04:15.160> balls<00:04:15.340> are

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
focus our first row of pool balls are

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.979 
focus our first row of pool balls are
coming<00:04:15.700> back<00:04:15.970> towards<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.510> camera<00:04:16.780> out<00:04:16.959> of

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
coming back towards the camera out of

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.170 
coming back towards the camera out of
focus<00:04:17.440> but<00:04:17.889> we<00:04:17.950> can<00:04:18.280> see<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.820> effect<00:04:19.060> is

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
focus but we can see that the effect is

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.390 
focus but we can see that the effect is
working<00:04:19.630> cleanly<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.169> nicely<00:04:20.799> in<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.190> scene

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
working cleanly and nicely in the scene

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.670 
working cleanly and nicely in the scene
for<00:04:21.669> us<00:04:21.700> what<00:04:22.630> though<00:04:22.810> if<00:04:23.050> we<00:04:23.200> wanted<00:04:23.500> to

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
for us what though if we wanted to

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.070 
for us what though if we wanted to
change<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.250> focal<00:04:24.639> point<00:04:24.880> in<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.419> scene<00:04:25.630> well

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
change the focal point in the scene well

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.719 
change the focal point in the scene well
again<00:04:26.440> we<00:04:26.650> just<00:04:26.770> need<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.070> work<00:04:27.250> with<00:04:27.490> our

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
again we just need to work with our

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.969 
again we just need to work with our
focus<00:04:28.270> distance<00:04:28.510> parameter<00:04:29.169> so<00:04:29.470> this<00:04:29.680> time<00:04:29.860> if

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
focus distance parameter so this time if

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.460 
focus distance parameter so this time if
I<00:04:30.070> set<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.430> value<00:04:30.460> of<00:04:30.909> 115<00:04:31.720> centimeters<00:04:32.349> in

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
I set the value of 115 centimeters in

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.980 
I set the value of 115 centimeters in
here<00:04:32.650> we<00:04:33.099> would<00:04:33.250> go<00:04:33.400> from<00:04:33.700> this<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.270> this

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
here we would go from this to this

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.080 
here we would go from this to this
render<00:04:35.470> which

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
render which

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.790 
render which
you<00:04:36.180> can<00:04:36.300> see<00:04:36.449> changes<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.290> point<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.650> focus

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
you can see changes the point of focus

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.830 
you can see changes the point of focus
towards<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.639> top<00:04:38.880> of<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.330> table

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
towards the top of the table

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.689 
towards the top of the table
you<00:04:40.380> may<00:04:40.560> notice<00:04:40.800> though<00:04:41.100> that<00:04:41.370> we<00:04:41.460> have

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
you may notice though that we have

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.879 
you may notice though that we have
deepened<00:04:42.240> our<00:04:42.419> depth<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.960> field<00:04:43.139> effect<00:04:43.470> as<00:04:43.650> we

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
deepened our depth of field effect as we

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.469 
deepened our depth of field effect as we
have<00:04:44.040> shifted<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.520> focus<00:04:44.550> if<00:04:45.030> we<00:04:45.210> want<00:04:45.419> to

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
have shifted the focus if we want to

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.030 
have shifted the focus if we want to
recreate<00:04:46.050> a<00:04:46.199> shallower<00:04:46.650> depth<00:04:46.889> of<00:04:46.979> field

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
recreate a shallower depth of field

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.890 
recreate a shallower depth of field
effect<00:04:47.520> or<00:04:47.699> put<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.060> top<00:04:48.300> end<00:04:48.479> of<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.690> table

we<00:04:49.350> may<00:04:49.470> have<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.710> adjust<00:04:49.889> our<00:04:50.310> aperture

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
we may have to adjust our aperture

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.129 
we may have to adjust our aperture
settings<00:04:51.240> as<00:04:51.570> well

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
settings as well

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.439 
settings as well
okay<00:04:52.710> what<00:04:52.830> about<00:04:52.919> finally<00:04:53.400> increasing<00:04:54.180> the

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.110 
work with this aperture control in fact
what<00:05:01.530> we<00:05:01.590> will<00:05:01.680> do<00:05:01.860> is<00:05:02.160> we<00:05:02.370> will<00:05:02.400> double<00:05:02.880> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
what we will do is we will double the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.879 
what we will do is we will double the
value<00:05:03.270> in<00:05:03.630> here<00:05:03.840> from<00:05:04.110> one<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.710> two

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
value in here from one to two

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.520 
value in here from one to two
centimeters<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.669> we<00:05:05.970> would<00:05:06.120> go<00:05:06.270> from<00:05:06.419> this<00:05:06.660> to

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
centimeters and we would go from this to

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.590 
centimeters and we would go from this to
this<00:05:07.740> which<00:05:08.310> as<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.700> can<00:05:08.850> clearly<00:05:08.970> see<00:05:09.180> is<00:05:09.540> a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
this which as you can clearly see is a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.530 
this which as you can clearly see is a
greatly<00:05:10.020> increased<00:05:10.350> blur<00:05:11.190> effect<00:05:11.639> you<00:05:12.360> may

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
greatly increased blur effect you may

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.210 
greatly increased blur effect you may
also<00:05:12.690> notice<00:05:13.050> that<00:05:13.380> there<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.740> lot<00:05:14.040> more

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
also notice that there is a lot more

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.940 
also notice that there is a lot more
grain<00:05:14.580> apparent<00:05:15.389> in<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:16.020> effect<00:05:16.530> now<00:05:16.680> well

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
grain apparent in the effect now well

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.740 
grain apparent in the effect now well
that<00:05:16.979> is<00:05:17.340> because<00:05:17.490> we<00:05:17.790> have<00:05:18.030> increased<00:05:18.630> the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
that is because we have increased the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.020 
that is because we have increased the
amount<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.139> blurring<00:05:19.830> taking<00:05:20.550> place<00:05:20.729> but<00:05:20.910> we

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
amount of blurring taking place but we

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.969 
amount of blurring taking place but we
haven't<00:05:21.300> increased<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.139> quality<00:05:22.320> after

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
haven't increased the quality after

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.500 
haven't increased the quality after
sampling<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.580> may<00:05:23.790> need<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.090> increase

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
sampling so you may need to increase

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.840 
sampling so you may need to increase
your<00:05:24.630> subdivision<00:05:25.410> levels<00:05:25.740> or<00:05:25.950> you<00:05:26.430> may<00:05:26.580> have

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
your subdivision levels or you may have

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.879 
your subdivision levels or you may have
to<00:05:26.910> work<00:05:27.270> with<00:05:27.570> V<00:05:27.750> Ray's<00:05:27.960> image<00:05:28.350> sampling<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
to work with V Ray's image sampling and

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.520 
to work with V Ray's image sampling and
DMC<00:05:29.430> sampler<00:05:29.970> controls<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.600> clean<00:05:31.050> this<00:05:31.200> up<00:05:31.350> a

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
little bit as we have increased the

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.200
