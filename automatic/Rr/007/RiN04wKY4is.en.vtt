00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
for next week does it that was purely my

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.920

fault<00:01:09.289> as<00:01:09.440> well<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:09.920> I<00:01:10.300> take<00:01:11.300> like<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.539> hundred

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
fault as well like I take like a hundred

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.910 
fault as well like I take like a hundred
percent<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.289> blame<00:01:12.440> for<00:01:12.649> that<00:01:12.680> one

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
percent of the blame for that one

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.890 
percent of the blame for that one
because<00:01:13.759> I<00:01:13.820> was<00:01:13.940> going<00:01:14.119> too<00:01:14.300> fast<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:14.840> that's

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
because I was going too fast and that's

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.600 
because I was going too fast and that's
a<00:01:15.049> blind<00:01:15.260> corner<00:01:15.590> for<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.100> guide<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:16.430> plow

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
a blind corner for that guide to plow

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.810 
a blind corner for that guide to plow
off<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.810> he<00:01:18.560> was<00:01:18.740> going<00:01:18.979> very<00:01:19.040> slowly<00:01:19.490> pulling

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
off and he was going very slowly pulling

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.880 
off and he was going very slowly pulling
out<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.299> I<00:01:20.810> think<00:01:20.990> he<00:01:21.080> did<00:01:21.200> see<00:01:21.409> me<00:01:21.440> in<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.740> end

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
out and I think he did see me in the end

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.149
