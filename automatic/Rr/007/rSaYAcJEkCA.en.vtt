this pine paneling project what I would

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.639 
this pine paneling project what I would
do<00:00:35.090> is<00:00:36.090> drill<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.870> near<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> end<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> my

do is drill right near the end of my
line<00:00:41.629> some<00:00:42.629> pilot<00:00:43.020> holes<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> would<00:00:44.460> take

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
line some pilot holes then I would take

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.479 
line some pilot holes then I would take
the<00:00:44.700> tool<00:00:45.350> let<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> blade<00:00:46.739> through<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> hole

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the tool let the blade through the hole

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:01.640 
the tool let the blade through the hole
and<00:00:48.440> that's<00:00:49.440> where<00:00:49.739> I'd<00:00:49.800> start<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.280> cut

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.619 

that's<00:01:02.650> great<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.700> works<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.300> I've<00:01:04.420> done

is to do what's called plunge cutting I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.150 
is to do what's called plunge cutting I
take<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.880> saw<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.990> I<00:01:20.110> lean<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.530> up<00:01:20.620> like<00:01:20.920> this
