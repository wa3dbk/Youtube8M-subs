00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
on the site then he may do so still

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.509 
on the site then he may do so still
giving<00:03:52.319> priority<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.069> other<00:03:53.220> players

next<00:03:54.359> phase<00:03:54.569> is<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.810> feed<00:03:55.170> your<00:03:55.319> construction

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
next phase is to feed your construction

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.190 
next phase is to feed your construction
crew<00:03:56.099> to<00:03:56.790> do<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.150> players<00:03:57.419> have<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.810> add<00:03:58.019> up<00:03:58.049> the

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
crew to do so players have to add up the

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.110 
crew to do so players have to add up the
sum<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.590> their<00:03:58.829> workers<00:03:59.099> and<00:03:59.579> compare
