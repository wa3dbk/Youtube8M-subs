recently about electric cars and it
seems<00:00:09.900> like<00:00:10.080> almost<00:00:10.290> every<00:00:10.710> manufacturer<00:00:11.429> is

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
seems like almost every manufacturer is

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.820 
seems like almost every manufacturer is
rushing<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> bring<00:00:12.540> them<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.809> market<00:00:13.019> there's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
rushing to bring them to market there's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.289 
rushing to bring them to market there's
just<00:00:14.009> one<00:00:14.160> problem<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.639> all<00:00:14.820> these<00:00:14.940> future

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
just one problem with all these future

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.000 
just one problem with all these future
models<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.750> course<00:00:15.960> most<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.680> them<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:16.859> still

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
models of course most of them are still

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.920 
models of course most of them are still
on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> drawing<00:00:17.550> board<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.060> years<00:00:18.600> away<00:00:18.900> from

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
appropriate journey we're gonna take it

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
appropriate journey we're gonna take it
to<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> largest<00:00:44.370> wind<00:00:44.730> farm<00:00:44.790> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.150> South<00:00:45.450> of

to the largest wind farm in the South of

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
to the largest wind farm in the South of
England<00:00:45.690> which<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> near<00:00:46.530> lead<00:00:46.830> in<00:00:47.100> Kent<00:00:47.430> and

England which is near lead in Kent and
unfortunately<00:00:48.630> as<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.350> slightly<00:00:50.010> beyond<00:00:50.310> the

unfortunately as to slightly beyond the
imf's<00:00:50.910> maximum<00:00:51.570> range<00:00:51.810> now<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.560> means<00:00:52.770> we're

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
imf's maximum range now that means we're

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.500 
imf's maximum range now that means we're
gonna<00:00:53.040> have<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> find<00:00:53.550> out<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.090> easy<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
gonna have to find out just how easy it

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
gonna have to find out just how easy it
is<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:55.170> recharge<00:00:55.560> it<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.860> route

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

now<00:01:06.240> as<00:01:06.450> its<00:01:06.630> name<00:01:06.840> suggests<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.619> IMF<00:01:08.009> is

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
now as its name suggests the IMF is

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.010 
now as its name suggests the IMF is
basically<00:01:08.759> an<00:01:09.030> electric<00:01:09.539> version<00:01:09.750> of

that's<00:01:20.039> about<00:01:20.310> 60<00:01:20.759> horsepower<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.329> the<00:01:21.390> old

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
that's about 60 horsepower in the old

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.960 
that's about 60 horsepower in the old
money<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:22.829> not<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> headline

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
money but that's not really the headline

money but that's not really the headline
figure<00:01:24.360> which<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.929> fact<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.289> got<00:01:25.490> 133

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
figure which is the fact it's got 133

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.459 
figure which is the fact it's got 133
pounds<00:01:26.789> feet<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.270> torque<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:28.289> it's

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
pounds feet of torque and because it's

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.600 
pounds feet of torque and because it's
electric<00:01:28.679> that's<00:01:29.159> available<00:01:29.429> from<00:01:29.880> rest<00:01:31.610> now

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
electric that's available from rest now

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039 
electric that's available from rest now
the<00:01:32.670> upshot<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> i-miev<00:01:33.899> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the upshot is that the i-miev is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.950 
the upshot is that the i-miev is
supremely<00:01:34.619> easy<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.159> drive<00:01:35.399> in<00:01:35.579> town<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.689> got

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
supremely easy to drive in town it's got

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.809 
supremely easy to drive in town it's got
very<00:01:37.140> strong<00:01:37.229> acceleration<00:01:38.159> from<00:01:38.459> about

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
very strong acceleration from about

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.510 
very strong acceleration from about
naught<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.390> 30<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.099> operating<00:01:41.099> it<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.369> as

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
naught to 30 and operating it is as

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.580 
naught to 30 and operating it is as
simple<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.179> pedal<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.599> stop<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.140> one

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
simple as one pedal to stop and one

dramatically<00:02:06.409> which<00:02:06.650> is<00:02:06.830> why<00:02:07.010> we're<00:02:07.280> stopping

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
dramatically which is why we're stopping

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.070 
dramatically which is why we're stopping
in<00:02:07.729> South<00:02:08.000> London<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.899> top-up<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.350> battery

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
one big problem with the environmental

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480 
one big problem with the environmental
credentials<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:10.110> all<00:04:10.230> electric<00:04:10.709> cars<00:04:10.980> they're

the other end of the recharging cord

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.580 
the other end of the recharging cord
which<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.420> why<00:04:15.630> we're<00:04:15.810> finishing<00:04:16.109> our<00:04:16.290> journey

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
which is why we're finishing our journey

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.259 
which is why we're finishing our journey
at<00:04:16.799> little<00:04:17.100> trainee<00:04:17.370> court<00:04:17.790> which<00:04:18.060> is<00:04:18.239> the

at little trainee court which is the

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.270 
at little trainee court which is the

biggest wind farm in the South of
England<00:04:20.430> these<00:04:21.359> turbines<00:04:21.750> behind<00:04:22.230> me<00:04:22.320> are

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
England these turbines behind me are

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.900 
England these turbines behind me are
going<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.590> produce<00:04:22.710> more<00:04:23.040> than<00:04:23.190> 60<00:04:23.610> megawatts

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
going to produce more than 60 megawatts

going to produce more than 60 megawatts
of<00:04:24.210> power<00:04:24.510> now<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.140> know<00:04:25.260> that<00:04:25.620> they're<00:04:25.800> going

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
of power now I know that they're going

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.290 
of power now I know that they're going
to<00:04:25.980> need<00:04:26.100> something<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> back<00:04:26.760> them<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.060> for

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
to need something to back them up for

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.180 
to need something to back them up for
when<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.510> wind<00:04:27.690> is<00:04:27.810> not<00:04:27.930> blowing<00:04:27.990> but<00:04:28.860> between

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
when the wind is not blowing but between

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.610 
when the wind is not blowing but between
them<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.669> this<00:04:30.150> car<00:04:30.450> we<00:04:30.960> have<00:04:31.080> at<00:04:31.200> least<00:04:31.380> the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
them and this car we have at least the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.830 
them and this car we have at least the
possibility<00:04:32.280> of<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.610> motoring<00:04:33.000> future<00:04:33.419> that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
possibility of a motoring future that

possibility of a motoring future that
doesn't<00:04:34.200> involve<00:04:34.440> oil<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.610> should<00:04:35.790> be

doesn't involve oil and that should be

doesn't involve oil and that should be
enough<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.419> make<00:04:36.450> us<00:04:36.690> all<00:04:36.810> think
