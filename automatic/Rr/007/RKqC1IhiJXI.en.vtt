better<00:01:56.060> but<00:01:56.840> with<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.110> being<00:01:57.290> said<00:01:57.560> if<00:01:57.770> you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
better but with that being said if you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920 
better but with that being said if you
were<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.979> stack<00:01:58.220> Mega<00:01:58.460> Man<00:01:58.640> 5<00:01:58.880> up<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.150> 80%<00:01:59.540> of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
were to stack Mega Man 5 up to 80% of

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.330 
were to stack Mega Man 5 up to 80% of
NES<00:02:00.200> games<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.650> would<00:02:00.740> still<00:02:01.040> be<00:02:01.070> considered

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
NES games it would still be considered

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.760 
NES games it would still be considered
good<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.870> when<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.140> compare<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.590> one

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
good but when you compare it to one

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.830 
good but when you compare it to one
through<00:02:03.950> three<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.640> doesn't<00:02:05.180> even<00:02:05.300> hold<00:02:05.630> a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
through three it doesn't even hold a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.330 
through three it doesn't even hold a
candle<00:02:05.869> it's<00:02:06.800> like<00:02:06.979> they<00:02:07.070> tried<00:02:07.310> really

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
candle it's like they tried really

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
candle it's like they tried really
really<00:02:07.640> hard<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.090> make<00:02:08.240> changes<00:02:08.570> to<00:02:08.630> improve

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
really hard to make changes to improve

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.020 
really hard to make changes to improve
the<00:02:09.020> series<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:09.860> screwed<00:02:10.220> up<00:02:10.340> all<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.820> things

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the series but screwed up all the things

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.500 
the series but screwed up all the things
that<00:02:11.150> made<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.390> earlier<00:02:11.720> games<00:02:12.020> good
