see that all the little buttons so we

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.910 
see that all the little buttons so we
got<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> triggers<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.770> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
got the triggers right here that just

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
pop up and out same thing with this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
pop up and out same thing with this
other<00:01:03.120> side<00:01:03.480> they're<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.019> kind<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.320> stuck

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

other side they're just kind of stuck
down<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.189> clasp<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.869> to

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
down in a little clasp these have to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
down in a little clasp these have to
wiggle<00:01:07.140> free<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:10.010> same<00:01:11.010> thing<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.430> these

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
wiggle free the same thing with these

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
wiggle free the same thing with these
top<00:01:11.970> buttons<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.900> left<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
top buttons the left and the right just

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.780 
top buttons the left and the right just
slide<00:01:14.189> down<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.549> little<00:01:14.760> grooves<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.790> then

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
slide down in little grooves and then

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.160 
slide down in little grooves and then
right<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> little

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
right here this is the little

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230 
right here this is the little
contraption<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.070> controls<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> majority

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
contraption that controls the majority

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.960 
contraption that controls the majority
of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> buttons<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> there's<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> bunch<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
of the buttons so there's a bunch of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.520 
of the buttons so there's a bunch of
screws<00:01:30.270> holding<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.840> place<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:31.439> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
screws holding that in place then you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
screws holding that in place then you
can<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.890> little<00:01:32.100> ribbon<00:01:32.369> cable<00:01:32.520> you

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
can see this little ribbon cable you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
can see this little ribbon cable you
have<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.240> lift<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> latch<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.350> unlatch<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
have to lift up the latch and unlatch it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
have to lift up the latch and unlatch it
and<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.540> buttons<00:01:36.869> stop<00:01:37.049> working<00:01:37.500> most

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and so if your buttons stop working most

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.140 
and so if your buttons stop working most
likely<00:01:38.040> you'll<00:01:38.130> need<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> replace<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.030> guy

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
likely you'll need to replace this guy

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.350 
likely you'll need to replace this guy
right<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:40.130> or<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> ribbon<00:01:42.000> cables

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
right here or just the ribbon cables

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.139 
right here or just the ribbon cables
depending<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.350> they're<00:01:43.530> selling<00:01:44.149> now

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
depending on what they're selling now

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.620 
depending on what they're selling now
the<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.710> stick<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:47.520> you're<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:47.970> be

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the little stick that you're going to be

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.420 
the little stick that you're going to be
playing<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.200> break<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> lot<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
playing with these break a lot and so

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
playing with these break a lot and so
the<00:01:50.549> whole<00:01:50.729> pad<00:01:51.030> comes<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.720> with<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> circuit

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
the whole pad comes up with the circuit

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
the whole pad comes up with the circuit
board<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.220> plugs<00:01:53.520> into<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> main<00:01:54.030> board

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
board and just plugs into the main board

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
board and just plugs into the main board
that<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> can<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.810> right<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.100> so<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
that you can see right here so if it

important so lift up at two points on
that<00:03:11.620> little<00:03:11.799> latch<00:03:12.099> so<00:03:12.819> you<00:03:12.909> don't<00:03:13.150> break<00:03:13.420> it

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
that little latch so you don't break it

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.509 
that little latch so you don't break it
if<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.930> lift<00:03:14.139> up<00:03:14.290> at<00:03:14.409> one<00:03:14.620> point<00:03:14.920> OPA<00:03:15.220> not<00:03:15.340> be

if you lift up at one point OPA not be
too<00:03:15.730> much<00:03:15.879> pressure<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.989> it<00:03:17.109> might<00:03:17.319> snap<00:03:17.650> it

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
too much pressure and it might snap it

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.330 
too much pressure and it might snap it
anyway<00:03:20.169> keep<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:20.590> working<00:03:20.919> with<00:03:20.980> all<00:03:21.220> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
the main board to the controller going

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.879 
the main board to the controller going
to<00:03:28.959> pull<00:03:29.199> those<00:03:29.379> loose<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:35.440> working<00:03:35.739> my<00:03:35.769> way

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
to pull those loose just working my way

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:42.399 
to pull those loose just working my way
around<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.459> outside

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.289 

and<00:03:43.409> now<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.830> release<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.430> most<00:03:44.939> of<00:03:45.180> the

two sensors that are still attached up
at<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> top<00:03:51.390> but<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.019> need<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.260> lift<00:03:52.470> up<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
at the top but you need to lift up the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.979 
at the top but you need to lift up the
mainboard<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.459> order<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.760> get<00:03:53.939> to<00:03:53.970> them<00:03:54.209> now

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
mainboard in order to get to them now

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
mainboard in order to get to them now
remember<00:03:55.409> what<00:03:55.890> remember<00:03:56.189> the<00:03:56.430> orientation

underneath now when you're replacing the
screen<00:05:25.199> it<00:05:25.949> could<00:05:26.220> be<00:05:26.340> one<00:05:26.520> of<00:05:26.669> two<00:05:26.820> things

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
screen it could be one of two things

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.240 
screen it could be one of two things
they<00:05:27.389> might<00:05:27.659> come<00:05:27.930> with<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.440> digitizer<00:05:28.949> which

they might come with the digitizer which

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.600 
they might come with the digitizer which
is<00:05:29.400> the<00:05:29.550> outer<00:05:29.760> part<00:05:29.909> or<00:05:30.889> it<00:05:31.889> might<00:05:32.190> just<00:05:32.220> come

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
is the outer part or it might just come

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.000 
is the outer part or it might just come
with<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.030> LCD<00:05:33.240> underneath<00:05:33.960> so<00:05:34.680> you<00:05:34.740> might

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
with the LCD underneath so you might

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.830 
with the LCD underneath so you might
need<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.220> separate<00:05:35.789> that<00:05:35.940> little<00:05:36.210> contraption

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
need to separate that little contraption

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.550 
need to separate that little contraption
in<00:05:37.020> order<00:05:37.830> to<00:05:37.979> finish<00:05:38.699> the<00:05:38.849> repair<00:05:39.409> but<00:05:40.409> it's

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
in order to finish the repair but it's

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.260 
in order to finish the repair but it's
not<00:05:40.680> too<00:05:40.860> bad<00:05:41.010> there's<00:05:41.250> just<00:05:41.430> little<00:05:41.699> clasps

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
not too bad there's just little clasps

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.379 
not too bad there's just little clasps
that<00:05:42.300> hold<00:05:42.690> the<00:05:42.810> two<00:05:42.960> sections<00:05:43.260> together<00:05:44.389> now

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
that hold the two sections together now

in<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:52.919> square<00:05:53.130> hole<00:05:53.430> is

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
in the square hole is

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.980 
in the square hole is

same thing each of these little buttons
has<00:05:56.319> its<00:05:56.500> own<00:05:56.680> little<00:05:56.979> notch<00:05:57.569> so<00:05:58.569> one<00:05:59.530> button

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
has its own little notch so one button
