it<00:01:59.280> difficult<00:01:59.670> for<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.939> driver

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
it difficult for a driver

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.440 
it difficult for a driver
well<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.619> racetrack<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.100> very<00:02:02.520> narrow<00:02:02.880> it's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
well this racetrack is very narrow it's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
well this racetrack is very narrow it's
very<00:02:03.630> difficult<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.320> early<00:02:04.560> stages<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
very difficult in early stages of the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.940 
very difficult in early stages of the
race<00:02:05.600> basically<00:02:06.600> in<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.750> starter<00:02:07.140> race<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
race basically in a starter race it's a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.529 
race basically in a starter race it's a
one<00:02:08.160> group<00:02:08.399> racetrack<00:02:08.910> right<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> bottom

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
one group racetrack right on the bottom

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.100 
one group racetrack right on the bottom
of<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> racetrack

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
of the racetrack

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.430 
of the racetrack
it<00:02:10.739> takes<00:02:11.009> them<00:02:11.220> 150<00:02:12.090> 200<00:02:12.750> laps<00:02:12.930> into<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.319> race

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it takes them 150 200 laps into the race

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.260 
it takes them 150 200 laps into the race
before<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> high<00:02:14.370> groove<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.910> race<00:02:15.030> track

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.240 
before the high groove of the race track
starts<00:02:15.569> getting<00:02:15.810> worked<00:02:16.020> in<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.860> by<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.220> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
starts getting worked in and by that I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.800 
starts getting worked in and by that I
mean<00:02:17.489> cars<00:02:17.850> have<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.270> get<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.660> and

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
mean cars have to get up there and

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.449 
mean cars have to get up there and
gradually<00:02:19.230> inch<00:02:19.650> their<00:02:19.890> way<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> top<00:02:20.310> of

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
gradually inch their way to the top of

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.580 
gradually inch their way to the top of
the<00:02:20.520> racetrack<00:02:20.700> put<00:02:21.600> rubber<00:02:21.840> down<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.319> until

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
the racetrack put rubber down and until

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.020 
the racetrack put rubber down and until
that<00:02:22.620> happens<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.550> don't<00:02:23.790> have<00:02:23.880> any

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that happens you really don't have any

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.760 
that happens you really don't have any
racing<00:02:24.390> room<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.660> there<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
racing room up there but this is the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.990 
racing room up there but this is the
kind<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.040> race<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.400> after<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.819> halfway

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
kind of race that after the halfway

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610 
kind of race that after the halfway
point<00:02:27.209> you'll<00:02:27.660> have<00:02:27.690> cars<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> bottom<00:02:28.530> of

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
point you'll have cars on the bottom of

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.410 
point you'll have cars on the bottom of
the<00:02:28.680> racetrack<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.610> you'll<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.880> fast<00:02:30.150> cars

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
Darrell I think so we had a problem with

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.090 
Darrell I think so we had a problem with
the<00:05:07.870> tire<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.229> I<00:05:08.260> think<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.530> young<00:05:08.680> man<00:05:08.889> just

tire<00:05:57.420> which<00:05:57.810> is<00:05:57.960> very<00:05:58.200> critical<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.910> think

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
tire which is very critical and I think

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.460
