00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.010 
water and when i was living in colorado
i<00:02:32.860> really<00:02:33.280> missed<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> ocean<00:02:34.000> so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.580 
I didn't think I really wanted to go
back<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.760> California<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.720> flipped<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.380> coin

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
back to California so I flipped the coin

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.200 
back to California so I flipped the coin
and<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:38.980> was<00:02:39.130> either<00:02:39.400> California<00:02:40.090> or<00:02:40.180> Florida

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
and it was either California or Florida

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.800 
and it was either California or Florida
and<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.780> turned<00:02:41.260> out<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.410> be<00:02:41.620> Florida<00:02:42.810> future

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
