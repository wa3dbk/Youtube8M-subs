00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
single time Louis I have so far opted

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.609 
single time Louis I have so far opted
for<00:01:02.609> something<00:01:03.000> other<00:01:03.180> than<00:01:03.359> an<00:01:03.840> iphone<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
for something other than an iphone and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.950 
for something other than an iphone and
when<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> started<00:01:05.189> looking<00:01:05.369> at<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.360> specs<00:01:06.810> for

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
when I started looking at the specs for

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.390 
when I started looking at the specs for
the<00:01:07.200> new<00:01:07.380> iPhone<00:01:07.890> 6<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> UH<00:01:09.360> galaxy<00:01:10.320> note<00:01:10.619> 4<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the new iPhone 6 the UH galaxy note 4 I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 
the new iPhone 6 the UH galaxy note 4 I
guess<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.270> equivalent<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
guess is kind of equivalent to the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.859 
guess is kind of equivalent to the
iphone<00:01:13.530> 6<00:01:13.920> plus<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.640> bigger<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.390> would

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
iphone 6 plus the bigger one I would

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.770 
iphone 6 plus the bigger one I would
choose<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.590> note<00:01:16.799> 4<00:01:17.130> uh<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.670> think<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.299> uh<00:01:18.509> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
choose the note 4 uh I think it uh the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.899 
choose the note 4 uh I think it uh the
the<00:01:18.869> six<00:01:19.350> has<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> slightly<00:01:19.920> bigger<00:01:20.189> screen<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the six has a slightly bigger screen a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
the six has a slightly bigger screen a
higher<00:01:21.570> pixel<00:01:21.900> density<00:01:22.560> better<00:01:22.860> camera

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
higher pixel density better camera

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.270 
higher pixel density better camera
better<00:01:23.729> front<00:01:24.119> camera<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.350> 64<00:01:25.860> gigabytes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
better front camera up to 64 gigabytes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.039 
better front camera up to 64 gigabytes
of<00:01:26.369> extra<00:01:26.700> storage<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.570> were<00:01:27.689> looking<00:01:27.810> at

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
of extra storage so if I were looking at

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
of extra storage so if I were looking at
the<00:01:28.170> larger<00:01:28.619> ones<00:01:28.860> i<00:01:29.130> would<00:01:29.759> go<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the larger ones i would go with the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.230 
the larger ones i would go with the
galaxy<00:01:30.840> note<00:01:31.049> 4<00:01:31.350> uh<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.700> looking<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240

iphone 6 versus the samsung galaxy s5 i

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
iphone 6 versus the samsung galaxy s5 i
would<00:01:38.070> still<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.640> with<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.000> s5<00:01:39.479> Louis<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.079> i
