00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone welcome to gravity 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:10.500
 falls and this top 5 false theory 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.360
 theory first name dipera in my opinion 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 Dipper and the name is because when Alex 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.619
 hirsch answered the question answer sabina then 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.140
 it was there that Bill thought that the name Diper 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.060
 bullshit but how do we see in this scene bill 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.510
 says that what they say in the name 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.220
 UAH complete nonsense yes he wanted that name but 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.740
 This does not mean that his name is so 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 there is a difference between wanting to have 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.320
 theory 2 diary creator 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.960
 diary writer has always been 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 brother scene of a certain makgaket arm with a cast 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.650
 About the product for the particularly smart I do not say 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 blond or father of susa 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.120
 but it is likely that the diaries 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.400
 added while the author was not for example 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.540
 Dipper finished them and it is possible 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:00.230
 someone could finish writing well we go further 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 theory 3 wendy mermaid is untrue 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.790
 Immediately talk about what you say about 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.100
 shoes are complete nonsense she just 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.170
 the pattern is the same dirt on the shoes 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.220
 she's the daughter of a woodcutter, you know 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:18.010
 work us and so on 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.510
 theory 4 arabia with you the vampire was worth it 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.940
 would be silent but I will say 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.490
 robby ordinary man would he be a vampire 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.870
 he would burn from the sun then two red 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.600
 the points on the face are 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.610
 acne in adolescents represent on it 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 yes yes surprise surprise 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.170
 Robbie is not a zombie although much points to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.750
 it is but it is not so the creators of the cartoon 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.760
 We just confuses the matter is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.760
 what if he were a zombie he would have 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.310
 habits of zombies inhibited speech he was 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.470
 would be paler than snacks under the eyes would limp 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.010
 would walk slowly would walk constantly 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.750
 somewhere 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 eat people for example 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.030
 the last fifth theory 2 Andy doesn't like 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.890
 dipper 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.080
 remember this series where they make sense 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.940
 moved in time so here when 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.070
 they met up with little wendy when 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.500
 she saw dipper whispered something 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.959
 girlfriend and then issued her secret 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.300
 My friend thinks you're pretty 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.069
 so since then wendy remember him 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.890
 because he recognizes him in that guy 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.840
 dipper but not always 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.120
 hang out but tell you de berg not 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.120
 glued so here I do not think that only he 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.030
 if she were against she would already 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.709
 somehow I hinted well or something so 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.480
 more in a series where not met 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.300
 Changeling them when Dipper thought that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.060
 wendy is dead he confessed her love a 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.560
 the real one heard him but not at first 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.739
 understood what it was but then she remembered 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.200
 that guy and understood everything and when at the end 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.090
 the series they spoke heart to heart saying to him 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.440
 that she was too old for him in indie 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.989
 sincerely sorry since she really 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.989
 to him is not indifferent and this is a fact
