00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.179 
sure people have played basketball
before<00:01:47.450> but<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.810> case<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> haven't<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.770> does

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.060 
before but in case you haven't it does
have<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.700> distinctive<00:01:51.240> noise<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.070> it's

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
like a kind of Mecca mean I've a know

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.359 
like a kind of Mecca mean I've a know
what<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.079> trying<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> explain<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.710> basketball

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
what I'm trying to explain a basketball

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.459 
what I'm trying to explain a basketball
noise<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.420> sure<00:01:57.659> people<00:01:57.960> have<00:01:58.259> been

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
noise but I'm sure people have been

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.920 
noise but I'm sure people have been
playable<00:01:58.799> before<00:01:59.610> or<00:01:59.700> whatnot<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.600> that's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
playable before or whatnot but that's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.780 
playable before or whatnot but that's
the<00:02:01.079> basketball<00:02:01.590> side<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> things<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.640> are

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the basketball side of things there are

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.940 
the basketball side of things there are
basketball<00:02:03.060> courts<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
basketball courts so there is a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.300 
basketball courts so there is a
possibility<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.110> then<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.530> implement<00:02:08.069> in

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
possibility of then just implement in

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.699 
possibility of then just implement in
and<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.239> guys<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.750> played<00:02:09.959> san<00:02:10.200> andreas

than that I don't mean trouble anymore

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.729 
than that I don't mean trouble anymore
oh<00:02:27.819> well<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.170> next<00:02:29.200> thing<00:02:29.440> I'm<00:02:29.590> going<00:02:29.620> to

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
oh well so the next thing I'm going to

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.970 
oh well so the next thing I'm going to
be<00:02:29.860> talking<00:02:30.040> about<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.880> skateboard<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
be talking about is a skateboard and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610 
be talking about is a skateboard and
rollerblades<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.599> it<00:02:34.599> don't<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.380> know<00:02:35.590> if

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
rollerblades so it don't really know if

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.370 
rollerblades so it don't really know if
that<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.310> possible<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.750> might<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.230> might

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
that is possible it might be it might

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.050 
that is possible it might be it might
not<00:02:38.650> be<00:02:38.709> they're<00:02:38.980> gonna<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.400> rework<00:02:39.819> tomb

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
not be they're gonna have to rework tomb

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.210 
not be they're gonna have to rework tomb
animations<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.900> obviously<00:02:41.620> put<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.980> in<00:02:42.069> there

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
animations and obviously put it in there

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.150 
animations and obviously put it in there
because<00:02:42.489> it's<00:02:42.670> not<00:02:42.989> fully<00:02:43.989> like<00:02:44.260> there<00:02:45.040> isn't

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
because it's not fully like there isn't

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.979 
because it's not fully like there isn't
skateboards<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:45.880> game<00:02:46.120> yet<00:02:46.330> it<00:02:46.660> would<00:02:46.840> be

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
skateboards in the game yet it would be

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.350 
skateboards in the game yet it would be
cool<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.650> skateboards<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.430> blade<00:02:49.120> in

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
cool to have skateboards and blade in

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.199 
cool to have skateboards and blade in
the<00:02:49.390> game<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:50.430> realistically<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.579> don't<00:02:51.970> think

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
the game but realistically I don't think

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.390 
the game but realistically I don't think
that<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> possibility<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.980> sounds<00:02:54.340> don't

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
that is a possibility the sounds don't

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.220 
that is a possibility the sounds don't
really<00:02:54.760> sound<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.630> like<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.870> can't<00:02:56.079> hit

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
really sound like it like you can't hit

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.589 
really sound like it like you can't hit
the<00:02:56.349> pop<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:57.310> skateboard<00:02:58.060> when<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.329> do<00:02:58.480> an

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
the pop of a skateboard when you do an

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.020 
the pop of a skateboard when you do an
ollie<00:02:58.720> or<00:02:58.989> whatnot<00:02:59.170> or<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.650> jump<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.700> you're<00:03:00.880> not

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
ollie or whatnot or a jump if you're not

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.660 
ollie or whatnot or a jump if you're not
skateboard<00:03:01.989> fluently<00:03:02.560> language<00:03:03.010> door<00:03:03.280> yeah
