00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.110 

hey<00:00:01.230> guys<00:00:01.500> Henry<00:00:01.829> here<00:00:02.129> and<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.700> think<00:00:03.000> this

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hey guys Henry here and I think this

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey guys Henry here and I think this
would<00:00:03.210> be<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.510> on<00:00:03.659> who's<00:00:03.899> clan<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.440> my

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
would be going on who's clan and my

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.140 
would be going on who's clan and my
channel<00:00:05.040> was<00:00:05.130> well<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.549> reason<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:05.970> that

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
channel was well and the reason for that

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.299 
channel was well and the reason for that
is<00:00:06.299> because<00:00:06.509> battlefield<00:00:07.500> 3<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.859> here<00:00:08.069> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
is because battlefield 3 is here and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.339 
is because battlefield 3 is here and
this<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> first<00:00:09.030> stage<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.900> making<00:00:10.230> you

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
this is the first stage in making you

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.940 
this is the first stage in making you
can<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.920> more<00:00:11.780> active<00:00:12.780> channel<00:00:13.139> show<00:00:13.500> say<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
can a more active channel show say and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.609 
can a more active channel show say and
i'll<00:00:14.639> be<00:00:14.790> posting<00:00:14.969> here<00:00:15.299> not<00:00:15.929> as<00:00:16.139> obviously

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
highway and the reason you might see

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.950 
highway and the reason you might see
some<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.820> shots<00:00:57.059> lag<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> might

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
some of my shots lag a bit and it might

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.270 
some of my shots lag a bit and it might
take<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> while<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.620> kill<00:00:58.800> someone<00:00:59.010> that's

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
take a while to kill someone that's

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.950 
take a while to kill someone that's
because<00:00:59.550> i<00:00:59.579> was<00:00:59.760> uploading<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> time<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
because i was uploading at the time and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
because i was uploading at the time and
you<00:01:01.260> could<00:01:01.649> tell<00:01:01.829> was<00:01:01.980> lagging<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.399> bit

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you could tell was lagging a little bit

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.230 
you could tell was lagging a little bit
but<00:01:03.600> i<00:01:03.629> still<00:01:03.780> had<00:01:03.899> fun<00:01:04.080> nothing<00:01:04.439> i<00:01:04.470> think<00:01:04.830> i

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240

wasn't<00:01:14.010> by<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.360> did<00:01:15.509> lose<00:01:17.030> but

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
wasn't by a lot but we we did lose but

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330
