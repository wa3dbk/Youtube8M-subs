that happened on that one I mean this
whole<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.700> joint<00:00:46.970> I<00:00:47.210> believe<00:00:47.900> is<00:00:48.110> an<00:00:48.260> original

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
whole you joint I believe is an original

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.870 
whole you joint I believe is an original
u<00:00:48.860> joint<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:50.480> can<00:00:50.660> drag<00:00:50.930> your<00:00:51.170> nail

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.170 

across<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.180> scoring<00:00:56.630> just<00:00:56.900> like<00:00:57.050> that<00:00:57.290> and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
across the scoring just like that and

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.050 
across the scoring just like that and
they're<00:00:59.180> deep<00:00:59.980> so<00:01:00.980> there<00:01:01.460> was<00:01:01.610> some<00:01:01.820> grease

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
they're deep so there was some grease

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.190 
they're deep so there was some grease
left<00:01:02.210> on<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:02.510> side<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:02.900> side<00:01:03.020> there's

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
left on this side of this side there's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.950 
left on this side of this side there's
absolutely<00:01:03.530> no<00:01:03.680> grease<00:01:03.920> left<00:01:04.100> at<00:01:04.309> all<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:04.820> yeah

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
absolutely no grease left at all so yeah

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.760 
absolutely no grease left at all so yeah
towstee<00:01:06.939> that<00:01:07.939> was<00:01:08.359> what<00:01:08.570> was<00:01:08.749> making<00:01:08.929> all<00:01:09.289> the

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
towstee that was what was making all the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.139 
towstee that was what was making all the
noise<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.700> car

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
noise in that car

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.279 
noise in that car
so<00:01:11.299> hopefully<00:01:12.039> we'll<00:01:13.039> be<00:01:13.159> able<00:01:13.249> to<00:01:14.289> change

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
so hopefully we'll be able to change

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:23.200 
so hopefully we'll be able to change
that<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:20.030> here's<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.810> new<00:01:20.929> u<00:01:21.170> joint<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.880> as

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
that so here's the new u joint and as

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.020 
that so here's the new u joint and as
you<00:01:23.359> can<00:01:23.479> tell<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:25.159> definitely<00:01:25.640> moves<00:01:25.850> around

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
you can tell it definitely moves around

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.749 
you can tell it definitely moves around
a<00:01:26.359> lot<00:01:26.509> better<00:01:26.749> than<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.170> old<00:01:27.319> one<00:01:27.759> somebody

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
a lot better than the old one somebody

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.639 
a lot better than the old one somebody
thought<00:01:29.149> that<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.420> was<00:01:29.659> soaking<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.200> old<00:01:30.409> u

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.020 
smack out a u joint so the way that I
was<00:02:09.380> taught<00:02:09.679> how<00:02:09.709> to<00:02:09.890> do<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.340> was<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.670> open<00:02:10.940> up

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
was taught how to do it was you open up

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.800 
was taught how to do it was you open up
your<00:02:11.209> vise<00:02:11.799> just<00:02:12.799> enough<00:02:13.299> so<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.629> half

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
your vise just enough so that the half

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.260 
your vise just enough so that the half
shaft<00:02:15.170> will<00:02:15.379> go<00:02:15.500> through<00:02:16.150> but

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
shaft will go through but

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.840 
shaft will go through but
the<00:02:17.360> flange<00:02:17.690> won't<00:02:18.200> okay<00:02:19.480> just<00:02:20.480> like<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.830> and

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the flange won't okay just like that and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.550 
the flange won't okay just like that and
then<00:02:22.850> what<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.120> do<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.480> take<00:02:23.690> a<00:02:23.750> socket

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
then what you do is you take a socket

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.640 
then what you do is you take a socket
that's<00:02:25.160> as<00:02:25.490> large<00:02:26.240> as<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.990> flange<00:02:27.380> right

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
that's as large as this flange right

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.250 
that's as large as this flange right
here<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.160> larger<00:02:29.030> than<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.390> cup<00:02:30.020> on<00:02:30.170> the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
here so larger than the cup on the

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.770 
here so larger than the cup on the
u-joint<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.830> then<00:02:31.580> either<00:02:32.210> use<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.570> socket

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
u-joint and then either use the socket

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.550 
u-joint and then either use the socket
or<00:02:33.080> use<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:34.480> piece<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.660> metal<00:02:35.810> above<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.410> and

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
or use a a piece of metal above it and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.820 
or use a a piece of metal above it and
then<00:02:37.400> take<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.700> big<00:02:37.970> heavy<00:02:38.270> hammer<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.930> hit

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
then take a big heavy hammer and hit

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.470 
then take a big heavy hammer and hit
down<00:02:40.070> on<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.640> what<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:40.970> does<00:02:41.270> is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
down on it and the what that does is

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.170 
down on it and the what that does is
that<00:02:41.600> drives<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:43.100> flange<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.760> hole<00:02:43.970> you

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
that drives the flange and the hole you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.240 
that drives the flange and the hole you
joint<00:02:44.450> up<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.470> cup<00:02:45.680> will<00:02:45.860> start<00:02:46.100> raising

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
joint up so the cup will start raising

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.640 
joint up so the cup will start raising
up<00:02:46.550> above<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.480> flam's<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.020> then<00:02:48.110> you<00:02:48.230> take<00:02:48.440> it

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
up above the flam's and then you take it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.340 
up above the flam's and then you take it
and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.030> turn<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.330> over<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:51.260> you

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
and then you turn it over and then you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.020 
and then you turn it over and then you
do<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> same<00:02:51.770> thing<00:02:52.010> back<00:02:52.520> and<00:02:52.700> forth<00:02:52.850> back

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
do the same thing back and forth back

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.820 
do the same thing back and forth back
and<00:02:53.060> forth<00:02:53.210> back<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.510> forth<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.990> cups<00:02:54.260> will

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
and forth back and forth the cups will

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.440 
and forth back and forth the cups will
start<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.190> come<00:02:55.340> out<00:02:55.400> in<00:02:55.610> both<00:02:55.730> directions<00:02:56.090> and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
start to come out in both directions and

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.540 
start to come out in both directions and
then<00:02:56.720> once<00:02:57.530> they're<00:02:57.740> out<00:02:57.830> enough<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.430> can

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
then once they're out enough you can

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.370 
then once they're out enough you can
pull<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.760> cups<00:02:58.970> out<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.390> u-joint<00:02:59.780> go<00:03:00.320> to

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
pull the cups out and the u-joint go to

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.710 
pull the cups out and the u-joint go to
work<00:03:00.560> its<00:03:00.710> way<00:03:00.860> free<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:01.520> that's<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:02.000> that's

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
work its way free so that's the that's

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.990 
work its way free so that's the that's
the<00:03:02.930> easiest<00:03:03.230> way<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.500> get<00:03:03.740> these<00:03:04.310> u-joints

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
the easiest way to get these u-joints

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.030 
the easiest way to get these u-joints
out<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.520> same<00:03:07.700> thing<00:03:07.910> goes<00:03:08.120> for<00:03:09.040> same

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
out so the same thing goes for same

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.780 
out so the same thing goes for same
thing<00:03:10.220> goes<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:11.620> now<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:13.070> easiest<00:03:13.610> way

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
thing goes for this now the easiest way

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.490 
thing goes for this now the easiest way
to<00:03:13.940> do<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:15.320> to<00:03:15.980> get<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.810> spindle<00:03:17.810> flange<00:03:18.110> so

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
to do it is to get a spindle flange so

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.630 
to do it is to get a spindle flange so
what<00:03:18.680> goes<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.100> other<00:03:19.190> side<00:03:19.430> of<00:03:19.550> this

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
what goes on the other side of this

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.490 
what goes on the other side of this
inside<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.120> trailing<00:03:20.360> arm<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:21.080> bolt<00:03:21.320> that

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
inside the trailing arm you bolt that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.080 
inside the trailing arm you bolt that
all<00:03:21.650> together<00:03:21.830> and<00:03:22.460> then<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:22.760> way<00:03:22.910> when

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
all together and then that way when

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.640 
all together and then that way when
you're<00:03:23.240> beating<00:03:23.510> on<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.810> you<00:03:24.200> won't<00:03:24.380> end<00:03:24.560> up

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
you're beating on it you won't end up

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.200 
you're beating on it you won't end up
cracking<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.220> right<00:03:25.370> here<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:25.820> then<00:03:25.880> you

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
cracking it right here and then you

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.370 
cracking it right here and then you
won't<00:03:26.360> break<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.810> so<00:03:27.680> new<00:03:28.520> joint<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.360> this<00:03:30.200> u

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
won't break it so new joint is in this u

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.580 
won't break it so new joint is in this u
joint<00:03:30.650> has<00:03:30.770> been<00:03:30.800> regressed<00:03:31.430> and<00:03:31.670> actual

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
joint has been regressed and actual

00:03:32.590 --> 00:04:04.920 
joint has been regressed and actual
clips<00:03:33.590> put<00:03:33.830> on<00:03:33.950> it

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.920 

so<00:04:06.280> before

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.539 

when<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.500> would<00:04:10.739> roll<00:04:10.890> out<00:04:11.099> of<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.280> garage<00:04:11.519> I

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
when I would roll out of the garage I

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.119 
when I would roll out of the garage I
could<00:04:11.939> hear<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.239> click<00:04:12.810> I<00:04:12.840> didn't<00:04:13.680> hear<00:04:13.829> then

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
could hear the click I didn't hear then

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.340 
could hear the click I didn't hear then
rolling<00:04:14.519> out<00:04:14.640> now<00:04:15.049> but<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.079> think<00:04:16.380> we're<00:04:16.560> okay

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
rolling out now but I think we're okay

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.199 
rolling out now but I think we're okay
I'm<00:04:19.350> excited<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:20.009> get<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.280> done<00:04:20.489> just<00:04:20.820> because

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
I'm excited to get it done just because

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.140 
I'm excited to get it done just because
we<00:04:22.079> have<00:04:22.169> about<00:04:22.470> four<00:04:23.190> or<00:04:23.400> five<00:04:23.610> more<00:04:23.789> days<00:04:23.940> of

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
we have about four or five more days of

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.640 
we have about four or five more days of
nice<00:04:24.300> weather<00:04:24.509> here<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:24.930> Texas<00:04:25.289> and<00:04:25.470> then<00:04:25.560> it

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
nice weather here in Texas and then it

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.760 
nice weather here in Texas and then it
gets<00:04:25.800> down<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.570> real<00:04:27.570> November<00:04:28.020> weather<00:04:28.229> so

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
gets down to real November weather so

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.990 
gets down to real November weather so
right<00:04:29.520> now<00:04:29.669> it's<00:04:29.880> about<00:04:29.960> 60<00:04:30.960> degrees<00:04:31.050> 65<00:04:32.000> not

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
right now it's about 60 degrees 65 not

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.909 
right now it's about 60 degrees 65 not
bad<00:04:33.270> so<00:04:33.690> I'm<00:04:34.229> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.410> go<00:04:34.500> ahead<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.740> take<00:04:34.889> it

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
bad so I'm going to go ahead and take it
