00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
canon g7x is destroying the iPhone 6

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
canon g7x is destroying the iPhone 6
really<00:01:26.250> for<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.240> reason<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:27.810> iPhones<00:01:28.380> when

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
really for some reason on iPhones when

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
really for some reason on iPhones when
you<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.860> into<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> recording<00:01:29.939> mode

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you go into the recording mode

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.190 
you go into the recording mode
it<00:01:30.600> likes<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> zoom<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.390> as<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.630> see<00:01:33.689> if

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
it likes to zoom in so as you can see if

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
it likes to zoom in so as you can see if
I<00:01:34.350> moved<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.430> camera<00:01:35.460> over

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
I moved the camera over

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.020 
I moved the camera over
we<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> same<00:01:38.400> distance

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
we are actually at the same distance

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
we are actually at the same distance
from<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.869> hoodie<00:01:40.189> ok<00:01:41.189> let's<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> little

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
from the hoodie ok let's go in a little

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.270 
from the hoodie ok let's go in a little
bit<00:01:42.000> closer<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.600> see<00:01:42.869> how<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.290> autofocus

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
bit closer and see how the autofocus

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.270 
bit closer and see how the autofocus
works<00:01:44.780> see<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.930> stay<00:01:46.229> focused<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
works see if we stay focused in with the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
works see if we stay focused in with the
iPhone<00:01:49.280> stay<00:01:50.280> nicely<00:01:50.610> focused<00:01:51.439> with<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
iPhone stay nicely focused with the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.130 
iPhone stay nicely focused with the
Canon<00:01:55.159> nicely<00:01:56.159> focused<00:01:56.640> again<00:01:56.969> okay<00:01:57.930> let's

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
Canon nicely focused again okay let's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530 
Canon nicely focused again okay let's
bring<00:01:58.320> them<00:01:58.469> both<00:01:58.649> back<00:01:59.119> let<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> Canon

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
bring them both back let the Canon

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.100 
bring them both back let the Canon
autofocus<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:04.860> focused<00:02:05.280> again<00:02:05.460> ok<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.299> do

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
autofocus it's focused again ok I do

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
autofocus it's focused again ok I do
think<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.740> mess<00:02:07.890> around<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.280> bit<00:02:08.429> more

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
think I have to mess around a bit more

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.919 
think I have to mess around a bit more
with<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> settings<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> camera<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.810> it

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
with the settings from the camera so it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.630 
with the settings from the camera so it
focuses<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> bit<00:02:10.560> quicker<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.400> go<00:02:11.580> up

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
focuses a bit quicker but let's go up

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.699 
focuses a bit quicker but let's go up
and<00:02:11.849> down

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and down

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.300 
and down
so<00:02:14.709> as<00:02:15.549> you<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.209> see<00:02:16.360> again<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.620> iPhone<00:02:17.950> 6<00:02:18.189> is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
so as you can see again the iPhone 6 is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.420 
so as you can see again the iPhone 6 is
having<00:02:18.579> none<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.760> that

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
having none of that

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.309 
having none of that
but<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.519> camera<00:02:21.879> stays<00:02:22.120> relatively<00:02:22.870> focused

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
but the camera stays relatively focused

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.830 
but the camera stays relatively focused
on<00:02:23.799> the<00:02:24.040> objective<00:02:24.579> or<00:02:24.939> on<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.239> target<00:02:25.689> should

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
on the objective or on the target should

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.649 
on the objective or on the target should
say<00:02:26.049> okay<00:02:26.980> now<00:02:27.310> let's<00:02:27.519> go<00:02:27.670> into<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:28.000> aerosol

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
say okay now let's go into the aerosol

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.649 
say okay now let's go into the aerosol

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
bottle see we're gonna go with this see

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.910 
bottle see we're gonna go with this see
if<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.840> keeps<00:02:32.019> its<00:02:32.290> focus<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.650> extremely

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
if it keeps its focus so it's extremely

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.009 
if it keeps its focus so it's extremely
good<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.519> can<00:02:36.670> read<00:02:36.849> that<00:02:37.060> extremely<00:02:37.599> clear

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
good you can read that extremely clear

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.250 
phone it is a bit dark and it's grainy
compared<00:03:08.620> to<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:08.769> compact<00:03:09.250> camera<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
compared to a compact camera and the

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.910 
compared to a compact camera and the
vibration<00:03:11.950> control<00:03:12.069> isn't<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:13.000> good<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.620> out

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
vibration control isn't as good so out

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.000 
vibration control isn't as good so out
of<00:03:15.040> 10<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.340> would<00:03:15.549> rate<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.030> iPhone<00:03:16.599> 6<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:17.290> 6<00:03:17.799> out

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010
