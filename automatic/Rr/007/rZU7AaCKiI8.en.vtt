00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.490
 hello everyone today we bring you a new 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.719
 Ivan tuna recipe is called ibm that 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 it would be something like an original 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.450
 stuffed meat croquette to make it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.310
 we will need these ingredients 100 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.670
 grams of beef the same amount of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.490
 lamb a few pine nuts the burgh that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.070
 can not miss in Lebanese food 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.670
 cinnamon powder onion some leaves 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.129
 mint pepper of jamaica salt pepper 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.460
 black and olive oil and sunflower 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.890
 this recipe has two parts the dough and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 the filling I already have made here the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.629
 mass but while I give it shape 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.390
 I tell how to make the dough 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.229
 veal use the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.330
 borough the mint the onion and a little 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.570
 File of jamaica and black pepper 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.330
 normal is chopped all and chopped several 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.619
 Sometimes in the end we will sting you with 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.280
 some ice because it is very important 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.470
 that the dough does not heat up like that the meat 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.490
 it will stay perfect and we can 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.560
 knead better 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.840
 a little sunflower oil in the palm 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.470
 hand and a little on the finger to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.080
 give shape and that does not break we have 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.770
 the molds or the stories where we are going to 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.990
 go filling the filling this here 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.049
 I've done some onion posing and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.899
 adding half half lamb meat 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.539
 veal the amount depending on the 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.179
 diners that we have the cook with 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.860
 cinnamon salt and a pinch of sweet pepper 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.439
 of jamaica that you can find in 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.659
 any food store I have 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.149
 chopped the result and I've thrown 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.250
 pinions to close the croquettes there 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.770
 to do it carefully and with your hands 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.530
 wet oil seems simple but 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.170
 you will play a lot because it is 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.720
 a Lebanese technique that requires a lot 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.240
 practice this is the hardest part 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.310
 because it's not about tightening but about 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.099
 wrap the filling with the dough 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.310
 now it's time to fry them in oil well 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.760
 hot and emplazar 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.340
 the decoration to taste of each one to me 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.530
 I like it with a lettuce base and a 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.800
 cherry tomato to garnish 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.069
 I hope you like see you in dhul 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.069
