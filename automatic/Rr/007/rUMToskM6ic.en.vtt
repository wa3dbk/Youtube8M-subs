00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
in this movie we're going to continue to

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.460 
in this movie we're going to continue to
work<00:00:04.399> on<00:00:04.580> the<00:00:05.000> same<00:00:05.210> image<00:00:05.750> one<00:00:06.259> of<00:00:06.350> things

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
work on the same image one of things

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.110 
work on the same image one of things
that<00:00:06.529> I<00:00:06.680> notice<00:00:07.009> with<00:00:07.189> this<00:00:07.339> image<00:00:07.729> is<00:00:07.939> that<00:00:08.059> it

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
that I notice with this image is that it

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.120 
that I notice with this image is that it
would<00:00:08.209> be<00:00:08.270> kind<00:00:08.510> of<00:00:08.570> nice<00:00:08.719> to<00:00:08.780> darken<00:00:09.500> the<00:00:09.650> sky

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
would be kind of nice to darken the sky

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.190 
would be kind of nice to darken the sky
a<00:00:10.160> little<00:00:10.549> bit<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:10.820> brighten<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:11.719> foreground

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
a little bit and brighten the foreground

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.110 
a little bit and brighten the foreground
so<00:00:12.920> let's<00:00:13.070> say<00:00:13.160> that<00:00:13.190> I<00:00:13.370> decide<00:00:13.790> to<00:00:13.820> go<00:00:14.089> ahead

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.120 
so let's say that I decide to go ahead

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.480 
so let's say that I decide to go ahead
and<00:00:14.540> increase<00:00:14.750> my<00:00:15.049> overall<00:00:15.559> exposure<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.400> I

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
and increase my overall exposure and I

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.370 
and increase my overall exposure and I
like<00:00:16.759> that<00:00:16.939> except<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.540> skies<00:00:17.779> just<00:00:18.140> way<00:00:18.320> too

exposure<00:00:43.039> a<00:00:43.129> little<00:00:43.429> bit<00:00:43.550> more<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:43.999> we<00:00:44.120> can<00:00:44.149> see

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
exposure a little bit more so we can see

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.689 
exposure a little bit more so we can see
how<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:44.839> is<00:00:45.019> actually<00:00:45.440> functioning<00:00:45.949> well

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
how this is actually functioning well

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.040 
how this is actually functioning well
one<00:00:46.879> of<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.030> ways<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.359> this<00:00:47.510> tool<00:00:47.780> actually

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
one of the ways that this tool actually

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.319 
one of the ways that this tool actually
works<00:00:48.499> is<00:00:48.710> if<00:00:48.829> you<00:00:48.949> hover<00:00:49.219> over<00:00:49.519> the<00:00:49.820> node<00:00:49.850> I

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
works is if you hover over the node I

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.720 
works is if you hover over the node I
can<00:00:50.629> click<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.109> reposition<00:00:51.890> this<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.370> can<00:00:52.550> click

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
can click to reposition this I can click

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.489 
can click to reposition this I can click
to<00:00:52.789> reposition<00:00:53.329> how<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:53.839> darkening<00:00:54.379> effect

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
to reposition how that darkening effect

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.160 
to reposition how that darkening effect
is<00:00:54.949> actually<00:00:55.339> taking<00:00:55.760> place<00:00:55.839> you<00:00:56.839> get<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:56.960> lot

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
is actually taking place you get a lot

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.229 
is actually taking place you get a lot
of<00:00:57.199> times<00:00:57.499> like<00:00:57.920> with<00:00:58.129> all<00:00:58.309> of<00:00:58.579> these<00:00:58.699> overlays

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
of times like with all of these overlays

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.689 
of times like with all of these overlays
they<00:00:59.809> get<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.229> way<00:01:00.379> what's<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.249> shortcut

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
they get in the way what's the shortcut

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.579 
they get in the way what's the shortcut
to<00:01:01.819> hide<00:01:01.999> that<00:01:02.210> well<00:01:02.479> it's<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.719> H<00:01:02.899> key<00:01:03.379> that

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
to hide that well it's the H key that

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.010 
to hide that well it's the H key that
toggles<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.430> on<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.909> off<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.570> can<00:01:05.750> see<00:01:05.900> it's

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
toggles that on and off you can see it's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.810 
toggles that on and off you can see it's
toggling<00:01:06.530> between<00:01:06.650> these<00:01:07.130> different<00:01:07.160> views

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
toggling between these different views

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120 
toggling between these different views
we<00:01:08.480> also<00:01:08.720> have<00:01:08.960> an<00:01:09.080> option<00:01:09.230> as<00:01:09.620> we've<00:01:09.950> seen

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
we also have an option as we've seen

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.220 
we also have an option as we've seen
before<00:01:10.580> which<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:10.850> auto<00:01:11.300> now<00:01:11.630> auto<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.020> really

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
before which is auto now auto is really

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.690 
before which is auto now auto is really
interesting<00:01:12.710> when<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:12.890> hover<00:01:13.190> over<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.670> image

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
interesting when I hover over the image

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.180 
interesting when I hover over the image
there<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.750> when<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.410> hover<00:01:15.680> off<00:01:15.980> it

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
there it is when I hover off it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.340 
there it is when I hover off it
disappears<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.600> course<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:18.050> can<00:01:18.200> always

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
disappears and of course we can always

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.330 
disappears and of course we can always
choose<00:01:18.860> always<00:01:19.550> or<00:01:19.820> only<00:01:20.360> when<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.020> selected

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
choose always or only when it's selected

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.560 
choose always or only when it's selected
now<00:01:22.340> one<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.670> things<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:22.910> happens<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.450> lot

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
now one of the things that happens a lot

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.240 
now one of the things that happens a lot
of<00:01:23.720> times<00:01:23.930> is<00:01:24.110> when<00:01:24.230> you<00:01:24.350> make<00:01:24.530> adjustments

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
of times is when you make adjustments

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.620 
of times is when you make adjustments
let's<00:01:25.400> go<00:01:25.550> ahead<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.790> make<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.210> number<00:01:26.510> of

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
let's go ahead and make a number of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.900 
let's go ahead and make a number of
different<00:01:26.960> adjustments<00:01:27.500> here<00:01:27.710> is<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.580> you

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
different adjustments here is that you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.180 
different adjustments here is that you
may<00:01:29.150> want<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.480> make<00:01:29.660> adjustment<00:01:30.620> that<00:01:30.770> affects

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
may want to make adjustment that affects

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.480 
may want to make adjustment that affects
all<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.700> these<00:01:31.880> sliders<00:01:32.210> at<00:01:32.570> once<00:01:33.070> well<00:01:34.070> before

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
all of these sliders at once well before

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.000 
all of these sliders at once well before
what<00:01:35.450> we<00:01:35.600> could<00:01:35.780> do<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.380> adjustment

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010
