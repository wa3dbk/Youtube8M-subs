00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
we're going to drop a spill on the barbs

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.510 
we're going to drop a spill on the barbs
here<00:01:28.239> now<00:01:28.479> of<00:01:28.690> course<00:01:28.899> if<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:30.039> troop<00:01:30.310> is

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
here now of course if the troop is

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.940 
here now of course if the troop is
stronger<00:01:31.179> like<00:01:31.810> as<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.170> can<00:01:32.289> see<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.560> Dragons

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
stronger like as you can see the Dragons

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.070 
stronger like as you can see the Dragons
a<00:01:33.039> lot<00:01:33.220> stronger<00:01:33.520> than<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:34.149> barbs<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:34.989> the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
a lot stronger than the barbs so the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.559 
a lot stronger than the barbs so the
barbs<00:01:35.349> go<00:01:35.500> out<00:01:35.649> no<00:01:36.130> problem<00:01:36.369> it's<00:01:37.179> just<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
barbs go out no problem it's just the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:38.999 
barbs go out no problem it's just the
Dragons<00:01:37.989> going<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.170> be<00:01:38.259> a<00:01:38.289> lot<00:01:38.470> harder<00:01:38.649> to<00:01:38.860> take

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
Dragons going to be a lot harder to take

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.040 
Dragons going to be a lot harder to take
out<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.429> I'm<00:01:39.550> thinking<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.179> this<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.929> going

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
out so I'm thinking that this is going

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.749 
out so I'm thinking that this is going
to<00:01:41.110> change<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.530> way<00:01:41.649> people<00:01:41.679> you<00:01:42.429> know<00:01:42.550> how

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
to change the way people you know how

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.130 
to change the way people you know how
they<00:01:42.940> put<00:01:43.149> troops<00:01:43.390> inside<00:01:43.780> their<00:01:43.959> clan

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
they put troops inside their clan

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.020 
they put troops inside their clan
castles<00:01:44.590> most<00:01:44.830> likely<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.340> will<00:01:45.429> see<00:01:45.610> tons<00:01:45.849> of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
castles most likely you will see tons of

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.089 
castles most likely you will see tons of
bigger<00:01:46.300> troops<00:01:46.720> inside<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.500> clan<00:01:47.679> castles

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and not small ones anymore because you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.839 
and not small ones anymore because you
can<00:01:50.229> take<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.590> barbs<00:01:51.009> out<00:01:51.190> or<00:01:51.399> archers

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
whatever you have it so fast that it

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:55.669 
whatever you have it so fast that it
won't<00:01:54.610> make<00:01:54.729> sense<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:55.090> put<00:01:55.209> those<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.539> there

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
won't make sense to put those in there

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
troops so you won't have to worry if you

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.890 
troops so you won't have to worry if you
have<00:03:08.170> your<00:03:08.409> own<00:03:08.549> army<00:03:09.549> troop<00:03:10.120> compositions<00:03:10.719> in

have your own army troop compositions in

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.470 
have your own army troop compositions in
there<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.170> won't<00:03:11.379> affect<00:03:11.739> them<00:03:12.340> you'll<00:03:13.329> be

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
there it won't affect them you'll be

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.599 
there it won't affect them you'll be
fine<00:03:13.659> inside<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.469> poison<00:03:14.799> spill<00:03:15.069> you

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
fine inside of the poison spill you

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.849 
fine inside of the poison spill you
won't<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:15.999> worry<00:03:16.030> about<00:03:16.239> it<00:03:16.569> so<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.709> is

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
won't have to worry about it so that is

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.709 
won't have to worry about it so that is
pretty<00:03:18.040> much<00:03:18.219> it<00:03:18.280> only<00:03:18.879> against<00:03:19.180> troops<00:03:19.510> and
