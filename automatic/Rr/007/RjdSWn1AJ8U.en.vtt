 yes 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.949
 correct not 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:28.140
 Many people have also told me 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.140
 what is it 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.000
 how to have backup copies of your 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.910
 phone if it constantly changes from 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.099
 Stole 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.810
 danny the phone 77 can the phone 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.330
 as they say 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.100
 some people and I want we understand 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.780
 have all things and use this 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.780
 program called titanium 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.550
 here 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.650
 they look for us in prehistory is 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.650
 totally free 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.020
 no no 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.949
 there is a paid version that is super 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.370
 good and good I'll show you how 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.370
 this works 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:27.290
 so that they have the free payment 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.180
 it is difficult as they should always be equal 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:33.509
 have activated 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.430
 the developer options what is 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.430
 debug usb and the origins 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.760
 unknown security 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.129
 what is fundamental for whatever 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.669
 necessary 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.169
 it's unloading and we'll be a little bit 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:51.619
 I apologize I do not know what's going on with 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:54.780
 internet is super slow and literally 

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:57.090
 yes I am very upset why 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.560
 the zinc came from my job and I'm 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.900
 well a little tired and I wanted to be what 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.690
 fastest possible but it has been sometimes 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.950
 which delay is delayed but good 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:10.080
 then for helping people that 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.529
 you need not that not that you can not not like 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.060
 what I'm showing is not 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:18.930
 greatest thing 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.850
 at least 4 k for the times and how they 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.850
 I said it's that easy
