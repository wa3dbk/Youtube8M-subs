but also because it's under continual
operation<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:03.839> always<00:01:04.080> add<00:01:04.350> anti<00:01:04.799> palm<00:01:05.040> into

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
operation you always add anti palm into

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.590 
operation you always add anti palm into
the<00:01:05.460> water<00:01:05.729> mixture

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600
