fairly acceptable there's not you're not
gonna<00:03:50.690> be<00:03:50.780> doing<00:03:50.870> anything<00:03:51.140> too<00:03:51.320> heavy<00:03:51.500> so

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
gonna be doing anything too heavy so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.069 
gonna be doing anything too heavy so
it's<00:03:52.340> pretty<00:03:52.670> well<00:03:53.120> for<00:03:53.360> that<00:03:53.510> manner<00:03:53.750> there's

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
it's pretty well for that manner there's

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.420 
it's pretty well for that manner there's
a<00:03:54.140> lot<00:03:54.230> of<00:03:54.350> menus<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.860> things<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.280> it's

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
a lot of menus and things so it's

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.360 
a lot of menus and things so it's
surprisingly<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:57.170> know<00:03:57.260> robust<00:03:57.739> for

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
surprisingly you know robust for

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.789 
surprisingly you know robust for
something<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.420> know<00:03:59.540> it's<00:03:59.870> such<00:04:00.350> basic

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
something that you know it's such basic

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.150 
something that you know it's such basic
phone<00:04:01.040> but<00:04:01.250> it's<00:04:01.430> surprisingly<00:04:02.590> more<00:04:03.590> than

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
phone but it's surprisingly more than

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.580 
phone but it's surprisingly more than
what<00:04:04.700> we<00:04:04.820> come<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.150> expect<00:04:05.720> from<00:04:05.870> more<00:04:06.170> basic

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
what we come to expect from more basic

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.229 
what we come to expect from more basic
handsets<00:04:07.040> like<00:04:07.280> there's<00:04:07.549> no<00:04:07.670> bluetooth<00:04:08.060> on

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
handsets like there's no bluetooth on

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.840 
handsets like there's no bluetooth on
this<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.540> course<00:04:08.570> but<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.829> do<00:04:10.070> you<00:04:10.519> know<00:04:10.609> these

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
this of course but you do you know these

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.910 
this of course but you do you know these
menus<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.390> things<00:04:11.570> do<00:04:11.810> makes<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.680> seem<00:04:12.859> a

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
menus and things do makes it seem a

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.289 
menus and things do makes it seem a
little<00:04:13.070> bit<00:04:13.250> more<00:04:13.549> sophisticated<00:04:13.730> than

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
little bit more sophisticated than

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.680 
little bit more sophisticated than
really<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.840> is<00:04:15.220> going<00:04:16.220> back<00:04:16.519> we<00:04:16.760> also<00:04:16.910> have<00:04:17.180> the

I could calendar and to-do lists which

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.570 
I could calendar and to-do lists which
is<00:04:21.289> cool<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:21.709> they<00:04:21.919> include<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.310> inside

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
is cool that they include that inside

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.210 
is cool that they include that inside
the<00:04:23.060> box<00:04:23.300> we<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:23.780> games<00:04:24.140> there's<00:04:24.800> no<00:04:24.950> chests

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
Oh which is kind of ironic

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.279 
Oh which is kind of ironic
maybe<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.750> little<00:04:27.810> back<00:04:28.110> home<00:04:28.610> games

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.710 
maybe a little back home games
slack<00:04:31.289> game<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.910> we<00:04:32.910> have<00:04:33.090> bounce<00:04:33.360> which<00:04:33.600> is

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
slack game and we have bounce which is

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.110 
slack game and we have bounce which is
one<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.870> our<00:04:34.050> only<00:04:34.350> games<00:04:34.680> but<00:04:35.100> it<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.639> good

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
one of our only games but it is a good

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.150 
one of our only games but it is a good
game<00:04:36.150> we<00:04:36.960> will<00:04:37.080> see<00:04:37.289> that<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.680> second

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
game we will see that in a second

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.800 
game we will see that in a second
you<00:04:38.400> basically<00:04:38.550> navigate<00:04:39.180> this<00:04:39.300> little<00:04:39.600> ball

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
you basically navigate this little ball

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.920 
you basically navigate this little ball
and<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.919> try<00:04:41.280> to<00:04:41.340> make<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.330> jump<00:04:42.690> over

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
and you try to make it jump over

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.659 
and you try to make it jump over
obstacles<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.800> survive<00:04:44.190> as<00:04:44.430> long<00:04:44.460> as

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
obstacles and survive as long as

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.310 
obstacles and survive as long as
possible<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.360> right<00:04:45.509> now<00:04:45.630> we're<00:04:45.780> underwater<00:04:46.199> I

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
possible so right now we're underwater I

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.510 
possible so right now we're underwater I
think<00:04:46.590> Oh<00:04:46.650> we'll<00:04:46.770> continue<00:04:46.949> from<00:04:47.220> our<00:04:47.370> last

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
think Oh we'll continue from our last

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.939 
think Oh we'll continue from our last
game<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:47.970> as<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.780> can<00:04:48.870> see<00:04:48.930> we<00:04:49.169> jump<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.800> we

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
game and as you can see we jump and we

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.100 
game and as you can see we jump and we
try<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.160> get<00:04:50.340> out<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.639> this<00:04:50.940> water<00:04:51.300> then<00:04:52.050> you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
try to get out of this water then you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.680 
try to get out of this water then you
have<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.320> go<00:04:52.410> back<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.360> basically<00:04:54.360> just

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
have to go back and basically just

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.560 
have to go back and basically just
maneuver<00:04:55.229> this<00:04:55.410> ball<00:04:55.650> around<00:04:56.009> until<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:57.330> you

it's good for you know on the road trips
because<00:05:09.720> it's<00:05:09.930> not<00:05:10.080> because<00:05:11.039> of<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.370> great

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
because it's not because of the great

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.129 
because it's not because of the great
battery<00:05:11.699> life<00:05:11.820> you<00:05:12.060> can<00:05:12.180> do<00:05:12.270> some<00:05:12.479> stuff<00:05:12.660> more

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:14.749 
battery life you can do some stuff more
than<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:13.530> taking<00:05:13.740> calls<00:05:14.009> you<00:05:14.490> should

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
than just taking calls you should

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.310 
than just taking calls you should
utilize<00:05:15.000> more<00:05:15.330> fun<00:05:15.509> features<00:05:15.840> I'm<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.199> gonna

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
and there's a calculator like we said

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.300 
and there's a calculator like we said
which<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:47.340> basically<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:49.560> super<00:05:49.979> simple

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
which is the basically the super simple
