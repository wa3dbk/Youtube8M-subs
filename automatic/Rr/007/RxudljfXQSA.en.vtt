00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
easily this is one kilo of flour this is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.320 
easily this is one kilo of flour this is
the<00:00:21.840> yeast<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.560> sugar<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.250> salt<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.880> Ollie

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.359 
the yeast the sugar the salt and Ollie
were<00:00:24.510> all<00:00:24.689> put<00:00:24.869> together<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.410> left<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
were all put together I left it in a

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
were all put together I left it in a
warm<00:00:26.580> place<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.849> about<00:00:27.029> half<00:00:27.330> an<00:00:27.480> hour<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.810> as

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
warm place for about half an hour and as

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.080 
warm place for about half an hour and as
you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.980> starting<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.580> bubble<00:00:29.760> and

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
you can see it's starting to bubble and

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.179 
you can see it's starting to bubble and
this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.720> call<00:00:31.230> activating<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
this is what we call activating the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
this is what we call activating the
yeast<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.540> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.719> do<00:00:33.840> now<00:00:34.020> is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
yeast so what we're going to do now is

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.459 
yeast so what we're going to do now is
just<00:00:34.200> slowly<00:00:34.649> add<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.200> bring<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> all

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
just slowly add this in and bring it all

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.340 
just slowly add this in and bring it all
in<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.270> needing<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.690> very<00:00:39.899> important

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
in and needing is very very important

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.340 
in and needing is very very important
bringing<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.739> very<00:00:41.010> slowly<00:00:41.399> together<00:00:42.350> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
bringing in very slowly together so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.190 
bringing in very slowly together so
we're<00:00:43.530> holding<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> flour<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.910> what<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.020> want

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
we're holding the flour in what we want

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.760 
we're holding the flour in what we want
to<00:00:46.260> create<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> big<00:00:47.100> dough<00:00:47.280> ball<00:00:48.590> if<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to create is a big dough ball if the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.799 
to create is a big dough ball if the
flowers<00:00:49.980> too<00:00:50.399> dry<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:51.090> add<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
flowers too dry just add a little bit of

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720 
flowers too dry just add a little bit of
water<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.260> little<00:00:52.469> bit<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> time<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.610> we

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
water to a little bit at a time so we

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
water to a little bit at a time so we
don't<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.120> too<00:00:54.329> wet<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:55.559> home<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.010> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
don't want it too wet and at home if you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
time you get home just to make pizza so

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.910 
time you get home just to make pizza so
needing<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.990> quite<00:01:25.200> important<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> want

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
needing is quite important so you want

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.160 
needing is quite important so you want
to<00:01:25.979> need<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> by<00:01:26.369> hand<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> good<00:01:27.420> two<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to need it by hand for a good two to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.060 
to need it by hand for a good two to
three<00:01:28.290> minutes<00:01:28.970> let<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.000> rest<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> say

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
three minutes let it rest and when I say

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.530 
three minutes let it rest and when I say
that<00:01:32.310> at<00:01:32.430> rest<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.119> reactivate

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that at rest and it will reactivate

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780 
that at rest and it will reactivate
again<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.650> usually<00:01:34.950> double<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.549> size

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
again and we usually double up in size

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.580 
again and we usually double up in size
and<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:36.540> we'll<00:01:36.659> take<00:01:36.810> approximately<00:01:37.500> about

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then we'll take approximately about

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.120 
and then we'll take approximately about
10<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.430> 20<00:01:38.820> minutes<00:01:39.140> depending<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.890> abouts

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
10 to 20 minutes depending where abouts
