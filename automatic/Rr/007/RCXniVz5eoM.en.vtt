00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.350 
electric cars and we're gonna see if it
still<00:00:26.619> as<00:00:26.770> pioneering<00:00:27.310> as<00:00:27.490> it<00:00:27.610> was<00:00:27.790> when<00:00:28.330> it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
is the second edition of the leaf and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.020 
is the second edition of the leaf and
the<00:01:01.660> first<00:01:01.899> they<00:01:02.739> had<00:01:03.399> some<00:01:03.579> feedback<00:01:03.760> from

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030

the first they had some feedback from
the<00:01:04.180> users<00:01:04.509> that<00:01:04.540> they<00:01:05.140> were<00:01:05.229> slightly

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
the users that they were slightly

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.139 
the users that they were slightly
anxious<00:01:06.009> every<00:01:06.280> time<00:01:06.640> they<00:01:06.759> switched<00:01:06.940> on<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
anxious every time they switched on the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.029 
anxious every time they switched on the
air-conditioning<00:01:07.930> or<00:01:08.289> they<00:01:08.710> needed<00:01:08.979> to

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:09.039 
air-conditioning or they needed to

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.040

switch<00:01:09.190> on<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.399> heating<00:01:09.850> because<00:01:10.720> they<00:01:10.930> would

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
switch on the heating because they would

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.050 
switch on the heating because they would
lose<00:01:11.259> three<00:01:11.830> or<00:01:11.950> four<00:01:12.160> miles<00:01:12.430> on<00:01:12.610> their<00:01:12.759> range

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
lose three or four miles on their range

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.139 
lose three or four miles on their range
so<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.080> sort<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:15.100> know<00:01:15.250> deal<00:01:15.789> with<00:01:16.000> that

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
so to sort of you know deal with that

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.609 
so to sort of you know deal with that
and<00:01:16.330> remedy<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.750> problem<00:01:17.140> they've<00:01:17.289> added

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
and remedy the problem they've added

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.700 
and remedy the problem they've added
this<00:01:17.740> little<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.880> panel<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:20.110> kind<00:01:20.530> of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
this little so in a panel to kind of

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.680 
this little so in a panel to kind of
offset<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.160> problem<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.910> it<00:01:22.240> does<00:01:22.390> make<00:01:22.569> you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
offset the problem and it does make you

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.960 
offset the problem and it does make you
wonder<00:01:22.929> what<00:01:23.700> possibilities<00:01:24.700> they<00:01:24.819> could

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
wonder what possibilities they could

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.480 
wonder what possibilities they could
have<00:01:25.149> if<00:01:25.390> they<00:01:25.810> turn<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.140> whole<00:01:26.410> roof<00:01:26.740> into<00:01:27.459> a

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
have if they turn the whole roof into a

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.910 
have if they turn the whole roof into a
massive<00:01:27.910> solar<00:01:28.149> panel<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.679> other<00:01:29.830> than

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
massive solar panel and so other than

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.219 
massive solar panel and so other than
that<00:01:30.069> it's<00:01:30.429> not<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> very<00:01:31.119> impressive<00:01:31.690> car<00:01:32.080> from

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
that it's not a very impressive car from

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.620 
that it's not a very impressive car from
the<00:01:32.319> outside<00:01:32.649> but<00:01:33.310> inside<00:01:33.520> it's<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:34.149> totally

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
the outside but inside it's a totally

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.410 
the outside but inside it's a totally
different<00:01:35.020> story

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.209 

it's<00:01:41.420> not<00:01:41.780> just<00:01:42.079> the<00:01:42.200> electric<00:01:42.500> engine<00:01:42.680> that

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
it's not just the electric engine that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.919 
it's not just the electric engine that
makes<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:44.289> nice<00:01:45.289> place<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.740> be<00:01:46.060> inside<00:01:47.060> it's

your dashboard how far you can go you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.949 
your dashboard how far you can go you
get<00:02:16.519> a<00:02:16.549> visual<00:02:16.849> representation<00:02:17.269> where<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
get a visual representation where the

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.190 
get a visual representation where the
white<00:02:18.440> circle<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.519> kind<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.420> your<00:02:20.540> lower<00:02:20.810> limit

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
white circle is kind of your lower limit

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.339 
white circle is kind of your lower limit
and<00:02:21.349> the<00:02:21.980> gray<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.489> your<00:02:22.700> upper<00:02:22.849> limit<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.290> you

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
and the gray is your upper limit so you

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.170 
and the gray is your upper limit so you
probably<00:02:24.709> don't<00:02:25.069> want<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.340> go<00:02:25.489> towards

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
get going yes and says it'll do not 60

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.180 
get going yes and says it'll do not 60
in<00:03:01.520> 11<00:03:01.970> seconds<00:03:02.390> but<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.290> feels<00:03:03.560> far<00:03:03.920> far

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
faster than that and that's because the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.130 
faster than that and that's because the
