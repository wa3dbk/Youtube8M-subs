00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.619
 first step we will carve the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.860
 cake so there you make a cake 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:27.610
 in a rector mold if I chose a 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.220
 sprint kaka lavagne our choices you 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.550
 take a sheet a4 on which you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.710
 draw the end of a 17-car 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.289
 edges a little more rounded and a 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.820
 behind a little late 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:43.510
 thank you on the audi to all and with the knife 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.829
 you tp tricky so especially do not throw 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.660
 not the falls they can serve you 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 afterwards you put them aside 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.510
 so here you cut the little ones 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.530
 details so as to train women and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.930
 the front of the car 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.790
 what I advise you these cuts and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 envied the bottom of the cake for a try a 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.660
 little more realistic 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.950
 then a place a layer of cream 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.950
 can put the second 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 or pose the second form that we also have 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.180
 previously cut to the same size 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:42.010
 that the boss will do here the hood 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:48.130
 of the car so we cut on a 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:49.900
 centimeter or three quarters of the 4 you 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.430
 see the falls will serve us 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:02:01.330
 assured going to make the windshield and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:04.929
 the back of the car cuts them 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.149
 sides while from the first layer of 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.209
 cake finally the one that's over at 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.220
 so there it is to train the 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.380
 rear windows and our shape at 9 pm 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.130
 we will dig the middle to make 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.180
 take out women what flash 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.630
 mcqueen with the bill slightly rounded on 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.630
 the middle 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 now goes without the hood 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.590
 you'll see it's not obvious because 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.200
 that a cake we turn what there is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.880
 had everywhere then it's a little 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.640
 laborious on buses but you go 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.319
 see you will quickly get out and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.660
 anyway it'll be covered with 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.060
 dough knew if there are the little faults that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.220
 so keep it here we managed to 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.459
 come up with a shape that looks like 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.020
 that of flash macro so there you for 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.430
 finn and the little details so as to 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.000
 it's still more right 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.410
 possible to have a cake well-being 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.370
 take a knife that cut me well 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.489
 I used a ceramic knife 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.569
 because it's going great because 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.489
 it's not easy with all these 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.489
 crumbs to get by 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.110
 then we went there was the paw is for 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.600
 recover it you take a dough to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.730
 sugar with a little icing sugar to 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.330
 not that it sticks and you spread your 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:01.910
 sugar dough so as to make a big 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:04.130
 rectangle discovered the car you 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.960
 try patterns of icing sugar on 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.470
 above the dough not from its phase of 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.470
 white spots 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.180
 then we will roll the sugar dough 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.530
 around the roll to be able to the 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.090
 carry on our cake you roll 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.940
 advise you with a small brush 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.660
 removing the icing sugar surplus 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.640
 linked to the outside so that it does not 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.330
 no white spots yet on your 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.740
 sugarpaste 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.290
 so here we bring the cake you have 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.570
 made a small hole beforehand 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:45.219
 spoon for the wheels that it makes a 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:48.699
 little hollow so there 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:51.830
 not his sugar dough on the cake 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.650
 now we will shape high schools so 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.139
 with a small brush you invest more 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.909
 chocolate and with your hands gently 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.309
 watch out the sugar dough we see all 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:04.569
 the traces of wars you use the 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:06.949
 palms of the hands you slip 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:12.199
 delicately in order to marry the 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:14.029
 cake shape then we will use 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.620
 a straightener to feel that it's okay 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:23.779
 give a result a lot of trine is 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:27.009
 much smoother and you to listen to the 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.009
 swimming extra cost 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.230
 so with the 10 hours it's appear 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.520
 the different details of the cake so there 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.300
 you see the parents said two 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.630
 small at the time we see it 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.630
 appear 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:59.180
 then for the eleven you can 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.830
 use either oreo it works it 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.080
 does it too the wheel shape the 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.850
 color either with hues and if you 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.910
 made a name that you cover with a 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.640
 black swimming pudding to close 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:12.410
 then we will stick some decals 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.600
 so you have a choice if you have a 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.400
 food printer soaking you 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.580
 the little signs i 'm going to put you 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.590
 in the in the description of the video 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.180
 the link on which you can find 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.080
 these decal to be able to 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.490
 printed 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.290
 otherwise you hackers improperly 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.330
 classic with a little water that sticks 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.730
 all alone just pay attention to remove them 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.770
 before tasting 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.360
 so for the windshield a piece two 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:45.230
 years so as to make flash eyes 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:46.940
 mcqueen then we'll do the fly the 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.850
 little smile so two piece accomplices 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:57.470
 white sugar dough that you place 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:59.540
 request in cars and that's the result 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.289
 ten months I decided to add 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.780
 latest 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:06.780
 meetic in camera 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.780
 m 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.660
 for
