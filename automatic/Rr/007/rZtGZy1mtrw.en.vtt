 remember central supply as if 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.910
 we were jarocho of supply of sorrow 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.910
 brother in law 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:39.369
 although we already have now what they 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.759

 our mussels are ready that 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.090
 rich delicious can be botana can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.610
 being a strong dish can be the first 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.880
 what you want, I will take 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.679
 the saw is enough during the technique 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 Breaking right hand dry left 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.860
 wet ok ok 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.860
 high do not do anything 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.840
 restart 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.920
 very well 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.790
 maybe you know more than me and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.790
 where you feel when you win 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.069
 salt though she was going to take him and all 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.069
 we put everything 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.709
 very well because we already have the flour that 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.140
 is seasoned now without right hand 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.989
 let's pass the fish 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.049
 it's like our our resistance to 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.659
 that you understand it right hand 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.370
 wet left hand by dip 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.739
 exactly here now with this same 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.310
 hand put it very well enter it 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.490
 flip it very well I'm scared does not happen 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.630
 nothing 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.630
 the little fish had the little fish start and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.630
 alone 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.769
 because that is our next 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.769
 this is the glue 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.959
 Now that the packaging is covered 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.910
 very good is in out 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.220
 that you do not do exactly the sad 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.870
 then you always have a hand in a 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.099
 hand that is with the dry ingredients 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.769
 ok and another consumption that is not right I'm 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.540
 alright now I'll have on the dow less 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.280
 hang up does that very calmly I 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.900
 here I have on the back in these twigs 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.030
 that we can see this is an aniseed flavor 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.780
 delicious we are not going to finally apply 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.849
 to make our dressings and I do 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.560
 several more and please go that 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.879
 You taught me is new I did not know I did not 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.239
 many people do not do it and we do it 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.239
 upside down 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.110
 and if I go well very well 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.850
 rather you go perfect do not pay attention to them 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.880
 but because they put me of sensitive nerve 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.890
 to the irrigation manella that I am mentally not 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.760
 you're really coordinating tables 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.070
 suddenly it fails if it's different there's the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.570
 Brahms monstrosity and we should 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.030
 to put him like the pepillo there is not his 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.310
 desk there so he asks for it and everything 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.430
 because this one comes to here manila or 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.980
 it is coming to make me annoying 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.960
 hear me do not bother my girl please 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.220
 let's make the different dressings 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.969
 to accompany these delicious 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.069
 little fishes 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.559
 so that people do not scold us about what 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:36.539
 waking that we are in vigil but what 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.219
 what did you just say you really have 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.139
 me how it gives me courage to see people who were going to 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.139
 me and I know that and they are crazy 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:50.219
 why with that in the dow we're going to put 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:53.549
 yogurt these dressings is first 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.869
 to say that they were going with cream but as 

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:56.999
 we are taking a little care of the line 

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:59.189
 we have enough with the bread that is 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:00.689
 using bread crumbs or panko the bank are 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.929
 flakes of bread that are available on 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.939
 super is a very good Japanese product 

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:08.579
 I really like to use it because it does not absorb 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.709
 both fat and bread crushed but 

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:13.019
 if you do not have more than ground bread 

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:15.299
 the bread hardens a lot 

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.039
 remember we can not process it and we do not 

00:05:15.299 --> 00:05:19.949
 they leave us much like what it is 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.269
 the bank but do it you want in bread 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.360
 tell it with whatever you want is with 

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.979
 it is not what can happen with sesame 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.589
 compensate h with pistachios is clearly 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.869
 and we go to the dressings we need nothing 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.150
 more Greek yogurt I told them that these 

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:36.420
 dressings first of all and they go 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.860
 cream with cream but how are we 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.830
 taking a little care of the line because we have 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.200
 the painting we are going to do it 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.740
 with Greek yogurt that is low in fat 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.840
 ok ok ok we are ready with this very 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.150
 ready now let's do the other 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.680
 direct let me park this one I'm going to 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.900
 put very little pepper because the 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.230
 Dill is an aniseed taste that I do not want 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.230
 to lose 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:03.220
 let's mix 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.139
 we are ready with your first of that 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.270
 let's see the second dressing 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.430
 we need a Greek yogurt spatula 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.770
 again a touch of vinegar 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.660
 dijon mustard if it does not have mustard 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.700
 dijon of the one you have at home is very 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.470
 good the yellow I love that the one 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.930
 I like more 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:27.430
 icap your tomato sauce faces 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:29.800
 this because I am very concentrated way 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.990
 to arrive with a magnificent import 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.130
 transactions ascended the grain true 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.130
 no more salt 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.779
 and pepper 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.219
 in less than 30 minutes they are dishes from 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.760
 less than 30 minutes 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.850
 and we are doing it very efficiently 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.190
 now I concentrated my housewife well 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:53.880
 what a good dressing we have two dressings 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.639
 ready let's put our kitchen 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:00.770
 from list 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:07.120
 as we're going we're going very simple with 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.120
 the sink yes because it is itchy 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.800
 we have boiling oil 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.860
 and let's see what oil is like 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.360
 we can see the oil we can see that 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.270
 down there in the bottom the oil is 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.510
 they move like little horses 

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:29.360
 say it they move and that means 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.670
 that our oil is about to be able 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.980
 make a deep fry 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.130
 I'm going to start frying, we're ready 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:39.590
 to do it but I will send to your note 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.930
 of the life market 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.970
 afterwards and we see it seems to me how cold 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:46.010
 these little fish though and let's see if 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.290
 we will not see the recipe was left 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.450
