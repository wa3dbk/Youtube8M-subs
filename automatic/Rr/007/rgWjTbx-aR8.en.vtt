hey guys this is will so I don't know
how<00:00:02.340> many<00:00:02.490> of<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.820> have<00:00:03.060> power<00:00:03.449> tools<00:00:03.780> but<00:00:04.200> I

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
how many of you have power tools but I

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.160 
how many of you have power tools but I
just<00:00:05.490> got<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> bunch<00:00:05.910> recently<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.839> do<00:00:06.960> some

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
just got a bunch recently to do some

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.799 
just got a bunch recently to do some
work<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.519> went<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.210> Porter<00:00:09.599> Cable

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
work and I went with Porter Cable

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.360 
work and I went with Porter Cable
because<00:00:10.170> they<00:00:10.320> were<00:00:10.380> cheap<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:11.070> there<00:00:11.280> are<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
because they were cheap but there are a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.430 
because they were cheap but there are a
bunch<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.610> other<00:00:11.759> good<00:00:11.969> ones<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.420> problem<00:00:13.320> is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
bunch of other good ones but problem is

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.539 
bunch of other good ones but problem is
none<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> batteries<00:00:14.370> are

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
none of the batteries are

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.330 
none of the batteries are
interchangeable<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.900> further<00:00:16.770> no<00:00:17.220> one

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
interchangeable and further no one

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.830 
interchangeable and further no one
really<00:00:17.609> wants<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:18.150> two<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.630> everything

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
really wants to have two of everything

really wants to have two of everything
accorded<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.590> cordless<00:00:19.980> cordless<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.939> often

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
accorded in a cordless cordless is often

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.259 
accorded in a cordless cordless is often
really<00:00:21.990> practical<00:00:22.859> useful<00:00:23.279> obviously<00:00:24.060> for<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
really practical useful obviously for a

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
really practical useful obviously for a
drill<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.689> want<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.710> sucks

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
drill you want that but it really sucks

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.179 
drill you want that but it really sucks
when<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.490> run<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.789> batteries<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.560> I

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.660 

experimented<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.430> plugging<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.239> 18<00:00:33.719> volt

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
experimented with plugging in 18 volt

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.299 
experimented with plugging in 18 volt
transformers<00:00:35.670> directly<00:00:36.090> into<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:37.010> base<00:00:38.010> here

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
transformers directly into the base here

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.740 
transformers directly into the base here
but<00:00:38.340> obviously<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:39.300> want<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.570> coming

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
but obviously you don't want it coming

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
but obviously you don't want it coming
out<00:00:39.899> when<00:00:40.050> you're<00:00:40.170> using<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.790> lamented

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
out when you're using it so lamented

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.299 
out when you're using it so lamented
this<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:43.050> gizmo<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
this little gizmo here it's just a

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.520 
this little gizmo here it's just a
simple<00:00:45.270> adapter<00:00:46.910> but<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.510> cool<00:00:48.840> cuz<00:00:49.200> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
simple adapter but it is cool cuz it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.100 
simple adapter but it is cool cuz it
fits<00:00:49.739> right<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:51.300> has<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> perfect<00:00:51.780> pin

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
fits right in and it has a perfect pin

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.340 
fits right in and it has a perfect pin
out<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:53.010> slide<00:00:53.660> into<00:00:54.660> your<00:00:57.350> normally

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
out just slide into your normally

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.260 
out just slide into your normally
cordless<00:00:58.800> tools<00:00:59.719> so<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> looks<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
cordless tools so it looks like this and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.840 
cordless tools so it looks like this and
you<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.390> push<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.610> I<00:01:05.610> had

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you just push it in like that and I had

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.109 
you just push it in like that and I had
this<00:01:06.060> extra<00:01:06.240> 18<00:01:06.960> volts<00:01:07.850> transformer<00:01:08.850> lying

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this extra 18 volts transformer lying

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.730 
this extra 18 volts transformer lying
around<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.840> it's<00:01:09.990> only<00:01:10.110> four-and-a-half

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
around now it's only four-and-a-half

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
around now it's only four-and-a-half
amps<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.650> much<00:01:13.650> power<00:01:14.580> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
amps so that's not that much power but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.100 
amps so that's not that much power but
if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.810> start<00:01:16.049> out<00:01:16.170> slow<00:01:17.479> they<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:18.659> still

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
if you start out slow they will still

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:28.000 
if you start out slow they will still
run<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.470> sawzall<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.280> circular<00:01:21.150> saw

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.820 

before<00:01:28.910> blowing<00:01:29.320> but<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:30.470> you've<00:01:30.650> got<00:01:30.800> a

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
before blowing but if you've got a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.550 
before blowing but if you've got a
higher<00:01:31.490> amperage<00:01:31.940> 18<00:01:32.660> volt<00:01:32.900> adapter<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.500> can

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
higher amperage 18 volt adapter you can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.040 
higher amperage 18 volt adapter you can
use<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:33.950> or<00:01:34.660> potentially<00:01:35.660> they<00:01:35.750> could<00:01:35.870> put

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
use that or potentially they could put

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.580 
use that or potentially they could put
two<00:01:36.260> little<00:01:36.530> ports<00:01:36.800> here<00:01:37.040> and<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:38.000> could<00:01:38.590> run

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
two little ports here and it could run

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.450 
two little ports here and it could run
the<00:01:40.420> running<00:01:41.420> in<00:01:41.750> parallel<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.650> add<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
the running in parallel and add the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.790 
the running in parallel and add the
average<00:01:43.730> together<00:01:44.080> but<00:01:45.080> yep<00:01:45.320> there<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.560> have

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
average together but yep there you have

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.610 
average together but yep there you have
it<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:46.370> I'm<00:01:47.180> also<00:01:47.390> thinking<00:01:47.720> about<00:01:47.810> doing<00:01:48.470> an

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
it so I'm also thinking about doing an

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.230 
it so I'm also thinking about doing an
adapter<00:01:49.160> so<00:01:49.190> that<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.610> can<00:01:49.790> plug<00:01:50.000> in<00:01:50.210> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
adapter so that you can plug in a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.230 
adapter so that you can plug in a
battery<00:01:50.660> from<00:01:50.840> another<00:01:51.050> company<00:01:51.340> into<00:01:52.340> you

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
battery from another company into you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.740 
battery from another company into you
know<00:01:53.560> another<00:01:54.560> company<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:56.000> make<00:01:56.120> an<00:01:56.240> adapter

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
know another company to make an adapter

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.900 
know another company to make an adapter
for<00:01:56.780> these<00:01:57.140> these<00:01:57.470> pin<00:01:57.740> outs<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.610> they're

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
for these these pin outs but they're

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.460 
for these these pin outs but they're
essentially<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> exact<00:01:59.690> same<00:01:59.900> form<00:02:00.230> factor

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
essentially the exact same form factor

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.950 
essentially the exact same form factor
and<00:02:00.860> all<00:02:01.010> the<00:02:01.130> batteries<00:02:01.550> for<00:02:02.510> these<00:02:02.600> sorts<00:02:02.900> of

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
and all the batteries for these sorts of

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.830 
and all the batteries for these sorts of
tools<00:02:03.200> but<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.980> pin<00:02:04.310> out<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.730> different<00:02:05.600> so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
tools but the pin out is different so

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.020 
tools but the pin out is different so
that<00:02:05.870> you<00:02:06.110> can't<00:02:06.530> share<00:02:07.250> batteries<00:02:07.700> anyway

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that you can't share batteries anyway

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.480 
that you can't share batteries anyway
let<00:02:08.990> me<00:02:09.020> know<00:02:09.110> your<00:02:09.410> thoughts<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.980> if<00:02:10.250> you've

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
let me know your thoughts and if you've

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.170 
let me know your thoughts and if you've
ever<00:02:10.640> had<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.000> problem<00:02:11.060> thanks<00:02:11.840> bye
