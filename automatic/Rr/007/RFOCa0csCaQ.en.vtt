when<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.150> went<00:03:03.390> ahead<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.020> picked<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.860> my

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
when I went ahead and picked up my

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.199 
when I went ahead and picked up my
camera<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.530> took<00:03:07.530> some<00:03:07.770> video<00:03:08.070> now<00:03:08.430> I

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
camera here and took some video now I

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.030 
camera here and took some video now I
was<00:03:09.870> fairly<00:03:10.290> steady<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> object<00:03:11.430> and

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
was fairly steady on the object and

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.610 
was fairly steady on the object and
despite<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.900> we<00:03:15.900> lost<00:03:16.080> out<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> object

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
despite that we lost out of the object

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.030 
despite that we lost out of the object
really<00:03:17.040> quickly<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:19.080> continued<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.709> film

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
really quickly and I continued to film

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.910 
really quickly and I continued to film
because<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.489> figured<00:03:20.940> well<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.680> still<00:03:22.680> right

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
because I figured well it's still right

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.750 
because I figured well it's still right
there<00:03:24.440> take<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> look<00:03:25.650> at<00:03:25.739> this<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:25.980> 39<00:03:26.400> seconds

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
there take a look at this is 39 seconds

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.720 
there take a look at this is 39 seconds
to<00:03:26.880> video<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.750> object<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.890> only<00:03:29.070> visible<00:03:29.459> for

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
to video the object is only visible for

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.080 
to video the object is only visible for
the<00:03:29.790> first<00:03:30.080> 10<00:03:31.080> seconds<00:03:31.440> or<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:32.640> then<00:03:32.940> it

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the first 10 seconds or so and then it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.449 
the first 10 seconds or so and then it
does<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:34.970> well<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.360> goes<00:03:36.570> away<00:03:36.920> so<00:03:37.920> I'll<00:03:38.310> be

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
does a well it goes away so I'll be

00:03:38.459 --> 00:04:20.090 
does a well it goes away so I'll be
right<00:03:38.549> back<00:03:38.730> with<00:03:38.910> this

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.620 

ok<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.160> now<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.459> going<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.639> show<00:04:21.790> you<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:22.449> same

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
ok so now I'm going to show you the same

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.710 
ok so now I'm going to show you the same
footage<00:04:24.060> with<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.150> brightness<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.660> contrast

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
footage with the brightness and contrast

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.480 
footage with the brightness and contrast
adjusted<00:04:26.680> and<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.889> really<00:04:27.160> doesn't<00:04:27.340> show

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
adjusted and it really doesn't show

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.420 
adjusted and it really doesn't show
anything<00:04:27.820> different<00:04:28.570> than<00:04:29.100> when<00:04:30.100> you<00:04:30.220> just

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
anything different than when you just

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.730 
anything different than when you just
saw<00:04:30.610> all<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.060> vents<00:04:31.389> to<00:04:31.419> clear<00:04:31.810> image<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.590> the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
saw all the vents to clear image and the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.550 
saw all the vents to clear image and the
outline<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.310> object<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:35.139> take<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.380> look

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
outline of this object going take a look

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.800 
outline of this object going take a look
at<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.740> now

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
okay so now I'm going to throw some

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.959 
okay so now I'm going to throw some
filters<00:04:59.180> on<00:04:59.509> here<00:05:00.189> zoom<00:05:01.189> out<00:05:01.340> let's<00:05:01.669> speed<00:05:01.939> it

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:01.969 
filters on here zoom out let's speed it

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.739 
filters on here zoom out let's speed it
up<00:05:02.180> slow<00:05:02.389> it<00:05:02.599> down<00:05:03.969> all<00:05:04.969> the<00:05:05.150> amount<00:05:05.419> of<00:05:05.479> stuff

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749 
up slow it down all the amount of stuff

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.670 
up slow it down all the amount of stuff
that<00:05:05.930> we<00:05:06.050> do<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:08.020> see<00:05:09.020> what<00:05:09.139> you<00:05:09.229> think<00:05:09.469> if<00:05:09.650> you

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
that we do and see what you think if you

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.100 
that we do and see what you think if you
can<00:05:09.949> see<00:05:10.159> anything<00:05:10.580> flapping<00:05:11.389> or<00:05:11.539> flying

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110

can see anything flapping or flying
what<00:05:12.259> was<00:05:12.409> that<00:05:12.439> plane<00:05:12.889> personally<00:05:13.849> I<00:05:13.909> don't

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:14.029 
what was that plane personally I don't

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.320 
what was that plane personally I don't
see<00:05:14.300> these<00:05:14.749> things<00:05:15.099> but<00:05:16.099> going<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.759> take<00:05:17.300> a

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
see these things but going to take a

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:27.780 
see these things but going to take a
quick<00:05:17.599> look<00:05:17.719> at<00:05:17.870> this<00:05:18.020> edited<00:05:18.919> footage

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:06:12.450 

you

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.189 

so<00:06:14.500> basically<00:06:15.500> and<00:06:15.979> it's<00:06:16.190> novices<00:06:16.900> I've<00:06:17.900> got

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
so basically and it's novices I've got

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.180 
so basically and it's novices I've got
an<00:06:18.289> unidentified<00:06:18.470> object<00:06:19.069> that<00:06:20.440> we<00:06:21.440> didn't

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
an unidentified object that we didn't

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.939 
an unidentified object that we didn't
see<00:06:22.340> on<00:06:22.669> one<00:06:23.000> set<00:06:23.479> of<00:06:23.569> video<00:06:23.810> which<00:06:24.470> was<00:06:24.650> cut

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:24.949 
see on one set of video which was cut

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:27.570 
see on one set of video which was cut
off<00:06:25.389> hopefully<00:06:26.389> because<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:26.990> hit<00:06:27.139> the<00:06:27.259> button

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
off hopefully because I hit the button

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.409 
off hopefully because I hit the button
not<00:06:28.580> because<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.090> aliens<00:06:29.539> did<00:06:29.810> it<00:06:29.960> I<00:06:30.229> hope<00:06:31.419> and

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
not because the aliens did it I hope and

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.839 
not because the aliens did it I hope and
then<00:06:32.599> we<00:06:32.750> have<00:06:32.960> another<00:06:33.349> video<00:06:33.770> where<00:06:34.129> we

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
then we have another video where we

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:36.850 
then we have another video where we
actually<00:06:35.000> did<00:06:35.360> observe<00:06:35.509> the<00:06:35.780> object<00:06:36.259> and<00:06:36.560> the

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
actually did observe the object and the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.920 
actually did observe the object and the
object<00:06:37.060> behaved<00:06:38.060> in<00:06:38.300> a<00:06:38.389> strange<00:06:38.690> manner<00:06:39.849> these

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
object behaved in a strange manner these

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.990 
object behaved in a strange manner these
white<00:06:41.979> fly<00:06:42.979> I'm<00:06:43.190> gonna<00:06:43.340> call<00:06:43.520> them<00:06:43.699> planes

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
white fly I'm gonna call them planes

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.480 
white fly I'm gonna call them planes
because<00:06:44.330> I'm<00:06:45.319> gonna<00:06:45.500> assume<00:06:45.979> they're

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:46.490 
because I'm gonna assume they're

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.999 
because I'm gonna assume they're
freaking<00:06:46.940> planes<00:06:47.229> however<00:06:48.229> they<00:06:48.620> just<00:06:48.830> don't

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:49.009 
freaking planes however they just don't

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.020 
freaking planes however they just don't
appear<00:06:49.340> to<00:06:49.370> act<00:06:49.610> like<00:06:49.880> planes<00:06:50.319> and<00:06:51.789> we<00:06:52.789> see

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
appear to act like planes and we see

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.930 
appear to act like planes and we see
these<00:06:53.240> quite<00:06:53.720> quite<00:06:54.289> a<00:06:54.319> bit<00:06:54.620> and<00:06:55.099> my<00:06:55.430> wife<00:06:55.639> has
