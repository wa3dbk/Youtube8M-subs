healer usually what you want to kill is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.350 
healer usually what you want to kill is
first<00:02:23.940> place<00:02:24.950> which<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:25.980> his<00:02:26.310> main<00:02:26.550> here<00:02:27.090> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
first place which is his main here and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.840 
first place which is his main here and
people<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.140> his<00:02:28.350> controller<00:02:29.010> but

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
people think is his controller but

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.970 
people think is his controller but
because<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.390> type<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> program<00:02:31.620> he<00:02:31.800> uses

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
because of the type of program he uses

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.979 
because of the type of program he uses
to<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.850> doesn't<00:02:33.239> matter<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.780> take

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
to do this it doesn't matter if you take

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.160 
to do this it doesn't matter if you take
out<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.440> head<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:36.239> simply<00:02:36.720> gives<00:02:36.900> him<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
out the head it simply gives him the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.330 
out the head it simply gives him the
next<00:02:37.500> one<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.480> doesn't<00:02:40.140> even<00:02:40.200> matter<00:02:40.470> but

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
next one so it doesn't even matter but

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.090 
next one so it doesn't even matter but
usually<00:02:42.170> everyone<00:02:43.170> knows<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.560> target<00:02:43.890> first

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
usually everyone knows the target first

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.970 
usually everyone knows the target first
place<00:02:44.370> first<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.319> other<00:02:46.350> healers

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
