now so you're going to be contracting

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.910 
now so you're going to be contracting
your<00:01:13.270> latissimus<00:01:13.750> dorsi<00:01:14.020> muscles<00:01:14.680> your<00:01:14.770> lap

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
your latissimus dorsi muscles your lap

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.310 
your latissimus dorsi muscles your lap
muscles<00:01:15.310> are<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.270> muscles<00:01:16.840> on<00:01:16.960> your<00:01:16.990> back

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320

those<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.800> contracting<00:01:27.310> those<00:01:27.430> down<00:01:27.760> as<00:01:28.060> you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
those on contracting those down as you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.960 
those on contracting those down as you
pull<00:01:29.350> your<00:01:29.680> leg<00:01:30.040> behind<00:01:30.280> each<00:01:30.930> each<00:01:31.930> each<00:01:32.970> i

should<00:01:34.330> say<00:01:34.360> stroke<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.020> here<00:01:35.170> we<00:01:35.260> go<00:01:35.290> take<00:01:35.950> a

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
should say stroke so here we go take a

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.399 
should say stroke so here we go take a
stroke<00:01:36.370> now<00:01:36.550> watch

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.039 

now<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.039> if<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.640> watch<00:01:41.789> what<00:01:42.030> happens<00:01:42.390> see

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
now you if you watch what happens see

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.709 
now you if you watch what happens see
how<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:43.409> pushing<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.039> back<00:01:44.719> contracting

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
how now I'm pushing my back contracting

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.550 
how now I'm pushing my back contracting
my<00:01:45.840> lap<00:01:46.049> muscles<00:01:46.499> here<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:46.979> side<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:48.560> now

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
my lap muscles here on the side and now

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.919 
my lap muscles here on the side and now
here<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> other<00:01:50.159> side<00:01:53.299> see<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.569> now

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
here on the other side see here now

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.130 
here on the other side see here now
pushing<00:01:55.469> and<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.179> does<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.630> forces

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
pushing and what this does is it forces

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
pushing and what this does is it forces
you<00:01:58.289> to<00:02:00.829> sort<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.890> make<00:02:02.069> a<00:02:02.099> turn<00:02:02.459> back<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you to sort of make a turn back and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.020 
you to sort of make a turn back and
forth<00:02:03.179> like<00:02:03.359> this<00:02:03.509> so

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.389 

your<00:02:07.600> back<00:02:07.810> your<00:02:08.380> back<00:02:08.410> is<00:02:08.770> pushing<00:02:09.130> your<00:02:09.250> body

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
your back your back is pushing your body

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.940 
your back your back is pushing your body
and<00:02:09.700> almost<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.179> fish<00:02:10.660> like<00:02:10.869> movement

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.530 

step<00:02:17.950> 3<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:20.730> coordinate<00:02:21.730> your<00:02:21.790> hips<00:02:22.239> and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
step 3 is to coordinate your hips and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.089 
step 3 is to coordinate your hips and
your<00:02:23.200> arms<00:02:24.000> so<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:26.440> hips<00:02:26.470> are<00:02:26.769> straight

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
your arms so that your hips are straight

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.520 
your arms so that your hips are straight
and<00:02:27.370> your<00:02:27.730> arms<00:02:27.760> are<00:02:28.060> opposite<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.750> your<00:02:29.080> feel

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
and your arms are opposite of your feel

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.800 
and your arms are opposite of your feel
like<00:02:29.680> you're<00:02:29.830> pulling<00:02:29.950> behind<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:37.269> this<00:02:37.660> is

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
like you're pulling behind and this is

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.479 
like you're pulling behind and this is
what<00:02:38.049> I<00:02:38.080> want<00:02:38.349> you<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.650> practice<00:02:38.830> as<00:02:39.220> part<00:02:39.459> of

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
what I want you to practice as part of

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:49.809 
what I want you to practice as part of
the<00:02:39.610> step

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.790 

what's<00:02:50.819> important<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.300> notice<00:02:51.480> in<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
what's important to notice in in this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.290 
what's important to notice in in this
particular<00:02:52.980> step<00:02:53.550> when<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.819> when<00:02:54.150> you're

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
particular step when you when you're

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.500 
particular step when you when you're
learning<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.720> insanity<00:02:55.319> trick<00:02:56.099> is<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:57.239> sort

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
learning the insanity trick is you sort

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.949 
learning the insanity trick is you sort
of<00:02:57.569> pivoting<00:02:57.989> on<00:02:58.110> your<00:02:58.290> heels<00:02:58.940> so<00:02:59.940> when<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> want

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
of pivoting on your heels so when I want

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.150 
of pivoting on your heels so when I want
to<00:03:01.080> pull<00:03:01.440> back<00:03:05.030> I'm<00:03:06.030> pivoting<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
to pull back I'm pivoting on the on the

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.750 
to pull back I'm pivoting on the on the
