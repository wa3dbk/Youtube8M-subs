 quite rewarding and good as well as 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.840
 he was commenting 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.480
 I feel basically like when I 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.370
 I made this channel the main one very 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.580
 excited with wanting to start and 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.860
 s looking forward to putting this new 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.450
 project and well guys just 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.940
 tell you a little bit that this channel 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.950
 secondary is going to go for anything but a 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.840
 channel everything is what happens to me 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.400
 by the head or what you guys 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.970
 propose you hear why you do not do this 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.100
 Well, because we're not going to see it for him 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.720
 then in this main channel what 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.700
 let's do is leave a little more 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.520
 focused on what the series' the a ícaro 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 crop not maybe something so 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.110
 see interesting so you see it good 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 to climb also here but usually 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.220
 is going to be the clear duty gta iv in the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.470
 secondary channel you will be able to find 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.780
 variety that I imagine a lot of people 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.020
 you will like the variety I know there 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.390
 others who do not want to leave gta because 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.760
 you like you are super hooked that I 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.620
 It's also worth it but yes, I like it 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.360
 in when 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.130
 if there was some other type of game 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.350
 basically because for example I do not 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.600
 only act any a call of duty and 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.430
 I also usually play destiny and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.140
 example to this day or another type of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.670
 games that are coming out then yes 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.670
 I want to share it with you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.230
 share those fun moments that 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.110
 we usually go through sometimes because for example 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 to give an example, it is worth distinguishing 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.700
 there are many times that I am that 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.350
 I break my ass laughing at the nonsense 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.150
 we can not only get to do 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.490
