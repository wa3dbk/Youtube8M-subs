too<00:00:40.670> special<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.239> guess<00:00:41.450> it<00:00:41.600> just<00:00:41.630> makes<00:00:41.989> some

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
too special I guess it just makes some

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.799 
too special I guess it just makes some
really<00:00:42.530> good<00:00:42.739> split<00:00:43.010> pusher<00:00:43.370> in<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.640> sense<00:00:43.910> so

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
really good split pusher in a sense so

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.299 
really good split pusher in a sense so
yeah<00:00:44.900> that<00:00:45.080> was<00:00:45.170> kind<00:00:45.350> of<00:00:45.379> boring<00:00:45.590> let's<00:00:46.070> go<00:00:46.190> on

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
yeah that was kind of boring let's go on

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.430 
yeah that was kind of boring let's go on
to<00:00:46.460> his<00:00:46.580> cue<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.420> it's<00:00:47.720> actually<00:00:48.110> getting<00:00:48.290> a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
to his cue so it's actually getting a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.950 
to his cue so it's actually getting a
nerf<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.550> silence<00:00:49.940> duration<00:00:50.420> and<00:00:50.570> also

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
nerf to the silence duration and also

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.540 
nerf to the silence duration and also
the<00:00:51.050> movement<00:00:51.230> speed<00:00:51.620> duration<00:00:52.070> both

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the movement speed duration both

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.310 
the movement speed duration both
directions<00:00:52.970> have<00:00:53.330> been<00:00:53.390> reduced<00:00:53.840> by<00:00:53.930> one

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
directions have been reduced by one

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.920 
directions have been reduced by one
second<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.100> he<00:00:55.489> is<00:00:55.610> getting<00:00:55.879> nerfed<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.360> maybe

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
second so he is getting nerfed and maybe

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.479 
second so he is getting nerfed and maybe
it<00:00:57.080> has<00:00:57.199> to<00:00:57.230> do<00:00:57.410> something<00:00:57.620> with<00:00:57.739> him<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.280> don't

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
spinning on them and basically one

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.670 
spinning on them and basically one
shotting<00:01:01.790> him<00:01:01.910> if<00:01:02.090> he<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.630> ad<00:01:02.870> as<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.560> know

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
there's not really a lot you can do if

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.690 
there's not really a lot you can do if
you<00:01:05.600> are<00:01:05.780> silenced<00:01:06.170> for<00:01:06.350> 2.5<00:01:06.800> seconds<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:07.550> yeah

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
you are silenced for 2.5 seconds so yeah

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.670 
you are silenced for 2.5 seconds so yeah
of<00:01:07.910> course<00:01:08.180> overall<00:01:08.720> nerf<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.290> there<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.530> some

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
of course overall nerf but there is some

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.320 
of course overall nerf but there is some
conversation<00:01:10.340> later<00:01:10.550> and<00:01:10.790> his<00:01:11.180> other

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
conversation later and his other

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.109 
conversation later and his other
abilities<00:01:11.600> next<00:01:12.560> up<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:12.890> going<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.190> be<00:01:13.340> his<00:01:13.640> W

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
abilities next up is going to be his W

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.850 
abilities next up is going to be his W
so<00:01:14.570> instead<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.960> increasing<00:01:15.110> your<00:01:15.500> bonus

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
so instead of increasing your bonus

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.710 
so instead of increasing your bonus
armor<00:01:16.070> and<00:01:16.340> magic<00:01:16.369> resist<00:01:16.759> by<00:01:17.030> twenty<00:01:17.390> percent

armor and magic resist by twenty percent

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.780 
armor and magic resist by twenty percent
each<00:01:18.200> kill<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.710> get<00:01:18.860> gives<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.369> zero<00:01:19.610> point

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
each kill you get gives you zero point

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.060 
each kill you get gives you zero point
25<00:01:20.210> armor<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:20.869> magic<00:01:20.899> resist<00:01:21.259> up<00:01:21.680> to<00:01:22.040> a

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
maximum of 30 bonus resists to get the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.590 
maximum of 30 bonus resists to get the
full<00:01:24.710> compensation<00:01:25.040> out<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:25.729> buff<00:01:25.970> you

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
full compensation out of this buff you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.480 
full compensation out of this buff you
must<00:01:26.810> have<00:01:26.960> 120<00:01:27.560> creep<00:01:27.770> score<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.399> in

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
must have 120 creep score so in

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.160 
must have 120 creep score so in
comparison<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.149> old<00:01:29.300> positive<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:29.899> think

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
comparison to the old positive I think

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.109 
comparison to the old positive I think
this<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.470> better<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.490> mid<00:01:31.640> game<00:01:31.789> as

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
this is better in the mid game as

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.820 
this is better in the mid game as
relating<00:01:32.720> you'll<00:01:32.959> probably<00:01:33.229> have<00:01:33.530> like

relating you'll probably have like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.430 
relating you'll probably have like

and<00:01:42.800> armor<00:01:43.250> at<00:01:43.459> like<00:01:43.880> 15<00:01:44.300> minutes<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.630> still

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
and armor at like 15 minutes is still

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.359 
and armor at like 15 minutes is still
pretty<00:01:44.990> good<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:45.740> they<00:01:45.860> take<00:01:46.009> out<00:01:46.190> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
pretty good but they take out the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.730 
pretty good but they take out the
tenacity<00:01:46.670> when<00:01:47.209> you<00:01:47.300> use<00:01:47.420> active<00:01:47.899> in<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.440> sense

tenacity when you use active in a sense

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.580 
tenacity when you use active in a sense
I<00:01:48.890> do<00:01:49.009> feel<00:01:49.580> like<00:01:49.789> it<00:01:50.030> is<00:01:50.209> an<00:01:50.479> overall<00:01:51.020> buffin

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
I do feel like it is an overall buffin

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.680 
I do feel like it is an overall buffin
early<00:01:51.890> game<00:01:52.069> and<00:01:52.310> mid<00:01:52.520> game<00:01:52.670> but<00:01:53.300> it<00:01:53.509> kind<00:01:53.660> of

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
early game and mid game but it kind of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.969 
early game and mid game but it kind of
falls<00:01:53.929> off<00:01:54.110> late<00:01:54.319> game<00:01:54.530> since<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.830> visited

falls off late game since you visited

falls off late game since you visited
nasty<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:55.819> the<00:01:55.910> bonus<00:01:56.209> armor<00:01:56.420> from<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.050> old

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
passive finally we're going to be going

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.240 
passive finally we're going to be going
over<00:01:59.810> something<00:02:00.229> interesting<00:02:00.740> which<00:02:00.920> got

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
over something interesting which got

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.120 
over something interesting which got
overhaul<00:02:02.030> of<00:02:02.270> big<00:02:02.569> changes<00:02:02.780> ok<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.800> best<00:02:03.979> way

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
overhaul of big changes ok the best way

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.650 
overhaul of big changes ok the best way
to<00:02:04.190> explain<00:02:04.550> what<00:02:04.789> happened<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.240> e<00:02:05.390> is

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
to explain what happened to is e is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.870 
to explain what happened to is e is
basically<00:02:06.410> it's<00:02:06.830> weaker<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.399> early<00:02:07.700> game

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
basically it's weaker in the early game

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.820 
basically it's weaker in the early game
but<00:02:08.450> once<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.750> get<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.959> few<00:02:09.050> levels<00:02:09.410> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
but once you get a few levels it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.559 
but once you get a few levels it
definitely<00:02:10.280> becomes<00:02:10.640> more<00:02:10.849> stronger<00:02:11.270> than<00:02:11.450> it

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
definitely becomes more stronger than it

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.690 
definitely becomes more stronger than it
used<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.870> be<00:02:12.080> because<00:02:12.530> everything<00:02:13.250> levels<00:02:13.550> do

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
used to be because everything levels do

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.460 
used to be because everything levels do
you<00:02:13.760> get<00:02:13.880> an<00:02:13.970> extra<00:02:14.090> damage<00:02:14.420> tank<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.440> a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
you get an extra damage tank up to a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.070 
you get an extra damage tank up to a
maximum<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.980> 10<00:02:16.520> damage<00:02:16.730> tix<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.390> it<00:02:17.930> does

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
maximum of 10 damage tix and it does

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.050 
maximum of 10 damage tix and it does
start<00:02:18.290> off<00:02:18.410> at<00:02:18.590> five<00:02:18.800> ticks<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.640> used<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:19.910> be

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
start off at five ticks it used to be

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.610 
start off at five ticks it used to be
six<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.569> that's<00:02:20.810> why<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:20.990> kind<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.230> got<00:02:21.380> a<00:02:21.410> nerf

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
six and that's why I kind of got a nerf

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.500 
six and that's why I kind of got a nerf
at<00:02:21.920> least<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.280> early<00:02:22.550> game<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:22.880> for<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
at least for early game as for the

at least for early game as for the
damage<00:02:23.870> itself<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.770> way<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.040> works<00:02:25.069> now<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.730> it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
damage itself the way it works now is it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.059 
damage itself the way it works now is it

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
does reduce damage you're hitting

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.410 
does reduce damage you're hitting
multiple<00:02:28.220> enemies<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:29.120> if<00:02:29.209> you're<00:02:29.270> hitting

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
multiple enemies but if you're hitting

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180 
multiple enemies but if you're hitting
just<00:02:29.630> one<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.110> does<00:02:30.349> more<00:02:30.530> damage<00:02:30.590> than<00:02:31.040> it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
just one it does more damage than it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.830 
just one it does more damage than it
used<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> do<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:32.060> also<00:02:32.180> no<00:02:32.510> more<00:02:32.690> movement

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
used to do there's also no more movement

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.210 
used to do there's also no more movement
speed<00:02:33.110> reduction<00:02:33.349> when<00:02:33.980> you're<00:02:34.099> going

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
speed reduction when you're going

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.730 
speed reduction when you're going
through<00:02:34.310> minions<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.330> ad<00:02:35.510> ratio<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.260> base

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
through minions the ad ratio and base

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.460 
through minions the ad ratio and base
damage<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.310> also<00:02:37.790> increased<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.870> full<00:02:39.200> ad

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
damage is also increased so full ad

damage is also increased so full ad
Garen<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:39.920> way<00:02:40.430> more<00:02:40.640> better

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
Garen is way more better

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.150 
Garen is way more better
probably<00:02:41.870> just<00:02:42.080> say<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.440> black<00:02:42.650> Leah<00:02:42.830> should

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
probably just say that black Leah should

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.070 
probably just say that black Leah should
be<00:02:43.310> your<00:02:43.520> only<00:02:43.640> offensive<00:02:44.060> item<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:44.510> an<00:02:44.840> actual

be your only offensive item in an actual

shreds<00:02:49.400> armor<00:02:49.670> way<00:02:49.849> faster<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.959> if<00:02:51.200> you

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
shreds armor way faster is that if you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.920 
shreds armor way faster is that if you
stop<00:02:51.769> spinning<00:02:52.040> manually<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.330> duration<00:02:53.750> that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
stop spinning manually the duration that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.050 
stop spinning manually the duration that
was<00:02:54.050> remaining<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.650> refunded<00:02:55.550> to<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.760> so

was remaining is refunded to you so
that's<00:02:56.360> a<00:02:56.510> good<00:02:56.660> thing<00:02:56.870> in<00:02:57.019> team<00:02:57.200> fights<00:02:57.349> since

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
that's a good thing in team fights since

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.589 
that's a good thing in team fights since
say<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.280> finished<00:02:58.910> off<00:02:59.060> an<00:02:59.209> enemy<00:02:59.420> with<00:02:59.569> your

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
say you finished off an enemy with your

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.300 
say you finished off an enemy with your
e<00:02:59.900> then<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.620> get<00:03:00.769> some<00:03:00.920> your<00:03:01.040> code<00:03:01.190> on<00:03:01.280> back

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
e then you get some your code on back

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.130 
e then you get some your code on back
since<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:01.970> don't<00:03:02.090> have<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.269> keep<00:03:02.420> spinning<00:03:02.840> it

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
since you don't have to keep spinning it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.559 
since you don't have to keep spinning it
also<00:03:03.290> still<00:03:03.680> scales<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.190> crit<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:04.910> honestly

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
also still scales with crit but honestly

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.870 
also still scales with crit but honestly

bit<00:03:14.330> weaker<00:03:14.690> than<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.959> used<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.200> be<00:03:15.349> but<00:03:15.890> after

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
bit weaker than it used to be but after

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.009 
bit weaker than it used to be but after
loan<00:03:16.400> for<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:17.060> definitely<00:03:17.450> scales<00:03:17.690> up<00:03:17.840> way

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
loan for it definitely scales up way

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.420 
loan for it definitely scales up way
better<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.530> has<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.769> lot<00:03:19.069> more<00:03:19.220> damage

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
better and has a lot more damage

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.550 
better and has a lot more damage
especially<00:03:20.120> in<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.569> late<00:03:20.750> game<00:03:20.930> he<00:03:21.140> becomes<00:03:21.440> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
especially in the late game he becomes a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.100 
especially in the late game he becomes a
tough<00:03:21.799> bruiser<00:03:22.099> and<00:03:22.840> finally<00:03:23.840> we'll<00:03:24.019> be

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
tough bruiser and finally we'll be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.870 
tough bruiser and finally we'll be
talking<00:03:24.260> about<00:03:24.410> his<00:03:24.650> new<00:03:24.860> ultimate<00:03:25.370> passive

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
talking about his new ultimate passive

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.420 
talking about his new ultimate passive
the<00:03:26.329> villain<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.560> great<00:03:27.890> change<00:03:28.220> and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the villain this is a great change and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.610 
the villain this is a great change and
it's<00:03:28.610> pretty<00:03:28.790> exciting<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.230> champion

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
it's pretty exciting so the champion

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.140 
it's pretty exciting so the champion
with<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.860> most<00:03:31.040> recent<00:03:31.250> killing<00:03:31.730> spree<00:03:31.970> is

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
with the most recent killing spree is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.390 
with the most recent killing spree is
marked<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.079> villain<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:33.860> basically<00:03:34.280> what

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
marked as the villain so basically what

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.740 
marked as the villain so basically what
happens<00:03:34.730> when<00:03:34.940> someone<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.299> marked<00:03:35.540> as<00:03:35.599> a

ultimate on the villain it deals two

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.479 
ultimate on the villain it deals two
damage<00:03:49.690> yes<00:03:50.690> that's<00:03:51.170> right<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.829> get<00:03:51.950> Darius

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
damage yes that's right you get Darius

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.879 
damage yes that's right you get Darius
ultimate<00:03:52.910> now<00:03:53.329> in<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.569> form<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.930> demacia<00:03:54.440> so

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
ultimate now in the form of demacia so

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.199 
ultimate now in the form of demacia so
none<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.100> those<00:03:55.220> champions<00:03:55.670> are<00:03:55.790> truly

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
none of those champions are truly

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.090 
none of those champions are truly
counterparts<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.049> each<00:03:57.170> other<00:03:57.350> which<00:03:57.739> is<00:03:57.920> kind

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
counterparts of each other which is kind

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.860 
counterparts of each other which is kind
of<00:03:58.160> cool<00:03:58.220> in<00:03:58.519> a<00:03:58.639> sense<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.269> basically<00:03:59.389> what

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
of cool in a sense and so basically what

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.990 
of cool in a sense and so basically what
I've<00:04:00.019> gathered<00:04:00.350> from<00:04:00.530> this<00:04:00.650> ability<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:01.220> that

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
I've gathered from this ability is that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.240 
I've gathered from this ability is that
on<00:04:02.209> squishies<00:04:02.780> it's<00:04:03.350> only<00:04:03.709> a<00:04:03.739> slight<00:04:04.010> more

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
on squishies it's only a slight more

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.860 
on squishies it's only a slight more
damage<00:04:04.579> since<00:04:04.850> well<00:04:05.180> they<00:04:05.329> don't<00:04:05.450> probably

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
damage since well they don't probably

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.539 
damage since well they don't probably
have<00:04:05.989> a<00:04:06.019> lot<00:04:06.170> of<00:04:06.230> magic<00:04:06.590> resist<00:04:06.889> so<00:04:07.190> like<00:04:07.370> my

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
have a lot of magic resist so like my

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.220 
have a lot of magic resist so like my
thoughts<00:04:07.819> it<00:04:08.060> would<00:04:08.180> do<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.329> lot<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.630> damage<00:04:08.870> 3d

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
thoughts it would do a lot of damage 3d

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.020 
thoughts it would do a lot of damage 3d
squishies<00:04:09.739> but<00:04:10.310> as<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.579> can<00:04:10.639> see<00:04:10.850> in<00:04:10.940> this

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
squishies but as you can see in this

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.390 
squishies but as you can see in this
clip<00:04:11.239> it's<00:04:11.480> only<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:11.750> little<00:04:12.019> bit<00:04:12.139> more<00:04:12.350> no<00:04:13.130> on

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
clip it's only a little bit more no on

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.580 
clip it's only a little bit more no on
tanks<00:04:13.880> that's<00:04:14.120> where<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.959> counts<00:04:15.290> that's

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
tanks that's where it counts that's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.750 
tanks that's where it counts that's
where<00:04:15.799> it's<00:04:15.950> going<00:04:16.039> to<00:04:16.100> do<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.250> lot<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.489> damage

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
where it's going to do a lot of damage

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.729 
where it's going to do a lot of damage
so<00:04:17.239> like<00:04:17.419> a<00:04:17.570> tank<00:04:17.840> is<00:04:18.019> at<00:04:18.169> twenty-five<00:04:18.590> percent

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
so like a tank is at twenty-five percent

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.740 
so like a tank is at twenty-five percent
health<00:04:19.190> now<00:04:19.729> you<00:04:19.789> can<00:04:19.940> actually<00:04:20.329> finish<00:04:20.510> them

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
health now you can actually finish them

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.719 
health now you can actually finish them
off<00:04:20.930> since<00:04:21.410> your<00:04:21.739> ultimate<00:04:22.039> doesn't<00:04:22.310> do<00:04:22.400> magic

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
off since your ultimate doesn't do magic

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.010 
off since your ultimate doesn't do magic
damage<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.210> will<00:04:23.479> probably<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.960> your

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
damage and will probably do to your

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.450 
damage and will probably do to your
damage<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.740> you're<00:04:24.860> going<00:04:24.950> to<00:04:25.010> be<00:04:25.130> more<00:04:25.340> of<00:04:25.370> a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
damage so you're going to be more of a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.010 
damage so you're going to be more of a
tank<00:04:25.669> killer<00:04:25.940> if<00:04:26.090> he<00:04:26.300> is<00:04:26.389> marked<00:04:26.660> as<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.780> villain

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
tank killer if he is marked as a villain

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.690 
tank killer if he is marked as a villain
although<00:04:27.770> we'll<00:04:27.919> probably<00:04:27.950> be<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.370> squishy

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
although we'll probably be a squishy

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.490 
although we'll probably be a squishy
since<00:04:29.150> those<00:04:29.419> are<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.630> people<00:04:29.780> who<00:04:29.960> get

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
since those are the people who get

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.350 
since those are the people who get
killing<00:04:30.979> sprees<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.910> definitely<00:04:32.300> in

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
killing sprees the definitely in

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.700 
killing sprees the definitely in
teamfights<00:04:32.570> your<00:04:32.900> focus<00:04:33.229> should<00:04:33.260> be<00:04:33.470> the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
teamfights your focus should be the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.070 
teamfights your focus should be the
villain<00:04:33.919> but<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.760> strategy<00:04:35.180> might<00:04:35.389> think<00:04:35.660> of<00:04:35.870> is

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
villain but a strategy might think of is

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.529 
villain but a strategy might think of is
something<00:04:36.860> like<00:04:37.099> feeding<00:04:37.580> two<00:04:37.940> kills<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.479> the

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
something like feeding two kills to the

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.510 
something like feeding two kills to the
enemy<00:04:38.810> top<00:04:39.020> laner<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.800> can<00:04:40.010> become<00:04:40.400> the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
enemy top laner so you can become the

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.040 
enemy top laner so you can become the
villain<00:04:40.669> don't<00:04:41.030> do<00:04:41.150> that<00:04:41.180> that<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.870> just

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
much more viable top liner I do theorize

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.539 
much more viable top liner I do theorize
that<00:05:59.569> helping<00:06:00.049> the<00:06:00.169> top<00:06:00.349> 10<00:06:00.619> at<00:06:00.829> least<00:06:01.009> saying

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:01.549 
that helping the top 10 at least saying

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:03.069 
that helping the top 10 at least saying
he'll<00:06:01.699> be<00:06:01.819> in<00:06:01.909> the<00:06:01.939> top<00:06:02.119> five<00:06:02.360> is<00:06:02.569> a<00:06:02.599> big<00:06:02.869> gamble

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:03.079 
he'll be in the top five is a big gamble

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.929 
he'll be in the top five is a big gamble
and<00:06:03.469> yeah<00:06:03.889> he<00:06:04.009> just<00:06:04.189> has<00:06:04.369> a<00:06:04.399> much<00:06:04.759> more

00:06:04.929 --> 00:06:04.939 
and yeah he just has a much more

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:06.669 
and yeah he just has a much more
stronger<00:06:05.329> man<00:06:05.479> gaming<00:06:05.659> linking<00:06:06.110> and<00:06:06.289> that's

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:06.679 
stronger man gaming linking and that's

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:07.989 
stronger man gaming linking and that's
