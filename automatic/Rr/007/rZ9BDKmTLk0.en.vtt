enjoyable to play throughout the year I
know<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.380> might<00:01:10.560> sound<00:01:10.740> odd<00:01:10.979> having<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> lower

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

remember scores and titles don't mean

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.870 
remember scores and titles don't mean
anything<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.650> amount<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.100> enjoyment<00:01:17.759> I
