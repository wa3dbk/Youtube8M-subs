00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
here this looks like a little tab does

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.500 
here this looks like a little tab does
it<00:06:35.990> do<00:06:36.139> anything

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:37.510

no I'll come back to you about that on

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.850 
no I'll come back to you about that on
the<00:06:41.030> for<00:06:41.240> review<00:06:41.690> oh<00:06:41.930> actually<00:06:42.230> this<00:06:42.650> is

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
the for review oh actually this is

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.160 
the for review oh actually this is
what's<00:06:43.070> gonna<00:06:43.280> actually<00:06:44.120> allow<00:06:44.600> us<00:06:44.750> to<00:06:44.900> remove

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
what's gonna actually allow us to remove

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.300 
what's gonna actually allow us to remove
this<00:06:45.350> front<00:06:45.620> portion<00:06:45.920> I<00:06:46.130> think<00:06:48.010> there<00:06:49.010> we<00:06:49.160> go

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:49.310 
this front portion I think there we go

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.160 
this front portion I think there we go
so<00:06:49.610> this<00:06:49.730> allows<00:06:50.090> us<00:06:50.120> to<00:06:50.300> unclip<00:06:50.780> the<00:06:50.900> front

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.170 
so this allows us to unclip the front

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.470 
so this allows us to unclip the front
portion<00:06:51.440> and<00:06:51.830> this<00:06:52.370> is<00:06:52.550> what<00:06:52.880> where<00:06:53.210> the

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
portion and this is what where the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.840 
portion and this is what where the
battery<00:06:53.990> resides<00:06:54.320> and<00:06:55.040> then<00:06:55.190> this<00:06:55.340> clips<00:06:55.640> back

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
battery resides and then this clips back

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.040 
battery resides and then this clips back
on<00:06:56.090> into<00:06:56.360> place<00:06:56.570> that's<00:06:57.530> very<00:06:57.860> very<00:06:58.160> neat

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:02.480 
they're going to go back on it's quite a

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.430 
they're going to go back on it's quite a
tight<00:07:02.780> fit<00:07:04.270> there<00:07:05.270> we<00:07:05.420> go<00:07:05.570> back<00:07:05.930> into<00:07:06.140> place
