00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.710
Hi everybody

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.513
This is my first "unboxing"

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:16.793
In this particular case, of the Nikon SB-700

00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:22.534
that I've just received

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:25.969
I bought it online

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:29.114
for less than 250 Euros

00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:33.154
It seemed like the best option

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:35.069
I have other two flashes

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.049
one of them broke down

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:42.451
and so I chose the Nikon SB-700

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:46.282
Inside the box

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.007
we have two

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:52.507
(let me adjust the focus)

00:00:57.914 --> 00:00:59.914
User Manuals

00:01:09.134 --> 00:01:11.134
that neither have Portuguese instrutions

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:25.434
Also, an informative brochure 

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:28.703
I don't know if the manual will be sent in Portuguese 

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:31.203

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:31.733
If bought on a Portuguese store

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
We can see her some important information

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.420
on this quick guide

00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:08.813
Warranty

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
And the flash it self

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:35.593
Very well packaged

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:52.727
I particulary liked the pouch

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:05.343
It is very usefull for keeping things together

00:03:05.343 --> 00:03:07.343

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.560
it as a belt suport

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:33.594
storage slip here

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760
it comes complete with two rigid 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.760
colour filters

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.320
to use with diferent colour temparatures

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.355
and a difuser

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680
the portable flash

00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:33.395
and a hotshoe

00:05:02.033 --> 00:05:04.033
The difuser

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:04.533
and a white card bouncer included

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:06.533

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.020
The batterie opening system

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.447
in the SB-700 is slightly diferent 

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:16.553
than other nikon flashes

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.460
you have to push in the center and then slide it down

00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:28.112
Seems simple and efective

00:05:28.112 --> 00:05:29.734
and that is the batery compartment

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
Let's put some batteries on 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.540
and turn on the flash

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240
It's working

00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:12.654
later I will make a review about this flash

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:14.200
Nikon SB-700

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.660
that seems to be pretty good!

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.060
Thank you all for watching

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.560
Hope you liked it!
