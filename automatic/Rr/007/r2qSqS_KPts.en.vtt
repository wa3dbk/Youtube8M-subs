00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
running I've been running in these for

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.620 
running I've been running in these for
around<00:00:33.040> two<00:00:33.399> and<00:00:33.520> a<00:00:33.579> half<00:00:33.760> three<00:00:34.059> months<00:00:34.450> now

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
around two and a half three months now

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.610 
around two and a half three months now
and<00:00:34.989> I<00:00:35.770> find<00:00:36.280> them<00:00:36.750> easily<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:38.230> best<00:00:38.350> shoes

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
and I find them easily the best shoes

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.200 
and I find them easily the best shoes
that<00:00:38.860> I've<00:00:38.980> ever<00:00:39.010> had<00:00:39.579> running<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.910> way<00:00:43.060> that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
that I've ever had running the way that

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.690 
that I've ever had running the way that
the<00:00:43.330> laces<00:00:43.720> work<00:00:43.960> is<00:00:44.800> that<00:00:45.070> they're<00:00:45.220> connected

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
the laces work is that they're connected

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.030 
the laces work is that they're connected
here<00:00:46.000> and<00:00:46.180> actually<00:00:46.450> run<00:00:46.840> around<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:47.710> back<00:00:47.890> of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
here and actually run around the back of

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.280 
here and actually run around the back of
the<00:00:48.100> shoe<00:00:48.340> so<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.150> when<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:49.450> pull<00:00:49.990> them<00:00:50.110> two

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
the shoe so that when you pull them two

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.760 
the shoe so that when you pull them two
itouches<00:00:51.870> obviously<00:00:52.870> a<00:00:53.050> good<00:00:53.290> thing<00:00:53.530> with

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
itouches obviously a good thing with

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.350 
itouches obviously a good thing with
with<00:00:54.040> trail<00:00:54.280> running<00:00:54.490> shoes<00:00:54.730> as<00:00:54.880> well<00:00:54.910> because

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
there's a lot of grace and sound and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.640 
there's a lot of grace and sound and
Justin<00:00:57.940> small<00:00:58.240> stones<00:00:58.540> if<00:00:59.110> you<00:00:59.290> can<00:00:59.440> tighten

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
Justin small stones if you can tighten

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.680 
Justin small stones if you can tighten
it<00:00:59.950> up<00:01:00.040> this<00:01:00.370> really<00:01:00.670> pulls<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.240> the<00:01:01.270> back<00:01:01.540> of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
it up this really pulls in the back of

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.950 
it up this really pulls in the back of
the<00:01:01.750> shoe<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.230> make<00:01:02.980> such<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.250> big<00:01:03.520> difference

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the shoe and make such a big difference

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.660 
the shoe and make such a big difference
to<00:01:04.960> keeping<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.560> shoe<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.130> your<00:01:06.189> foot<00:01:06.340> and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
to keeping the shoe on your foot and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.560 
to keeping the shoe on your foot and
keeping<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.869> whole<00:01:08.049> thing<00:01:08.290> very<00:01:08.320> sturdy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
keeping the the whole thing very sturdy

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
keeping the the whole thing very sturdy
there's<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.659> locking<00:01:11.020> mechanism

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.230 

yeah<00:01:18.220> so<00:01:18.610> you<00:01:18.729> can<00:01:18.880> flip<00:01:19.180> mine<00:01:20.760> you<00:01:21.760> can<00:01:21.940> see<00:01:22.150> it

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
yeah so you can flip mine you can see it

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.690 
yeah so you can flip mine you can see it
all<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.479> time<00:01:22.600> around<00:01:22.960> here<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.590> then<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
all the time around here and then the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.200 
all the time around here and then the
locking<00:01:25.000> mechanism<00:01:25.170> hold<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.350> place<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.850> then

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
locking mechanism hold in place and then

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.630 
locking mechanism hold in place and then
there<00:01:28.990> is<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.140> vampire<00:01:29.680> section<00:01:30.160> on<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.340> front

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
there is a vampire section on the front

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.969 
there is a vampire section on the front
of<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:30.850> shoe<00:01:31.060> where<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.750> can<00:01:31.900> connect<00:01:32.380> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
of the shoe where you can connect the

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.650 
of the shoe where you can connect the
laces<00:01:33.340> directly<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.119> front<00:01:34.300> of<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.450> shoe

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
laces directly to the front of the shoe

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.240 
laces directly to the front of the shoe
so<00:01:34.840> there's<00:01:35.140> no<00:01:35.290> movement<00:01:35.590> when<00:01:36.100> you're

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
so there's no movement when you're

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.920 
so there's no movement when you're
running<00:01:36.520> it's<00:01:36.880> great<00:01:37.119> because<00:01:37.390> they<00:01:37.750> just

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
running it's great because they just

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.690 
running it's great because they just
they<00:01:38.170> stay<00:01:38.380> exactly<00:01:38.500> where<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.369> put<00:01:39.610> them

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
they stay exactly where you put them

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.370 
they stay exactly where you put them
I've<00:01:39.910> been<00:01:40.360> running<00:01:40.540> for<00:01:40.780> hours<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:41.259> these

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
I've been running for hours in these

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.260 
I've been running for hours in these
shoes<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.979> never<00:01:42.220> found<00:01:42.490> actually<00:01:42.850> that<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
shoes and never found actually that the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.870 
shoes and never found actually that the
laces<00:01:43.720> came<00:01:43.930> undone<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:44.590> it's<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.700> really

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
laces came undone so it's a really

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.270 
laces came undone so it's a really
wonderful<00:01:46.470> mechanism<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.619> expect<00:01:47.979> to<00:01:48.039> see

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
wonderful mechanism and I expect to see

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.779 
wonderful mechanism and I expect to see
it<00:01:48.600> repeated<00:01:49.600> on<00:01:49.780> many<00:01:50.440> shoes<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.100> come<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
it repeated on many shoes to come on the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.790 
it repeated on many shoes to come on the
sole<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.300> shoe<00:01:52.330> there's<00:01:52.930> also<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.410> rock

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
sole of the shoe there's also a rock

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.969 
sole of the shoe there's also a rock
plate<00:01:54.100> protecting<00:01:55.060> your<00:01:55.539> foot<00:01:55.840> from<00:01:56.200> any

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
plate protecting your foot from any

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.730 
plate protecting your foot from any
stones<00:01:57.430> or<00:01:58.330> rocky<00:01:58.690> surfaces<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.470> might<00:01:59.619> be

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
stones or rocky surfaces you might be

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.090 
stones or rocky surfaces you might be
running<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:01.000> could<00:02:04.800> protruded<00:02:05.800> area

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
running on and that could protruded area

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.550 
running on and that could protruded area
of<00:02:06.190> your<00:02:06.280> foot<00:02:06.520> will<00:02:06.640> be<00:02:06.759> very<00:02:06.970> very<00:02:07.750> tender

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
of your foot will be very very tender

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.400 
of your foot will be very very tender
and<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.459> actually<00:02:09.759> stops<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.840> lot

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
and that and this actually stops a lot

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
and that and this actually stops a lot
more<00:02:11.560> than<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.860> than<00:02:12.610> I<00:02:12.670> first<00:02:12.970> imagined<00:02:13.660> when<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
more than I than I first imagined when I

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.509 
more than I than I first imagined when I
first<00:02:14.140> saw<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.590> because<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.160> doesn't<00:02:15.400> look

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
first saw this because it doesn't look

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.800 
first saw this because it doesn't look
it<00:02:15.640> doesn't<00:02:15.790> look<00:02:15.970> very<00:02:16.000> substantial<00:02:16.690> but

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
it doesn't look very substantial but

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.570 
it doesn't look very substantial but
actually<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.260> difference<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.769> huge<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.250> found

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
actually the difference is huge I found

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.479 
actually the difference is huge I found
that<00:02:19.360> my<00:02:19.420> feet<00:02:20.110> stay<00:02:20.380> cooler<00:02:20.709> when<00:02:21.100> wearing

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
that my feet stay cooler when wearing

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.850 
that my feet stay cooler when wearing
the<00:02:21.730> vibram<00:02:22.120> fivefingers<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:23.230> think<00:02:23.709> it's

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
the vibram fivefingers I think it's

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.979 
the vibram fivefingers I think it's
mainly<00:02:24.160> because<00:02:24.549> of<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> neoprene<00:02:25.450> upper<00:02:25.870> and

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
mainly because of the neoprene upper and

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.530 
mainly because of the neoprene upper and
the<00:02:26.019> fact<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.440> my<00:02:27.280> toes<00:02:27.580> are<00:02:27.760> separated<00:02:28.360> and

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the fact that my toes are separated and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.930 
the fact that my toes are separated and
there's<00:02:29.110> just<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.620> lot<00:02:29.950> more<00:02:30.010> airflow<00:02:30.340> that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
there's just a lot more airflow that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.990 
there's just a lot more airflow that
happens<00:02:31.239> around<00:02:31.329> the<00:02:31.660> foot

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.720 

the<00:02:39.000> heat<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.690> comes<00:02:39.870> up<00:02:40.080> from<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.410> road<00:02:40.730> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the heat that comes up from the road you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.580 
the heat that comes up from the road you
because<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:42.330> close<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> because

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
because you're so close to it because

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.070 
because you're so close to it because
the<00:02:43.739> base<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.280> thin<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.819> can<00:02:45.510> really<00:02:45.840> tell

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the base is so thin you can really tell

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.339 
the base is so thin you can really tell
but<00:02:46.530> also<00:02:47.270> because<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.569> neoprene<00:02:49.080> up

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
but also because of the neoprene up

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.380 
but also because of the neoprene up
where<00:02:49.560> she<00:02:49.680> feels<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.190> because<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.910> feels<00:02:51.180> as

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
where she feels like because it feels as

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.970 
where she feels like because it feels as
if<00:02:51.420> you're<00:02:51.660> not<00:02:51.780> wearing<00:02:52.110> shoes<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.680> fact

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
if you're not wearing shoes it in fact

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.059 
if you're not wearing shoes it in fact
releases<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> lot<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> heat<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:55.230> tread<00:02:55.800> on

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
releases a lot of the heat the tread on

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.830 
releases a lot of the heat the tread on
the<00:02:56.250> bottom<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.730> shoe<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.450> found<00:02:57.630> to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the bottom of the shoe I have found to

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.870 
the bottom of the shoe I have found to
be<00:02:57.959> pretty<00:02:58.230> good<00:02:58.470> I've<00:02:59.160> had<00:02:59.310> these<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.610> around

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
be pretty good I've had these for around

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.580 
be pretty good I've had these for around
three<00:03:00.120> months<00:03:00.270> as<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.630> mentioned<00:03:01.250> and<00:03:03.590> although

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
three months as I mentioned and although

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.370 
three months as I mentioned and although
on<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> few<00:03:05.430> patches<00:03:05.670> where<00:03:06.120> my<00:03:06.450> feet<00:03:06.930> first

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
on a few patches where my feet first

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.850 
on a few patches where my feet first
touched<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.190> ground<00:03:08.340> when<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> land<00:03:09.350> they<00:03:10.350> they

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
touched the ground when I land they they

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.220 
touched the ground when I land they they
have<00:03:11.130> actually<00:03:11.580> taken<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.390> tread<00:03:12.720> right<00:03:12.989> down

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
have actually taken the tread right down

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.130 
have actually taken the tread right down
to<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.880> surface<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.660> bottom<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.080> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
to the the surface of the bottom of the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.710 
to the the surface of the bottom of the
shoe<00:03:16.580> but<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> rest<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.180> shoe<00:03:18.390> has

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
shoe but the rest of the shoe has

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.300 
shoe but the rest of the shoe has
remained<00:03:19.880> pretty<00:03:20.880> well<00:03:21.150> shredded<00:03:21.720> I<00:03:22.650> actually

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
remained pretty well shredded I actually

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.880 
remained pretty well shredded I actually
started<00:03:23.790> wearing<00:03:24.180> these<00:03:24.420> as<00:03:24.720> shoes<00:03:25.380> very

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
started wearing these as shoes very

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.240 
started wearing these as shoes very
quickly<00:03:26.190> after<00:03:26.959> after<00:03:27.959> after<00:03:28.319> starting<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.069> do

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
quickly after after after starting to do

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.190 
quickly after after after starting to do
running<00:03:29.700> in<00:03:29.819> them<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.299> noticed<00:03:30.959> that

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
running in them because I noticed that

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.140 
running in them because I noticed that
my<00:03:31.440> feet<00:03:31.709> needed<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.340> strengthen<00:03:32.640> up<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
my feet needed to strengthen up and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.710 
my feet needed to strengthen up and
become<00:03:33.450> acclimatized<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:34.459> not<00:03:35.459> wearing<00:03:35.850> to

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
become acclimatized to not wearing to

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.949 
become acclimatized to not wearing to
this<00:03:36.900> style<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.470> no<00:03:38.069> rise<00:03:38.340> at<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> bank<00:03:38.959> I

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
this style of no rise at the bank I

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.229 
this style of no rise at the bank I
wanted<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.040> give<00:03:41.340> my<00:03:41.370> feet<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.760> opportunity

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
wanted to give my feet the opportunity

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.800 
wanted to give my feet the opportunity
to<00:03:42.390> strengthen<00:03:42.660> up<00:03:42.930> really<00:03:43.470> well<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.510> yeah<00:03:45.510> so

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
to strengthen up really well and yeah so

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.300 
to strengthen up really well and yeah so
I've<00:03:46.140> done<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.500> by<00:03:46.739> wearing<00:03:47.040> them

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
I've done that by wearing them

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.180 
I've done that by wearing them
constantly<00:03:47.790> instead<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.329> my<00:03:48.480> other<00:03:48.750> shoes

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
constantly instead of my other shoes

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.720 
constantly instead of my other shoes
because<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.609> also<00:03:51.060> found<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.489> feet

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
because I also found that as as my feet

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.789 
because I also found that as as my feet
spread<00:03:54.120> slightly<00:03:54.959> from<00:03:55.230> wearing<00:03:55.470> Levi's

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
spread slightly from wearing Levi's

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.710 
spread slightly from wearing Levi's
fingers<00:03:56.459> which<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> good<00:03:57.299> thing<00:03:57.359> because

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
fingers which is a good thing because

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.360 
fingers which is a good thing because
obviously<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.380> helps<00:03:58.500> with<00:03:58.680> your<00:03:58.829> balance<00:03:59.190> and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
obviously it helps with your balance and

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.050 
obviously it helps with your balance and
so<00:03:59.549> on<00:04:00.230> that<00:04:01.230> my<00:04:01.769> toes<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.250> now<00:04:02.400> moved<00:04:02.609> apart

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
so on that my toes have now moved apart

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.569 
so on that my toes have now moved apart
and<00:04:03.239> become<00:04:03.480> a<00:04:03.510> lot<00:04:03.690> stronger<00:04:04.019> but<00:04:04.350> now<00:04:05.130> if<00:04:05.459> i

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
and become a lot stronger but now if i

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.460 
and become a lot stronger but now if i
go<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:05.850> wear<00:04:06.030> normal<00:04:06.180> shoes<00:04:06.570> i<00:04:06.840> have<00:04:07.109> found

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
go and wear normal shoes i have found

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.319 
go and wear normal shoes i have found
that<00:04:07.709> I<00:04:07.920> get<00:04:08.130> blisters<00:04:08.340> on<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.790> insides<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.269> my

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
that I get blisters on the insides of my

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.090 
that I get blisters on the insides of my
little<00:04:09.690> toes<00:04:09.900> as<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> result<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:10.950> little

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
little toes as a result of a little

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.000 
little toes as a result of a little
pushing<00:04:11.310> my<00:04:11.579> feedback<00:04:12.090> together<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.950> a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
pushing my feedback together in in in a

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.000 
pushing my feedback together in in in a
poor<00:04:14.250> shape<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.359> might<00:04:16.200> find<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.739> the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
poor shape so you might find that to the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.370 
poor shape so you might find that to the
water<00:04:17.250> does<00:04:17.640> enter<00:04:18.030> quite<00:04:18.269> easily<00:04:18.479> through

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
water does enter quite easily through

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.319 
water does enter quite easily through
the<00:04:19.530> toe<00:04:19.739> section<00:04:20.130> here<00:04:20.430> or<00:04:20.579> across<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> front

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
the toe section here or across the front

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.100 
it also doesn't hang around which is
great<00:04:23.700> because<00:04:23.910> I<00:04:24.060> mean<00:04:24.300> obviously<00:04:24.419> if<00:04:24.900> you

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
river or something like that the water

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.760 
river or something like that the water
will<00:04:30.090> just<00:04:30.390> drain<00:04:30.690> straight<00:04:31.140> out<00:04:31.320> of<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.530> shoe

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
will just drain straight out of the shoe

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.370 
will just drain straight out of the shoe
which<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.760> really<00:04:33.150> good<00:04:33.390> it<00:04:33.720> doesn't<00:04:34.020> keep<00:04:34.200> any

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
which is really good it doesn't keep any

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.690 
which is really good it doesn't keep any
of<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.590> weight<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.040> your<00:04:35.130> feet<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.580> you

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
of the weight on your feet that you

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.400 
of the weight on your feet that you
would<00:04:35.850> otherwise<00:04:35.970> have<00:04:36.240> yeah<00:04:36.900> it<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.110> great<00:04:37.290> it

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
would otherwise have yeah it is great it

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.410 
would otherwise have yeah it is great it
doesn't<00:04:37.710> keep<00:04:37.800> your<00:04:37.950> feet<00:04:38.130> dry<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.700> it<00:04:39.270> also

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
doesn't keep your feet dry but it also

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.840 
doesn't keep your feet dry but it also
doesn't<00:04:39.840> keep<00:04:39.930> them<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:40.260> way<00:04:40.320> itself<00:04:40.950> that's

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
doesn't keep them that way itself that's

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.280 
doesn't keep them that way itself that's
going<00:04:42.060> to<00:04:42.150> be<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.240> good<00:04:42.360> thing<00:04:42.570> as<00:04:42.780> I<00:04:42.960> mentioned

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
going to be a good thing as I mentioned

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.610 
going to be a good thing as I mentioned
before<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:44.310> has<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.580> wonderful<00:04:45.620> felt

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
before it has this wonderful felt

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.590 
before it has this wonderful felt
section<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.550> goes<00:04:47.760> right<00:04:48.120> across<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.510> front

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
section that goes right across the front

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.450 
section that goes right across the front
of<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.870> foot<00:04:49.050> which<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.380> really<00:04:49.680> think<00:04:50.100> this

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
of the foot which I really think this

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.460 
of the foot which I really think this
for<00:04:50.700> helping<00:04:51.090> gives<00:04:51.450> structure<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.230> top

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
for helping gives structure to the top

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.470 
for helping gives structure to the top
of<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.680> shoe<00:04:52.890> so<00:04:53.160> that<00:04:53.370> both<00:04:53.790> your<00:04:53.940> foot<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
of the shoe so that both your foot and

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.050 
of the shoe so that both your foot and
the<00:04:55.350> actual<00:04:55.830> shoe<00:04:56.190> itself<00:04:56.220> stay<00:04:56.850> together

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
the actual shoe itself stay together

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.930 
the actual shoe itself stay together

yourself you really do need to

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.790 
yourself you really do need to
acclimatize<00:05:29.550> your<00:05:30.090> feet<00:05:30.360> to<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:31.320> style<00:05:31.680> of

running if you don't give your feet the

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.020 
running if you don't give your feet the

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
time necessary to acclimatize they will

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.180 
time necessary to acclimatize they will
person<00:05:39.960> potentially<00:05:40.560> you<00:05:40.650> could<00:05:40.710> damage<00:05:41.040> your

person potentially you could damage your
feet<00:05:41.520> so<00:05:41.820> really<00:05:42.780> just<00:05:42.810> down<00:05:43.350> take<00:05:43.980> your<00:05:44.010> time

your normal shoes and and these and sort
of<00:05:51.840> spread<00:05:52.230> it<00:05:52.380> about<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.650> bit<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.160> personally

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
of spread it about a bit but personally

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.310 
of spread it about a bit but personally
I<00:05:53.760> don't<00:05:54.210> think<00:05:54.510> that<00:05:54.570> that's<00:05:54.720> really<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.200> way

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
I don't think that that's really the way

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.830 
I don't think that that's really the way
to<00:05:55.350> do<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.830> think<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:56.250> lots<00:05:56.910> of<00:05:57.150> small<00:05:57.540> runs

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
to do it I think that lots of small runs

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.909 
to do it I think that lots of small runs
and<00:05:58.790> just<00:05:59.790> just<00:06:00.240> keep<00:06:00.570> keep<00:06:01.200> acclimatizing

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
and just just keep keep acclimatizing

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.850 
and just just keep keep acclimatizing
your<00:06:02.190> feet<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:02.550> if<00:06:02.730> you<00:06:03.000> have<00:06:03.600> damage<00:06:04.080> as<00:06:04.800> a

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
your feet and if you have damage as a

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.610 
your feet and if you have damage as a
result<00:06:05.720> you<00:06:06.720> know<00:06:06.840> maybe<00:06:07.110> you've<00:06:07.350> pulled
