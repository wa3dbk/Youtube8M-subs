00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and they're more for obviously using for

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
and they're more for obviously using for
cream<00:02:08.009> makeups<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.820> lipsticks<00:02:09.210> now

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
cream makeups or for lipsticks now

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.140 
cream makeups or for lipsticks now
disappointingly<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:11.039> weren't<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.610> deep

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
disappointingly they weren't that deep

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.200 
disappointingly they weren't that deep
they're<00:02:12.660> actually<00:02:12.990> very<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.530> shallow<00:02:14.210> the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
they're actually very very shallow the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.700 
they're actually very very shallow the
only<00:02:15.420> reason<00:02:15.630> I've<00:02:15.690> seen<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.930> disappointing

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
only reason I've seen is disappointing

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.520 
only reason I've seen is disappointing
because<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.640> palette<00:02:18.030> itself<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.810> very<00:02:19.230> very

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
because the palette itself is very very

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.250 
because the palette itself is very very
deep<00:02:19.740> like<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:21.510> would<00:02:21.630> accommodate<00:02:21.870> like

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
deep like it's it would accommodate like

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.550 
deep like it's it would accommodate like
your<00:02:22.410> mineral<00:02:22.910> baked<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:25.140> eyeshadows

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
your mineral baked don't like eyeshadows

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.010 
your mineral baked don't like eyeshadows
and<00:02:25.710> stuff<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.210> quite<00:02:27.720> deep

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
and stuff like that so it is quite deep

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840 
and stuff like that so it is quite deep
so<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.320> would<00:02:28.590> assume<00:02:28.950> that<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.400> will<00:02:29.520> be<00:02:29.670> able

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
so you would assume that it will be able

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.940 
so you would assume that it will be able
to<00:02:30.030> accommodate<00:02:30.270> quite<00:02:30.630> deep<00:02:30.810> wells<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.740> they

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
to accommodate quite deep wells but they

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.740 
to accommodate quite deep wells but they
just<00:02:32.100> didn't<00:02:32.310> go<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:33.240> buy<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> 12

just didn't go for that you can buy a 12
well<00:02:34.050> or<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> 24<00:02:35.130> wells<00:02:35.340> like<00:02:35.580> these<00:02:35.760> now<00:02:36.690> in

would<00:03:31.440> stick<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.830> pan<00:03:31.980> whereas<00:03:32.760> the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
would stick to the pan whereas the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.520 
would stick to the pan whereas the
English<00:03:33.210> is<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.450> opposite<00:03:33.750> way<00:03:33.930> around<00:03:33.960> where

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
English is the opposite way around where

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.490 
English is the opposite way around where
that<00:03:34.830> the<00:03:35.090> palette<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.300> magnetized<00:03:36.990> and<00:03:37.320> then

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
that the palette is magnetized and then

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.790 
that the palette is magnetized and then
the<00:03:38.390> pan<00:03:39.390> themselves<00:03:39.960> are<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.170> not<00:03:40.500> there

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
the pan themselves are just not there

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.710 
the pan themselves are just not there
metal<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.460> they<00:03:41.940> wouldn't<00:03:42.210> stick<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.600> this

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
metal so they wouldn't stick to this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.940 
metal so they wouldn't stick to this
because<00:03:42.990> it's<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.200> metal<00:03:43.530> on<00:03:43.590> metal<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:43.890> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
because it's just metal on metal so I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.140 
because it's just metal on metal so I
had<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.190> get<00:03:44.280> separate<00:03:44.610> strips<00:03:44.910> of

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
had to get separate strips of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.630 
had to get separate strips of
sticky-backed<00:03:46.040> magnet<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.280> put<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.490> on<00:03:47.580> the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
sticky-backed magnet and put it on the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.370 
sticky-backed magnet and put it on the
bottom<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.270> put<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.540> down<00:03:48.690> but<00:03:49.110> anyhow

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
bottom and then I put it down but anyhow

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.600 
bottom and then I put it down but anyhow
that's<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:49.830> give<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.010> an<00:03:50.070> idea<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.430> what

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
that's just to give you an idea of what

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.000 
that's just to give you an idea of what
you<00:03:50.730> can<00:03:50.880> do<00:03:51.030> with<00:03:51.180> those<00:03:51.330> pallets<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.870> 15<00:03:52.770> of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
you can do with those pallets and 15 of

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.800 
you can do with those pallets and 15 of
these<00:03:53.310> fit<00:03:53.730> him<00:03:53.850> perfectly<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.540> really

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
these fit him perfectly so I really

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.410 
these fit him perfectly so I really
really<00:03:54.990> love<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.220> now<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.490> probably<00:03:57.030> will<00:03:57.270> be

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
really love that now I probably will be

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.080 
really love that now I probably will be
using<00:03:57.690> them<00:03:57.780> more<00:03:57.960> for<00:03:58.400> these<00:03:59.400> guys<00:03:59.670> or

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
using them more for these guys or

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.800 
using them more for these guys or
quickly<00:04:00.780> how<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.310> melted<00:04:02.310> these<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.820> put

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
quickly how I melted these I put

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.390 
quickly how I melted these I put
pictures<00:04:04.020> on<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.380> blog<00:04:04.470> post<00:04:04.560> accompanying

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
pictures on the blog post accompanying

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.700 
pictures on the blog post accompanying
so<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.150> see<00:04:06.420> exactly<00:04:06.900> kind<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.500> how<00:04:07.620> it

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
so you can see exactly kind of how it

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.320 
so you can see exactly kind of how it
looked<00:04:07.950> during<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.310> process<00:04:08.700> but<00:04:08.880> basically

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
looked during the process but basically

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.930 
looked during the process but basically
I<00:04:09.630> did<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.960> very<00:04:10.200> very<00:04:10.530> roughly<00:04:10.890> I<00:04:11.100> logged<00:04:11.670> off

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
I did a very very roughly I logged off

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.840 
I did a very very roughly I logged off
about<00:04:12.420> just<00:04:13.140> over<00:04:13.410> half<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.950> say<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.310> regular

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
about just over half of say a regular

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.910 
about just over half of say a regular
sized<00:04:15.120> lipstick<00:04:15.870> bullet<00:04:16.170> and<00:04:16.410> pop<00:04:16.620> them<00:04:16.799> in

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
sized lipstick bullet and pop them in

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.830 
sized lipstick bullet and pop them in
depending<00:04:17.640> on<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.820> lipstick<00:04:18.090> I<00:04:18.180> was<00:04:18.299> using<00:04:18.450> it

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
depending on the lipstick I was using it

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.340 
depending on the lipstick I was using it
very<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.410> then<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.590> put<00:04:19.770> them<00:04:19.920> really<00:04:20.430> and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
very and then I put them really and

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.800 
very and then I put them really and
roughly<00:04:22.350> into<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.340> like<00:04:24.180> insert<00:04:24.630> so

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
roughly into the like insert so

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.909 
roughly into the like insert so
obviously<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.140> insert<00:04:25.380> wasn't<00:04:25.710> in<00:04:25.800> the

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
obviously the insert wasn't in the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.280 
obviously the insert wasn't in the
palette<00:04:26.190> at<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:26.430> stage<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.880> then<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.810> popped

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
palette at this stage and then I popped

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.820 
palette at this stage and then I popped
it<00:04:28.470> into<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.800> microwave

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
it into the microwave

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.410 
it into the microwave
I<00:04:29.860> use<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> microwave<00:04:30.580> from<00:04:30.880> melting<00:04:31.210> stove

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
I use a microwave from melting stove

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.910 
I use a microwave from melting stove
it's<00:04:31.690> okay<00:04:32.020> as<00:04:32.140> long<00:04:32.170> as<00:04:32.350> you're<00:04:32.470> careful<00:04:32.620> with

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
it's okay as long as you're careful with

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.210 
it's okay as long as you're careful with
it

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
it

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.310 
it
I<00:04:33.250> wasn't<00:04:33.520> that<00:04:33.760> careful<00:04:34.210> because<00:04:34.360> some<00:04:35.200> of

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
I wasn't that careful because some of

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.590 
I wasn't that careful because some of
the<00:04:35.590> dryer<00:04:36.250> lipsticks<00:04:36.820> like<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.240> may<00:04:37.390> being

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
the dryer lipsticks like the may being

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.890 
the dryer lipsticks like the may being
14<00:04:38.050> hour<00:04:38.170> stay<00:04:38.440> ones<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.920> of<00:04:39.700> course<00:04:40.120> max<00:04:40.480> Ruby

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
14 hour stay ones and of course max Ruby

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.060 
14 hour stay ones and of course max Ruby
mu<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.050> shouldn't<00:04:41.410> have<00:04:41.470> been<00:04:41.620> surprised<00:04:41.920> at

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
mu I shouldn't have been surprised at

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.440 
mu I shouldn't have been surprised at
that<00:04:42.100> because<00:04:42.310> it's<00:04:42.460> such<00:04:42.700> a<00:04:42.730> dry<00:04:43.000> powdery

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
that because it's such a dry powdery

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.420 
that because it's such a dry powdery
lipstick<00:04:43.780> they<00:04:44.320> have<00:04:44.500> much<00:04:44.740> higher<00:04:44.770> melting

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
lipstick they have much higher melting

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.420 
lipstick they have much higher melting
points<00:04:45.970> so<00:04:46.240> while<00:04:46.840> other<00:04:47.110> ones<00:04:47.380> were<00:04:47.680> near

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
points so while other ones were near

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.630 
points so while other ones were near
boiling<00:04:49.000> in<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.980> microwave<00:04:51.010> thousands

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
boiling in the microwave thousands

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.700 
boiling in the microwave thousands
didn't<00:04:51.880> melt<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.300> me<00:04:52.870> like<00:04:53.050> an<00:04:53.170> Aegis<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.500> said<00:04:53.680> I

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
didn't melt so me like an Aegis I said I

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.110 
didn't melt so me like an Aegis I said I
leave<00:04:54.010> another<00:04:54.280> second<00:04:54.670> and<00:04:54.730> see<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.000> them

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
leave another second and see to them

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.300 
leave another second and see to them
else<00:04:55.270> they<00:04:55.420> didn't<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:55.870> if<00:04:56.200> this<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.830> worked

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
else they didn't so if this it worked

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.730 
else they didn't so if this it worked
tiny<00:04:57.670> bit<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:58.180> you<00:04:58.420> can<00:04:59.140> see<00:04:59.320> it's<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.590> little

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
tiny bit there you can see it's a little

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.070 
tiny bit there you can see it's a little
bit<00:04:59.920> warped<00:05:00.250> because<00:05:00.520> I<00:05:01.060> think<00:05:01.600> one<00:05:01.750> or<00:05:01.840> two<00:05:01.900> of

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
bit warped because I think one or two of

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.390 
bit warped because I think one or two of
the<00:05:02.140> lipsticks<00:05:02.500> there<00:05:02.710> had<00:05:02.920> such<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.130> lowers

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
the lipsticks there had such a lowers

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.370 
the lipsticks there had such a lowers
and<00:05:03.700> boiling<00:05:04.480> point<00:05:04.750> should<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.080> rest<00:05:05.290> of

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
and boiling point should the rest of

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.660 
and boiling point should the rest of
them<00:05:05.530> that<00:05:05.710> they<00:05:05.830> were<00:05:05.890> starting<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.400> do<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> bit

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
spoon and then I hovered the metal spoon

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.660 
spoon and then I hovered the metal spoon
with<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.240> lipstick<00:05:34.570> on<00:05:34.690> it<00:05:34.840> over<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:35.830> open

flame so again you'll be really careful
but<00:05:38.230> over<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.590> candle<00:05:39.040> and<00:05:39.190> then<00:05:39.550> I<00:05:39.580> let<00:05:39.820> that

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
doesn't bubble over or boil so you have

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.930 
doesn't bubble over or boil so you have
to<00:05:44.320> you<00:05:44.590> know<00:05:44.680> burn<00:05:45.070> so<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.580> have<00:05:45.730> to<00:05:45.820> keep

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
to you know burn so you have to keep

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.120 
to you know burn so you have to keep
kind<00:05:46.150> of<00:05:46.240> stirring<00:05:46.570> it<00:05:46.750> around<00:05:47.020> and<00:05:47.890> then<00:05:48.040> I

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
kind of stirring it around and then I

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.730 
kind of stirring it around and then I
can<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.580> used<00:05:48.820> my<00:05:49.060> metal<00:05:49.870> spatula<00:05:50.110> as<00:05:50.440> well<00:05:50.560> it's

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
can I used my metal spatula as well it's

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.020 
can I used my metal spatula as well it's
kind<00:05:50.890> of<00:05:50.950> start<00:05:51.160> around<00:05:51.280> that<00:05:51.490> helps<00:05:51.760> it<00:05:51.850> melt

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
kind of start around that helps it melt

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.090 
kind of start around that helps it melt
down<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.480> once<00:05:52.750> that<00:05:52.930> was<00:05:53.050> melted<00:05:53.410> I<00:05:53.560> poured

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
down and once that was melted I poured

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.380 
down and once that was melted I poured
it<00:05:54.310> into<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:55.450> well<00:05:55.870> like<00:05:56.380> was<00:05:56.620> basically

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
it into the well like was basically

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
it into the well like was basically
setting<00:05:58.390> the<00:05:58.480> straight<00:05:58.720> away<00:05:58.930> again<00:05:59.140> so<00:05:59.380> I

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
setting the straight away again so I

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.900 
setting the straight away again so I
didn't<00:05:59.650> want<00:05:59.830> very<00:06:00.010> smooth<00:06:00.280> but<00:06:00.550> it<00:06:00.640> doesn't

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
didn't want very smooth but it doesn't

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.950 
didn't want very smooth but it doesn't
bother<00:06:00.970> me<00:06:01.180> I<00:06:01.210> don't<00:06:01.270> really<00:06:01.420> care<00:06:01.660> about<00:06:01.780> it

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
very long anyhow so that's how I did

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.620 
very long anyhow so that's how I did
that<00:06:08.320> there<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:09.460> fill<00:06:09.670> up<00:06:09.910> those<00:06:10.120> last<00:06:10.420> two

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
that there and to fill up those last two

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.520 
that there and to fill up those last two
because<00:06:10.840> I'm<00:06:10.930> not<00:06:10.990> gonna<00:06:11.140> stick<00:06:11.350> it<00:06:11.410> in<00:06:11.470> the

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
because I'm not gonna stick it in the

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.960 
because I'm not gonna stick it in the
microwave<00:06:11.770> again<00:06:11.950> obviously<00:06:12.160> I<00:06:12.370> will<00:06:12.730> just

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
microwave again obviously I will just

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.110 
microwave again obviously I will just
use<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.510> candle<00:06:14.290> and<00:06:14.500> spoon<00:06:14.980> method<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:16.090> only

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
use the candle and spoon method the only

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.860 
use the candle and spoon method the only
problem<00:06:16.570> with<00:06:16.690> that<00:06:16.720> is<00:06:17.110> that<00:06:17.520> you<00:06:18.520> do<00:06:19.270> waste<00:06:19.510> a

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
problem with that is that you do waste a

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.030 
problem with that is that you do waste a
bit<00:06:19.960> of<00:06:20.080> product<00:06:20.440> because<00:06:20.590> because<00:06:20.890> there's

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
bit of product because because there's

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.620 
bit of product because because there's
inevitably<00:06:21.220> going<00:06:21.790> to<00:06:21.910> be<00:06:22.060> some<00:06:22.390> of<00:06:22.540> the

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
inevitably going to be some of the

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.210 
inevitably going to be some of the
lipstick<00:06:22.930> that<00:06:23.080> sticks<00:06:23.350> to<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.560> spoon<00:06:23.800> even

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
lipstick that sticks to the spoon even

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.830 
lipstick that sticks to the spoon even
if<00:06:24.310> you<00:06:24.370> try<00:06:24.580> and<00:06:24.670> scrape<00:06:24.910> it<00:06:25.090> off<00:06:25.270> there's

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
if you try and scrape it off there's

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.240 
if you try and scrape it off there's
still<00:06:25.990> going<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.170> be<00:06:26.230> some<00:06:26.380> left<00:06:26.590> overs<00:06:26.890> and

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
still going to be some left overs and

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.080 
still going to be some left overs and
that's<00:06:27.370> like<00:06:27.520> worth<00:06:27.730> a<00:06:27.820> few<00:06:27.910> applications

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
that's like worth a few applications

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.630 
that's like worth a few applications
plus<00:06:28.780> that's<00:06:29.530> just<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.250> price<00:06:30.370> you<00:06:30.430> have<00:06:30.610> to

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
plus that's just the price you have to

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.830 
plus that's just the price you have to
pay<00:06:30.730> so<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.120> only<00:06:31.240> other<00:06:31.390> thing<00:06:31.510> we<00:06:31.660> need<00:06:31.810> to

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
pay so the only other thing we need to

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.170 
pay so the only other thing we need to
say<00:06:32.050> is<00:06:32.260> that<00:06:32.620> you<00:06:32.710> can<00:06:32.830> get<00:06:32.980> the<00:06:33.190> twelve<00:06:33.550> in

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.820 
say is that you can get the twelve in
search<00:06:34.480> ones<00:06:34.720> as<00:06:34.840> well<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.230> should<00:06:35.380> be<00:06:35.590> bigger

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
search ones as well it should be bigger

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.440 
search ones as well it should be bigger
wells<00:06:36.100> so<00:06:36.670> I<00:06:36.700> think<00:06:36.820> that<00:06:37.030> would<00:06:37.120> need<00:06:37.240> to<00:06:37.360> be

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:37.450 
wells so I think that would need to be

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.260 
wells so I think that would need to be
better<00:06:37.600> for<00:06:37.990> like<00:06:38.860> cream<00:06:39.190> makeups<00:06:39.670> actual

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
better for like cream makeups actual

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.470 
better for like cream makeups actual
foundations<00:06:40.810> and<00:06:41.020> you<00:06:41.410> can<00:06:41.530> also<00:06:41.770> catch<00:06:42.190> the

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
foundations and you can also catch the

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.060 
foundations and you can also catch the
pilots<00:06:42.810> that<00:06:42.960> look<00:06:43.140> like<00:06:43.290> this<00:06:43.500> now<00:06:43.740> this<00:06:43.860> is<00:06:43.920> a

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
pilots that look like this now this is a

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.980 
pilots that look like this now this is a
japanesse<00:06:44.460> but<00:06:44.730> but<00:06:44.940> the<00:06:45.420> Mac<00:06:45.630> bone<00:06:45.840> also

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
japanesse but but the Mac bone also

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.590 
japanesse but but the Mac bone also
comes<00:06:46.320> with<00:06:46.470> an<00:06:46.710> insert<00:06:47.060> like<00:06:48.060> a<00:06:48.090> double<00:06:48.420> sided

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:48.600 
comes with an insert like a double sided

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.470
