and<00:04:00.730> do<00:04:01.730> we<00:04:01.820> know<00:04:01.970> his<00:04:02.090> name<00:04:02.120> do<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:02.570> know<00:04:02.690> his

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
and do we know his name do we know his

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.740 
and do we know his name do we know his
family<00:04:03.200> no<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.470> I'm<00:04:03.830> okay<00:04:04.100> with<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:04.280> because

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
family no I I'm okay with that because

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.530 
family no I I'm okay with that because
yeah<00:04:05.750> his<00:04:06.020> actions<00:04:06.380> speak<00:04:06.440> for<00:04:06.590> him<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.250> it's

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
yeah his actions speak for him and it's

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.450 
yeah his actions speak for him and it's
beautifully<00:04:08.540> shot<00:04:08.570> oh<00:04:09.110> really<00:04:09.830> really<00:04:09.980> top<00:04:10.280> to

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
beautifully shot oh really really top to

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.010 
beautifully shot oh really really top to
make<00:04:10.640> because<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.090> much<00:04:11.209> of<00:04:11.270> it<00:04:11.420> is<00:04:11.570> within<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
make because so much of it is within the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.810 
make because so much of it is within the
close<00:04:12.230> quarters<00:04:12.650> of<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:13.040> boat<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.370> don't<00:04:13.640> know

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
close quarters of the boat I don't know

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.610 
close quarters of the boat I don't know
how<00:04:13.940> they<00:04:14.090> do<00:04:14.630> they<00:04:14.720> actually<00:04:14.840> go<00:04:15.140> out<00:04:15.260> and<00:04:15.500> to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
how they do they actually go out and to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.580 
how they do they actually go out and to
I<00:04:16.540> think<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.630> was<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:17.810> between<00:04:18.080> here<00:04:18.560> and

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
I think it was like between here and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.349 
I think it was like between here and
Catalina<00:04:19.070> like<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.489> was<00:04:19.609> not<00:04:19.820> really<00:04:20.060> all<00:04:20.330> that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
Catalina like it was not really all that

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.000 
Catalina like it was not really all that
out<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.169> way<00:04:21.260> I<00:04:21.290> think<00:04:21.440> there's<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.770> lot<00:04:21.890> of

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
out of the way I think there's a lot of

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.890 
out of the way I think there's a lot of
digital<00:04:22.370> trickery<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.880> erase<00:04:23.180> things<00:04:23.480> and<00:04:23.810> to

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
digital trickery to erase things and to

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.290 
digital trickery to erase things and to
add<00:04:24.020> clouds<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:24.770> whatnot<00:04:25.070> but<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:25.640> know<00:04:25.790> yeah

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
add clouds and whatnot but you know yeah

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.640 
add clouds and whatnot but you know yeah
like<00:04:26.480> for<00:04:26.630> example<00:04:26.690> there's<00:04:27.050> there's<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.380> scene

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
like for example there's there's a scene

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.820 
like for example there's there's a scene
where<00:04:27.980> he's<00:04:28.580> climbed<00:04:29.060> up<00:04:29.419> the<00:04:29.870> mastic<00:04:30.320> really

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
where he's climbed up the mastic really

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.320 
where he's climbed up the mastic really
really<00:04:31.250> high<00:04:31.430> it's<00:04:31.730> very<00:04:31.970> kind<00:04:32.180> of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
really high it's very kind of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.560 
really high it's very kind of
vertigo-inducing<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:34.130> in<00:04:34.700> the<00:04:34.970> distance<00:04:35.419> he

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
vertigo-inducing and in the distance he

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.540 
vertigo-inducing and in the distance he
sees<00:04:35.780> these<00:04:36.020> storm<00:04:36.350> clouds<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.160> see<00:04:37.340> and

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
sees these storm clouds and you see and

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.250 
sees these storm clouds and you see and
his<00:04:37.760> face<00:04:38.060> sort<00:04:38.270> of<00:04:38.330> registering<00:04:38.870> what<00:04:39.050> that

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
his face sort of registering what that

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.159 
his face sort of registering what that
means<00:04:39.730> exactly<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.270> I<00:04:41.510> just<00:04:41.720> thought<00:04:41.810> okay<00:04:41.990> so

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
means exactly and I just thought okay so

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:44.250 
means exactly and I just thought okay so
he's<00:04:42.650> not<00:04:42.830> they<00:04:43.250> don't<00:04:43.370> even<00:04:43.550> have<00:04:43.790> him<00:04:43.970> say

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
he's not they don't even have him say

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.480 
he's not they don't even have him say
storms<00:04:45.260> coming<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.800> know<00:04:45.919> or<00:04:46.100> something<00:04:46.460> I

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
storms coming you know or something I

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.580 
storms coming you know or something I
got<00:04:46.730> like<00:04:46.880> we<00:04:47.090> have<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.510> pay<00:04:47.690> attention<00:04:47.840> there

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
got like we have to pay attention there

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.659 
got like we have to pay attention there
are<00:04:48.710> things<00:04:48.950> that<00:04:48.980> happened<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.490> I<00:04:49.520> don't

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
are things that happened that I don't

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.690 
are things that happened that I don't
even<00:04:49.880> know<00:04:50.030> why<00:04:50.240> he's<00:04:50.480> doing<00:04:50.900> them<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:52.520> thing

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
even know why he's doing them the thing

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.520 
even know why he's doing them the thing
with<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:52.970> bucket<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.780> things<00:04:54.169> stretched

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
with the bucket and the things stretched

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.230 
with the bucket and the things stretched
on<00:04:54.770> top<00:04:55.040> of<00:04:55.190> it<00:04:55.340> like<00:04:55.370> is<00:04:55.610> that<00:04:55.640> somehow<00:04:55.910> can<00:04:56.180> I

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
on top of it like is that somehow can I

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120 
on top of it like is that somehow can I
convert<00:04:56.600> salt<00:04:56.990> water<00:04:57.200> into<00:04:57.500> drinking<00:04:57.830> water<00:04:57.860> I

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
convert salt water into drinking water I

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.280 
convert salt water into drinking water I
didn't<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.460> didn't<00:04:59.390> know<00:04:59.510> but<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.810> didn't<00:05:00.080> care<00:05:00.230> I

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
didn't I didn't know but I didn't care I

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.930 
didn't I didn't know but I didn't care I
figured<00:05:00.740> whatever<00:05:01.070> he<00:05:01.160> was<00:05:01.280> doing<00:05:01.490> was<00:05:01.730> he

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
figured whatever he was doing was he

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.270 
figured whatever he was doing was he
knew<00:05:02.060> what<00:05:02.180> he<00:05:02.240> was<00:05:02.360> doing<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:02.800> yeah<00:05:03.800> he's

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
knew what he was doing so yeah he's

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.100 
knew what he was doing so yeah he's
trying<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.760> take<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.300> salt<00:05:05.510> water<00:05:05.780> because<00:05:05.990> he

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
trying to take the salt water because he

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.320 
trying to take the salt water because he
now<00:05:06.260> realizes<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.800> his<00:05:07.310> little<00:05:07.820> portable

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
now realizes that his little portable

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.390 
now realizes that his little portable
thingy<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.840> contaminated<00:05:09.530> right<00:05:09.680> I<00:05:09.919> think

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
thingy is contaminated right I think

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.909 
thingy is contaminated right I think
he's<00:05:10.550> taking<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.030> sunlight<00:05:11.450> and<00:05:12.110> using<00:05:12.830> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
he's taking the sunlight and using the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.730 
he's taking the sunlight and using the
heat<00:05:13.100> from<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.340> sunlight<00:05:13.700> with<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.740> whatever

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
heat from the sunlight with the whatever

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.580 
heat from the sunlight with the whatever
saran<00:05:16.280> wrap<00:05:16.490> whatever<00:05:16.789> it<00:05:17.030> is<00:05:17.120> to<00:05:17.660> boil<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:18.320> and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
saran wrap whatever it is to boil it and

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.709 
saran wrap whatever it is to boil it and
make<00:05:18.650> it<00:05:19.220> clean<00:05:20.000> okay

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:20.719 
make it clean okay

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.509

does<00:05:40.849> ain't<00:05:41.089> can<00:05:41.239> anybody<00:05:41.689> possibly<00:05:42.049> well<00:05:42.889> I

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
does ain't can anybody possibly well I

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.279 
does ain't can anybody possibly well I
you<00:05:43.159> know<00:05:43.309> it'll<00:05:44.059> be<00:05:44.089> interesting<00:05:44.209> to<00:05:44.749> see<00:05:44.989> how

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
you know it'll be interesting to see how

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.469 
you know it'll be interesting to see how
that<00:05:46.009> plays<00:05:46.249> them<00:05:46.459> because<00:05:46.669> certainly<00:05:47.209> I<00:05:47.239> mean

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
that plays them because certainly I mean

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.119 
that plays them because certainly I mean
I<00:05:47.599> think<00:05:47.689> the<00:05:47.839> Academy<00:05:48.229> likes<00:05:48.409> acting<00:05:49.009> they

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:49.129 
I think the Academy likes acting they

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:51.159 
I think the Academy likes acting they
can<00:05:49.279> quantify<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:50.149> he's<00:05:50.360> acting<00:05:50.779> the

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
can quantify and he's acting the

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.739 
can quantify and he's acting the
out<00:05:51.289> of<00:05:51.319> this<00:05:51.559> thing<00:05:51.799> so<00:05:51.829> you<00:05:52.339> know<00:05:52.659> and<00:05:53.659> he's

00:05:53.739 --> 00:05:53.749 
out of this thing so you know and he's

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:55.929 
out of this thing so you know and he's
Robert<00:05:54.019> Redford<00:05:54.429> it's<00:05:55.429> interesting<00:05:55.669> to<00:05:55.879> look

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:55.939 
Robert Redford it's interesting to look

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:57.790 
Robert Redford it's interesting to look
at<00:05:56.119> this<00:05:56.239> in<00:05:56.539> through<00:05:56.869> the<00:05:56.989> through<00:05:57.289> the<00:05:57.439> lens

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
at this in through the through the lens

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.549 
at this in through the through the lens
of<00:05:58.009> gravity<00:05:58.610> which<00:05:59.419> is<00:05:59.449> also<00:05:59.929> a<00:05:59.959> kind<00:06:00.379> of<00:06:00.469> a

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:00.559 
of gravity which is also a kind of a

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:03.309 
of gravity which is also a kind of a
one-man<00:06:00.800> show<00:06:01.249> to<00:06:01.579> extent<00:06:02.059> about<00:06:02.719> being<00:06:03.019> about

one-man show to extent about being about

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.839 
one-man show to extent about being about
you<00:06:03.499> guys<00:06:03.649> it<00:06:03.800> but<00:06:03.919> total<00:06:04.249> totally<00:06:04.519> different

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
you guys it but total totally different

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:05.949 
you guys it but total totally different
and<00:06:04.939> all<00:06:04.999> the<00:06:05.089> people<00:06:05.329> that<00:06:05.419> complained<00:06:05.809> about

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:05.959 
and all the people that complained about

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.569 
and all the people that complained about
how<00:06:06.259> you<00:06:06.679> know<00:06:06.769> they<00:06:06.889> love<00:06:07.069> the<00:06:07.189> effects<00:06:07.519> of

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:07.579 
how you know they love the effects of

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:09.040 
how you know they love the effects of
gravity<00:06:07.729> but<00:06:08.089> they<00:06:08.209> didn't<00:06:08.479> like<00:06:08.629> the<00:06:08.809> writing

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
gravity but they didn't like the writing

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.979 
gravity but they didn't like the writing
or<00:06:09.319> the<00:06:09.349> backstory<00:06:09.860> well<00:06:10.069> know<00:06:10.489> that<00:06:10.809> this<00:06:11.809> is

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:11.989 
or the backstory well know that this is

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:14.469 
or the backstory well know that this is
all<00:06:12.229> surviving<00:06:13.039> self<00:06:13.459> so<00:06:13.729> you<00:06:13.789> know<00:06:14.059> that<00:06:14.360> was

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
all surviving self so you know that was

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.759 
all surviving self so you know that was
an<00:06:14.599> issue<00:06:14.689> for<00:06:14.809> you<00:06:14.989> and<00:06:15.139> gravity<00:06:15.469> check<00:06:15.649> this

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:15.769 
an issue for you and gravity check this

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:17.439 
an issue for you and gravity check this
one<00:06:15.919> which<00:06:16.219> is<00:06:16.369> more<00:06:16.519> harrowing<00:06:16.849> do<00:06:17.179> you<00:06:17.239> think

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
one which is more harrowing do you think

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:18.909 
one which is more harrowing do you think
the<00:06:17.539> idea<00:06:17.779> of<00:06:17.869> being<00:06:18.079> stranded<00:06:18.409> by<00:06:18.589> yourself

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
the idea of being stranded by yourself

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.409 
the idea of being stranded by yourself
in<00:06:19.039> space<00:06:19.369> or<00:06:19.579> the<00:06:19.669> idea<00:06:19.939> of<00:06:19.999> being<00:06:20.179> stranded

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
in space or the idea of being stranded

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:21.969 
in space or the idea of being stranded
by<00:06:20.749> yourself<00:06:21.079> in<00:06:21.229> the<00:06:21.319> middle<00:06:21.469> of<00:06:21.559> the<00:06:21.649> ocean

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
by yourself in the middle of the ocean

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.969 
by yourself in the middle of the ocean
well<00:06:22.369> they<00:06:22.459> both<00:06:22.579> kind<00:06:22.849> of<00:06:22.879> suck<00:06:23.089> I<00:06:23.929> will<00:06:24.829> say

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
well they both kind of suck I will say

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.100 
well they both kind of suck I will say
the<00:06:25.159> ocean<00:06:25.639> is<00:06:25.909> public<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.449> have<00:06:26.629> a<00:06:26.659> little

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
the ocean is public you have a little

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.269 
the ocean is public you have a little
more<00:06:27.319> of<00:06:27.439> a<00:06:27.499> fighting<00:06:27.709> chance<00:06:27.979> because<00:06:28.099> you're

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:28.279 
more of a fighting chance because you're

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.909 
more of a fighting chance because you're
actually<00:06:28.399> on<00:06:28.729> the<00:06:28.909> planet<00:06:29.329> but<00:06:29.509> you<00:06:29.659> know<00:06:29.919> as

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
actually on the planet but you know as

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.309 
actually on the planet but you know as
we<00:06:31.189> know<00:06:31.309> above<00:06:32.119> it<00:06:32.239> exactly<00:06:32.749> but<00:06:33.019> as<00:06:33.079> we<00:06:33.229> know

00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 
we know above it exactly but as we know

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.989 
we know above it exactly but as we know
from<00:06:33.409> Life<00:06:33.649> of<00:06:33.800> Pi<00:06:33.889> that's<00:06:34.129> no<00:06:34.309> picnic<00:06:34.669> either

00:06:34.989 --> 00:06:34.999 
from Life of Pi that's no picnic either

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.350 
from Life of Pi that's no picnic either
there<00:06:35.689> is<00:06:35.809> no<00:06:36.050> CGI<00:06:36.709> Tiger<00:06:37.369> doctor<00:06:37.879> here<00:06:38.089> okay

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
there is no CGI Tiger doctor here okay

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.299 
there is no CGI Tiger doctor here okay
so<00:06:38.389> what<00:06:38.659> is<00:06:38.749> your<00:06:38.839> number<00:06:38.959> I<00:06:39.379> give<00:06:40.009> this<00:06:40.129> an

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:40.309 
so what is your number I give this an

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:41.649 
so what is your number I give this an
eight<00:06:40.459> point<00:06:40.699> eight<00:06:40.819> this<00:06:41.029> is<00:06:41.209> a<00:06:41.239> really

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:41.659 
eight point eight this is a really

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:43.209 
eight point eight this is a really
really<00:06:41.959> strong<00:06:42.349> film<00:06:42.649> I<00:06:42.769> very<00:06:43.039> highly

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
really strong film I very highly

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.589 
really strong film I very highly
recommend<00:06:43.369> I<00:06:43.729> think<00:06:43.999> I<00:06:44.059> didn't<00:06:44.300> go<00:06:44.419> high

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
recommend I think I didn't go high

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.119 
recommend I think I didn't go high
enough<00:06:44.629> I'm<00:06:45.019> gonna<00:06:45.229> say<00:06:45.439> nine<00:06:45.649> just<00:06:45.919> to<00:06:45.979> make

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:46.129 
enough I'm gonna say nine just to make

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:47.589 
enough I'm gonna say nine just to make
the<00:06:46.219> math<00:06:46.339> you<00:06:46.519> know<00:06:46.669> so<00:06:46.849> our<00:06:47.029> average<00:06:47.419> is

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
the math you know so our average is

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:50.919 
the math you know so our average is
eight<00:06:47.929> point<00:06:48.229> nine<00:06:48.289> it<00:06:48.800> is<00:06:49.039> 94%<00:06:50.029> on<00:06:50.509> the<00:06:50.599> tomato

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:50.929 
eight point nine it is 94% on the tomato

00:06:50.929 --> 00:06:53.049 
eight point nine it is 94% on the tomato
