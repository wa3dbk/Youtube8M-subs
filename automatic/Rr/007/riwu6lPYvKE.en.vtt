very<00:00:14.340> similar<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.910> concept<00:00:15.120> with<00:00:15.870> even

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
very similar to the concept with even

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.720 
very similar to the concept with even
the<00:00:16.199> rubber<00:00:16.350> air<00:00:16.650> bumps<00:00:17.010> making<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.520> into

the rubber air bumps making it into

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.730 
the rubber air bumps making it into
production<00:00:17.900> let's<00:00:18.900> see<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.320> they<00:00:19.439> think<00:00:19.470> of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.340 
the finished product really liked it I
was<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.800> came<00:00:23.070> here<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> concept<00:00:23.820> car<00:00:24.060> and

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
was I came here for the concept car and

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.689 
was I came here for the concept car and
I'm<00:00:25.350> really<00:00:25.619> surprised<00:00:25.949> they've<00:00:26.130> stuck<00:00:26.400> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I'm really surprised they've stuck to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.730 
I'm really surprised they've stuck to
the<00:00:26.820> bold<00:00:27.029> styling<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.289> part<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the bold styling that was part of the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.529 
the bold styling that was part of the
concept<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.400> really<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.970> outside<00:00:30.330> it

are<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.730> important<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.180> mean<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.480> our

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
of those you know one of the factors of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.930 
of those you know one of the factors of
that<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.100> no<00:00:53.899> no<00:00:54.899> tax<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
although we thought this weight losing

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
although we thought this weight losing
stuff<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> electric<00:00:59.969> rear

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
stuff you're not got the electric rear

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.389 
stuff you're not got the electric rear
windows<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.690> car<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.370> with<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
windows in this car which with a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.070 
windows in this car which with a
two-year-old<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.239> bit<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> pain<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.960> they

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
two-year-old is a bit of a pain if they

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.270 
two-year-old is a bit of a pain if they
want<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> window<00:01:04.530> down<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.100> won't

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
want the window down because they won't

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.219 
want the window down because they won't
be<00:01:05.339> able<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.729> themselves

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
be able to do it themselves

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.050 
be able to do it themselves
yeah<00:01:07.229> low<00:01:07.710> running<00:01:07.950> costs<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.460> important<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
yeah low running costs are important to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.330 
yeah low running costs are important to
anybody<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.990> would've<00:01:10.170> thought<00:01:10.320> having<00:01:11.010> sat<00:01:11.250> in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
anybody I would've thought having sat in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.859 
anybody I would've thought having sat in
the<00:01:11.430> back<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> tallest<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.540> people

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the back and not the tallest of people

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.590 
the back and not the tallest of people
so<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> say<00:01:13.560> as<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.100> said<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.400> concept<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
so I say as we said with the concept the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
so I say as we said with the concept the
roof<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:16.140> head<00:01:16.770> height<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.250> isn't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
roof at head height in there isn't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.920 
roof at head height in there isn't
brilliant<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.270> other<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.750> think

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
brilliant but other than that I think

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
brilliant but other than that I think
it's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.350> great<00:01:19.619> great<00:01:19.970> confidence

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
it's a great great confidence

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.429 
it's a great great confidence
quite<00:01:22.020> honestly<00:01:22.640> initially<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.420> did<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.229> like

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
quite honestly initially I did not like

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.210 
quite honestly initially I did not like
the<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.340> plastic<00:01:27.119> panels<00:01:27.509> either<00:01:27.689> at<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.220> at

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the the plastic panels either at the at

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.999 
the the plastic panels either at the at
the<00:01:29.400> sides<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.810> learn<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.829> could

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the sides but I did learn that you could

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
the sides but I did learn that you could
get<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.909> different<00:01:32.970> colors<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:34.320> yeah<00:01:34.500> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
get them in different colors so yeah I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.870 
get them in different colors so yeah I
love<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:35.009> now<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.579> don't<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
love them now I don't really like the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.550 
love them now I don't really like the
back<00:01:38.880> windows<00:01:39.479> because<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> can't<00:01:40.140> bring<00:01:40.290> them

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
back windows because I can't bring them

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.389 
back windows because I can't bring them
down<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.780> imagine<00:01:43.229> myself<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> summer

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
afternoon with my friends at the back

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.950 
afternoon with my friends at the back
and<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.159> probably<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:48.030> want<00:01:48.180> fresh<00:01:48.450> air<00:01:48.720> I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350

supposed<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.860> air<00:01:50.009> conditioning<00:01:50.610> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
supposed to the air conditioning that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
supposed to the air conditioning that
was<00:01:51.509> frustrating<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.439> love<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.220> interior

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
was frustrating I love the interior

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.240 
was frustrating I love the interior
especially<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.869> handles<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.770> handles<00:01:56.130> are

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
especially the handles the handles are

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.600 
especially the handles the handles are
beautiful<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> headlights<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
beautiful I like the headlights and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.510 
beautiful I like the headlights and
how<00:02:00.330> simple<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.870> dashboards<00:02:01.410> are<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.250> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
how simple the dashboards are you really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
how simple the dashboards are you really
don't<00:02:02.760> need<00:02:02.940> that<00:02:03.000> much<00:02:03.180> complication<00:02:03.900> way

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
don't need that much complication way

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.320 
don't need that much complication way
especially<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.100> driving<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.730> yeah<00:02:06.270> I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
especially when you're driving so yeah I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.180 
especially when you're driving so yeah I
think<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.690> very<00:02:06.810> practical<00:02:07.080> because<00:02:07.770> most

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
think it's very practical because most

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.760 
think it's very practical because most
of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.429> things<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.850> would<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:10.289> would<00:02:10.410> use<00:02:10.649> in

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
of the things you would you would use in

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.200 
of the things you would you would use in
the<00:02:10.860> cars<00:02:11.100> here<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.610> radio<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
the cars here the radio the

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.950 
the cars here the radio the
air-conditioning<00:02:13.100> Bluetooth<00:02:14.510> sat-nav

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
air-conditioning Bluetooth sat-nav

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.020 
air-conditioning Bluetooth sat-nav
but<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.680> more<00:02:16.890> modern<00:02:17.070> than<00:02:17.490> what<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.790> Drive

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
but it's more modern than what I Drive

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.630 
but it's more modern than what I Drive
so<00:02:18.240> it's<00:02:18.420> definitely<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.320> be<00:02:19.640> more

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so it's definitely going to be more

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.600 
so it's definitely going to be more
comfortable<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:21.600> me<00:02:22.100> practicing<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.310> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
comfortable for me practicing and and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
comfortable for me practicing and and
what<00:02:24.000> comes<00:02:24.360> with<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> cards<00:02:25.050> what<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.590> well

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
what comes with the cards what is well

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.090 
what comes with the cards what is well
worth<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.220> 13,000<00:02:27.060> pounds<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.620> I<00:02:28.740> don't<00:02:29.040> know

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
worth the 13,000 pounds but I don't know

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.330 
worth the 13,000 pounds but I don't know

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
about to drive should I Drive it I think

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
about to drive should I Drive it I think
that's<00:02:32.520> very<00:02:32.580> important<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.300> drive<00:02:33.740> yeah

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
that's very important on the drive yeah

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.330 
that's very important on the drive yeah
something<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.340> look<00:02:35.430> into<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.220> like

know displays I know that's the way
forward<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.130> like<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> large

dog<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.739> lip<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.070> boot<00:03:14.220> would<00:03:14.610> be<00:03:14.820> a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
dog and the lip on the boot would be a

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.330 
dog and the lip on the boot would be a
problem<00:03:15.269> possibly<00:03:16.260> but<00:03:16.470> it's<00:03:16.890> nothing<00:03:17.220> we

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
problem possibly but it's nothing we

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.250 
problem possibly but it's nothing we
couldn't<00:03:17.580> get<00:03:17.730> around<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.360> lot<00:03:18.720> of<00:03:18.840> cars<00:03:19.049> have

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
something like a 2cv who's been built

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.990 
something like a 2cv who's been built
for<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.690> function<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.320> do<00:03:37.470> certain<00:03:37.890> things<00:03:38.000> and

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
for a function to do certain things and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.300 
for a function to do certain things and
I<00:03:39.090> think<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.780> c4<00:03:40.380> cactus<00:03:40.410> has<00:03:40.980> done<00:03:41.190> the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
I think that the c4 cactus has done the

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.250 
I think that the c4 cactus has done the
same<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.850> think<00:03:41.910> function<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.810> main<00:03:42.989> thing

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
same I think function is the main thing

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.590 
same I think function is the main thing
it's<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.769> family<00:03:44.340> orientated<00:03:44.820> sized<00:03:45.209> Tower

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
it's a family orientated sized Tower

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.560 
it's a family orientated sized Tower
pretty<00:03:46.350> versatile<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.489> gonna<00:03:48.120> be<00:03:48.269> obviously

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
pretty versatile it's gonna be obviously

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.229 
pretty versatile it's gonna be obviously
value<00:03:49.049> for<00:03:49.260> money<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.830> it's<00:03:49.980> going<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.250> tick<00:03:51.209> a

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
value for money and it's going to tick a

lot of boxes for a lot of people when

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.220 
lot of boxes for a lot of people when
you<00:03:53.790> look<00:03:53.940> at<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.180> prototype<00:03:54.660> when<00:03:55.019> it<00:03:55.110> had<00:03:55.200> a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you look at the prototype when it had a

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.870 
you look at the prototype when it had a
full<00:03:55.470> bench<00:03:55.769> seat<00:03:56.100> in<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.280> front<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:56.700> thought

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
full bench seat in the front I thought

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.580 
full bench seat in the front I thought
that<00:03:57.060> was<00:03:57.180> brilliant<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.780> wish<00:03:58.079> that<00:03:58.290> had<00:03:58.410> gone

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
that was brilliant I wish that had gone

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.490 
that was brilliant I wish that had gone
into<00:03:58.799> this<00:03:59.100> current<00:03:59.970> car<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.480> very<00:04:00.540> close<00:04:01.200> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
into this current car it's very close to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.470 
into this current car it's very close to
a<00:04:01.620> full<00:04:01.890> bench

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
a full bench

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.790 
a full bench
and<00:04:03.480> with<00:04:03.599> all<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.050> Citron's<00:04:04.410> I've<00:04:04.560> had<00:04:04.680> in

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
and with all the Citron's I've had in

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.290 
and with all the Citron's I've had in
the<00:04:04.890> past<00:04:05.099> you<00:04:05.280> tend<00:04:05.489> not<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.730> notice<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
seeds because of that good so I really

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.640 
seeds because of that good so I really

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
good the wheels are quite distinctive

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.129 
good the wheels are quite distinctive
especially<00:04:14.459> with<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.610> more<00:04:15.420> flush<00:04:15.660> built-in

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
especially with a more flush built-in

really<00:04:19.560> look<00:04:19.919> at<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.130> dash<00:04:20.340> compared<00:04:21.180> to<00:04:21.329> a

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
really look at the dash compared to a

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.629 
really look at the dash compared to a
conventional<00:04:21.630> car<00:04:22.290> and<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.280> is<00:04:23.430> in<00:04:23.580> a

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
conventional car and it is in a

conventional car and it is in a
different<00:04:23.970> league<00:04:24.120> so<00:04:24.780> some<00:04:25.230> people<00:04:25.410> like<00:04:25.650> it

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
different league so some people like it

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.980 
different league so some people like it
some<00:04:26.130> people<00:04:26.340> won't<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.060> really<00:04:27.480> like<00:04:27.660> it

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
some people won't I really like it

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.170 
some people won't I really like it
taking<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.950> elements<00:04:29.490> off<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.730> car<00:04:29.940> that

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
taking all the elements off the car that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.360 
taking all the elements off the car that
are<00:04:30.240> not<00:04:30.389> wanted<00:04:30.870> like<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.740> electric<00:04:32.070> windows

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
are not wanted like the electric windows

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.270 
are not wanted like the electric windows
at<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.550> back<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.840> weight<00:04:34.500> saving<00:04:34.950> on<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
at the back the weight saving on the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.060 
at the back the weight saving on the
windscreen<00:04:35.700> wipers<00:04:36.210> things<00:04:36.419> like<00:04:36.570> that<00:04:37.070> the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
windscreen wipers things like that the

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.909 
windscreen wipers things like that the
weight<00:04:38.400> reduction<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.270> back<00:04:39.570> seats

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
weight reduction on the back seats

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:41.810 
weight reduction on the back seats
things<00:04:40.919> that<00:04:41.100> are<00:04:41.190> going<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.370> make<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.639> car

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
things that are going to make the car

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.450 
things that are going to make the car
more<00:04:42.090> efficient<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.560> it's<00:04:43.740> trying<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.040> save<00:04:44.250> a

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
more efficient so it's trying to save a

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.000 
more efficient so it's trying to save a
pound<00:04:44.700> here<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.090> pound<00:04:45.330> there<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.010> pound

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
pound here and a pound there so pound

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.620 
pound here and a pound there so pound
here<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.340> money<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.580> pound<00:04:47.850> here<00:04:48.030> in<00:04:48.210> weight<00:04:48.389> so

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
here in money a pound here in weight so

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.180 
here in money a pound here in weight so
I<00:04:48.690> think<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.260> weight<00:04:49.440> reduction<00:04:49.590> thing<00:04:50.040> is<00:04:50.160> a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
I think the weight reduction thing is a

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.700 
I think the weight reduction thing is a
key<00:04:50.460> thing<00:04:50.760> not<00:04:51.450> really<00:04:51.750> cross<00:04:52.020> over<00:04:52.440> it's<00:04:52.590> not

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
key thing not really cross over it's not

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.969 
key thing not really cross over it's not
