00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
were the first to use they didn't invent

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.879 
were the first to use they didn't invent
the<00:00:13.750> system<00:00:14.080> but<00:00:14.200> they<00:00:14.290> were<00:00:14.380> the<00:00:14.440> first<00:00:14.710> to

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
the system but they were the first to

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.950 
the system but they were the first to
use<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.940> flick<00:00:16.299> lock<00:00:16.740> idea<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.820> that's<00:00:19.720> what

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
use the flick lock idea and that's what

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.620 
use the flick lock idea and that's what
I<00:00:19.989> like<00:00:20.259> is<00:00:20.470> very<00:00:20.739> very<00:00:21.099> simple<00:00:21.340> I<00:00:21.700> can<00:00:22.210> pull

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.729 
shoot every so often
otherwise<00:00:26.470> the<00:00:26.649> oxidize<00:00:27.869> put<00:00:28.869> it<00:00:28.989> back<00:00:29.169> lock

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
otherwise the oxidize put it back lock

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:30.240 
otherwise the oxidize put it back lock
it<00:00:29.890> in

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
it in

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.500

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
open it you tie them there to screw up a

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.670 
open it you tie them there to screw up a
bit<00:00:39.190> with<00:00:39.610> your<00:00:39.730> fingernail<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:40.630> it's<00:00:41.350> nice

bit with your fingernail and it's nice
and<00:00:41.980> tight<00:00:42.130> so<00:00:42.190> you<00:00:42.430> can't<00:00:42.760> move<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.210> no<00:00:43.450> okay

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
so it's very easy to maintain and you

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.860 
so it's very easy to maintain and you
should<00:00:47.040> move<00:00:48.040> them<00:00:49.079> pull<00:00:50.079> them<00:00:50.260> down<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.500> bit<00:00:50.710> or

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
should move them pull them down a bit or

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.319 
should move them pull them down a bit or
increase<00:00:52.870> their<00:00:53.050> height<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.760> for<00:00:54.970> them<00:00:55.120> down

it's<00:01:37.330> opinion<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.049> I'll<00:01:38.200> show<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.440> how<00:01:39.159> they

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
it's opinion so I'll show you how they

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.170 
it's opinion so I'll show you how they
actually<00:01:39.729> work<00:01:40.320> okay<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:41.560> first<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.700> set<00:01:43.090> them

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
actually work okay so first you set them

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.730 
actually work okay so first you set them
up<00:01:43.360> at<00:01:43.720> about<00:01:44.560> elbow<00:01:45.340> height

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.660 

then<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.610> do<00:01:49.790> use<00:01:50.120> two<00:01:50.390> Falls<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:52.190> get<00:01:52.369> better

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
then I do use two Falls you get better

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.240 
then I do use two Falls you get better
balance<00:01:53.090> than<00:01:53.150> 20<00:01:53.600> but<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.960> traction<00:01:56.950> okay

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
balance than 20 but the traction okay

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.070 
balance than 20 but the traction okay
something<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:58.940> that<00:01:59.300> not<00:01:59.450> like<00:01:59.659> that

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
something like that not like that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.260 
something like that not like that
however<00:02:00.650> since<00:02:01.070> I've<00:02:01.280> got<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.580> at<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.850> if

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
however since I've got it at this if

however since I've got it at this if
you're<00:02:02.479> going<00:02:02.630> down<00:02:02.750> here<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:03.590> want<00:02:03.860> it

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
you're going down here you want it

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.580 
you're going down here you want it
longer<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:04.640> by<00:02:05.270> this<00:02:05.330> height<00:02:05.690> if<00:02:06.440> you're<00:02:06.619> going

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
longer so by this height if you're going

night is I don't need to eat the poor so
when<00:03:30.860> I<00:03:30.890> do<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.120> don't<00:03:32.329> need<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.629> do<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:32.959> so

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
when I do the I don't need to do this so

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.360 
when I do the I don't need to do this so
my<00:03:33.790> waist<00:03:34.790> keeps<00:03:35.239> moving<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.959> keep<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:36.980> strange

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
my waist keeps moving I keep you strange

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.839

because<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:39.590> touch<00:03:39.920> that<00:03:40.280> and<00:03:40.549> I<00:03:40.640> know

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
because I just touch that and I know

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:52.910 
because I just touch that and I know
this<00:03:41.120> part

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.230 

and<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:54.060> our<00:03:54.540> walk<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.670> don't<00:03:56.670> really<00:03:57.000> need

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
and that's our walk I don't really need

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.540 
and that's our walk I don't really need
to<00:03:57.300> move<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.840> recently<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.980> there's<00:03:59.310> two

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
to move that recently so there's two

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.699 
to move that recently so there's two
reason<00:03:59.910> why<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.660> should<00:04:00.930> have<00:04:01.020> this<00:04:01.110> tap<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
reason why you should have this tap you

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.210 
reason why you should have this tap you
like<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.700> for<00:04:02.880> safety<00:04:03.319> next<00:04:04.319> for<00:04:04.560> just

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
like that one for safety next for just

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.080 
like that one for safety next for just
simply<00:04:05.640> economics<00:04:06.440> avoiding<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:08.870> that's<00:04:09.870> it
