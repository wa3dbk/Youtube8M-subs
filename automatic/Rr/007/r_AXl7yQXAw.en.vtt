video this is the type of grinder bit

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600 
video this is the type of grinder bit
that<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.390> sell<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:55.050> our<00:00:55.199> glass<00:00:55.469> studio<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.550> can

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
that we sell in our glass studio you can

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
that we sell in our glass studio you can
get<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> online<00:00:58.039> it's<00:00:59.039> an<00:00:59.219> eighth<00:00:59.340> inch<00:00:59.370> bit

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
get it online it's an eighth inch bit

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
get it online it's an eighth inch bit
now<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> things<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> point

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
out before I turn the grinder on is that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.710 
out before I turn the grinder on is that
you<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.110> not<00:01:04.320> want<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.799> push<00:01:05.180> against<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.510> bit

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you do not want to push against the bit

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.190 
you do not want to push against the bit
you<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.159> top<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.020> reason<00:01:10.020> for

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you want to be on top of it reason for

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
you want to be on top of it reason for
that<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.890> push<00:01:11.159> against<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that is that if you push against it you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.600 
that is that if you push against it you
may<00:01:12.210> bend<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.350> may<00:01:13.500> bend<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.100> distort

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
may bend it you may bend it and distort

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
may bend it you may bend it and distort

it over then you'll have a bit that's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.260 
it over then you'll have a bit that's
out<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.970> round<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.280> that'll<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.850> hard<00:01:21.060> on

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
out of round and and that'll be hard on

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.170 
out of round and and that'll be hard on
your<00:01:21.450> grinder<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> it'll<00:01:22.439> also<00:01:22.820> be<00:01:23.820> hard<00:01:24.090> on

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
motion but you notice that my hole is a

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.130 
motion but you notice that my hole is a
lot<00:03:21.280> closer<00:03:21.550> to<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:22.000> edge<00:03:22.240> it<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.600> over<00:03:22.960> here

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
lot closer to this edge it is over here

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.440 
lot closer to this edge it is over here
so<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:23.380> have<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.430> pay<00:03:24.610> attention<00:03:25.120> as<00:03:25.270> to

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
jewels that fit in it were very nice so

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.230 
jewels that fit in it were very nice so
that's<00:04:44.940> how<00:04:45.120> it's<00:04:45.300> done<00:04:47.060> all<00:04:48.060> right<00:04:48.120> and

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
that's how it's done all right and

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
that's how it's done all right and
here's<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.810> yin-yang<00:04:49.070> that<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:51.570> we<00:04:51.690> did<00:04:51.930> you

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
here's the yin-yang that that we did you

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.220 
here's the yin-yang that that we did you
can<00:04:52.440> see<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.970> two<00:04:54.210> jewels<00:04:54.570> that<00:04:55.110> are

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.780 
can see the the two jewels that are
ground<00:04:57.920> Jeannie<00:04:58.920> and<00:04:59.070> I<00:04:59.160> did<00:04:59.370> that<00:04:59.550> piece

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
ground Jeannie and I did that piece

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.060 
ground Jeannie and I did that piece
together<00:05:00.060> so<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.540> guess<00:05:00.840> she<00:05:01.110> can<00:05:01.290> sign<00:05:01.560> off<00:05:01.800> for

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
together so I guess she can sign off for

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.130 
together so I guess she can sign off for
us
