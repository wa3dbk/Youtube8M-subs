00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
forums it's free for incoming calls
I<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.800> 1.9<00:00:59.579> cents<00:01:00.239> per<00:01:00.480> minute

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
I think it's 1.9 cents per minute

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.380 
I think it's 1.9 cents per minute
outgoing<00:01:01.289> calls<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.160> it's<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.579> cheap<00:01:02.640> if<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
