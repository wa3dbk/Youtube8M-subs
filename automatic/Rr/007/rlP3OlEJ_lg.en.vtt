00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
going to college I took a class in the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060 
going to college I took a class in the
history<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.910> photography<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.800> was<00:00:25.920> at

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
history of photography and it was at

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.650 
history of photography and it was at
that<00:00:26.099> time<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:27.029> fell<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.480> love

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
that time that I really fell in love

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.970 
that time that I really fell in love
with<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> few<00:00:28.080> different<00:00:28.439> photographers

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
with a few different photographers

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.640 
with a few different photographers
Walker<00:00:29.279> Evans<00:00:29.490> being<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.150> them<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.650> so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
Walker Evans being one of them and so

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.760 
Walker Evans being one of them and so

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
pictures you see the artist's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
pictures you see the artist's
progression<00:01:06.150> how<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.540> change<00:01:07.010> how<00:01:08.010> they

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
progression how they change how they

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.830 
progression how they change how they
become<00:01:08.490> interested<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.210> thing<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.750> then

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
become interested in one thing and then

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.280 
become interested in one thing and then
another<00:01:10.070> I<00:01:11.070> guess<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.060> attracted<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
another I guess I was attracted to the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.460 
another I guess I was attracted to the
creative<00:01:14.100> mind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> artist<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:16.290> was

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
creative mind of the artist and it was

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.640 
creative mind of the artist and it was
it<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.130> really<00:01:17.460> only<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:18.200> studying<00:01:19.200> an<00:01:19.290> artist

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it was really only by studying an artist

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.609 
it was really only by studying an artist
in<00:01:19.860> particular<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.450> deep<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.960> their

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
in particular and going deep on their

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.100 
in particular and going deep on their
work<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.850> found<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> could<00:01:24.840> really

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
work that I found that I could really

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020 
work that I found that I could really
understand<00:01:25.710> what<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.000> were

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
understand what it was that they were

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
understand what it was that they were
about<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:28.850> probably<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.770> 40

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
about I probably have about 40

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
about I probably have about 40
photographers<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.549> collection<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
photographers in the collection and

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.590 
photographers in the collection and
perhaps<00:01:33.540> somewhere<00:01:34.110> around<00:01:34.369> 1400<00:01:35.369> works<00:01:35.640> it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
perhaps somewhere around 1400 works it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
perhaps somewhere around 1400 works it's
obviously<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> lot<00:01:37.229> more<00:01:37.259> works<00:01:37.650> than<00:01:37.890> anybody

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
obviously a lot more works than anybody

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.249 
obviously a lot more works than anybody
can<00:01:38.400> show<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> reasons

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can show and that's one of the reasons

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.130 
can show and that's one of the reasons
why<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:41.189> Andy<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.670> Mary<00:01:42.000> Polara<00:01:42.479> invited<00:01:43.020> me

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
why when Andy and Mary Polara invited me

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
why when Andy and Mary Polara invited me
to<00:01:43.259> show<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.590> collection<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
to show the collection here I was so

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240 
to show the collection here I was so
excited<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.380> able<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.100> all

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
excited to be able to do it because all

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
excited to be able to do it because all
of<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.399> sudden<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> chance<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:49.229> what

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
of a sudden I have a chance to see what

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
of a sudden I have a chance to see what
the<00:01:49.710> collection<00:01:49.979> truly<00:01:50.670> looks<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.360> its

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the collection truly looks like in its

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.209 
the collection truly looks like in its
totality<00:01:52.439> as<00:01:52.890> opposed<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:54.110> snippets<00:01:55.219> they're

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
totality as opposed to snippets they're

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.959 
totality as opposed to snippets they're
40<00:01:56.700> artists<00:01:57.210> probably<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.229> total<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> would

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
40 artists probably in total but I would

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.690 
40 artists probably in total but I would
say<00:02:00.210> 20<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:02.460> deep

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
say 20 where I have really deep

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.600 
say 20 where I have really deep
collections<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.750> Walker<00:02:04.469> Evans<00:02:04.770> Lee

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
places in these galleries where I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.640 
places in these galleries where I
deviate<00:02:32.280> from<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.900> William<00:02:33.900> Eggleston<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.620> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
deviate from that William Eggleston is a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.250 
deviate from that William Eggleston is a
color<00:02:35.160> photographer<00:02:35.880> who<00:02:36.690> starred<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
dye transfer prints so that would be

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.530 
dye transfer prints so that would be

Surrealists<00:03:09.620> works<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.580> ivv<00:03:11.570> it<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.840> little<00:03:12.080> bit

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
Surrealists works so ivv it a little bit

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.050 
Surrealists works so ivv it a little bit
but<00:03:12.920> I've<00:03:13.040> always<00:03:13.250> felt<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.730> with

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
but I've always felt that with

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.200 
but I've always felt that with
photography<00:03:14.720> because<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:16.210> approachable

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
photography because of the approachable

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.840 
photography because of the approachable
nature<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.960> work<00:03:18.200> that<00:03:19.130> with<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
nature of the work that with the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.820 
nature of the work that with the
collection<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.540> really<00:03:20.570> needed<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.140> be<00:03:21.320> focused

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
collection I really needed to be focused

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.910 
collection I really needed to be focused
because<00:03:22.190> if<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.670> only<00:03:23.000> if<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.630> bought<00:03:23.920> everything

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
because if I only if I bought everything

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.980 
because if I only if I bought everything
I<00:03:25.010> liked<00:03:25.310> all<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> sudden<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.480> turn<00:03:26.720> around

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
I liked all of a sudden I turn around

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.380 
I liked all of a sudden I turn around
and<00:03:27.200> I<00:03:27.260> would<00:03:27.440> see<00:03:27.650> so<00:03:28.040> many<00:03:28.190> pieces<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:28.970> they

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
and I would see so many pieces and they

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.750 
and I would see so many pieces and they
really<00:03:29.660> wouldn't<00:03:29.900> make<00:03:30.260> much<00:03:31.010> sense<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.550> I've

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
really wouldn't make much sense so I've

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.480 
really wouldn't make much sense so I've
tried<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.150> make<00:03:32.180> sense<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.380> collection<00:03:33.920> by

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
tried to make sense in the collection by

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.630 
tried to make sense in the collection by
focusing<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.470> single<00:03:36.470> artists<00:03:36.950> and<00:03:37.130> going

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
focusing on single artists and going

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.100 
focusing on single artists and going
deep<00:03:37.880> within<00:03:38.150> those<00:03:38.450> artists<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:44.750> know<00:03:44.780> never

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
deep within those artists you know never

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.440 
deep within those artists you know never
really<00:03:45.200> concentrated<00:03:46.160> on<00:03:46.250> portraiture<00:03:47.030> per

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
really concentrated on portraiture per

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.840 
really concentrated on portraiture per
se<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:48.500> would<00:03:48.950> say<00:03:49.130> actually<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:49.610> there<00:03:49.790> are

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
se I would say actually that there are

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.370 
se I would say actually that there are
probably<00:03:50.060> more<00:03:50.360> pieces<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.260> collection

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
probably more pieces in the collection

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.910 
probably more pieces in the collection
that<00:03:51.920> are<00:03:51.950> without<00:03:52.460> people<00:03:52.940> than<00:03:53.240> with<00:03:53.450> people

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
that are without people than with people

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.470 
that are without people than with people
there<00:03:54.920> are<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> lot<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.250> landscape<00:03:55.880> photographs

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
there are a lot of landscape photographs

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.970 
there are a lot of landscape photographs
although<00:03:56.720> I'm<00:03:56.930> not<00:03:57.110> even<00:03:57.410> particularly

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
although I'm not even particularly

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.280 
although I'm not even particularly
interested<00:03:58.490> in<00:03:58.610> landscape<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.900> what<00:04:00.200> I'm

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
interested in landscape so what I'm

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.950 
interested in landscape so what I'm
interested<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:00.890> really<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.700> is<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.450> style

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
interested in really is the is the style

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.670 
interested in really is the is the style
of<00:04:03.230> photography<00:04:03.380> that's<00:04:04.130> clear<00:04:04.730> that's<00:04:05.150> not

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
of photography that's clear that's not

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.550 
of photography that's clear that's not
per<00:04:06.680> se<00:04:07.040> about<00:04:07.640> emotion<00:04:08.290> many<00:04:09.290> of<00:04:09.440> the

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
per se about emotion many of the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
per se about emotion many of the
photographs<00:04:10.060> are<00:04:11.060> actually<00:04:11.890> quite<00:04:12.890> devoid<00:04:13.370> of

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
photographs are actually quite devoid of

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.670 
photographs are actually quite devoid of
that<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.239> but<00:04:14.540> they<00:04:14.660> do<00:04:14.720> give<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.320> viewer

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
that and and but they do give the viewer

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.880 
that and and but they do give the viewer
a<00:04:15.800> chance<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.660> almost<00:04:17.660> put<00:04:18.049> their<00:04:18.230> own<00:04:18.260> emotion

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
a chance to almost put their own emotion

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.670 
a chance to almost put their own emotion
into<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.250> picture

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680

Evans<00:04:21.680> was<00:04:21.950> particularly<00:04:22.490> interested<00:04:23.150> in

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
Evans was particularly interested in

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.890 
Evans was particularly interested in
signs<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.200> in<00:04:24.380> documenting<00:04:25.280> America<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.030> for

signs and in documenting America and for
many<00:04:27.350> artists<00:04:28.070> there's<00:04:28.550> nothing<00:04:28.970> that

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
want it to affect the way I look at the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.750 
want it to affect the way I look at the
work<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.780> think<00:05:15.470> when<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.740> meet<00:05:15.950> an<00:05:16.130> artist<00:05:16.280> and

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
work I think when you meet an artist and

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.790 
work I think when you meet an artist and
you<00:05:16.880> learn<00:05:17.240> more<00:05:17.480> about<00:05:17.540> who<00:05:18.200> they<00:05:18.410> are<00:05:18.440> as<00:05:18.680> an

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
you learn more about who they are as an

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.120 
you learn more about who they are as an
individual<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:20.390> it<00:05:20.780> I<00:05:21.020> find<00:05:21.470> that<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.740> affects

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
individual it it I find that it affects

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.760 
individual it it I find that it affects
how<00:05:22.460> you<00:05:22.520> think<00:05:22.970> about<00:05:23.090> their<00:05:23.390> work<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:24.590> the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
how you think about their work and the

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.320 
how you think about their work and the
kind<00:05:24.980> of<00:05:25.040> passion<00:05:25.220> you<00:05:25.580> have<00:05:25.610> for<00:05:25.820> their<00:05:26.120> work

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
kind of passion you have for their work

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.720 
kind of passion you have for their work
so<00:05:26.720> and<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.650> think<00:05:27.710> at<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.070> same<00:05:28.130> time<00:05:28.490> you<00:05:28.640> know

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
so and I think at the same time you know

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.230 
so and I think at the same time you know
the<00:05:28.880> artists<00:05:30.520> frankly<00:05:31.520> they'd<00:05:31.730> probably<00:05:31.940> be

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
the artists frankly they'd probably be

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.390 
the artists frankly they'd probably be
rather<00:05:32.570> be<00:05:32.840> left<00:05:33.080> alone<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.680> think<00:05:33.890> collectors

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
rather be left alone I think collectors

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.790 
rather be left alone I think collectors
for<00:05:34.640> them<00:05:34.820> or<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.060> in<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.930> way<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.110> necessary<00:05:36.740> evil

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
for them or a in a way a necessary evil

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.250 
for them or a in a way a necessary evil
a<00:05:37.310> way<00:05:37.460> for<00:05:37.670> them<00:05:37.790> to<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:38.360> sell<00:05:38.660> their<00:05:38.840> art<00:05:39.050> and

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
a way for them to to sell their art and

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.060 
a way for them to to sell their art and
for<00:05:39.500> them<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:39.620> to<00:05:40.490> continue<00:05:40.940> to<00:05:41.030> live<00:05:41.270> but<00:05:42.070> but

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
for them to to continue to live but but

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.470 
for them to to continue to live but but
I<00:05:43.100> think<00:05:43.400> it's<00:05:43.550> it's<00:05:43.940> the<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.300> know<00:05:44.330> the

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
I think it's it's the you know the

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.420 
I think it's it's the you know the
creative<00:05:44.930> mind<00:05:45.170> needs<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.680> be<00:05:45.830> left<00:05:46.070> alone<00:05:46.370> to

creative mind needs to be left alone to

at the entire collection we started

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:22.379 
at the entire collection we started
thinking<00:06:21.129> about<00:06:21.219> what<00:06:21.609> would<00:06:21.789> go<00:06:21.969> into<00:06:22.149> each

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
thinking about what would go into each

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.399 
thinking about what would go into each
room<00:06:22.779> and<00:06:23.409> he<00:06:23.769> as<00:06:24.009> the<00:06:24.389> the<00:06:25.389> patron<00:06:25.869> here<00:06:26.289> at

the Pilar Foundation had input into that

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.659 
the Pilar Foundation had input into that
and<00:06:29.439> then<00:06:29.649> it<00:06:29.769> turned<00:06:29.979> out<00:06:30.159> that<00:06:30.219> when<00:06:30.609> the
