make them different if you want all you
must<00:04:38.060> do<00:04:38.360> for<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.550> hands<00:04:40.820> it's<00:04:41.060> really

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
must do for the the hands it's really

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.980 
must do for the the hands it's really
simple

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
simple

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.379 
simple
obviously<00:04:42.350> they<00:04:42.470> share<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:43.760> block<00:04:44.030> of<00:04:44.270> the

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
obviously they share the block of the

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.580 
obviously they share the block of the
end<00:04:44.539> of<00:04:44.630> their<00:04:44.750> hands<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.260> just<00:04:45.440> got<00:04:45.560> a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
end of their hands so you just got a

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.210 
end of their hands so you just got a
debauch<00:04:45.949> hero<00:04:46.310> more<00:04:46.910> complicated

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220
