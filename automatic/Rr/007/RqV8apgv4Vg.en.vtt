to the e-reader its passes on to pokemon
ruby<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.579> sapphire<00:00:48.050> but<00:00:49.050> however<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.890> only

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
ruby or sapphire but however the only

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
ruby or sapphire but however the only
way<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> obtain<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.120> in<00:00:51.180> pokemon<00:00:51.690> emerald<00:00:51.899> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
way to obtain it in pokemon emerald is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.990 
way to obtain it in pokemon emerald is
to<00:00:52.890> record<00:00:53.309> mixing<00:00:53.879> water<00:00:54.030> Ruby<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:54.780> sapphire

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
to record mixing water Ruby or sapphire

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.930 
to record mixing water Ruby or sapphire
however<00:00:57.379> Japanese<00:00:58.379> Ruby<00:00:59.039> cannot<00:00:59.370> record<00:00:59.609> mix

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
however Japanese Ruby cannot record mix

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
however Japanese Ruby cannot record mix
with<00:01:00.149> drink<00:01:00.449> these<00:01:00.660> games<00:01:00.989> since<00:01:01.770> they<00:01:01.920> have

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
with drink these games since they have

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.299 
with drink these games since they have
different<00:01:02.070> languages<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.769> guess<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.070> record

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
different languages I guess the record

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
different languages I guess the record
mixing<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.119> region<00:01:06.510> log<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.710> can't

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
mixing is region log in there so I can't

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.510 
mixing is region log in there so I can't
mix<00:01:08.340> records<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> Japanese<00:01:09.510> Ruby<00:01:10.490> but<00:01:11.490> I

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
mix records with a Japanese Ruby but I

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.359 
mix records with a Japanese Ruby but I
got<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.689> try<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.110> works<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
got see and try if it works with the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.469 
got see and try if it works with the
Aeon<00:01:14.640> ticket<00:01:15.000> later

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
Aeon ticket later

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.039 
Aeon ticket later
so<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:17.280> Aeon<00:01:17.640> ticket<00:01:18.180> allows<00:01:18.659> me<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
so this Aeon ticket allows me to

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.969 
so this Aeon ticket allows me to
