00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.210
 everyone here is great again 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 today there is neither a new tutorial 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.530
 for you and I wanted you in 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 In this video we show the autocar 10 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.010
 even the new exotics are just this 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.270
 I can give you this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.710
 show it at the end 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.359
 but I just wanted to give you a quick tour 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.800
 We show these simple free 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.019
 you can switch and you have to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.490
 Whole to win on the card that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.619
 means there he could at the end of this 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.939
 Post as so and I will give you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 explain exactly how that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 whole works you will be round 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.360
 five so round 5 starts then 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.860
 you hear at the beginning oster says you'll 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.020
 Immediately teleported in 10 seconds 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.550
 and then comes in a certain space 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 and you have to have this room for a short time 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 a bit more than five rounds are waiting there 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.309
 you will be about 30 seconds later 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 teleport out again 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 you have to play until round 13 at the beginning 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.120
 the round 13 happens again only 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.129
 that they are out this time 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.289
 Somehow, that would have to fight somehow 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.270
 means there are at the top of the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.489
 walls so small fan or small 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 housing where the seat on the switches 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.080
 and you just have to kill it 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.090
 that means there will always fall 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.010
 Activated and after the case is activated 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 that means they're back out 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.820
 then the window opens where it is 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
 seated and had to hurry up to him 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.110
 shoot him and kill him if he does 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.060
 then he has exploded 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.310
 so to speak and lauda flames come out 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.170
 Out of this room and then you have to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 wait until the other three cars arrive 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.470
 that means there are four pieces in total 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.880
 everyone has to kill and if you have that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.159
 So managed the four pieces 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.079
 have killed then you will be back after 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.450
 teleported outside and now you just have to 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.430
 to play until round 20 because there is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 the final fight against cheers 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.649
 so to speak then comes this mutant os 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.229
 So this big zombie this boss 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.939
 tommy where then up at your house 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.409
 and the life is and can be there 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 I just give you a tip 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.689
 arm yourselves first round 20 pretty good 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.219
 because you can not score this room 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.149
 that means you can only do that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.070
 take points with you 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.990
 who did it before and even 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.670
 somehow make points that is unfortunately 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.680
 so do not get into the room 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.329
 first good and the tactics at 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.489
 this thing is really just that you 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.069
 the house in the middle must entice 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.780
 this decontamination station and him 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.680
 there you almost have to guess that is if 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.719
 you stand there and the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.129
 it comes then we have to but the 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:19.920
 thing there so activate this 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.719
 decoration station and will therefore for 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.480
 short time yesterday and you can then 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.980
 also harm and only in this 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.109
 time can only hurt 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.579
 Add that means after that, too 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.650
 deactivate the generator again 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.299
 after getting the decontamination station 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.280
 have activated and you have the 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.659
 only turn on generators again 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.219
 it gets a bit harder too 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.230
 After that it will be too 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.730
 At the same time, I activate it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.500
 think it's okay you can do it 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.359
 short and you can do it well 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.409
 in twos or threes or in twos 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.060
 you just have to be a little bit 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.400
 to deny that means everyone takes over 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.409
 Continue his generator and then you can 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.480
 it will be easy to get it down, too 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.919
 shoot him , so to speak, and so on 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.079
 if you did that now gets done 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.819
 her, of course , a success and the 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:02.639
 is somehow again killed or killed 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.189
 Son so and as soon as you come back 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.959
 could have been teleported to the outside 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.489
 yes, the game will end or too 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.799
 just die somehow that's completely 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.750
 no matter what, that should be the case 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.760
 she died time then becomes easy on 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.280
 at the end of the game 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.290
 is displayed in the main menu you have one 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.879
 new cats unlocked and thus 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.840
 Do you have the car k10 then ? 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.250

 Lennox was campaigned for the extinction of the 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.709
 source of atlas infection 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.730

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 Dekker finally had the chance 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.210
 the right to being there 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.110
