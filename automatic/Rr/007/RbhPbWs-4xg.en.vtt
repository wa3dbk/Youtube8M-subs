00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.380
 Hello and welcome because the Domfreunde 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.680
 We've got a lot of suggestions lately, including on the 4th 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.989
 as before strongly cooled 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.709
 Kobayashi url that she was frustration bandage want to do 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.130
 And definitely must be very happy sends us in any case 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.249
 continued success proposals 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.909
 and if that sort of way 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.919
 with the law Bommel duel 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.409
 Johnson foul warned 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.810
 so Diana Ross I have already poured 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.300
 saw differently 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 after tasting a bit in between 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.090
 more structural chees already cheers 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.000
 prepared on a baking sheet 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.070
 And of course, here are dressed up so of course, need for it 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.670
 what is still missing 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.380
 send our cook 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.790
 so the boiled ham I have down here there are a lot of different ones 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.890
 Possibilities to get involved 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.630
 some do it with margarine butter 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.790
 with the show or mayonnaise 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.470
 I'm going to write death now, too 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.920
 then, of course, miracles happen 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 Guttenberg is 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 So then our toast will look like Hawaii 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.790
 the Commerzbank may 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 8 minutes in the preheated oven 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.540
 and in the meantime Voigt expected you can betray more times 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.270
 their big cleaning is also here with my power 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.660
 with margarine or even better 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.660
 So I still have that with mine 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.190
 after this 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 Century after a few minutes we have already here 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 Toast Hawai 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190
 Lakic already a little corner 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.080
 because that's what I definitely enjoy now 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 I still have a little prizes or jam to pay and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.540
 in small 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.430
 even decorated to it 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.039
 and that is always a lot of fun 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.569
 then raced 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.099
 the garden friends
