Applejack was probably pulling down the
apples<00:02:44.910> with<00:02:45.150> when<00:02:45.630> or<00:02:45.870> harness<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.680> thing

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
apples with when or harness the thing

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.890

around her broke and and you know
apparently<00:02:49.500> apples<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.370> blur<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
apparently apples that blur in the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.910 
apparently apples that blur in the
ability<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.540> skyrocket<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.350> air<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.770> let

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
inland exactly on Fluttershy and the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.440 
inland exactly on Fluttershy and the
whole<00:02:58.470> reason<00:02:58.530> why<00:02:59.070> Apple<00:02:59.700> Bloom<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.120> even

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
whole reason why Apple Bloom is even

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.540 
whole reason why Apple Bloom is even
there<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.080> her<00:03:01.290> mind<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.650> first<00:03:01.860> case<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
there and her mind the first case is the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.740 
there and her mind the first case is the
last<00:03:02.760> person<00:03:02.910> she<00:03:03.150> talked<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.650> right<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.690> you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
last person she talked to right so you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.560 
last person she talked to right so you
know<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.020> be<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> most<00:03:07.380> fresh<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.830> her<00:03:07.890> mind

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
know it's be the most fresh in her mind

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.330 
know it's be the most fresh in her mind
so<00:03:09.570> then<00:03:09.780> her<00:03:10.050> subconscious<00:03:10.470> took<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.100> form

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
so then her subconscious took the form

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.180 
so then her subconscious took the form
of<00:03:11.490> creepy<00:03:11.880> Apple<00:03:12.180> Bloom<00:03:15.770> of<00:03:16.770> course<00:03:17.010> the
