00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.180
 because we're going to see a red moon this 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.600
 night 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.120
 the cycle written from the moon when the 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.519
 Earth is crossed to the moon with 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.460
 with respect to the sun from the sun block 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.340
 then the sun what it does is move to 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.200
 across the horizon of the earth 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.210
 let's say the moon that everything all the 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.279
 horizon of the earth and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.829
 preferentially the light that is left 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.599
 pass on the horizon is red 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.860
 in fact when the moon rises we the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.160
 we see red because 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.170
 preferentially the atmosphere allows 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.490
 pass the color red 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.080
 then the moon what you are seeing is 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.640
 practically all sunsets or 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.330
 all the dawns of the world at the same 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.040
 time and that red light that comes in the 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.400
 that is going to color it to see 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.780
 say that that red light we're going to see 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.070
 are the sun's rays 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.219
 that pass over the speaker the atmosphere 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.219
 land 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.580
 they are projected on the moon giving it this 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.259
 colorful red many people believe and here 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.770
 it's good that we're pointing out that 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.259
 red moon sets and rather 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.100
 it's about a perception of the moon with 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.780
 that color not effectively but there 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.479
 of possibilities 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.520
 the moon may become very dark is 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.590
 can turn yellow color 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.080
 orange or red this is it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.540
 known as the union scale 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.430
 then it is very interesting to see during 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.340
 the maximum of the color eclipse he put 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.500
 the moon this time we're going to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.140
 can see doctor of leo from the city 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060
 from Mexico from any point of the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.160
 Mexican Republic we will be able to do what 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.260
 they say that in fact they will be able to see 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.130
 from any point in the hemisphere 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.130
 north this is so 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.650
 practically the entire sector 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.710
 classic 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.720
 but the rest of America 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.049
 I was listening to some comments 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.910
 that also the red coloration more 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.220
 intense could depend on 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.710
 pollution elements of the 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.840
 terrestrial atmosphere this is how the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.340
 Right 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 the particles that are found 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.930
 suspended in the 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.000
 in the place where it is 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.069
 the sunlight that is going to be projected 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.120
 towards the moon will help us the color 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.370
 all the drawing 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.930
 wildfires eruptions 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.060
 recent volcanic or much 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.710
 pollution the cloudiness is going to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.110
 help make the color more red 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.660
 then the coloration is going to be more 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.400
 yellowish or darker even doctor 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.700
 then we can only see that now 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.109
 that now 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.400
 yes indeed as mentioned 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:54.260
 your 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.260
 reaction of the night starts but efe 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.299
 All shadows have two components 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.569
 the darkest and the lightest that are the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.810
 shadow and the penumbra correct the eclipse 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.070
 penumbral is very 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.830
 carlos simple view the eclipse 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.200
 starts at 58 minutes after 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.570
 midnight time from the center of mexico 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.430
 then from that moment we are going to 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.190
 can see how the moon will be losing 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.790
 shine a little bit of there until 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.710
 arrives at 246 in the morning which is the 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.410
 maximum eclipse when we are going to be able 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.010
 see as color change and from there 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.800
 until 4 33 in the morning she will leave 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.740
 of the work and then it will be over 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.570
 the very interesting part of the eclipse a 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.000
 minute then it's not to be scared anymore 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.890
 well it is to enjoy it is a 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.870
 opportunity to enjoy it we are going to see it 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.780
 another complete from Mexico to the year 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.900
 2019 although we're going to see another 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.200
 in October and it is also observed to simple 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.600
 sight does not harm the view and we do not need 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.410
 telescopes then everything can 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.690
 observe 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.160
 of the city from the field or from 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.160
 some small suburban areas
