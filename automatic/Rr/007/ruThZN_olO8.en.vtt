really short mod if you haven't noticed

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.080 
really short mod if you haven't noticed
by<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> time<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.519> doesn't<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> lot

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
by the time because it doesn't do a lot

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.300 
by the time because it doesn't do a lot
but<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> does<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:28.050> some<00:00:28.289> really<00:00:28.650> insane<00:00:29.039> things

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
but it does do some really insane things

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
that no other mods could possibly do so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.350 
that no other mods could possibly do so

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the ground that will slowly start to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
the ground that will slowly start to
disappear<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.570> there

disappear right now there you go there

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.210 
disappear right now there you go there
you<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.200> don't<00:01:46.799> think<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.979> works<00:01:47.130> with

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you go I don't think it works with

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
you go I don't think it works with
spiders<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:47.939> don't<00:01:48.119> think<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.540> with

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
spiders I don't think you can do with

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
spiders I don't think you can do with
spiders<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.680> guess<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.159> doesn't<00:01:50.369> hurt<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> try

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
spiders I guess it doesn't hurt to try

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.999 
spiders I guess it doesn't hurt to try
but<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.020> spiders<00:01:52.439> are<00:01:52.590> gonna<00:01:52.710> work

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
but I don't think spiders are gonna work

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.469 
but I don't think spiders are gonna work
yeah<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.579> think<00:01:53.700> spiders<00:01:54.090> work<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
yeah I don't think spiders work it's

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.260 
yeah I don't think spiders work it's
mainly<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:55.070> skeletons<00:01:56.070> skeletons<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.119> don't

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
mainly like skeletons skeletons I don't

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.399 
mainly like skeletons skeletons I don't
think<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.450> works<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.689> creepers<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.290> could

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
think it works with creepers we could

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.800 
think it works with creepers we could
try<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> guess<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.399> probably<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.329> blowing<00:02:00.689> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
try I guess but probably not blowing you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
up maybe hmm come on creeper let me try

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.539 
up maybe hmm come on creeper let me try
I<00:02:04.079> mean<00:02:04.229> let<00:02:04.740> me<00:02:04.799> try<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:04.979> take<00:02:05.189> off<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.430> head

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
yeah it doesn't it doesn't work with

whatever<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.640> strike<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.180> or<00:02:28.630> whatever<00:02:28.900> you

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
whatever you strike it or whatever you

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.470 
whatever you strike it or whatever you
want<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.530> come<00:02:29.770> off<00:02:29.980> its<00:02:30.700> gonna<00:02:30.820> come<00:02:31.000> off<00:02:31.210> so

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
want to come off its gonna come off so

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.780 
want to come off its gonna come off so
for<00:02:31.660> example<00:02:31.960> we<00:02:32.110> strike<00:02:32.440> at<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:33.310> his<00:02:33.490> arm

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
for example we strike at just his arm

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.670 
for example we strike at just his arm
actually<00:02:34.720> he<00:02:34.810> kind<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.110> turned<00:02:35.320> around<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.650> I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
actually he kind of turned around so I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.900 
actually he kind of turned around so I
think<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.890> was<00:02:35.950> harm<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.430> were<00:02:36.490> striking

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
think it was harm that we were striking

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.640 
think it was harm that we were striking
it<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.480> if<00:02:37.540> he<00:02:37.630> keep<00:02:37.780> striking<00:02:38.200> at<00:02:38.290> his<00:02:38.380> arm

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
it so if he keep striking at his arm

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.380 
it so if he keep striking at his arm
there<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:38.950> go<00:02:39.100> his<00:02:39.310> arm<00:02:39.520> falls<00:02:39.790> off<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.210> he's

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
there you go his arm falls off and he's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.930 
there you go his arm falls off and he's
bleeding<00:02:40.960> like<00:02:41.380> crazy<00:02:41.740> see<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.490> is<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.760> is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
one of the ones eventually he will die

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
heads just like that and I wouldn't

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.929 
heads just like that and I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:25.530> using<00:04:26.009> a<00:04:26.159> high-powered<00:04:26.370> sword

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
recommend using a high-powered sword

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.700 
recommend using a high-powered sword
because<00:04:27.599> it's<00:04:27.840> usually<00:04:27.960> gonna<00:04:28.229> kill<00:04:28.500> him<00:04:28.650> in

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
because it's usually gonna kill him in

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.830 
because it's usually gonna kill him in
one<00:04:28.740> hit<00:04:29.009> so<00:04:29.129> for<00:04:29.250> example<00:04:29.580> this<00:04:29.669> zombie<00:04:30.120> let

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
one hit so for example this zombie let

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.689 
one hit so for example this zombie let
me<00:04:30.930> try<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.080> take<00:04:31.259> off<00:04:31.409> his<00:04:31.500> head<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:32.430> it's<00:04:32.550> not

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
me try to take off his head but it's not

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.610 
me try to take off his head but it's not
really<00:04:32.939> doing<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.270> okay<00:04:33.689> yeah<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.349> usually

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
really doing it okay yeah so it usually

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.320 
really doing it okay yeah so it usually
with<00:04:35.009> a<00:04:35.039> high-powered<00:04:35.610> sword<00:04:35.819> like<00:04:35.939> a<00:04:35.969> diamond

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
with a high-powered sword like a diamond

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.850 
with a high-powered sword like a diamond
sword<00:04:36.449> it's<00:04:36.629> not<00:04:36.750> gonna<00:04:36.840> work<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.319> efficiently

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
sword it's not gonna work to efficiently

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.369 
sword it's not gonna work to efficiently
versus<00:04:38.580> a<00:04:38.610> stone<00:04:39.060> sword<00:04:39.389> because<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:40.229> have

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
versus a stone sword because you have

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.080 
versus a stone sword because you have
more<00:04:40.650> hits<00:04:40.860> like<00:04:41.039> for<00:04:41.159> example<00:04:41.219> a<00:04:41.520> stone<00:04:41.759> sword

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
more hits like for example a stone sword

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.420 
more hits like for example a stone sword
you<00:04:42.599> could<00:04:42.840> take<00:04:43.199> off<00:04:43.349> his<00:04:43.500> head<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.039> then<00:04:44.219> you

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
you could take off his head and then you

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.619 
you could take off his head and then you
would<00:04:44.520> probably<00:04:44.789> still<00:04:45.120> be<00:04:45.210> alive<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.539> you

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
would probably still be alive and you

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.029 
would probably still be alive and you
could<00:04:45.750> take<00:04:45.870> off<00:04:45.990> his<00:04:46.110> arm<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:46.710> if<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:46.889> use

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
could take off his arm and if you use

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.290 
could take off his arm and if you use
like<00:04:47.129> a<00:04:47.189> diamond<00:04:47.520> sword<00:04:47.699> obviously<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.180> can

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
like a diamond sword obviously you can

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.730 
like a diamond sword obviously you can
only<00:04:48.449> take<00:04:48.659> off<00:04:48.810> like<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.259> thing<00:04:49.500> because

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
only take off like one thing because

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.469 
only take off like one thing because
it's<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:49.949> powerful<00:04:50.129> because<00:04:50.460> all<00:04:50.879> damage<00:04:51.330> and

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
it's so powerful because all damage and

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.540 
it's so powerful because all damage and
stuff<00:04:51.659> but<00:04:51.840> anyways<00:04:52.189> that's<00:04:53.189> gonna<00:04:53.279> be<00:04:53.400> about

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
stuff but anyways that's gonna be about

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.890 
stuff but anyways that's gonna be about
it<00:04:53.699> hopefully<00:04:54.120> you've<00:04:54.270> enjoyed<00:04:54.360> this<00:04:54.719> mod
