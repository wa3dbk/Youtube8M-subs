I<00:00:04.910> think<00:00:05.910> I'm<00:00:06.000> gonna<00:00:06.150> use<00:00:06.529> these<00:00:07.759> splitters

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:08.759 
I think I'm gonna use these splitters

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:10.580 
I think I'm gonna use these splitters
right<00:00:09.059> here<00:00:09.360> it's<00:00:10.050> gonna<00:00:10.230> look<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.440> little

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
right here it's gonna look a little

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.100 
right here it's gonna look a little
something<00:00:10.800> like<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.480> that<00:00:12.480> one<00:00:12.690> our<00:00:12.840> stage

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
something like this that one our stage

something like this that one our stage
let<00:00:13.349> me<00:00:13.410> split<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:13.740> into<00:00:13.830> two<00:00:14.130> like<00:00:14.760> that<00:00:15.080> and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
let me split it into two like that and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.179 
let me split it into two like that and
these<00:00:16.199> are<00:00:16.320> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> be<00:00:16.619> plugged<00:00:16.890> into<00:00:17.070> here

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
these are going to be plugged into here

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.939 
these are going to be plugged into here
like<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.960> also<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.350> robbed<00:00:19.680> these

like that and also I robbed these

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.950 
like that and also I robbed these

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
I use this one still zero gauge in and I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290 
I use this one still zero gauge in and I
have<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> four<00:00:28.289> gauge<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:29.340> eight<00:00:29.670> gauge<00:00:29.880> coming

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
right here is gonna be zero gauge in and

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.049 
right here is gonna be zero gauge in and
one<00:00:43.769> side<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.519> the<00:00:44.639> answer<00:00:44.850> alright

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
so I got the power distribution block

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.329 
so I got the power distribution block
mounted<00:00:48.179> up<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:49.139> I'm<00:00:49.319> about<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> cut<00:00:49.859> this<00:00:50.069> one

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
mounted up now I'm about to cut this one

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:51.799 
mounted up now I'm about to cut this one
off<00:00:50.399> wire<00:00:50.789> that's<00:00:51.089> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.389> be<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.600> into

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
off wire that's going to be going into

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.770 
off wire that's going to be going into
the<00:00:51.959> bottom<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.499> right<00:00:52.530> here<00:00:53.600> there's<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the bottom of it right here there's that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.489 
the bottom of it right here there's that
so<00:00:55.049> it's<00:00:55.440> pretty<00:00:55.619> much<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:56.039> run<00:00:56.309> up<00:00:56.519> over

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
so it's pretty much gonna run up over

see what speakers are which so the one
that<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.229> have<00:01:31.469> tied<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.950> each<00:01:32.100> side<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.999> 10

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that I have tied on each side is the 10

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.090 
that I have tied on each side is the 10
but<00:01:33.929> the<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.109> that<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.380> do<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.920> you

but the way that you do this you get you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.889 
but the way that you do this you get you
a<00:01:35.130> 9-volt<00:01:35.579> battery<00:01:35.880> or<00:01:35.999> a<00:01:36.030> small<00:01:36.329> battery<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
a 9-volt battery or a small battery and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.349 
a 9-volt battery or a small battery and
you<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.560> tap<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.549> leads<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.210> you'll
