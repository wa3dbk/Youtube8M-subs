00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
I don't know spitting see this simply

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.179 
I don't know spitting see this simply
beautiful<00:02:28.200> though

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.259

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.580 

should<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.390> be<00:02:46.569> worried<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:47.049> I'm<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.379> only

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
should I be worried that I'm the only

00:02:47.590 --> 00:03:03.940

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
so how does it go through switched

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.390 
so how does it go through switched
breaks<00:03:09.049> only<00:03:10.049> stomp<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.680> grapes<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.099> we<00:03:11.220> did

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
breaks only stomp the grapes like we did

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.390

years<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.269> years<00:03:12.690> ago<00:03:13.019> but<00:03:13.379> obviously<00:03:14.160> there

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
years and years ago but obviously there

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.509

what<00:03:17.519> are<00:03:17.610> these<00:03:17.730> guys<00:03:17.970> for<00:03:18.269> these<00:03:18.870> are<00:03:19.140> our

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
what are these guys for these are our

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.740 
what are these guys for these are our
double<00:03:19.860> line<00:03:20.069> stainless<00:03:20.640> steel<00:03:21.000> tanks<00:03:21.510> for

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
fermentation and instead of using old

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.539 
fermentation and instead of using old
wood<00:03:24.900> vats<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.560> put<00:03:25.799> them<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.099> here<00:03:26.310> because

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
wood vats we put them in here because

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.920 
wood vats we put them in here because
it's<00:03:26.849> very<00:03:26.940> clean<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:28.500> put<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:28.890> French<00:03:29.220> yeast

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
it's very clean we put in French yeast

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.569 
it's very clean we put in French yeast
to<00:03:30.930> allow<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.290> fermentation<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.190> take<00:03:32.370> place

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
to allow the fermentation to take place

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.270
