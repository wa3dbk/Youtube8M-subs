00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.670
 answer the shift and ten minutes later you 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.440
 You have to explain everything again so that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.239

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.510
 his college and goes out to 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.889

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.930
 It is for you explaining about the course 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.790

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.620

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.480
 of course make it clear that it is 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.760
 better than yours, not to mention also about 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.980
 the questions of your personal life there 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.420
 girlfriends had not asked if 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.420
 I'm not focusing on studies. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 There's that thing, I do not know why either. 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.030
 but because you're in college 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.820
 very kind, I think you have to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.830
 to know about everything everything everything from 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.290
 menstruation of whales in the Atlantic until 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.670

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.300
 this microwave printer now 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.920
 depending on your course you still have 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.360
 those classic questions like when 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.280
 for example you do some degree 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.990
 or some not very famous course to 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.460
 nice how nice you like but it's 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.830
 that this course of money to the island 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.780

 the right to 80 of the entrance exam again 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.690
 you get who trusts you 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.430
 will come out of this and if you do a course of 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.410
 health area they want an appointment 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.900
 in independent time to time so 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.790
 here and here you know that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.860

 psychology begins to tell life 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.510
 whole for you is asking the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.940

 psychology that look 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.880

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.950

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.290
