00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
grunge and what that does is a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.859 
grunge and what that does is a
desaturate<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:30.000> image<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.570> throw

there's just grunge and what that does
is<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.590> sort<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.979> leaves<00:01:35.250> your<00:01:35.460> photo<00:01:35.729> alone

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
is it sort of leaves your photo alone

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.929 
is it sort of leaves your photo alone
and<00:01:36.390> add<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:37.020> texture<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.590> top<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
and add some texture on top of it and so

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
and add some texture on top of it and so
once<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.360> those<00:01:39.570> three<00:01:39.930> things<00:01:40.650> what

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
once you know those three things what

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.920 
once you know those three things what
you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.090> choose<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.570> one

you can do is you can choose the one

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
you can do is you can choose the one
that<00:01:42.960> most<00:01:43.229> closely<00:01:43.530> represents<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.399> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that most closely represents what you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
that most closely represents what you
want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.350> bunch<00:01:46.560> of

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
want to do and then there are a bunch of

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
want to do and then there are a bunch of
presets<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.520> here<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.210> we'll<00:01:48.329> choose<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> one

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
presets in here so we'll choose this one

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.120 
presets in here so we'll choose this one
this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.520> number<00:01:50.520> eight<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.210> that's<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
this is number eight and that's going to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.219 
this is number eight and that's going to
do<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.250> Grunch<00:01:53.579> tastic<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.930> don't

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
do this Grunch tastic look now I don't

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.380 
do this Grunch tastic look now I don't
really<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.579> want<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.790> adjust<00:01:56.909> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
really like that and I want to adjust it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
really like that and I want to adjust it
so<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.810> click<00:01:58.079> my<00:01:58.290> adjust<00:01:58.770> button<00:01:59.040> right

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
so I can click my adjust button right

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.880 
so I can click my adjust button right
here<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.759> can<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.469> start

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
here and you can see that we can start

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.459 
here and you can see that we can start
changing<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.640> tone<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.299> image<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.350> i

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
changing the tone of the image so if i

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.490 
changing the tone of the image so if i
change<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:06.270> will<00:02:06.540> either<00:02:07.020> make<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
change that it will either make it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.050 
change that it will either make it
brighter<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.039> darker<00:02:08.190> i<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.759> change<00:02:08.940> my

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
brighter or darker i can change my

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.360 
brighter or darker i can change my
threshold<00:02:09.509> levels<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.619> will<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
threshold levels it will do that and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.820 
threshold levels it will do that and
based<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.060> which<00:02:12.540> flavor<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.410> run

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
based on which flavor of run

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
based on which flavor of run
that<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.310> started<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.900> have<00:02:16.110> different

if i do pop grunge and i'll choose just
one<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.860> these<00:02:25.980> at<00:02:26.130> random<00:02:26.490> it'll<00:02:27.060> pop<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.510> here

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
one of these at random it'll pop in here

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.910 
one of these at random it'll pop in here
you'll<00:02:28.080> see<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.470> when<00:02:28.560> i<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.830> my

dialogues to play with now one thing

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.790 
dialogues to play with now one thing
that's<00:02:48.300> consistent<00:02:48.840> for<00:02:48.990> all<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.290> them<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
that's consistent for all of them is the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.370 
that's consistent for all of them is the
overlay<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> click<00:02:51.210> that<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.990> can<00:02:52.170> see

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
overlay when I click that you can see

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
overlay when I click that you can see
that<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:52.800> are<00:02:52.830> all<00:02:53.010> these<00:02:53.160> different

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that there are all these different

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.460 
that there are all these different
styles<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.420> overlay<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.050> here's<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.440> that's

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
styles of overlay so here's one that's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.380 
styles of overlay so here's one that's
sort<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.950> splotchy<00:02:56.400> paint<00:02:56.790> kind<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.180> look

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
sort of a splotchy paint kind of look

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.320 
sort of a splotchy paint kind of look
and<00:02:57.800> once<00:02:58.800> I<00:02:58.920> choose<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.459> it'll<00:02:59.820> throw<00:03:00.060> that

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and once I choose that it'll throw that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.150 
and once I choose that it'll throw that
on<00:03:00.360> there<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:01.110> change<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.530> color<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
on there I can change the color of that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.970 
on there I can change the color of that
so<00:03:02.640> let's<00:03:02.820> say<00:03:02.970> let's<00:03:03.209> make<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.420> more<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.860> know

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
so let's say let's make it more you know

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.010 
so let's say let's make it more you know
more<00:03:05.010> reddish<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> go<00:03:06.420> down<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.870> make

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
more reddish so I go down here and make

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.780 
more reddish so I go down here and make
it<00:03:07.110> more<00:03:07.230> red<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.709> I'll<00:03:07.770> apply<00:03:07.980> it<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.640> you'll

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
it more red and I'll apply it and you'll

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.820 
it more red and I'll apply it and you'll
see<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.270> splotchy<00:03:09.630> paint<00:03:10.020> will<00:03:10.500> become

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
see that that splotchy paint will become

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.470 
see that that splotchy paint will become
a<00:03:10.860> little<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.310> more<00:03:11.459> red<00:03:11.760> than<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.209> that

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
a little bit more red than it is that

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.390 
a little bit more red than it is that
violet<00:03:12.840> there<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.170> sort<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.070> looking<00:03:14.250> like

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
violet there it is sort of looking like
