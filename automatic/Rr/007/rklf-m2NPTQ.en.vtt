00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello guys like more and welcome to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.649
 another new ticket and how they saw it in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.080
 the big title paved 6 or big auto 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.179
 country city ​​second part not for those who 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.530
 have not understood this I'm going to start 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.910
 speak and first of all in the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.350
 description of this video I'm going to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.930
 leave the forum where you got this 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 information even more more than anything the forum 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 doubt and where I was inspired to do this 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 video and something that I wanted to talk to them 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.310
 this may all be false to me 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.260
 seem everything that says in this forum is 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.119
 a false information but of all 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.009
 I want to give you my opinion and some 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.410
 testimonies that for me are pretty 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.870
 good first that nothing big missed 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.690
 five big points 5 are located the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 city ​​of the saints that in their medal of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 the previous trilogy los saints 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.890
 belonged to big auto san andreas ok 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.110
 big point four big car four 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 belonged to great free cars and for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.850
 say it some way and free and it took 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.219
 place in big car 3 in the previous 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859
 trilogy that city we need then 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.590
 the second game that is between free 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.449
 series and the saints not what the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.600
 vice city and the truth that is something that I 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.700
 I hope enough not because it's vice 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 Well mainly because if they notice it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.369
 big cars what it does is take a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.409
 city ​​as a point of reference and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.020
 they always normally take the same 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 cities and they do not usually change that's how 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.159
 As you can see, we already had the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 saints although I mainly when 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.960
 they announced big cars 5 I expected 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.610
 that this game was going to be in the city 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.259
 from bay city ​​but they finally got it 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
 in san andreas because they took it out 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.770
 mainly in san andreas because 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.600
 They saw that Andrew was one of the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.369
 best- selling games and the company such 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.250
 once I needed a starting point to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.780
 expand much more was not going to be and not 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.340
 it had the same boom as in san andreas 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.929
 then mainly that's why 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.640
 they did to attract more people to their 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.429
 public and once they had a 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.050
 public to introduce you to the city of baix and 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.030
 came then I think this may be 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.280
 a great point besides that if you notice it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.009
 all games have their sequel 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.899
 good its sequels as a city as 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.850
 but they do not have a sequel like 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.130
 story not then this rumor said of 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.840
 that maybe we could get it the city 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.330
 from bay city but I do think we're going 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.890
 to have not the same time because the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.290
 who know very well about big cars 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.750
 they will know that the city of bay city 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.000
 in the 80s do not know that each 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.069
 game is based on a time and this game 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.349
 was based on the time of the clubs and 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.650
 things like that in the style of the eighties 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.780
 maybe we have that what is going 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.280
 doing in a year later or good 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.200
 not by disposition to the year anymore 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.239
 ahead it should be noted that there are many 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.459
 years because as you know right now you are going 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.780
 the rockstar games company is going to 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.329
 take out what grand theft is doing 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.280
 auto 5 for the new console 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.409
 generation and they will also take it out 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.180
 for computer not like that we do accounts 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.250
 of all that we need and others of 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.799
 is still this game is left 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.319
 a lot played by squeezing not just that 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.939
 terms can draw a dlc 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.919
 completely different from cities 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.230
 lost not even though they were sanz lost and 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:03:00.150
 the adventures, but I 've already 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.459
 said in other videos but more than anything 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.139
 I think it can be some by city 2 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.379
 and if they ask more or less like the 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:10.290
 year if you notice it if I remember correctly the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.780
 big car 4 came out in 2008 and the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.340
 big car 5 came out in 2013 no 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.349
 then take into account how old 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.510
 they were and more or less big favorite there 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.190
 is a company that is good rockstar 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.780
 goods are not the conformist company 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.460
 besides that we also need 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.250
 other great German titles 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.630
 autonomous such as the max payne red 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.550
 dead redemption that I also hope 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.320
 very much the king of redemption 2 and I 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.730
 I think this game is next to 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.070
 leave not but talking about the saga of 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.050
 big car for me is going to be the big one 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.510
 fauto 6 that is going to be obviously in the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.210
 city of the country and you since all the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.830
 cities have had their remastering and 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.360
 you're remastering that makes you 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.850
 missing, not who would not like to see a 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.950
 miami which you can walk totally 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.930
 free and in ica and crocodiles and more things 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.940
 that vary much more fun not the 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 characters can be the son of tony 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.330
 bernetti who knows then we are 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.980
 you tell me what you think in the 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.930
 comments anyway see the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.420
 forum qualifies in the description and he 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.100
 I say that the information they say in that 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.740
 forum to me an information is not based 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.450
 quite reliable but for me it is 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.370
 one per eye that does not give me much confidence 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.990
 but it was my inspiration anyway 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.730
 to make this video to other guys 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.739
 but he likes today's video ban 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.150
 in giving you like favorites subscribe to 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.160
 channel if they are not subscribed in the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.290
 description is my twitter created so that 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.910
 Follow me and share this video so that 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.400
 More people achieve that and want it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.050
 like that without saying anything to me 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.050
 goodbye goodbye
