have to look not only at the central
thickness<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> distribution<00:00:18.600> of

approximately<00:00:27.349> what<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.560> means<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.039> if

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
approximately what that means is if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.310 
others say I think the safe limit would
be<00:01:36.659> somewhere<00:01:37.229> between<00:01:37.430> 475<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.670> 500<00:01:39.570> microns

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
be somewhere between 475 to 500 microns

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.069 
be somewhere between 475 to 500 microns
if<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.100> cornea<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.640> thinner<00:01:41.970> than<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> again

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that we should not do refractive laser

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.770 
that we should not do refractive laser
surgery<00:01:58.130> why<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.180> are<00:02:00.299> worried<00:02:00.659> about

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
surgery why because we are worried about

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.969 
surgery why because we are worried about
making<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> cornea<00:02:02.520> very<00:02:02.759> weak<00:02:03.060> leading<00:02:03.600> to

making the cornea very weak leading to

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
making the cornea very weak leading to
occasi<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.490> producing<00:02:06.360> forward<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.049> is

occasi or producing forward which is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.820 
occasi or producing forward which is
known<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.649> keratoconus<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.690> besides<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
known as keratoconus so besides the

known as keratoconus so besides the
central<00:02:11.220> thickness<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:11.970> why<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.420> always

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
central thickness that's why we always

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.430 
central thickness that's why we always
look

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
look

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.560

corneal<00:03:05.520> topography<00:03:06.240> the<00:03:06.770> abnormalities<00:03:07.770> are

corneal topography the abnormalities are

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.690 
corneal topography the abnormalities are
detected<00:03:08.580> because<00:03:09.510> as<00:03:09.900> always<00:03:10.220> safety<00:03:11.220> comes

detected because as always safety comes

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.810 
detected because as always safety comes
first<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.390> for<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.080> reason<00:03:13.340> no<00:03:14.340> patient

first and for that reason no patient

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.760 
first and for that reason no patient
should<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.030> lasik<00:03:15.780> without<00:03:16.170> having<00:03:16.530> a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
should have lasik without having a

should have lasik without having a

corneal Packham entry which means

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.190 
corneal Packham entry which means
measuring<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:20.010> thickness<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.910> cornea<00:03:21.420> thank

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
measuring the thickness of cornea thank

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.410 
measuring the thickness of cornea thank
you
