00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
normal electricity with water how do you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.400 
normal electricity with water how do you
do<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> that's<00:00:38.879> right<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.570> generator

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
do it that's right this is a generator

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.650 
do it that's right this is a generator
that<00:00:40.469> we've<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:41.010> together<00:00:41.390> which<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that we've put together which is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.040 
that we've put together which is
basically<00:00:43.110> using<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.219> cartridge<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.510> this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
basically using a cartridge and this

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.080 
basically using a cartridge and this
cartridge<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.800> stored<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.399> quite<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> long

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
cartridge can be stored for quite a long

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
cartridge can be stored for quite a long
time<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:48.989> water<00:00:49.610> solar

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
time and just use this water solar

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.340 
time and just use this water solar

another<00:03:04.830> smaller<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.610> here<00:03:05.640> what's<00:03:06.120> this

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
another smaller one here what's this

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.930 
another smaller one here what's this
what<00:03:07.590> we<00:03:07.709> call<00:03:07.920> this<00:03:08.040> device<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.459> hydro<00:03:08.730> pack

what we call this device the hydro pack

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.290 
what we call this device the hydro pack
this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.420> hydro<00:03:09.690> pacem<00:03:10.020> in

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300

so it's a smaller version of this this
is<00:03:16.770> a<00:03:16.800> sort<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.610> 271<00:03:18.420> hour<00:03:18.660> this<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.290> 15<00:03:19.800> watt

phone it is right this is what's inside

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.310 
phone it is right this is what's inside
the<00:03:34.740> B<00:03:35.280> hydro<00:03:35.610> pack<00:03:35.790> mini<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:36.990> actual

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
the B hydro pack mini this is actual

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.710 
the B hydro pack mini this is actual
cartridge<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:37.980> this<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> fuel<00:03:38.910> cell<00:03:39.120> as

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
cartridge and this is the fuel cell as

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.570 
cartridge and this is the fuel cell as
the<00:03:39.930> fuel<00:03:40.110> cell<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.500> cartridge<00:03:40.860> both<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.490> them

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
the fuel cell the cartridge both of them

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.940 
the fuel cell the cartridge both of them
are<00:03:41.730> kind<00:03:41.970> of<00:03:42.060> independent<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.620> what<00:03:43.860> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
are kind of independent so what the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.190 
are kind of independent so what the
consumer<00:03:44.400> would<00:03:44.520> buy<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:45.060> retail<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
consumer would buy in retail is just the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.230 
consumer would buy in retail is just the
cartridge<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.820> I'm<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.060> going<00:03:48.180> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
cartridge so I'm just going to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.480 
cartridge so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:03:48.450> how<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.350> works<00:03:49.560> here's<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
demonstrate how that works here's the

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:57.640 
demonstrate how that works here's the
USB<00:03:50.940> plug<00:03:53.300> here's<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.450> phone

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.400 

you<00:03:58.129> can<00:03:58.250> see<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.489> charging

you can see it's charging

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.110 
you can see it's charging

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
about the fuel cell yeah is this a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.090 
about the fuel cell yeah is this a
bigger<00:04:14.270> version<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.750> is<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.320> this<00:04:15.920> is<00:04:16.070> a

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
bigger version of that is that this is a

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.130 
bigger version of that is that this is a
larger<00:04:16.700> unit<00:04:17.000> here<00:04:17.150> yeah<00:04:17.299> that's<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.750> guts<00:04:17.959> of

this one actually it's a smaller I its

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.840 
this one actually it's a smaller I its
smaller<00:04:20.810> inside<00:04:21.230> because<00:04:21.650> we<00:04:21.769> use<00:04:21.890> a<00:04:21.920> 25<00:04:22.550> watt

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
smaller inside because we use a 25 watt

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.030 
smaller inside because we use a 25 watt
this<00:04:23.390> is<00:04:23.540> actually<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.900> 100<00:04:24.230> watt<00:04:24.350> fuel<00:04:24.800> cell

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
this is actually a 100 watt fuel cell

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.400 
this is actually a 100 watt fuel cell
okay<00:04:25.610> for<00:04:25.880> future<00:04:26.330> some<00:04:26.840> commercial
