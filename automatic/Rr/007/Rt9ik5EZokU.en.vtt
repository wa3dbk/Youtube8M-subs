00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it's just the way he's carrying yourself

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
it's just the way he's carrying yourself
you<00:01:27.600> know<00:01:27.750> he<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.049> tell<00:01:28.259> he's<00:01:28.560> getting<00:01:29.250> more

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

to<00:03:11.110> be<00:03:11.170> satisfied<00:03:11.200> but<00:03:12.010> that's<00:03:12.700> probably<00:03:13.090> been

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
to be satisfied but that's probably been

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.150
