00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
not potentially adding shine to this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
not potentially adding shine to this
matte<00:01:24.540> lip<00:01:24.810> product<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:25.860> really

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
as moisturized and as fresh as they can

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
as moisturized and as fresh as they can

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
product as well I think the difference

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.590 
product as well I think the difference
would<00:03:16.560> be<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.770> when<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.220> put<00:03:17.490> on<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.180> Rimmel

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
would be that when you put on the Rimmel

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.780 
would be that when you put on the Rimmel

in<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.620> texture<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.310> one<00:03:35.490> I<00:03:35.520> am<00:03:35.790> wearing<00:03:35.820> have

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
in the texture the one I am wearing have

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.890 
been wearing throughout this video is
atomic<00:03:38.160> rose<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.210> think<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:39.570> a<00:03:39.660> very

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
atomic rose and I think it's a very

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.740 
atomic rose and I think it's a very
wearable<00:03:40.350> color<00:03:40.740> especially<00:03:41.750> spring/summer

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
wearable color especially spring/summer

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.480

you<00:03:43.290> know<00:03:43.380> it's<00:03:43.500> got<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.680> little<00:03:44.070> bit<00:03:44.340> of

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
you know it's got that little bit of

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.600 
you know it's got that little bit of
warmth<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.840> really<00:03:46.350> I<00:03:46.380> think

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
warmth to it it really I think

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.100 
warmth to it it really I think
coordinates<00:03:47.610> nicely<00:03:48.270> with<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> peachy<00:03:49.080> cheek

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
coordinates nicely with a peachy cheek
