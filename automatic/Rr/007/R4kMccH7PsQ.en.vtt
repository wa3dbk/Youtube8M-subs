00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.670
 so welcome to a round 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.130
 conclusion also confirms about people with 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.200
 the honey badger perks and so i know 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.640
 I'm not sorry no idea must 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.869
 You can see for yourself I can 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.430
 which classes grab the description 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.529
 I have to paint the motto color 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.660
 if I'm out looking for it that way 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.879
 a cams track 31 gameplay that is 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.350
 actually pretty little is like that 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.510
 you wait a minute I watch how long the video 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.260
 Let's go about seven or so 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.960
 eight minutes 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.010
 and since we have to circle 33 reality 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.290
 also say that I am very defensive now 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.850
 played because I stop on the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.260
 good streak suspected as age I want 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.449
 not always have camp 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.280
 I think that was my third 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.780
 camp strike or something like that I have myself 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.729
 already extremely celebrated so thought so at 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.470
 Hilal the fight at the start and then 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.600
 finally the house wall come my ok 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.790
 good gameplay itself out so it was very 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 all right although I stop partly for 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.729
 played me very defensive, I have 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.229
 was still thinking if I could do that 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.299
 should upload at all because of me 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.830
 Personally, that's not what it's like 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.490
 like in such defensive gameplays 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.799
 upload 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.909
 although I have to say that myself 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.189
 Now I have a few 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.420
 videos with clear fed her 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.250
 actually in the other so am 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.409
 were quick and they have just like that 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.240
 played extremely defensive that was one 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.100
 Double cab attracted more guests 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.689
 that's just not so about the map 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.939
 surprised that soon a whole 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.500
 Normal patrolling, I say it all 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.659
 the games are what I live normally 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.799
 then I think it'll be okay 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.409
 Let's see how it will change in the weeks 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.700
 can see the next days weeks 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.700
 few more aggressive money is he playing 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.079
 can so that is quite short for gameplay 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.359
 So as I said quite cool you can 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.679
 very good move I think I I 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.820
 then it's all over and i hope you 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.679
 have that out now that I have now 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.399
 some good quality microphone at the 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.630
 have started 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.729
 I have this now 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.340
 blocked now brought to the microphone 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.869
 did not get a headset factory worth 1 20 euro 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.030
 are that you have somewhere on the sea 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.740
 got thrown out more today 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.689
 I always before and that was just too 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.969
 so the only reason i stayed in the 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.530
 last days or even weeks 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.729
 play brought to irregular videos 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.689
 have comments with the rotor and such 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.369
 On and on, that's what happened to me 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.319
 Not 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.330
 that was partly because of it 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.780
 that I do not mind the videos too 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.060
 do 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.959
 with this filthy sound quality is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.580
 no joke 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.890
 even if some of you are not like that 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.420
 It bothered me that it was incomprehensible 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.370
 so excited when I turn on 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 today with 20,000 subscribers 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.330
 30,000 subscribers with ten celebrities 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.160
 have the sun good sound quality and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.160
 I hung you were my 200,000 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.280
 Subscribers around and have just 95 times 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.560
 cheap all the happy meal would have the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.060
 fucking quality but boys that is 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.620
 been stressful for me when I am at 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.290
 Sync my voice heard 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.090
 and that's why I'm here now 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.530
 so what happened is on the start was hope 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.209
 I hope that the house will be up 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.440
 every case is real i can memorize me 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.090
 the description fits my 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.920
 microphone blue yeti is that 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.480
 actually quite cool although I'm only at 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.560
 I was the same overall 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.600
 yesterday at i think 17 o'clock was that 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.489
 Guys I almost ran over Marcel 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.900
 scorpions kerpen and i have this 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.489
 mike get whatever one's 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.790
 very easy to connect very easy and 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.010
 This pop is protection and I wanted it 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.610
 just screw it on and that did not work 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.319
 is working 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.450
 because there is no that is namely 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.590
 no smooth surface is so confused 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.260
 to turn this around 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.450
 Guys I was close to this new one 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.739
 microphone from my desk and step 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.049
 put the thing back in the box 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.790
 I was really angry 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.340
 I was really angry that that was not 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.370
 worked, i thought, old now 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.329
 did you bring him plus pop shops and it 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.799
 does not work you can do it yourself 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.489
 then turn it all together screw it up 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.989
 did not work 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.400
 So I have to say I was right 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.950
 pissed a bit around 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 partly raised so that was real 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.579
 really corrosive but works now 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.690
 although it is still not so firm 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.190
 is still a bit loose but I 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.750
 think that should go first order 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.620
 if i have the heart if i kinda like that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.850
 moving force 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.440
 I have to look like this now 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.760
 so it will be at the live commentary 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.959
 First of all , I think every day 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.430
 a little bit more you 're coming because 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.170
 I'm right now bock that time 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.170
 There would be a bit of a microphone there 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.220
 So a little bit to play 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.319
 I have to watch the live comments 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.030
 how that works because I do not know how 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.130
 far now I can sit away from it 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.290
 or how close do I have to sit with it then 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.370
 one still holds a good quality on 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.500
 location that needs everything still 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 Try a little bit now in the next 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.979
 one two days in the next three four 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.150
 days something like that because device 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.400
 I have to see how it all works 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.990
 So it can be that I have a lot there 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.940
 improve in quality still 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.500
 extra one program that I hold as a 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.160
 a little something can stop with the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.650
 the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.300
 my song quali that is not so optimal 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.470
 as it is possible that will stop me 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.880
 pleased me personally if I namely 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.920
 to mean these in this difference 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.240
 other videos and now that makes me 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.420
 I think I'm happy for you 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.090
 Honestly, that's it, that 's it 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.500
 already I stand for 20.01 me 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.290
 just still a bit extreme a thought 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.570
 You can never do that age 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.010
 So a reason of the attitude of me 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.320
 when I'm short of the camps 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.710
 In short, wunderloop was soon before 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.170
 mur 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.060
 I 'm always as negative as 80 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.310
 comes sometime across the diameter 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.230
 map what kills me in tube deming like in 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.550
 headshot gives something to something 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.680
 I think every time I stop at short 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.320
 an important thing for me, then 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.120
 Well, I have that one now 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.400
 won a completely new as I said I think 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.390
 even me so if I am one 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.680
 find a bit more in the game 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.000
 what I do now we will do the next 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.590
 days today namely friday 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.380
 and I will remain at home today I 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.850
 Do not get into coma today for no reason 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.170
 shoot and somehow drunk and 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.410
 a park bench and me 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.760
 spit 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.260
 I will stay we wanted one 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.790
 a little bit have to look that I'm me 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.440
 a bit of the game will take place without today 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.240
 much to rage with a few bites the 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.310
 get to know maps i have to say i am 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.440
 so excited I do not know 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.210
 which maps somehow look like me 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.790
 often fight many angles of the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.140
 Maps not at all that's why that's ok 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.150
 come today you do it one time 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.290
 young zocker Friday might find 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.790
 I have some people from you a lobby 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.230
 maybe I'll give you another one 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.550
 Load have also tried but yesterday there 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.380
 It did not work that way 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.810
 actually the colleague's name was 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:02.290
 something with a diaper diaper or something 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.700
 no idea there was so I think so what 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.960
 Although still wanted to say, and indeed in 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.050
 the dominions are rounded off by the rule 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.820
 they can partly somehow here 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.919
 determined to go 15 minutes or somehow 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.850
 so 15 minutes you have to go 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.010
 If you think about it a bit 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.360
 got out fast with the sponsoring 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.520
 class has where you can quickly go 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.230
 where you can constantly graze sports I can 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.210
 I think there are a lot of camps 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.360
 create that I would have any of 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.310
 I know 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.449
 we have and so on and so forth 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.469
 by me because I will know me in 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.979
 fuchs think that we can do it 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:29.449
 can 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.639
 and I'm going today even about
