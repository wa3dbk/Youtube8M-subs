00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.729 
that and you should be able to see these
directories<00:00:48.510> click<00:00:48.930> documents<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.590> you'll

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
directories click documents and you'll

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.160 
directories click documents and you'll
have<00:00:49.980> your<00:00:51.320> saved<00:00:52.320> stuff<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> guess<00:00:54.170> what

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
have your saved stuff here I guess what

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.510 
have your saved stuff here I guess what
I<00:00:55.199> would<00:00:55.320> do<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> actually<00:00:55.890> back<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.430> up

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
I would do is actually back them up

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.479 
I would do is actually back them up
because<00:00:56.850> there's<00:00:57.030> absolutely<00:00:57.149> no<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
because there's absolutely no way to

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.459 
because there's absolutely no way to
reverse<00:00:59.489> this<00:01:00.059> unless<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> backup<00:01:01.140> so

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
reverse this unless you have a backup so

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.039 
reverse this unless you have a backup so
what<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.649> did<00:01:01.739> was<00:01:02.039> made<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.840> backup<00:01:03.840> folder

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
what I did was made a a backup folder

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.070 
what I did was made a a backup folder
and<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.680> dragged<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.369> dropped<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:06.119> saves

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and just dragged and dropped my saves

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.100 
and just dragged and dropped my saves
there<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.710> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.070> were<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> after<00:01:09.420> backing<00:01:09.780> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
there so if you were to after backing it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.840 
there so if you were to after backing it
up<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.890> were<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.159> select<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.670> click

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
absolutely no way to reverse that unless

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.530 
absolutely no way to reverse that unless
you<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.810> iCloud<00:01:19.049> C<00:01:19.560> backup<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.850> drag<00:01:21.360> and
