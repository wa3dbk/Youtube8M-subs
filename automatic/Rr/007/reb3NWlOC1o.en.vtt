now<00:00:56.059> one<00:00:56.239> of<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.010> signature<00:00:58.120> points<00:00:59.120> about

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
now one of the signature points about

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.000 
now one of the signature points about
this<00:00:59.510> riff<00:00:59.780> is<00:00:59.989> that<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.499> top<00:01:00.739> two<00:01:00.949> strings

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
this riff is that the top two strings

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.740 
this riff is that the top two strings
remain<00:01:01.550> constant<00:01:02.149> throughout<00:01:04.510> so<00:01:05.510> we<00:01:05.600> have

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
remain constant throughout so we have

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.899 
remain constant throughout so we have
that<00:01:05.930> sound<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.500> whole<00:01:06.680> way<00:01:06.890> through<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.760> when

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
that sound the whole way through so when

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.090 
that sound the whole way through so when
we<00:01:08.000> go<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.360> G<00:01:08.630> chord<00:01:08.900> we<00:01:09.590> only<00:01:09.800> move<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we go to the G chord we only move the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.690 
we go to the G chord we only move the
2nd<00:01:10.640> finger<00:01:10.850> over<00:01:11.659> onto<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.770> 6th<00:01:13.190> string<00:01:13.460> at

the 3rd fret little 3 fingers stay

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.740 
the 3rd fret little 3 fingers stay
exactly<00:01:16.130> where<00:01:16.460> we<00:01:16.760> were<00:01:16.910> so<00:01:17.450> we<00:01:17.480> have<00:01:17.630> this

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
exactly where we were so we have this

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
third string at the very point we hit

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.830 
third string at the very point we hit
that<00:02:50.340> first<00:02:50.400> chord<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.300> finger<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.720> actually

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
that first chord that finger is actually

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.960 
that first chord that finger is actually
still<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.350> midair<00:02:52.680> changing<00:02:53.250> down<00:02:53.370> from<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> G

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
still in midair changing down from the G

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
still in midair changing down from the G
but<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.600> essence<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.140> a<00:02:55.290> cordis<00:02:55.740> thesis

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
but in essence this is a cordis thesis

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.810 
but in essence this is a cordis thesis
for<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:57.209> then<00:02:57.360> move<00:02:57.540> over<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:58.050> 7sus4<00:02:59.010> which

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
for we then move over to a 7sus4 which

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.520 
for we then move over to a 7sus4 which
really<00:03:00.030> involves<00:03:00.360> us<00:03:00.630> moving<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.989> first<00:03:01.260> finger

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
really involves us moving a first finger

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.670 
really involves us moving a first finger
over<00:03:01.709> onto<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.820> fourth<00:03:03.150> string<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.410> sounds

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
over onto the fourth string this sounds

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:16.960 
over onto the fourth string this sounds
like<00:03:04.830> this

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.059 

the<00:03:17.970> right-hand<00:03:18.390> part<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.780> section<00:03:19.050> two<00:03:19.410> again

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
the right-hand part of section two again

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.610 
the right-hand part of section two again
involves<00:03:21.030> consistent<00:03:21.690> sixteenth<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.350> semi

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
involves consistent sixteenth or semi

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.010 
involves consistent sixteenth or semi
quiver<00:03:22.920> movements<00:03:23.640> when<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.240> land<00:03:24.420> on<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.569> DSS

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
quiver movements when we land on the DSS

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.580 
quiver movements when we land on the DSS
four<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.350> play<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.680> rhythm<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:28.290> when<00:03:28.410> we<00:03:28.500> go

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
four we play this rhythm then when we go

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.190 
four we play this rhythm then when we go
to<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.800> a<00:03:28.830> 7sus4<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:30.270> have<00:03:30.390> three<00:03:30.690> consecutive

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
to the a 7sus4 we have three consecutive

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:44.090 
to the a 7sus4 we have three consecutive
ups<00:03:41.930> here<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.050> is<00:03:43.140> with<00:03:43.290> both<00:03:43.470> sections<00:03:43.920> back

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
ups here it is with both sections back

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.280 
ups here it is with both sections back
together
