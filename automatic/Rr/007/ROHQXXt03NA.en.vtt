00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.239
 weapons games dying a maximum of 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.010
 Once I was I read it comes the challenge I said 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.260
 Well , a great set of weapons 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.540
 game and the most I can die is 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.629
 once was what I heard or what 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.540
 I read my way da and after I was 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.540
 playing that ended the game I finished 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.329
 first and nolan is only 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.519
 memory once but in the end that me that 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.619
 I see the comment well I read it well and 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.239
 you want you only have to play 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.089
 that is, the challenge of not having to be left 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.220
 first of all that I did not know but 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.019
 very bush had very well that was very 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.240
 very chingÃ³n that I reached to be in 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.710
 first place and only memory once here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.290
 he sent me killing the zeal 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.700
 uncheck but yes I had I had a lot 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.140
 lucky since I still know they are 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.750
 appearing everywhere 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.760
 thank you very much to that radar that 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.140
 I was helping a shit but in 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.689
 actually I was also helping them 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.330
 because several times they were going to kill me 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.400
 this one several times they appear everywhere 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.190
 check I know if you want to do this 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.490
 challenge if I recommend it 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.070
 This difficult it exists it is not going 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.780
 to be able to do the first because 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.390
 even I could do it the first 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 I did it like the fifth time but if it's 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.080
 a challenge that yes and sometimes you despair what 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.480
 what did any of you say 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.670
 try this challenge I recommend that you 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.730
 try to go as far ahead as 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.640
 they may be from the enemy since the 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.770
 enemies this if they take out the mole bitch 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.160
 life machine gun or if they take out a bazooka 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.500
 he's going to be a good ass if he's 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.570
 give them life because if you're against 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.850
 you bring any weapon with a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.590
 bazooka since these monkeys do not bring no 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.050
 you can have president you can not bring 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 beach that not so three to aim for 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.760
 artur or nothing will only know about the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.350
 base to kill so they try to go 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.330
 well ahead here I was walking 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.550
 coming here because I could not find 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.980
 nobody this at the end here look at this wey 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.230
 it left me a little red this the good thing that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.300
 there was no one at the end teatre this look 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.860
 of late finders I stayed there said 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.500
 now the point of view is going to come out 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.930

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.430

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.079

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.000

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.159
 He got to see also but well tell you 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.379
 fewer comments than another challenge want 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.640
 game is on the map that I do not know how to 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.920
 call but it 's a map that you download is not 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.719
 original map is a map that you download 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.659

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:57.269
 peacekeeper or something like that with a weapon that 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.549

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.709

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.670
