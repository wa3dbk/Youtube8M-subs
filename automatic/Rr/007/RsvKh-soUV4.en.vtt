00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
see to that the games just frozen it the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.910 
see to that the games just frozen it the
games<00:02:28.489> done<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.330> yeah<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:29.810> quit<00:02:30.680> like

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
games done so yeah it's like quit like

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.420 
games done so yeah it's like quit like
swipe<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.519> game<00:02:31.670> up<00:02:31.930> remove<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:34.220> yeah

that's why I show you guys some quick

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.020 
that's why I show you guys some quick
proof<00:02:36.410> that<00:02:37.340> he's<00:02:37.610> is<00:02:37.910> real<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:40.310> hope

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
proof that he's is real and I hope

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.850 
proof that he's is real and I hope
that's<00:02:41.150> enough<00:02:41.300> proof<00:02:41.840> for<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.170> guys<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.800> you

that's enough proof for you guys if you
guys<00:02:42.980> still<00:02:43.310> think<00:02:43.700> that's<00:02:43.910> fishy<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.660> don't

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
guys still think that's fishy I don't
