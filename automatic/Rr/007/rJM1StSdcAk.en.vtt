00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.549
 good evening dear friends i am glad again 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.370
 would like to see you on my channel 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.349
 congratulate you on the beginning of winter and of course 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.330
 I understand that the beginning of winter is still like 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.570
 Berlin but nevertheless it seems to me that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.740
 the weather has watered us all it's snow 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.600
 then rain will come then plus then minus 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.090
 some kind of tin is created and not at all 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.760
 crisis exchanged in Ukraine warriors 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.670
 islamic state natural anomalies 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.880
 dollar rate in the end what at all 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.190
 going on I do not understand nevertheless something 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.809
 what has changed i sit with you again 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.520
 this room and telling you about 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.890
 all sorts of interesting things 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.260
 today we have on the review that's not hard 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.230
 disc seagate backup plus red 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.940
 1 terabyte 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.950
 Here is the box nothing 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.219
 there is nothing interesting in it except again 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.210
 hard disk and usb cable usb 30 type 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 b and useless waste paper in general 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 Of course, I understand that now is not the most 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.180
 the best time to order various 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.100
 electronic gadgets 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.740
 Yes, and other goods from abroad in 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.720
 Russia and the reason for that will be very 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.260
 high dollar relative to 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.530
 ruble 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.270
 but nevertheless I considered that 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.549
 safety of my data 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 and the teacher what my photos music 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.810
 other stuff other kept mine 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.560
 a laptop if it's a departure in order all 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.740
 fly damn for me higher than money 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 so I decided it was time to buy 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.759
 external hard drive 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.470
 moreover, its main purpose except 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.610
 that I can carry him with me and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.549
 records before the movie will be what is there 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 my data and data will be stored 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.720
 hard drive is the best fit 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.180
 in order to use it like 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.159
 backup storage 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.500
 then 2600 rubles for which I took 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.930
 This hard disk mass in the market 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.820
 all sorts of 1 tra sick models but 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.219
 less it has built in 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.259
 to backup data 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.450
 let's now look at the design 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.820
 hard disk is made of two 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.429
 materials above it is covered with a layer of love 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.860
 I here present our emblem and segey 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.870
 on top is a light bulb to indicate 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.250
 hard drive operation it is done in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.620
 very unusual style 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.410
 this is such a strip it will burn white 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.110
 color at work is nothing here 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.680
 no on the sides we have glossy 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.290
 plastic 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.240
 and below is a matte soft-touch 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.370
 plastic and in principle as an assembly 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.140
 the hard disk itself is very good 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.680
 nothing bends no crunches no 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.600
 backlash and so on it is certainly nice 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.489
 the only question that I have or 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.040
 any other buyer in principle 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.950
 there will be why manufacturers are doing 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.000
 glossy details especially as hard 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.530
 the drive there is a smartphone these are the goods that 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.290
 migrate from pockets pocket from bag to 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.730
 bag and will inevitably scratch 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.070
 notice how caring 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.070
 manufacturer plastered glossy part 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.470
 hard disk drive so that it does not 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.900
 scratched during transport 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.910
 but personally I find this situation very 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.310
 absurd because it proves that 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.220
 the fact that the manufacturer thought about that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.880
 even transport when hard drive 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.580
 packed 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.489
 bag and in the ship where it is very good 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.500
 fixed any speck of dust can scratch 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 This plastic and imagine how it will be 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.070
 look after a year of active 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.540
 use it seems to me he will 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.340
 look just like a hood 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.750
 neighbor's cars which the enemies poured 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.600
 valerian so that you torn him in the morning 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.630
 well i know some lethality from my 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.790
 to the neighbors but nonetheless otherwise 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.790
 no questions hard drive from me 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.380
 no now let's go to the computer i 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.250
 I'll show you the program with which 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.720
 you can make backup copies of the data and 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.560
 That's how the hard drive looks during 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.750
 his work 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.280
 notice her usb cable 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.549
 which is made with a hint of 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.560
 accuracy they are usually 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.280
 that is, there is a monolithic body and all 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.470
 the hard drive is not rounded up and 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.890
 It works very silently that can not 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.140
 to please 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.230
 and cable length from connector to connector 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.030
 is 40 centimeters and so I 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.720
 plugged in hard drive and beaten to zero 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.150
 party Komi 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.489
 morning conductor he looks like seagate 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.980
 backup plus drive on the hard drive 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.320
 There is a pdf version of the waste paper that goes 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.460
 complete installer program with 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.040
 by which we will do 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.230
 backups this is seagate dashboard 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.060
 and also backup themselves more 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.980
 there's nothing here let's try 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:37.010
 copy some big movie 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.010
 to the hard drive here are 4 gigabytes and 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.990
 let's see how much windows to evaluate 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.750
 windows data copy speed 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.480
 rated data copying speed 8 5 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.470
 megabytes per second happened and higher just 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.720
 see some glitch 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.150
 but it doesn't matter in principle now 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.200
 try to read the same desktop 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.380
 file itself as you see the reading speed 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.900
 100 megabytes per second but considering that 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.430
 this hard drive is at 5400 rpm 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.650
 I think it's a normal minute 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.100
 crystaldiskmark results indicator 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.930
 303 looks like this 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.210
 Naturally in this case, the hard disk 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.460
 connected to yusbi port 30 computer 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.260
 and here is the test results for 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.660
 hard drive 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.330
 yusbi 20 computer port now 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:27.120
 move seagate from was here we see 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.460
 general information about our drive it 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.530
 firmware version can be customized 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.540
 control external led min on 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.110
 drive for example enable or 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.780
 turn off 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.100
 we can press the test button to 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.620
 make sure that the external drive 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.870
 works fine and you can 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.720
 configure its power management let's say 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.669
 if you have a laptop tablet it we can 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.160
 set up the time when our drive 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:52.740
 go to sleep also we can 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.720
 backup data with 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.270
 mobile devices let's say a smartphone or 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.729
 tablet she avis android downloading 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.160
 corresponding app from the appstore and 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.960
 google play we can do backup 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.580
 copying social network data 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.340
 such as facebook 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.370
 as well as boxing strings but unfortunately not 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.320
 maintained in contact and just 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.770
 most users from Russia and 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.500
 CIS will not be able to use 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.780
 he functions also can install our 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.250
 backup but the backup 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.430
 sc up 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.259
 this is what the doctor has prescribed it to me in 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.629
 first here we see all our backup 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.669
 copies you can see the magazine when 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:33.440
 backups were made and also we 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.930
 we can create a new backup plan 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.449
 copying schedule then when 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.830
 backup will be created we can 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.720
 select all files personal documents 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.699
 music image video but i 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.930
 I prefer to select the entire folder 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:50.659
 either select the entire hard drive 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.610
 hard drive and select the interval when 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.800
 backup will be created either 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.430
 constantly or hourly daily 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.430
 weekly monthly 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.630
 in fact everything is so modest but 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.449
 useful functionality 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.130
 this program for me personally summing up 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.870
 results I can say that this is hard 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.780
 the disk has a stylish design 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.430
 good build quality also has 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.650
 built-in about creating backup 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.139
 copies and not much different in price from 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.120
 my competitors and that's all I want 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:23.229
 wish you a happy day and see you 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.229
 in the following videos
