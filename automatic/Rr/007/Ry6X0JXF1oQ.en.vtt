 Christmas is just around the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.109

 in which we are most produced but 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.289
 It is not that it is something that has 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.760

 I'm an expert with shadows or anything 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.930

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.410

 we already have on our face and hair like that 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.750
 that if you have the video serving 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.830
 and 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.320
 let's start all the makeup 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.180
 we apply a base for all our everything 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.930
 face until there is no space 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.930
 of empty skin 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.910
 now we put a yellow corrector on 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.960
 the zone of wax unveiled and in some 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.090
 imperfection and we blend super well 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.950
 we follow them with a white corrector 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.840
 and we apply it in the darkest area of 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.670
 our eyecup and in the highest part of 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.030
 the nose to fix them and again 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.010
 we blur we seal everything by putting a 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.080
 compact powder all over the face 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.330
 we will use a darker tone powder 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.310
 to define and sharpen a prost die 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.080
 we make fish mouth and paint 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.910
 the minutes of our sock the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.530
 of the forehead and the contour of 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.870
 our crusade and padilla itself 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.330
 we have to distribute to and also 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.730
 student of the nose 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.220
 to get red we will apply a 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.870
 pink blush on our shoulders I 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.500
 I also put a little on the chin 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.500
 and in the nose 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.270
 now we go with the shadows we put a 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.270
 peach tone on the mobile eyelid 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.710
 with a brown tone we paint flush with 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.480
 the upper lashes of the half 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.480
 outward and eye socket 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.290
 Y 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.360
 to 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.840
 all right 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.700
 we take a golden shadow and put it on 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.000
 in the lacrimal and flush of the eyelashes 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.000
 lower 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.780
 then with a clear shadow we paint 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.780
 under the eyebrows with our crime 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.130
 already to finish with the shadows we put 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.380
 a black color flush with the eyelashes 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.640
 superiors and inferiors of the part of 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.640
 out in the middle 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.200
 ah 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.750
 and we removed what could have fallen with 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.390
 a little dust 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.850
 now this little heart brush does not 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.700
 love it so he used this insane has 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.920
 very little regret in the new volume 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.480
 product and now yes to get a lot 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.090
 Mascara on both upper lashes 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.080
 as inferior and let dry to give 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.600
 another one after 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.420
 now with this mascara that no longer has 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.140
 I take nothing to comb and paint 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.140
 a little bit my eyebrows 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.650
 Y 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:44.460
 and with the other email we give another pass 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.980
 to the eyelashes and voilÃ  for the lips 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.810
 we take a burgundy color we apply it and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.940
 we continue with our little finger so that 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.470
 impregnate well and we give another pass with the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.470
 lipstick and ready we finished 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.570
 for the hairstyle just wave we have no 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.760
 Heat divide your hair in two 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.100
 sections rotate each strand out 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.200
 and passes the lock of the outside on top of the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.209
 inside it 's super important that you do it 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.209
 so or the spiral will not form 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.790
 ah 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.790
 ah 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.919
 ah 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.620
 i 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 all right 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.630
 yes and yes throughout the hair until 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.130
 come to the end and subject with a life and 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.130
 leave it like this for some time 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.340
 they remember that I told them it was 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.340
 important to spend the day outside above 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.220
 because if they do it differently they 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:17.150
 it will happen 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.100
 so try it like that and it will come out 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.530
 that some half hour has passed loose 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.630
 the hair and you will have these super waves 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.630
 natural and without heat my love 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.020
 Y 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.290

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.600
 with a transparency a circular skirt 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.500
 black some taconcitos because these 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.540
 blacks and that's how it is 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.310
 and males that was all for the video of 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.720

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.370
 has served and has not boring 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.960

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:56.820

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.820
