hey<00:00:10.410> everybody<00:00:10.740> dusty<00:00:11.160> from<00:00:11.250> Dynojet<00:00:11.700> here

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
hey everybody dusty from Dynojet here

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.610 
hey everybody dusty from Dynojet here
even<00:00:12.450> though<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.660> auto-tune<00:00:12.929> has<00:00:13.320> been<00:00:13.500> out

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
even though the auto-tune has been out

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.320 
even though the auto-tune has been out
for<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> few<00:00:13.889> years<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.580> still<00:00:14.820> get<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> lot<00:00:15.089> of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
for a few years we still get a lot of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.970 
for a few years we still get a lot of
questions<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.470> hopefully<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
questions about it so hopefully the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.680 
questions about it so hopefully the
short<00:00:17.220> video<00:00:17.520> will<00:00:17.789> answer<00:00:18.000> those<00:00:18.270> questions

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
short video will answer those questions

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.540

are a lot of other variables to consider

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.480 
are a lot of other variables to consider
if<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:36.869> simply<00:01:37.290> adding<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.770> air<00:01:37.890> filter<00:01:38.070> or

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
if you're simply adding an air filter or

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
if you're simply adding an air filter or
an<00:01:38.579> exhaust<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.270> we<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> base<00:01:39.750> map<00:01:39.990> that's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
an exhaust and we have a base map that's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
an exhaust and we have a base map that's
fairly<00:01:40.439> close<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.280> auto-tune<00:01:41.490> will<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
fairly close the auto-tune will do a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.550 
fairly close the auto-tune will do a
great<00:01:42.060> job<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.479> getting<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.899> map<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.290> where<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
great job of getting the map to where it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.740 
great job of getting the map to where it
needs<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.250> you're<00:01:45.030> installing<00:01:45.450> an
