00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 that you do your games and someday 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.879
 Let's go there where I come with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.130
 I will still be light 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.630
 so have to give some lessons and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.550
 I know not whether all of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 you'll ever understand what for 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:21.240
 It just makes me so easy friends 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.439
 the iron sport was fun aside that was 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 of course only a joke of mine there 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.350
 in this video one of the most 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.119
 made allegations find what that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.099
 youtuber what find the theme concerns 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.390
 namely arrogance I thought so 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.279
 that I just blame them 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 go to position not related 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.280
 my with me that comes out too and yes 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.320
 again, before someone tells me you 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.790
 you are arrogant or you are a prolet 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 that is proletarian what to do and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.550
 so on and so forth 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.660
 that I should honestly why 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.070
 I do not refer to it anymore 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.370
 I mean something like that is coming again 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.750
 in front 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.430
 and maybe I can do it then 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.020
 Also, what do I mean, I mean 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
 curious what are the most made 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.160
 allegations of fitness youtuber the most 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.910
 made yes I would almost 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.649
 accuse 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 that does not sound so nice 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.059
 the assessment of characteristics 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.430
 arrogant I do not really know if 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.660
 I do that personally with my character 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.920
 would need to connect then 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.720
 I ask my friends if I ask 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.280
 arrogant i believe my friends 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.479
 they would say something completely different 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 I say that on the internet at 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.500
 I'm currently immersed in that yes 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 Hardly anyone has time and so to speak 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.409
 completely submerged 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 probably still on the internet dear 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.560
 that's a reproach he will 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.509
 I'll probably hear if I'm arrogant 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.990
 my nose is conceited far above 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.460
 drives 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.750
 no idea i do not believe it 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.600
 So somebody claims me personally 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.860
 do not see me as arrogant as that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200
 Of course there are also some 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.070
 find that youtuber there are a few 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 expression the way over the camera 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.710
 can be transported there you can 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.570
 Of course, get the impression 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 that carry your nose very high up 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.189
 maybe it's only one 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.860
 calculated a desired provocation 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.810
 call to action just call it 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.610
 spectators to animate himself about it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.780
 to rebel, it is already a type of 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.729
 defended him again so in 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 that sense could be a little calculus 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.729
 behind it are on the other side 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.130
 I will always stay as I am 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.750
 and that comes to me, it comes to me 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.640
 clear who says the guy is arrogant of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.990
 yes, my first political asocial 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.210
 God can not change it either 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.380
 So I mean, I'm guaranteed 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.180
 not on every single one per throw 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 but what I'm going to do is enter 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.989
 you write the comments what are 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.849
 the most accused of fitness 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.739
 youtuber and that's what it is 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.599
 the topic Europe came up 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.200
 now I'm curious what 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.310
 come there yet 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.620
 I thought I would just do it 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.599
 exactly the relationship relates me 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.099
 even the criticism make everything clear 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.360
 See you in the next video many 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.360
