00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
I was an early adopter to satellite

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.429 
I was an early adopter to satellite
radio<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.630> really<00:01:15.840> enjoyed<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
radio and I really enjoyed it

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289 
radio and I really enjoyed it
but<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.340> point<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.759> moved<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.150> an

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
but at one point I moved into an

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.609 
but at one point I moved into an
apartment<00:01:18.509> where<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> wrong<00:01:19.560> side

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
apartment where I was on the wrong side

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.410 
apartment where I was on the wrong side
of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> building<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> antenna<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> pick

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
of the building for the antenna to pick

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.600 
of the building for the antenna to pick
up<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> signal<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.799> also<00:01:22.979> had<00:01:23.220> moved<00:01:23.430> even

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
up a signal and I also had moved even

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
up a signal and I also had moved even
closer<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.390> work<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.290> took<00:01:25.409> me

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
closer to where I work so it took me

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.170 
closer to where I work so it took me
more<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> put<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> receiver<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:26.880> car

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
more time to put the receiver in my car

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.240 
more time to put the receiver in my car
and<00:01:27.330> find<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> signal<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.710> take<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.009> out

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and find a signal and then take it out

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.069 
and find a signal and then take it out
when<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> got<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.210> work<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.720> took<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
when I got to work then it took me to
