00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
I guess not a stadium more of just the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.600 
I guess not a stadium more of just the
court<00:00:11.480> I've<00:00:12.480> seen<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> lot<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.160> other<00:00:14.160> people

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610

some<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.050> them<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.859> honest<00:00:20.220> are<00:00:21.350> just<00:00:22.350> kind

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
some of them to be honest are just kind

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
some of them to be honest are just kind
of<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.859> blocks<00:00:23.189> placed<00:00:23.939> from<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> corners

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of some blocks placed from the corners

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.890 
of some blocks placed from the corners
diagonally<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.880> with<00:00:26.880> some<00:00:27.060> wood<00:00:27.240> floors<00:00:27.599> and

diagonally and with some wood floors and
colors<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.820> think<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.179> better

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
colors and I think you can do better

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.710 
colors and I think you can do better
than<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
than that

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.950 
than that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
there's a three block wide gap in the

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.620 
there's a three block wide gap in the
middle<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.950> these<00:02:11.099> end<00:02:11.400> blocks<00:02:11.730> here

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
middle and then on these end blocks here

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.410 
middle and then on these end blocks here
of<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.620> three-block<00:02:14.070> app<00:02:14.310> you're<00:02:15.090> gonna<00:02:15.180> want

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
of the three-block app you're gonna want

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.840 
of the three-block app you're gonna want
to<00:02:15.480> place<00:02:16.400> how<00:02:17.400> many<00:02:17.430> boxes<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:19.520> one<00:02:20.520> two

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
to place how many boxes this one two

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.100 
to place how many boxes this one two
three<00:02:21.270> four<00:02:21.630> five<00:02:22.050> six<00:02:22.410> seven<00:02:22.830> blocks<00:02:23.220> from

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
three four five six seven blocks from

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
three four five six seven blocks from
the<00:02:25.110> border<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.850> that's<00:02:27.780> actually<00:02:27.960> wrong<00:02:29.180> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the border so that's actually wrong so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.390 
the border so that's actually wrong so
just<00:02:30.540> some<00:02:30.780> straight<00:02:31.110> lines<00:02:31.350> just<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.160> that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
just some straight lines just like that

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.300 
just some straight lines just like that
now<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.480> two<00:02:33.810> options<00:02:34.020> here<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:35.070> could

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
now you have two options here you could

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.250 
now you have two options here you could
just<00:02:35.340> extend<00:02:35.940> these<00:02:36.210> another<00:02:36.540> block<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.110> then

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
just extend these another block and then

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.980 
just extend these another block and then
go<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.530> blocks<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.130> front<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.990> have

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
go two blocks in front here and have

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.980 
go two blocks in front here and have
that<00:02:40.260> be<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> free-throw<00:02:40.920> line<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.990> personally

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
that be a free-throw line I personally

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.340 
that be a free-throw line I personally
like<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.030> take<00:02:45.240> those<00:02:45.420> blocks<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:46.050> and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
like and you take those blocks out and

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.870 
like and you take those blocks out and
you<00:02:46.470> place<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:47.070> three<00:02:47.340> in<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.520> middle<00:02:47.730> like

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
you place just three in the middle like

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.740 
you place just three in the middle like
that<00:02:47.960> go<00:02:48.960> up<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.320> plot<00:02:49.560> places<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.600> place<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
that go up to plot places and place the

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
that go up to plot places and place the
free-throw<00:02:52.200> line<00:02:52.230> like<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.830> think<00:02:52.950> that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
free-throw line like that I think that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.060 
free-throw line like that I think that
looks<00:02:53.520> better<00:02:54.170> that's<00:02:55.170> totally<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.710> your

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
looks better that's totally up to your

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.070 
looks better that's totally up to your
choice<00:02:56.340> though<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.450> can<00:02:57.570> do<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:57.990> the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
choice though see you can do that on the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.220 
choice though see you can do that on the
other<00:02:58.170> side<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.060> then<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.720> three<00:03:01.020> blocks

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
other side and then the three blocks

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.730 
other side and then the three blocks
away<00:03:01.470> from<00:03:01.590> here<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:03.510> place<00:03:03.810> three<00:03:04.380> blocks

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
away from here and place three blocks

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.680 
away from here and place three blocks
just<00:03:05.130> like<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.380> go<00:03:07.380> another<00:03:07.590> three<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.070> way

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
just like that go another three this way

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.740 
just like that go another three this way
this<00:03:09.690> side<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.580> then<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.630> between

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
this side in there and then in between

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.710 
this side in there and then in between
put<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.320> line<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.040> that's<00:03:14.850> gonna<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.270> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
put a line and that's gonna be the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.070 
put a line and that's gonna be the
center<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.200> your<00:03:16.320> court<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.780> anything

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
center of your court and so anything

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.780 
center of your court and so anything
that<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.440> do<00:03:19.680> over<00:03:20.070> there<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.520> just<00:03:20.670> do

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
that you do over there you can just do

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.110 
that you do over there you can just do
over<00:03:20.940> there<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:22.490> then<00:03:23.490> of<00:03:23.610> course<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.000> can

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
over there and then of course you can

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.990 
over there and then of course you can
fill<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.870> best<00:03:25.080> court<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:26.160> floor

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
fill in the best court with the floor

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.900 
fill in the best court with the floor
material<00:03:27.570> material<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.650> your<00:03:28.980> choice

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
you could also color in the key to call

some cyan stained clay right there go

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.860 
some cyan stained clay right there go
three<00:03:49.140> blocks<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.680> one<00:03:50.550> block<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:51.240> another

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
three blocks up one block in another

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
three blocks up one block in another
block<00:03:52.140> up<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:53.070> just<00:03:53.250> play<00:03:53.370> six<00:03:53.790> pieces<00:03:54.030> of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
block up and just play six pieces of

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.240 
block up and just play six pieces of
glass<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:56.570> this<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.930> then<00:03:58.890> I<00:03:58.980> usually

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
glass just like this and then I usually

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.820 
glass just like this and then I usually
just<00:03:59.640> put<00:03:59.850> three<00:04:00.120> iron<00:04:00.300> bars<00:04:00.600> across<00:04:00.960> kind<00:04:01.710> of

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
just put three iron bars across kind of

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.680 
just put three iron bars across kind of
gives<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.070> general<00:04:02.550> idea<00:04:02.910> although<00:04:03.510> you

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
gives that general idea although you

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.110 
gives that general idea although you
could<00:04:04.020> instead<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.310> put<00:04:05.700> a<00:04:05.730> hopper

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
could instead of that put a hopper

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.170 
could instead of that put a hopper
totally<00:04:06.930> up<00:04:07.020> to<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:08.010> yeah<00:04:08.850> so<00:04:09.090> that's
