doing that i'm not exactly good that
Mike<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.090> built<00:01:54.299> my<00:01:54.450> own<00:01:54.479> controller<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.170> my

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
Mike I built my own controller so my

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.709 
Mike I built my own controller so my
controller<00:01:55.680> isn't<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.969> rotation<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
controller isn't my rotation on the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
controller isn't my rotation on the
sticks<00:01:58.049> isn't<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.640> fluid

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
sticks isn't as good it's not as fluid

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.209 
sticks isn't as good it's not as fluid
so<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.930> don't<00:02:01.079> want<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.290> pick<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.560> last<00:02:01.950> that

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
