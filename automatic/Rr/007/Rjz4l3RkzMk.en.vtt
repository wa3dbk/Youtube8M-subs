because that's what I have but this will

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.099 
because that's what I have but this will
work<00:00:26.220> for<00:00:26.279> most<00:00:26.609> microphones<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.510> definitely

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
work for most microphones and definitely

with the manual so you know how your mic
works<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.869> optimum<00:01:28.500> distance<00:01:28.680> away<00:01:29.130> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
works what the optimum distance away is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
works what the optimum distance away is
to<00:01:29.700> speak<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.860> what<00:01:31.860> modes<00:01:32.189> there

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
to speak into it and what modes there

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.090 
to speak into it and what modes there
are<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:33.090> microphone<00:01:33.619> such<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> blue

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
are on your microphone such as the blue

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.359 
are on your microphone such as the blue
Yeti<00:01:35.340> there's<00:01:35.700> cardioid<00:01:36.210> omnidirectional

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
Yeti there's cardioid omnidirectional

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
Yeti there's cardioid omnidirectional
directional<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.549> bi-directional<00:01:39.290> which<00:01:40.290> are

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
directional and bi-directional which are

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
directional and bi-directional which are
all<00:01:40.619> different<00:01:40.890> modes<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> they<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.060> used

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
all different modes and they can be used

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
all different modes and they can be used
in<00:01:42.689> different<00:01:42.979> settings<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.700> most

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
in different settings and for most

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.109 
in different settings and for most
commentators<00:01:45.560> they<00:01:46.560> normally<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.250> cardioid

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
commentators they normally use cardioid

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.940 
commentators they normally use cardioid
because<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.869> picks<00:01:49.020> up<00:01:49.200> everything<00:01:49.380> directly

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
because it picks up everything directly

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.520 
because it picks up everything directly
in<00:01:50.340> front<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.659> information<00:01:52.049> like

setting is best for you normally a very

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.670 
setting is best for you normally a very
low<00:02:59.129> setting<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.879> good<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.329> commentators<00:03:01.019> who

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
low setting is good for commentators who

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.119 
low setting is good for commentators who
would<00:03:01.829> speak<00:03:02.069> very<00:03:02.340> close<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:02.970> microphone

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
would speak very close to the microphone

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.850 
would speak very close to the microphone

commentaries because I can record at
very<00:03:24.959> high<00:03:25.079> bit<00:03:25.950> rates<00:03:26.359> bit<00:03:27.359> rates<00:03:27.690> are<00:03:27.900> like

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
very high bit rates bit rates are like

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.110

more there are the higher quality it is

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.370 
more there are the higher quality it is
I<00:03:34.940> would<00:03:35.940> then<00:03:36.239> remove<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.720> background<00:03:36.959> noise

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
I would then remove the background noise

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.280 
I would then remove the background noise
and<00:03:37.620> then<00:03:37.859> export<00:03:38.459> it<00:03:38.639> so<00:03:39.420> once<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.780> export<00:03:40.139> it

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
and then export it so once I export it

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.009 
and then export it so once I export it
from<00:03:40.590> audacity<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.400> open<00:03:41.910> it<00:03:41.970> up<00:03:42.120> with<00:03:42.450> adobe

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
from audacity I open it up with adobe

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.330 
from audacity I open it up with adobe
audition<00:03:43.220> CC<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.639> I<00:03:45.540> use<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.989> preset<00:03:46.530> effects

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
audition CC and I use the preset effects

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
audition CC and I use the preset effects
to<00:03:47.459> improve<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.849> quality<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.269> my<00:03:48.359> recordings

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
to improve the quality of my recordings

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.009 
to improve the quality of my recordings
I<00:03:49.109> personally<00:03:50.069> use<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.700> broadcast<00:03:51.419> presets

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
I personally use the broadcast presets

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.370 
I personally use the broadcast presets
under<00:03:52.769> multiband<00:03:53.430> compression<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.599> in

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
under multiband compression in in

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.400 
under multiband compression in in
effects<00:03:55.980> so<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.269> find<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.660> really<00:03:57.870> useful

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
effects so I find that really useful

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.199 
effects so I find that really useful
because<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.739> deepens<00:03:59.489> your<00:03:59.579> voice<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.030> makes

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
because it deepens your voice and makes

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.520 
because it deepens your voice and makes
it<00:04:00.389> more<00:04:01.130> engaging<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.180> listener<00:04:03.569> is<00:04:03.750> how

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
it more engaging to the listener is how

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.530 
it more engaging to the listener is how
I<00:04:04.560> think<00:04:04.889> I<00:04:04.980> should<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.430> so<00:04:06.150> things<00:04:06.389> like

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
I think I should put it so things like

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.900 
I think I should put it so things like
that<00:04:06.720> can<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.079> very<00:04:07.319> useful<00:04:07.579> there<00:04:08.579> are<00:04:08.730> some

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
that can be very useful there are some

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.940 
that can be very useful there are some
of<00:04:09.090> those<00:04:09.180> inside<00:04:09.780> Aldo<00:04:10.169> so<00:04:10.349> see<00:04:10.470> if<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.650> can't

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
of those inside Aldo so see if you can't

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.909 
of those inside Aldo so see if you can't
afford<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.400> buy<00:04:11.900> adobe<00:04:12.900> audition<00:04:13.200> right<00:04:13.709> now

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
afford to buy adobe audition right now

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.849 
afford to buy adobe audition right now
and<00:04:14.599> yeah<00:04:15.599> as<00:04:15.780> long<00:04:15.959> as<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.200> do<00:04:16.349> that<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.680> can

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
and yeah as long as you do that you can

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.509 
and yeah as long as you do that you can
have<00:04:17.039> some<00:04:17.340> very<00:04:17.549> high<00:04:17.959> recording<00:04:18.959> qualities

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
have some very high recording qualities

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.490 
have some very high recording qualities
so<00:04:20.519> number<00:04:20.970> five<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.479> quite<00:04:21.719> a<00:04:21.840> general<00:04:22.349> one

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
so number five is quite a general one

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.210 
so number five is quite a general one
keep<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.669> mind<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:24.060> there<00:04:24.330> are<00:04:24.510> many

many<00:04:25.700> different<00:04:26.210> combinations<00:04:26.420> of<00:04:26.870> things

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
many different combinations of things

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.500 
many different combinations of things
you<00:04:27.410> can<00:04:27.530> put<00:04:27.590> together<00:04:27.920> when<00:04:28.850> editing<00:04:29.240> your

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
audio you should always try out every

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.750 
audio you should always try out every
