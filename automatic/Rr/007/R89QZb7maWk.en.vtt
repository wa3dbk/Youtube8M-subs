here<00:00:01.350> over<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.709> past<00:00:01.949> summer<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.370> talked<00:00:02.700> about

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
here over the past summer I talked about

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.269 
here over the past summer I talked about
how<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.149> United<00:00:03.480> States<00:00:03.659> had<00:00:04.200> released<00:00:04.589> this

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
how the United States had released this

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.440 
how the United States had released this
new<00:00:06.170> laser<00:00:07.170> system<00:00:07.859> it<00:00:08.639> was<00:00:08.820> a<00:00:08.849> new<00:00:09.059> weapon

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
new laser system it was a new weapon

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.600 
new laser system it was a new weapon
they<00:00:09.540> were<00:00:09.660> gonna<00:00:09.780> use<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.080> Navy<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.889> deploy

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
they were gonna use the Navy and deploy

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.560 
they were gonna use the Navy and deploy
it<00:00:11.639> onto<00:00:12.090> their<00:00:12.360> ships<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:13.500> laser<00:00:13.889> cannon

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
it onto their ships this laser cannon

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.529 
it onto their ships this laser cannon
that<00:00:15.570> could<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.929> some<00:00:16.199> serious<00:00:16.710> damage<00:00:17.539> well

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
that could do some serious damage well

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.519 
that could do some serious damage well
now<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.930> looks<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.199> China<00:00:19.800> has<00:00:20.130> achieved<00:00:20.250> a

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
now it looks like China has achieved a

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.689 
now it looks like China has achieved a
technological<00:00:22.529> breakthrough<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.550> could

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
technological breakthrough that could

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.529 
technological breakthrough that could
help<00:00:23.880> them<00:00:24.240> introduce<00:00:24.960> pulse<00:00:25.529> weapons<00:00:26.539> into

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
help them introduce pulse weapons into

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.609 
help them introduce pulse weapons into
the<00:00:27.570> Chinese<00:00:28.109> army<00:00:28.970> now<00:00:30.019> this<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.230> all<00:00:31.410> put

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the Chinese army now this was all put

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
the Chinese army now this was all put
out<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.070> underneath<00:00:32.550> their<00:00:32.820> mouthpiece

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
out there underneath their mouthpiece

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.830 
out there underneath their mouthpiece
the<00:00:33.660> people's<00:00:34.559> daily<00:00:34.910> now<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.969> report<00:00:36.450> states

here<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.500> we<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:39.290> they<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
here and we all know that they have that

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
here and we all know that they have that
on<00:01:40.979> its<00:01:41.659> highest<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:43.340> regards<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.119> when<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
on its highest of regards so when you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.020 
on its highest of regards so when you
start<00:01:45.570> talking<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.170> terms<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.619> military<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
start talking in terms of military the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
start talking in terms of military the
simulated<00:01:48.570> x-ray<00:01:48.930> pulsars<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.649> help<00:01:49.799> trying

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
simulated x-ray pulsars can help trying

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.350 
simulated x-ray pulsars can help trying
to<00:01:50.070> develop<00:01:50.310> new<00:01:50.640> weapons<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.299> can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to develop new weapons they can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
to develop new weapons they can
challenge<00:01:51.840> America's<00:01:52.710> dominance<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
challenge America's dominance in the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
elect in the EMP weapons fear that's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.749 
elect in the EMP weapons fear that's
exactly<00:01:57.540> what<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.810> call<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
exactly what they call it

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.789 
exactly what they call it
electromagnetic<00:01:59.759> pulse<00:02:01.219> EMP<00:02:02.689> so<00:02:03.689> their<00:02:04.590> new

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
electromagnetic pulse EMP so their new

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.859 
electromagnetic pulse EMP so their new
EMP<00:02:05.610> weapon<00:02:07.640> they<00:02:08.640> are<00:02:08.819> very<00:02:09.030> proud<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.390> at<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
EMP weapon they are very proud of at the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.170 
EMP weapon they are very proud of at the
moment<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:12.090> reported<00:02:12.569> before

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
moment and as I reported before

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.289 
moment and as I reported before
you<00:02:15.180> wonder<00:02:15.480> if<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.110> counter<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:17.299> the

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
you wonder if this have a counter to the

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.589 
you wonder if this have a counter to the
US<00:02:18.629> Navy's<00:02:19.700> laser<00:02:20.700> cannon<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.180> they<00:02:21.299> put<00:02:21.480> on

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
US Navy's laser cannon that they put on

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:27.979 
US Navy's laser cannon that they put on
their<00:02:21.810> ships<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:26.299> we'd<00:02:27.299> like<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.599> see<00:02:27.780> some

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
their ships so we'd like to see some

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.960 
their ships so we'd like to see some
video<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.409> this<00:02:28.799> being<00:02:29.190> tested<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:29.730> don't<00:02:29.849> know

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
video of this being tested I don't know

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.670 
video of this being tested I don't know
if<00:02:30.060> we'll<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.079> but<00:02:31.230> if<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.379> can<00:02:31.500> get<00:02:31.590> my

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
if we'll see it but if I can get my

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.990 
if we'll see it but if I can get my
hands<00:02:31.890> on<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.099> I'll<00:02:32.310> share<00:02:32.579> it<00:02:32.610> with<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.790> guys

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
hands on it I'll share it with you guys

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.059 
hands on it I'll share it with you guys
and<00:02:33.329> I'll<00:02:34.260> leave<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.500> link<00:02:34.709> with<00:02:35.040> more
