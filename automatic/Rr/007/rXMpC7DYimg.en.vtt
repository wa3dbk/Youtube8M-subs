00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.370
 living by the water that sounds great 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 for many a dream the form of increase 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.380
 It would actually only be up there 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.929
 the water of a gotcha arises straight 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.540
 the first floating house the first of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.699
 a whole settlement but how do you build 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:25.320
 such a floating house without 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:28.800
 solid floor including two cranes 80 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 tons of weight a big sense of this 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.840
 ponton should once have a house 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.880
 two-storey with roof terrace 95 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.320
 square meters of living space for vacation 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 make or as a home 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.460
 Everything will be fine 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.829
 this is wondering about the birds 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 project manager of the new marina god too 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 if that's not his first floating house 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 So floating house is 15 years 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 over 50 houses already in the water so 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 actually swimming and physically there 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.899
 You can not rent them 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.239
 holiday draufmachen many many 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.949
 locations of a baltic sea mainly 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 but now also in whole 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.510
 Germany distributed in so-called 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.040
 HolzstÃ¤nderbauweise arise 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.200
 Meanwhile, with a manufacturer of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 prefabricated houses the complete interior as well 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 exterior walls and the false ceilings 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.020
 The thick forests are native forests 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.479
 live oaks and pines 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.540
 They make the building easier than 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.000
 But massive stone houses mean straight 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.180
 on a lake specific requirements for 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.100
 Keep waterproofing and insulation 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.729
 this turn a crisp German 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.729
 winter off 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.840
 in any case because of this demon 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.030
 behave what we put on the day here 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.130
 In any case, we are named after the houses 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.080
 let the cold outside and in winter 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.850
 the heat in it 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.909
 Meanwhile, then hang the crane hook on 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.159
 case the house made of foundation 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.799
 styrofoam for buoyancy and concrete for 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.780
 The stability is routine and gentle 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.610
 maneuver the experts for heavy 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.450
 load the 80 tons colossus on the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.460
 water surface 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.520
 unthinkable if now through 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.380
 damage the statics pedestrians at the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.670
 have projectors like peter erdmann 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.590
 namely long worked 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.660
 finally there is a floating house 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.380
 not despite his enormous weight 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.910
 completely still on the water surface 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.450
 are generally quite different claims too 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.319
 put 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.209
 It's about a changed statics 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.290
 at the normal house I need one 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.230
 statically well known at one 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.060
 floating house structural waves 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.220
 Center calculation and so on 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.680
 here are the houses to lie on one 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.329
 is located 60 meters from the lakeshore 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.980
 steel pipes provide for the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.930
 stability framed by 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.100
 Specialists already in the baltic sea 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.060
 anchored whole floating out of parks 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.160
 then the day of truth 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.019
 as the first outer wall in the light of 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.150
 morning sun hanging on the crane hook asks 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.489
 Not only project manager Siebel will be 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.489
 they fit into the prefabricated pontoon 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.370
 bingo to the millimeter and not just the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.650
 also all other walls fit like 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.019
 provided at your destination 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.579
 roland briefly, he has calmed down yet 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.139
 first house bought on the goitzsche 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 All in all, for more than 300,000 euros 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.900
 Of course it is something else on the 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.180
 see paper and now here in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.760
 Reality are finished part there arises 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.079
 within two days 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.519
 and if you can not do it there 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.349
 one later only on the film 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.060
 look at 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.400
 Meanwhile, the lower floor is ready 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.639
 follow the second and the complete 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.439
 Interior project manager buyer and 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.919
 already change through the 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.870
 rooms 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.639
 ten of these houses are built on the same day 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.870
 bitterfelder city port and become 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.879
 then to the destination 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.790
 hauled if everything works 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.480
 already in july the first holiday guests 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.480
 go on board
