00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
way right there the power up just to

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.609 
way right there the power up just to
give<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.189> energy<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:39.450> your<00:01:40.290> cape

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
when it's blinking red like this I think

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.610 
when it's blinking red like this I think
I<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> take<00:01:46.229> three<00:01:46.590> hits

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
I can take three hits

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.960 
I can take three hits
so<00:01:49.620> yeah<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.980> most<00:01:50.190> you<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.310> take<00:01:50.580> it<00:01:50.730> free

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
so yeah the most you can take it free

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.880
