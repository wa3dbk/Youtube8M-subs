looking at some of the the technology on

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.099 
looking at some of the the technology on
these<00:03:57.220> bikes<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.730> 20s<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.329> 30s<00:03:58.359> look

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
these bikes in the 20s and the 30s look

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.140 
these bikes in the 20s and the 30s look
at<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.350> motor<00:03:59.680> it's<00:04:00.070> when<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.670> way<00:04:00.820> it's

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
at that motor it's when that way it's

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.080 
at that motor it's when that way it's
bizarre<00:04:01.570> never<00:04:01.959> bad<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.459> speeds<00:04:03.790> that

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
bizarre never bad and the speeds that

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.810 
bizarre never bad and the speeds that
that<00:04:04.840> these<00:04:05.200> bikes<00:04:05.470> can<00:04:05.709> do<00:04:05.920> he<00:04:06.280> did<00:04:06.430> a<00:04:06.459> hundred

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
that these bikes can do he did a hundred

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.610 
that these bikes can do he did a hundred
miles<00:04:06.970> an<00:04:07.120> hour<00:04:07.209> on<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:07.600> bike<00:04:07.810> yeah

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
miles an hour on this bike yeah

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.080 
miles an hour on this bike yeah
these<00:04:08.980> people<00:04:09.310> were<00:04:09.430> way<00:04:09.670> ahead<00:04:09.700> of<00:04:09.940> their

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
these people were way ahead of their

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.300 
these people were way ahead of their
time<00:04:10.359> that's<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.959> cool-looking<00:04:11.230> this<00:04:12.130> is<00:04:12.280> a

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
time that's a cool-looking this is a

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.979 
time that's a cool-looking this is a
cool-looking<00:04:12.640> tank<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:13.299> would<00:04:13.480> be<00:04:13.630> nice<00:04:13.810> on

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
cool-looking tank this would be nice on

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.630 
cool-looking tank this would be nice on
an<00:04:14.109> old-school<00:04:14.410> bike<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:14.980> know<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:15.519> know

an old-school bike you know you know
looking<00:04:16.299> at<00:04:16.419> these<00:04:16.539> bikes<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.769> kind<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.160> gives

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
looking at these bikes it kind of gives

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.719 
looking at these bikes it kind of gives
you<00:04:18.700> some<00:04:19.000> ideas<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:20.340> incorporate<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.430> some<00:04:21.640> of

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
you some ideas to incorporate in some of

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.990 
you some ideas to incorporate in some of
the<00:04:21.820> maybe<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.840> old-school<00:04:23.830> bikes<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.400> that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
the maybe the old-school bikes that that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.719 
the maybe the old-school bikes that that
I<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.360> built

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.900 

there<00:04:29.729> were<00:04:29.819> no<00:04:30.120> retainage<00:04:31.550> I'll<00:04:32.550> take<00:04:32.819> you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
the cool things about Brooklands is that

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.640 
the cool things about Brooklands is that
