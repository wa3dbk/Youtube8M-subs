there's acres of fresh food form to eat
now<00:02:11.129> we've<00:02:11.280> got<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> harvester<00:02:11.879> working<00:02:12.239> on

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
now we've got a harvester working on

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.940 
now we've got a harvester working on
another<00:02:12.810> field<00:02:13.140> where<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.739> pinna

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
another field where the pinna

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.990 
another field where the pinna
so<00:02:14.069> ready<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.280> be<00:02:14.400> harvested<00:02:14.730> let's<00:02:14.849> take<00:02:14.970> a

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so ready to be harvested let's take a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:36.270 
so ready to be harvested let's take a
look<00:02:15.120> at<00:02:15.239> it

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.680 

okay<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.460> machine<00:02:37.700> we<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:38.060> saw<00:02:38.240> is<00:02:38.420> called

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
okay that machine we just saw is called

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.160 
okay that machine we just saw is called
an<00:02:38.810> inverter<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.530> its<00:02:40.310> job<00:02:40.550> is<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:40.930> invert<00:02:41.930> the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
an inverter and its job is to invert the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.710 
an inverter and its job is to invert the
peanuts<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:43.490> we<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:43.940> here<00:02:43.970> pull<00:02:44.510> them<00:02:44.660> out

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
peanuts like we see here pull them out

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.400 
peanuts like we see here pull them out
of<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.900> ground

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
flip them over upside down and set them

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.610 
flip them over upside down and set them
back<00:02:47.930> down<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.120> Sun<00:02:50.450> which<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.410> see

about<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.490> peanut<00:03:37.760> plant<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.450> will

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
about the peanut plant is that it will

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.920 
about the peanut plant is that it will
grow<00:03:38.810> just<00:03:39.470> about<00:03:39.620> anywhere<00:03:40.720> look<00:03:41.720> at<00:03:41.810> this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
grow just about anywhere look at this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.850 
grow just about anywhere look at this
ground<00:03:42.110> here<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.740> mean<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.490> turd<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.860> better

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
ground here I mean this turd is better

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.450 
ground here I mean this turd is better
suited<00:03:46.250> for<00:03:46.310> growing<00:03:46.640> pottery<00:03:47.150> than<00:03:48.020> peanuts

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
suited for growing pottery than peanuts

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.630 
suited for growing pottery than peanuts
but<00:03:49.460> yet<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.730> still<00:03:49.910> grows<00:03:51.340> various<00:03:52.340> parts<00:03:52.580> of

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
but yet it still grows various parts of

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.350 
but yet it still grows various parts of
Africa<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.210> China<00:03:53.680> people<00:03:54.680> are<00:03:55.330> hungry<00:03:56.330> and

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
Africa and China people are hungry and

Africa and China people are hungry and
starving<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:58.370> peanut<00:03:58.670> is<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.820> fantastic

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
starving the peanut is a fantastic

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
source of protein for him that's all I

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.070 
source of protein for him that's all I
got<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.270> say<00:04:05.330> about<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.870> peanut<00:04:08.080> anyways
