00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 under the name of Japan 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.460
 paper 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 Klose is located

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.050

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 remains relevant 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.190
 besides both groups 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.270

 satisfied with the meter antenna 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 black color

 and another ten years 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 for a number of regions 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.750
 but I think it was necessary not to hide it even

 if not 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.370

 Tymoshenko promised 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.239
