hi<00:00:00.539> everybody<00:00:00.750> welcome<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.140> another<00:00:01.319> career

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hi everybody welcome to another career

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.379 
hi everybody welcome to another career
tutorial<00:00:02.070> on<00:00:02.129> cry<00:00:02.280> man<00:00:02.460> and<00:00:03.149> we're<00:00:03.240> going<00:00:03.270> to

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
tutorial on cry man and we're going to

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.460 
tutorial on cry man and we're going to
do<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.629> time<00:00:03.870> theory<00:00:04.080> is<00:00:04.140> we're<00:00:04.259> going<00:00:04.380> to

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
do this time theory is we're going to

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.160 
do this time theory is we're going to
take<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.069> look<00:00:05.250> at<00:00:05.310> our<00:00:05.400> point<00:00:05.910> force<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.990> our

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
take a look at our point force in our

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.799 
take a look at our point force in our
forces<00:00:09.440> forces<00:00:10.440> objects<00:00:11.509> let's<00:00:12.509> go<00:00:12.570> ahead<00:00:12.690> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
forces forces objects let's go ahead and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.410 
forces forces objects let's go ahead and
insert<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.230> point<00:00:13.440> force<00:00:14.089> it's<00:00:15.089> probably<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
insert a point force it's probably the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.090 
insert a point force it's probably the
cooler<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.500> them<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.800> that's<00:00:16.920> why

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
cooler one of all of them so that's why

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.060 
cooler one of all of them so that's why
we're<00:00:17.250> doing<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:18.740> it's<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> get

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
we're doing this one it's going to get

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.380 
we're doing this one it's going to get
this<00:00:20.220> set<00:00:20.490> up<00:00:20.520> I've<00:00:21.359> already<00:00:21.539> done<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:23.390> thing

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
this set up I've already done the thing

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.480 
this set up I've already done the thing
with<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> turn<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> animation<00:00:26.010> off<00:00:26.160> camera

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
with the turn the animation off camera

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.930 
with the turn the animation off camera
and<00:00:28.670> set<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.939> render<00:00:30.779> only<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.820> only<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
and set it to render only one only the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
and set it to render only one only the
current<00:00:33.270> frame<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.469> we're<00:00:34.559> pretty<00:00:34.649> much<00:00:34.800> set

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
current frame so we're pretty much set

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.190 
current frame so we're pretty much set
up<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.370> way<00:00:35.520> we're<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.200> kind

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
up that way we're going to have to kind

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.810 
up that way we're going to have to kind
of<00:00:37.260> move<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:37.860> stuff<00:00:38.010> around<00:00:38.870> all<00:00:39.870> right<00:00:40.050> now

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
of move this stuff around all right now

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.220 
of move this stuff around all right now
you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.969> particle<00:00:42.210> emitter<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.110> have

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you have a particle emitter and you have

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680 
you have a particle emitter and you have
a<00:00:43.260> point<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.710> us<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.700> let's<00:00:45.329> step<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.600> our

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a point for us now let's step into our

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.180 
a point for us now let's step into our
particle<00:00:46.079> emitter<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.710> set<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.039> we

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
particle emitter and get it set up so we

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.810 
particle emitter and get it set up so we
can<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> point<00:00:48.239> for<00:00:48.450> us<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:49.700> first<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
can use the point for us on it first of

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.160 
can use the point for us on it first of
all<00:00:50.850> let's<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> facing<00:00:51.420> camera<00:00:51.989> because

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
all let's have it facing camera because

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.799 
all let's have it facing camera because
i<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> texture<00:00:52.770> i<00:00:52.829> want<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.039> use<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
i have a texture i want to use on it

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.900 
i have a texture i want to use on it
let's<00:00:54.809> bring<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.230> number<00:00:55.410> down<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.190> 500<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
let's bring that number down to 500 and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.040 
let's bring that number down to 500 and
let's<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.059> through<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.390> particles<00:01:00.899> life

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
let's go through here particles life

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
let's go through here particles life
this<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.760> lifetime<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this is this is for the lifetime of the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
this is this is for the lifetime of the
particle<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.830> anything

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
particle we're not going to do anything

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
particle we're not going to do anything
with<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.250> emitter<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.880> we're<00:01:06.720> only<00:01:06.840> going

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
with that emitter is on we're only going

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.210 
with that emitter is on we're only going
to<00:01:07.530> admit<00:01:07.979> we're<00:01:08.310> only<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.909> emit<00:01:13.220> 45

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
to admit we're only going to emit 45

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.890 
to admit we're only going to emit 45
seconds<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.580 

see<00:01:18.590> number<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:18.980> particles<00:01:19.430> is<00:01:20.680> probably<00:01:23.500> 50

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
see number of particles is probably 50

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.789 
see number of particles is probably 50
sighs<00:01:26.659> one<00:01:28.609> mass<00:01:29.609> is<00:01:29.880> good<00:01:30.090> velocity<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:31.350> kind

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
sighs one mass is good velocity we kind

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.560 
sighs one mass is good velocity we kind
of<00:01:31.859> want<00:01:32.039> to<00:01:32.100> pump<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.789> velocity<00:01:33.270> up<00:01:33.359> let<00:01:33.509> me

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of want to pump the velocity up let me

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.120 

and<00:01:39.780> I'll<00:01:39.870> show<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.080> why<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.770> second

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and I'll show you why here in a second

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.540 
and I'll show you why here in a second
let's<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.730> to<00:01:41.790> our<00:01:42.230> advanced<00:01:43.230> tab<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.830> turn

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
let's go to our advanced tab and turn

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.360 
let's go to our advanced tab and turn
our<00:01:44.670> air<00:01:44.850> friction<00:01:45.090> up<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.900> bit

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
our air friction up just a little bit

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.410 
our air friction up just a little bit
it's<00:01:47.370> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.550> slow<00:01:47.700> our<00:01:47.730> particles<00:01:48.270> down

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's going to slow our particles down

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's going to slow our particles down
but<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.690> also<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> slow<00:01:49.230> down<00:01:49.380> their

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
but it's also going to slow down their

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.360 
but it's also going to slow down their
impact<00:01:50.490> when<00:01:50.760> they<00:01:50.880> hit<00:01:51.120> things<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:54.110> oh<00:01:55.190> no<00:01:56.190> the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
impact when they hit things so oh no the

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.950 
impact when they hit things so oh no the
objects<00:01:56.760> friction<00:01:57.120> on<00:01:57.210> collision<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.780> what

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
objects friction on collision is what

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.290 
objects friction on collision is what
when<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.680> hit<00:01:58.830> things<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.610> air<00:01:59.730> friction<00:02:00.000> is

when they hit things the air friction is

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.620 
when they hit things the air friction is
uh<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:02.670> going<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> dampen<00:02:03.150> them<00:02:03.300> as<00:02:03.480> they

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
uh is it's going to dampen them as they

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
uh is it's going to dampen them as they
go<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.950> use<00:02:05.070> forces<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.790> scene

click in the middle here and you notice

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.670 
click in the middle here and you notice
there's<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.520> big<00:02:26.790> massive<00:02:27.410> particles<00:02:28.410> floating

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
there's a big massive particles floating

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.370 
there's a big massive particles floating
around<00:02:28.860> there<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.280> don't<00:02:29.370> want<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:30.290> let's<00:02:31.290> go

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
around there we don't want that let's go

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.550 
around there we don't want that let's go
to<00:02:31.440> our<00:02:31.500> point<00:02:31.800> force<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.930> go<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.200> effects

tab and you notice that there's an

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.820 
tab and you notice that there's an
insane<00:02:36.950> high<00:02:38.180> number<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.420> it's<00:02:39.570> like<00:02:39.830> 829

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
insane high number here it's like 829

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.090 
insane high number here it's like 829
well<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.520> see<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> 29<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.450> 40<00:02:42.950> let's<00:02:43.950> bring

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
well you can see a 29 for 40 let's bring

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.240 
well you can see a 29 for 40 let's bring
that<00:02:44.280> down<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.760> 5000<00:02:46.070> it's<00:02:47.070> going<00:02:47.190> to

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
that down to like 5000 it's going to

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.630 
that down to like 5000 it's going to
keep<00:02:47.400> our

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
keep our

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.460 
keep our
going<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.330> keep<00:02:49.480> our<00:02:49.600> particles<00:02:50.110> kind<00:02:50.380> of

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
going to keep our particles kind of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:58.180 
going to keep our particles kind of
close<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.980> same

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.010 

oh<00:02:58.250> we<00:02:59.240> got<00:02:59.390> 500<00:02:59.950> 5000<00:03:00.950> gonna<00:03:01.430> say<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.900> have

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
oh we got 500 5000 gonna say you have

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.540 
oh we got 500 5000 gonna say you have
lower<00:03:03.200> numbers<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.710> gonna<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.130> not<00:03:04.430> going

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
lower numbers it's gonna it's not going

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.830 
lower numbers it's gonna it's not going
to<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.760> much<00:03:05.000> of<00:03:05.120> an<00:03:05.180> effect<00:03:05.480> higher

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
to have that much of an effect higher

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.380 
to have that much of an effect higher
numbers<00:03:06.200> are<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.440> have<00:03:06.590> more<00:03:06.740> in<00:03:06.860> effect

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
numbers are going to have more in effect

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.420 
numbers are going to have more in effect
there<00:03:08.390> we<00:03:08.750> go<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:09.800> notice<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.190> way<00:03:10.310> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
there we go and you notice the way the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.880 
there we go and you notice the way the
point<00:03:10.640> force<00:03:10.940> goes<00:03:11.290> let's<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.440> preview<00:03:12.680> of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
point force goes let's do a preview of

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.620 
point force goes let's do a preview of
what<00:03:13.610> our<00:03:13.640> particles<00:03:14.120> will<00:03:14.210> look<00:03:14.330> like<00:03:14.450> in

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
what our particles will look like in

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.390 
what our particles will look like in
there<00:03:14.780> one<00:03:15.470> good<00:03:15.620> way<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.800> do<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.160> with

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
there one good way to do that is with

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.840 
there one good way to do that is with
your<00:03:19.210> draft<00:03:20.210> go<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.930> rendering<00:03:21.380> draft<00:03:21.980> let's

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
your draft go to rendering draft let's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.440 
your draft go to rendering draft let's
do<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> wireframe<00:03:23.270> render<00:03:25.330> make<00:03:26.330> sure

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
do a wireframe render make sure

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.300 
do a wireframe render make sure
and<00:03:28.830> check<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.860> notice<00:03:33.129> that<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
and check this out you notice that the

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.449 
and check this out you notice that the
particles<00:03:33.700> come<00:03:33.940> up<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.650> then<00:03:35.650> they<00:03:36.190> go<00:03:36.220> off

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
particles come up and then they go off

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.740 
particles come up and then they go off
camera<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.910> then<00:03:37.000> they<00:03:37.090> float<00:03:37.300> back<00:03:37.450> around

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
camera and then they float back around

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.000 
camera and then they float back around
we're<00:03:37.930> putting<00:03:38.140> back<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.470> frame<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.709> little

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
we're putting back and frame a little

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.300 
we're putting back and frame a little
bit<00:03:39.129> and<00:03:39.580> then<00:03:40.620> they<00:03:41.620> kind<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.920> spin<00:03:42.190> around

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
bit and then they kind of spin around

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.089 
bit and then they kind of spin around
until<00:03:42.550> they<00:03:42.849> get<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.269> middle<00:03:43.420> of<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:44.099> till

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
until they get to the middle of the till

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.729 
until they get to the middle of the till
they<00:03:45.190> get<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> middle<00:03:45.670> of<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.849> force

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
they get to the middle of the force

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.380 
they get to the middle of the force
that's<00:03:47.739> what<00:03:48.040> we<00:03:48.190> want<00:03:48.430> that's<00:03:48.849> exactly<00:03:49.000> what

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
that's what we want that's exactly what

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.229 
that's what we want that's exactly what
we<00:03:49.510> want<00:03:50.550> let's<00:03:51.550> go<00:03:51.640> ahead<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.819> get<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.030> little

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
we want let's go ahead and get a little

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.670 
we want let's go ahead and get a little
bit<00:03:52.330> more<00:03:52.540> of<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.690> bump<00:03:52.930> out<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.260> this<00:03:53.380> though

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
bit more of a bump out of this though

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.050 
bit more of a bump out of this though
let's<00:03:54.310> go<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.549> particle<00:03:54.910> emitter<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.830> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
let's go to the particle emitter and the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.690 
let's go to the particle emitter and the
velocity<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.450> at<00:03:58.780> 1125<00:03:59.560> let's<00:04:00.280> bump<00:04:00.489> that<00:04:00.670> up

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
velocity is at 1125 let's bump that up

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.630 
velocity is at 1125 let's bump that up
to<00:04:00.849> probably<00:04:02.459> 30<00:04:03.959> it's<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.019> nice<00:04:05.200> nice<00:04:06.190> roundish

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
to probably 30 it's a nice nice roundish

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.050 
to probably 30 it's a nice nice roundish
number

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.720 

and<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:11.930> particles<00:04:13.430> jump<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.489> little<00:04:14.580> higher

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
and the particles jump a little higher

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.689 
and the particles jump a little higher
level<00:04:15.180> let's<00:04:15.599> bump<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.900> up<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.019> 50

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:27.740 

bump<00:04:21.699> it<00:04:21.820> up<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> 30<00:04:22.289> what<00:04:23.289> happened

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.420 

there<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.800> particles<00:04:29.190> move<00:04:29.340> a

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
there you go and the particles move a

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.170 
there you go and the particles move a
little<00:04:29.580> higher

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.320 

may<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.750> have<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:36.050> bump<00:04:36.229> that<00:04:36.380> up<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.530> 50

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
may I have to bump that up to 50

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.430 
may I have to bump that up to 50
well<00:04:38.930> put<00:04:39.050> up<00:04:39.139> to<00:04:39.259> 50

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
well put up to 50

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.310 
well put up to 50
there<00:04:42.010> we<00:04:42.310> go<00:04:42.490> and<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:43.570> notice<00:04:43.720> if<00:04:44.020> you<00:04:44.080> have

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
there we go and you notice if you have

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.740 
there we go and you notice if you have
the<00:04:45.070> higher<00:04:45.250> your<00:04:45.460> number<00:04:45.790> higher<00:04:46.150> velocity

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
the higher your number higher velocity

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.120 
the higher your number higher velocity
number<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.110> higher<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.470> goes<00:04:47.620> before<00:04:47.890> the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
number the higher it goes before the

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.010 
number the higher it goes before the
force<00:04:48.580> takes<00:04:48.910> effect<00:04:49.600> let's<00:04:50.910> let's<00:04:52.020> check

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
force takes effect let's let's check

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.020 
force takes effect let's let's check
this<00:04:53.170> out

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.100 

frame<00:04:59.720> rendering<00:05:01.210> photorealistic<00:05:02.210> and

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.200 

insert<00:05:06.110> our<00:05:07.000> article

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
insert our article

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:26.900 
insert our article
what<00:05:09.630> we're<00:05:09.780> here<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:11.250> texture<00:05:12.180> map

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.080 

let's<00:05:27.540> see<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:27.750> we<00:05:27.810> got

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
let's see what we got

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.090 
let's see what we got
you<00:05:29.780> notice<00:05:30.020> how<00:05:30.139> the<00:05:30.199> particles<00:05:30.530> have<00:05:30.830> come

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
you notice how the particles have come

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.340 
you notice how the particles have come
out<00:05:31.280> shut<00:05:32.000> up<00:05:32.150> in<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.389> air<00:05:32.510> and<00:05:32.690> then<00:05:32.930> started

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
out shut up in the air and then started

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.890 
out shut up in the air and then started
their<00:05:33.470> turn<00:05:33.740> into<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:34.820> force<00:05:35.060> point<00:05:35.360> into<00:05:35.870> the

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
their turn into the force point into the

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.040 
their turn into the force point into the
point<00:05:35.990> for<00:05:36.440> us<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.740> I've<00:05:37.900> pre-rendered<00:05:38.900> a

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
point for us and I've pre-rendered a

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.420 
point for us and I've pre-rendered a
pre-rendered<00:05:39.910> this<00:05:40.910> scene<00:05:41.750> and<00:05:42.310> we're<00:05:43.310> going

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
pre-rendered this scene and we're going

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.390 
pre-rendered this scene and we're going
to<00:05:43.460> check<00:05:43.610> this<00:05:43.760> out

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.320 

it<00:05:47.910> goes<00:05:48.120> up<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.600> one<00:05:48.840> thing<00:05:49.169> too<00:05:49.380> is<00:05:50.210> when<00:05:51.210> you

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
it goes up and one thing too is when you

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.520 
it goes up and one thing too is when you
use<00:05:51.509> the<00:05:51.660> Force<00:05:51.900> mode<00:05:52.340> it<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:54.600> ground<00:05:54.930> becomes

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
use the Force mode it the ground becomes

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.029 
use the Force mode it the ground becomes
apparent<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.789> it<00:05:57.240> bounces<00:05:57.810> like<00:05:58.050> right<00:05:58.320> here

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
apparent the it bounces like right here

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.680 
apparent the it bounces like right here
and<00:06:00.620> so<00:06:01.620> just<00:06:02.280> be<00:06:02.880> aware<00:06:02.910> that<00:06:03.419> when<00:06:03.570> you're

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
and so just be aware that when you're

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.180 
and so just be aware that when you're
tweaking<00:06:03.990> your<00:06:04.020> stuff<00:06:04.320> just<00:06:04.560> make<00:06:05.009> sure<00:06:05.160> that

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
tweaking your stuff just make sure that

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.249 
tweaking your stuff just make sure that
you're<00:06:05.940> aware<00:06:05.970> that<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.479> ground<00:06:06.660> is<00:06:06.900> part<00:06:07.199> of

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
you're aware that the ground is part of

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.999 
you're aware that the ground is part of
your<00:06:07.320> scene<00:06:08.150> with<00:06:09.150> your<00:06:09.270> particles<00:06:09.630> anyway

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
your scene with your particles anyway

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:14.300 
your scene with your particles anyway
anyway<00:06:11.009> that's<00:06:11.880> how<00:06:12.000> you<00:06:12.060> do<00:06:12.240> that<00:06:13.130> that's<00:06:14.130> it

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
anyway that's how you do that that's it

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.430 
anyway that's how you do that that's it
for<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:14.550> time<00:06:14.759> I'm<00:06:15.120> quite<00:06:15.419> man<00:06:15.570> and<00:06:15.780> I'll

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
for this time I'm quite man and I'll

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.729
