00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.180
 This is great. 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.840
 Thank you for coming. 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.120
 This is amazing. 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.760
 This is great. 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.250
 How many of you know me from the TV series? 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.240
 Excellently. I want to let you know that it will not be like that. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.160
 It will be much worse. 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.080
 I feel bad about it, because many people will come here 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.300
 they will bring children ... 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
 "He will play Troy." 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.660
 And I: 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.000
 "Dicks!" 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.340
 "Let's go now." 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.739
 I can be disgusting at times and I know it's bad. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.860
 I did a half-hour special Comedy Central 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.149
 I got him by doing an hour in NY. 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.929
 I had my own hour. Comedy Central was there. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.460
 "We liked your hour." 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.260
 "Thanks." 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.560
 "We'll be happy to record you half an hour." 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.760
 "Great, happy to perform." 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.720
 "Great, but do not do anything from this hour." 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.680
 "It was disgusting, do not do it." 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 Have you heard about Spider-Man and that with me? 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.760
 For those who have some life. 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.740
 The point is that.. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.759
 They talked about the creation of Spider-Man on such a geek blog. 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.659
 That they make it from scratch. So maybe this new Spider-Man, 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.119
 that they do it so quickly after the previous one, 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.440
 that maybe they should do it differently. Darker, like "The Dark Knight", 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.159
 put in modern times. 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.159
 Maybe it does not even have to be white, maybe it will be black or Latinos or something like that. 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.100
 Someone has put my photo in the comments. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.840
 "Donald Glover can play Spider-Man." 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.080
 He is cheesy. 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.360
 I say: "Ok." 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.660
 Someone sent it to me, so I thought I would post it on Twitter. 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.660
 Donald on Spider-Man. We're going with it. 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.480
 A joke. But on the other hand, who would not want to be Spider-Man. That would be cool. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.800
 And then the world went crazy. 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.820
 Half of the world: "Donald on Spider-Man! 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.780
 I will watch him only if Donald plays Peter Parker. " 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.560
 Second half: 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.020
 "HE IS BLACK! KILL ME!" 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.754
 It was so fast. 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.319
 It was sick. Either for or against. 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.790
 I did not say anything during all this time, I did not do anything. 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.310
 I sat quietly, but read one comment: 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.270
 "Will we do a black Spider-Man now? 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.220
 This is what we will do? Will we do a black Spider-Man? 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.420
 Maybe let Michael Cera play Shaft? [role of Samuel L. Jackson] 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:43.529
 Translated by Crankees. 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.029
 I did not answer what I saw on the net. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.800
 Except for this. 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.120
 I wrote: 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.240
 ...Yes! 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020
 That would be fucking great. 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.880
 Jebany Michael Cera playing Shaft. 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 I would watch it every day. I would wash away. 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.440
 "Another one, please." 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.820
 I would do it everyday. 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.960
 Would not it be great watching the movie? ... 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.940
 "Hey, Shaft, how are you?" 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.380
 "Nothing interesting." 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.100
 "I was looking for whores." 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.656
 That would be great.
