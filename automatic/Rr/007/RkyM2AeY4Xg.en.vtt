hello I'm Buster from master tanning

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.400 
hello I'm Buster from master tanning
today<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.629> want<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> talk<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.319> about

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
today I want to talk to you about

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.589 
today I want to talk to you about
maintaining<00:00:07.919> your<00:00:08.099> tanning<00:00:08.550> bed<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.910> now

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
maintaining your tanning bed and now

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.780 
maintaining your tanning bed and now
let's<00:00:10.110> talk<00:00:10.260> about<00:00:10.440> how<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.740> change<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.460> choke

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
let's talk about how to change a choke

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.759 
let's talk about how to change a choke
ballast<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.420> choke<00:00:12.929> ballast<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.410> linear

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
ballast a choke ballast is a linear

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.400 
ballast a choke ballast is a linear
resistor<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.719> resistor<00:00:15.719> that's<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.139> line<00:00:16.379> with

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
resistor a resistor that's in line with

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.400 
resistor a resistor that's in line with
your<00:00:17.160> tanning<00:00:17.520> lamp<00:00:17.869> when<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> tanning<00:00:19.289> lamp

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
your tanning lamp when the tanning lamp

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.130 
your tanning lamp when the tanning lamp
fires<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.310> choke<00:00:20.730> ballast<00:00:21.119> drops<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
fires the choke ballast drops the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
fires the choke ballast drops the
voltage<00:00:22.500> which<00:00:22.680> means<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.430> your<00:00:23.730> thrust

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
voltage which means that now your thrust

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.089 
voltage which means that now your thrust
and<00:00:24.330> bulb<00:00:24.510> instead<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.900> running<00:00:25.140> at<00:00:25.230> 120<00:00:25.830> volts

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and bulb instead of running at 120 volts

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.689 
and bulb instead of running at 120 volts
runs<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.730> 74<00:00:27.269> volts<00:00:27.769> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.070> efficient

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
runs at 74 volts this is efficient

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.730 
runs at 74 volts this is efficient
fluorescent<00:00:30.390> bulbs<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.080> ran<00:00:31.410> much

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
fluorescent bulbs can be ran much

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.340 
fluorescent bulbs can be ran much
cheaper<00:00:32.160> than<00:00:32.189> incandescent<00:00:32.700> bulbs<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
cheaper than incandescent bulbs so the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.930 
cheaper than incandescent bulbs so the
choke<00:00:34.590> ballast<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.340> important<00:00:35.850> for

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
choke ballast is very important for

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.000 
choke ballast is very important for
running<00:00:36.090> your<00:00:36.300> tanning<00:00:36.630> bed<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.800> lights

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
running your tanning bed if your lights

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.970 
running your tanning bed if your lights
go<00:00:38.190> out<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.750> Chuck<00:00:39.960> ballast<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
go out it can be your Chuck ballast so

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.010 
go out it can be your Chuck ballast so
to<00:00:41.070> replace<00:00:41.370> your<00:00:41.579> choke<00:00:41.879> ballast<00:00:42.329> let<00:00:42.899> me

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
to replace your choke ballast let me

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
two screws on the timer if with a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.149 
two screws on the timer if with a
Phillips<00:01:13.020> screwdriver<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.619> ahead<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.860> remove

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Phillips screwdriver go ahead and remove

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.570 
Phillips screwdriver go ahead and remove

lift<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:25.320> gonna

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
lift it up a little bit you're gonna

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.080 
lift it up a little bit you're gonna
find<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> top<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.430> cover<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
find at the top the cover is going to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090
