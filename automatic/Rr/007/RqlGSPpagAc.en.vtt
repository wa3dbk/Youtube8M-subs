 muscle should be done exercises 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.330
 regular way however this is only 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.269
 half the way the other half is 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.809
 ideal foods for that purpose look at it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.090

 this mistake so common some people 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.550
 under the wrong argument is that 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.640
 If I eat more fat and I want 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.859
 muscles understand your point of view but 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 The idea is to know what to eat without falling 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 Overweight therefore to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.589

 foods

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.400
 the synthetic sugars this will come to you 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 very well when you have for example some 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 craving which you know will not turn out 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.360

 cereal will become oats combined 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.680
 this with the dried fruits so you do not get 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.640
