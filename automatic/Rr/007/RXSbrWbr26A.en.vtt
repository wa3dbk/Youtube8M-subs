that will fit inside of a basketball so

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.140 
that will fit inside of a basketball so
33<00:02:16.540> cubic<00:02:17.170> feet<00:02:17.410> is<00:02:17.680> huge<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.520> mean<00:02:18.670> these<00:02:18.820> bins

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
33 cubic feet is huge I mean these bins

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.510 
33 cubic feet is huge I mean these bins
are<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.570> deep<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.680> newer<00:02:20.830> refrigerators
