00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.430
 hi to all so for since yesterday we have a little over 2000 on a 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.379
 drawing so I thank you for being more and more numerous at age 28 sincerely 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.020
 obviously very happy% I still wait for the video of the guarantor 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.809
 responds to do a little bit of news crisis announcements that I would like 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:15.929
 implement 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.319
 today we leave on a year earlier from on the mouth all eyes section 

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:23.509
 title you know so we do not waste time this article to your pencils 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.230
 to first explain a little bit how it goes at the level of 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.230
 mouth is like we are in place 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 and the chin 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 which means that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.610
 but we will have something pretty much 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 more fully ready 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 about 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.950
 I am no longer minister 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.250
 good I know it's not back that say mac but it's not serious 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.650
 and in fact 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.650
 the first third 5 meters 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.670
 but how is it built 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 we are entitled 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.890
 the most hits 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.970
 and you will have to see 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.790
 the lower lip which is marked in December by the judges according to me I 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 think 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.720
 I'm going to play because I'm a socio I often see on descents that 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.719
 can be read at sad lily 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.730
 stand out and lip completely 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.630
 it's up to them 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.660
 we encourage those who are worn out to reproduce them undoing doors 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.660
 terraces 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.449
 at the rochelle 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:22.959
 simply to evoke monaco trying to learn more about the title 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.189
 Who is here 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:25.359
 and 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.729
 eventually 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.729
 his employee 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.659
 it saves you from having a weird pound to eat 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 very cartoon 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:42.679
 a little more precisely 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.009
 then laid down his basic lips 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.769
 tactically see what happens 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.769
 constructed for example 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.180
 it's great the cena stickers 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.180
 so this shows that I see 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:04.149
 if we make a square mouth 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.519
 l unless you have a very particular style it does not work and when that 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.589
 not walk too much 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.339
 so I really encourage you as we do a left 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:15.339
 she super flexible at the level of buildings 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.669
 to make him smile 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.639
 the title is garnering why not theirs deal with too many 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.729
 on some serious stuff this wall is realistic 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.500
 it is marked when 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.979
 we wish 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.979
 which is quickly done 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.609
 and especially we 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.659
 we laugh or 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.659
 we laugh and so on 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.009
 we are dealing here 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.009
 after two decades 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.100
 and after in this series it's a little bit what I wanted to say knowing 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.529
 that after the gaping mouths 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.929
 its quintessence of varied outlets and millions to see the shutters 

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:45.150
 higher or lower more or less expensive sector 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.370
 so that's also up to you to see and then depending on the type where the voice 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.050
 fine mouth any simple 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.039
 it's a bit of a goal 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.680
 so the mouth 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.210
 I feel a little too close to the nose you have right now it's this 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.210
 we know we really want 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.770
 so as I told you 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.029
 what is our team 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:39.129
 according to a style that make her mouth a little more a little bit more 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 it's all after its release 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.680
 even to draw to make your own choices of this order 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 for the day after tomorrow and if the film hostile studies 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
 mark commission 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.569
 here is a butcher's shop a smoker's house that smiles for example 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:23.069
 the carved 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.919
 but in the long run 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:31.749
 the lower lip can be divided 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.690
 to test 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.729
 a lot of different mud and that 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.520
 it's a small calculation of the rate of 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.310
 high school on the mouth for pros and cons 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.559
 I could also avoid doing a little bit older 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.559
 to complete his desires 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.319
 take care to walk around
