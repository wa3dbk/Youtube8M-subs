00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.910
 one of the most normal corrections that 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.330
 let's do in a photograph always 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.880
 is going to be the contrast correction this 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.490
 can be generated through a layer of 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.080
 levels or a layer of curves 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.360
 let's use the one with which 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.160
 we are more comfortable to 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.079
 the time to work and the one that 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.300
 let's understand better what is their 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.610
 operation in this particular case 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.730
 I'm going to first use one of levels and 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.219
 then I will use one of curves what 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.100
 interesting is always making steps 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.440
 short that is to say do not try to recover 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.019
 all the information that we want in a 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.749
 only step since we 're going to burn a lot 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.809
 the image and we will have less control 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:52.420
 if we work with zones and with 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.149
 very small movements we will 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.429
 allow to adjust much better the 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.710
 corrections we want to make as 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.780
 we are seeing this type of correction 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.300
 yes, it is worth to me for everything 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.870
 except for this area here that if 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.020
 you see he 's drawing a lot 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.850
 I will now be able to recover part of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.530
 that zone simply to the general layer 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.050
 of adjustment as we see it generates me a 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.990
 layer mask I'm going to take the brush 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.870
 let's switch with the frontals by 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.240
 background color with the x key we are going to 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.330
 make a smaller size a hardness 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.750
 0% an opacity of 100% and a flow 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.330
 05 and in this way I will be able to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.790
 that area recover the information 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.400
 original since that way it is pasted 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.650
 much less than what was the rest of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.040
 the information is thus correct and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.890
 now I could generate a second layer in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.410
 this case of levels to work a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.600
 little more everything what would be the area of 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.700
 contrast occurs the same here is it 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.910
 burning a lot that area with which with 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 the brush we would discover that area for 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.490
 do not burn it so much 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.920
 in this way we have quickly departed 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.619
 from that original that already had a quality 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.259
 quite optimal in the conversion to this 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.560
 another that has a much wider range 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.410
 and it has a much more defined contrast 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.380
 we will also be able to read 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.200
 of different photography to center 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.680
 the vision in certain areas of 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.239
 our image removing or increasing 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.319
 importance in certain areas 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:34.010
 If I deactivate, we see that here 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.130
 too much light we can burn a bit that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.410
 zone darken more that area to make 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.299
 that the vision goes to another place or in 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.819
 this case in particular to me that vision 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.130
 go that site does not bother me because the 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.470
 second shot of vision will always be 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 this darker object that we have in 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.420
 close-up with which the reading of 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.030
 the image would be this area and then it's 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.280
 we have to interpret that in each 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.280
 photography that we are retouching
