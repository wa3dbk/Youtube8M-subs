it looks closely this is the natural
everyday<00:03:33.690> makeup<00:03:34.020> versus<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.830> one<00:03:35.100> be<00:03:36.110> very

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
everyday makeup versus this one be very

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.430

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.310 

you

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.290 

so<00:03:58.320> things<00:03:58.650> differently<00:03:59.130> stronger<00:03:59.820> ones<00:04:00.000> are

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
so things differently stronger ones are

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.450 
so things differently stronger ones are
i<00:04:00.480> noticed<00:04:01.320> when<00:04:01.440> i<00:04:01.500> use<00:04:01.740> them<00:04:01.950> they're<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.160> bit

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
i noticed when i use them they're a bit

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.290 
i noticed when i use them they're a bit
thicker<00:04:03.120> um<00:04:03.990> they<00:04:04.710> are<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.890> bit<00:04:05.040> more<00:04:05.300> harder

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
thicker um they are a bit more harder

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.670 
thicker um they are a bit more harder
than<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.690> last<00:04:06.930> one<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.230> i<00:04:07.410> was<00:04:07.530> talking

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
than the last one that i was talking

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.400 
than the last one that i was talking
about<00:04:07.950> which<00:04:08.550> is<00:04:08.700> very<00:04:08.940> understandable<00:04:09.660> i<00:04:09.870> was

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
about which is very understandable i was

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
about which is very understandable i was
expecting<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:11.220> shorter<00:04:11.790> area<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.270> lash

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
expecting the shorter area of the lash

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.180 
expecting the shorter area of the lash
to<00:04:12.660> be<00:04:12.780> longer<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.530> wasn't<00:04:13.800> long<00:04:13.890> enough

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
to be longer but it wasn't long enough

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.950 
to be longer but it wasn't long enough
because<00:04:14.520> this<00:04:14.670> was<00:04:14.880> uber<00:04:15.150> long<00:04:15.420> it's<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.720> an

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
because this was uber long it's like an

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.420 
because this was uber long it's like an
8<00:04:16.320> mm<00:04:16.620> versus<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.510> 11<00:04:18.510> mm<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.620> 11<00:04:19.890> mm<00:04:20.190> stood

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
8 mm versus a 11 mm so the 11 mm stood

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.870 
8 mm versus a 11 mm so the 11 mm stood
out<00:04:20.580> both<00:04:20.790> 8mm<00:04:21.360> got<00:04:21.720> blended<00:04:22.110> into<00:04:22.260> well<00:04:22.880> but

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
out both 8mm got blended into well but

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.910
