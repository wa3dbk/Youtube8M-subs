00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and hi to all and alex and welcome to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.500
 body times today I'm going to you 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.910
 explain the best time for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.910
 to train in bodybuilding 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.610
 so that's really i answered several 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.080
 times in other videos but there I have 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.360
 decided to devote a video 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.220
 entirely to that because it's a 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.570
 recurring question that comes up 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
 all the time and people do not understand 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.230
 not really why so I you 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.210
 explain and tell you the moments where 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.309
 you do not have to train and at the end and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.599
 well you will be the best time for 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.590
 to train one often sees in the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.750
 comments from people who say yes 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.760
 it's good training early in the morning 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.550
 I train in the morning fasting before 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.920
 the breakfast to retype in the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.240
 grain all that so we do not recommend 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.739
 to do that anyway if he did not want to 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:53.390
 finish like that so that's it indeed 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.579
 you see that practicing at 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.480
 fasting makes it very weak and you risk 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.670
 hypoglycemia 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.739
 so I think it's not really 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.630
 profitable then there are people who 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.640
 think it's good to train 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.439
 immediately after eating to eliminate 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.210
 a little bit the calories they 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.759
 have just been eating so it does not work 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.070
 like that already digest it going you 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.600
 to consume energy 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.010
 you are going less well at 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.479
 the training you be more tired 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.950
 because you are in digestion is 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.790
 less concentrated and it can give 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.790
 precisely that 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.350
 I 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.929
 here I advise you also of you 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 train between 18 and 20 hours 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.439
 why because that's where really 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 gyms have an influence 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.979
 high but safe if you train at 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.390
 you have no worries but if you are 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.829
 a sports bag between 18 and 20 hours 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.319
 it's a lot of people in the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.819
 room so the machines are taken and 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.130
 bombshell if we have a program to respect 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.780
 with specific rest times that we are going 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.039
 talent of the goals it's not the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.439
 better way because you risk 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:04.069
 to get to the exercise fell there 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:04.069
 above we advance any estimated expectation 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.450
 of course also if possible do not go 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 train late at night 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.890
 why because you are going to be 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.810
 excited a little bit after the workout 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.370
 and you are going to have trouble 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.200
 to fall asleep right away it's complicated 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.220
 to make an intense effort is to go 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.930
 to lie down immediately behind 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.440
 otherwise of course you will end as 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.440
 that in the nose 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.849
 and of course now that we have seen the 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.349
 moments to avoid 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.120
 to train well I'll tell you 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.010
 that for me only in any case the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.730
 best time to train is 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.440
 about 1h30 2h after a meal to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.379
 not be too bloated to no longer be 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.000
 in digestion of course if possible of 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.519
 three hours before sleeping for no 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.440
 to be able to fall asleep and the top 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.090
 of the best is to train just before 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.560
 a meal why because you go 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.750
 open a metabolic window 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.269
 so to make it very simple you're going 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.400
 gain more muscle and lose more 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.720
 fat whether it's for men or for 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.049
 women is exactly the same 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.450
 thing 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.859
 the best time is just before a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.670
 meal so you train yourself eating 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.730
 immediately behind 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.400
 and you are of course sure that all the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.480
 world will not be able to respect the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.019
 instructions that I just gave in 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.549
 this video 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.170
 maybe you're not going to be you're 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.090
 obliged to train you very early on 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.280
 morning or late at night we that we 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.930
 arrives with pj to train at ten on 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.220
 Outside the night because we had not the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.780
 choice if you do not have a choice bah 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.519
 you will still be training 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.260
 not because it's a bad moment of 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
 the day in quotation marks that must be 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.160
 not train the contrary there 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.290
 no excuses it's really just so 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.329
 you want optimized and ben me was this 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.579
 workout really place the de 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.720
 most judicious way possible brief 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.400
 I think we went all the way 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.630
 case on this topic and we pass everything from 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.859
 following the questions and answers 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.989
