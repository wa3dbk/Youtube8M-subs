that i've been working on a lot that
i've<00:00:27.150> played<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.599> about<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.439> 20

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.679 
i've played I think about for about 20
games<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.640> all<00:00:29.820> three<00:00:29.849> matchups<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
games or so in all three matchups and

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.229 
games or so in all three matchups and
especially<00:00:31.260> vs<00:00:31.800> terran<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> vs<00:00:32.640> protoss<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
especially vs terran and vs protoss this

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.690 
especially vs terran and vs protoss this
is<00:00:33.390> almost<00:00:33.840> guaranteed<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> win<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.219> your

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
is almost guaranteed to be a win if your

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
is almost guaranteed to be a win if your
opponent<00:00:36.180> has<00:00:36.300> not<00:00:36.510> seen<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.960> before<00:00:37.020> now

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bunch of command centers as well I

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.840 
bunch of command centers as well I
believe<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.920> opens<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.280> triple<00:01:02.579> command

important<00:01:13.409> thing<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.680> note<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> game<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
important thing to note in this game is

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
important thing to note in this game is
that<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:15.180> scouts<00:01:15.509> what<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> am<00:01:16.020> doing<00:01:16.259> perfectly

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that he scouts what I am doing perfectly

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 
that he scouts what I am doing perfectly
so<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> reason<00:01:18.479> why<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> decided<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
so that's the reason why I decided to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.270 
so that's the reason why I decided to
pick<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> game<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:19.950> that's<00:01:20.130> actually

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
pick this game the one that's actually

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.490 
pick this game the one that's actually
before<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.030> patch<00:01:21.240> because<00:01:22.110> he<00:01:22.290> knows

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
before the patch because he knows

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
before the patch because he knows
exactly<00:01:22.710> what's<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.390> what's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
exactly what's gonna go like what's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020 
exactly what's gonna go like what's
gonna<00:01:24.750> happen<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:25.920> already<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> too<00:01:26.759> late

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
gonna happen but he already is too late

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
gonna happen but he already is too late
at<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> point<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.810> especially<00:01:28.080> terran<00:01:28.619> if

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
at that point and especially terran if

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.859 
at that point and especially terran if
they<00:01:28.920> don't<00:01:29.189> open<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:29.850> siege<00:01:30.150> tanks<00:01:30.600> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
they don't open up with siege tanks it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
they don't open up with siege tanks it
is<00:01:31.320> pretty<00:01:31.560> much<00:01:31.770> game<00:01:31.979> over<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.729> only

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
is pretty much game over the only

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.179 
is pretty much game over the only
counter<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.720> seen<00:01:34.020> properly<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
counter that I have seen properly is

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.530 
counter that I have seen properly is
that<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.460> already<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.450> like

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that they already are going for like

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
that they already are going for like
siege<00:01:36.780> tank<00:01:37.049> drops<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> couple

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
siege tank drops that have like a couple

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
siege tank drops that have like a couple
of<00:01:38.460> Queens<00:01:38.790> or<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> couple<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.479> siege<00:01:39.900> tanks<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
of Queens or a couple of siege tanks in

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
of Queens or a couple of siege tanks in
the<00:01:40.409> main<00:01:40.560> base<00:01:40.740> ready<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.549> immediately<00:01:42.420> shoot

the main base ready to immediately shoot

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.770 
the main base ready to immediately shoot
down<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:44.009> nidus<00:01:44.430> network<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.600> did

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
down the nidus network now what did

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.420 
down the nidus network now what did
change<00:01:45.960> about<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> night<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.950> legacy<00:01:47.369> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
change about the night is in legacy of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
change about the night is in legacy of
the<00:01:47.579> void<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.329> basically<00:01:48.810> cannot<00:01:49.259> attack<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the void you basically cannot attack the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
the void you basically cannot attack the
nidus<00:01:50.159> while<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.790> still<00:01:50.909> building<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.960> what

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
nidus while it is still building so what

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.740 
nidus while it is still building so what
happens<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.820> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.119> still<00:01:54.299> support<00:01:54.479> or

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
happens is that you can still support or

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
happens is that you can still support or
deny<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:55.530> come<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
deny this is gonna come up but the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.190 
deny this is gonna come up but the
opponent<00:01:56.640> cannot<00:01:56.969> attack<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.509> until<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
opponent cannot attack it until the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.539 
opponent cannot attack it until the
night<00:01:58.380> blue<00:01:58.560> tonightís<00:01:58.920> network<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> actually

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
night blue tonightís network is actually

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
night blue tonightís network is actually
completely<00:02:00.149> deployed<00:02:00.570> when<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.259> take<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> look

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
completely deployed when we take a look

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
completely deployed when we take a look
for<00:02:01.740> example<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.310> heart<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> swarm<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
for example at heart of the swarm you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.459 
for example at heart of the swarm you
can't<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.509> sort<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.659> attack<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> thing<00:02:04.320> with

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
can't just sort of attack the thing with

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.649 
can't just sort of attack the thing with
workers<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.280> still<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.610> down<00:02:05.659> but

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
workers and it will still go down but

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.880 
workers and it will still go down but
here's<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> idea<00:02:07.229> basically<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.770> we're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
here's the idea basically what we're

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.949 
here's the idea basically what we're
gonna<00:02:07.979> go<00:02:08.160> for<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.000> Queens<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.569> ideally

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
gonna go for is for Queens and ideally

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.350 
gonna go for is for Queens and ideally
more<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.160> save<00:02:11.400> up<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.700> lot<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.940> energy<00:02:12.330> on

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
more and we save up a lot of energy on

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.760 
more and we save up a lot of energy on
those<00:02:12.690> Queens<00:02:12.959> now<00:02:13.230> what<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.500> put

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
those Queens now what you put

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.740 
those Queens now what you put
-<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> Niners<00:02:14.340> Network<00:02:14.640> first<00:02:15.000> we'll<00:02:15.570> also

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
- a Niners Network first we'll also

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.080 
- a Niners Network first we'll also
actually<00:02:16.080> pop<00:02:16.470> out<00:02:16.650> first<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.640> what<00:02:17.790> happens

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
actually pop out first so what happens

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.340 
actually pop out first so what happens
is<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.780> very<00:02:19.020> powerful

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
is that you have this very powerful

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.470 
is that you have this very powerful
timely<00:02:19.980> attack<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.790> where<00:02:21.360> you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
timely attack that you can do where you

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.910 
timely attack that you can do where you
know<00:02:21.630> for<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> fact<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.350> transfuse

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
know for a fact that the transfuse

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.190 
know for a fact that the transfuse
energy<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.760> Queens<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.240> gonna<00:02:24.570> be<00:02:24.780> right

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
energy on the Queens is gonna be right

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.540 
energy on the Queens is gonna be right
there<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.890> that's<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> idea<00:02:26.220> we're<00:02:26.460> gonna

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
there so that's the idea we're gonna

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.370 
there so that's the idea we're gonna
make<00:02:26.730> as<00:02:26.850> many<00:02:27.000> Queens<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.450> possible<00:02:27.930> we're

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
make as many Queens as possible we're

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.590 
make as many Queens as possible we're
gonna<00:02:28.560> make<00:02:28.770> four<00:02:29.670> gases<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.150> well<00:02:30.300> so<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.570> can

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
gonna make four gases as well so we can

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.120 
gonna make four gases as well so we can
adults<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.140> Revengers<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.800> maybe<00:02:31.920> with<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
adults on Revengers and maybe with the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.500 
adults on Revengers and maybe with the
new<00:02:32.220> patch<00:02:32.460> that<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.760> not<00:02:32.910> gonna<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:33.360> most

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
new patch that is not gonna be the most

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.330 
new patch that is not gonna be the most
ideal<00:02:33.720> way<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.080> doing<00:02:34.440> this<00:02:34.590> I'm<00:02:35.310> not

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
ideal way of doing this I'm not

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.520 
ideal way of doing this I'm not
completely<00:02:35.760> sure<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.810> please<00:02:37.050> note<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.380> this

start up all the gases right now at the
same<00:03:06.270> time<00:03:06.330> which<00:03:06.750> allows<00:03:06.870> me<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.230> actually

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
same time which allows me to actually

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.070 
same time which allows me to actually

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
start up to layer relatively early but

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.540 
start up to layer relatively early but
still<00:03:10.290> be<00:03:10.410> at<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> point<00:03:10.800> where<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.250> squeeze

revered<00:03:15.210> years<00:03:15.390> did<00:03:15.570> get<00:03:15.720> nerfed<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> fact

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
revered years did get nerfed in the fact

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.110 
revered years did get nerfed in the fact
that<00:03:16.470> they<00:03:16.680> will<00:03:17.010> now<00:03:17.130> do<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.370> little<00:03:17.640> bit<00:03:17.910> they

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
that they will now do a little bit they

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.700 
that they will now do a little bit they
have<00:03:18.240> knock<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.630> little<00:03:18.930> bit<00:03:19.050> less<00:03:19.230> range<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
have knock a little bit less range and

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.960 
have knock a little bit less range and
they're<00:03:19.800> still<00:03:19.980> just<00:03:20.010> as<00:03:20.310> expensive<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:20.850> if

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
they're still just as expensive and if

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.120 
they're still just as expensive and if
just<00:03:21.090> not<00:03:21.270> as<00:03:21.390> great<00:03:21.540> anymore<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:22.890> while<00:03:23.100> I

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
just not as great anymore so while I

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.620 
just not as great anymore so while I
haven't<00:03:23.340> tried<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.760> yet<00:03:23.820> what<00:03:24.150> I'm<00:03:24.270> thinking

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
haven't tried this yet what I'm thinking

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.240 
haven't tried this yet what I'm thinking
about<00:03:24.720> what<00:03:25.320> is<00:03:25.410> probably<00:03:25.650> gonna<00:03:25.770> be<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.070> best

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
about what is probably gonna be the best

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.430 
about what is probably gonna be the best
option<00:03:26.460> right<00:03:26.820> now<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.570> go<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.080> burrowed

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
option right now is to go for burrowed

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.310 
option right now is to go for burrowed
roaches<00:03:28.890> instead<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:30.270> roaches<00:03:30.750> with<00:03:30.930> glory

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
roaches instead so roaches with glory

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.900 
roaches instead so roaches with glory

this build anyway but maybe we should

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.110 
this build anyway but maybe we should
just<00:03:34.890> go<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.070> little<00:03:35.190> bit<00:03:35.490> heavy<00:03:35.670> into<00:03:36.090> the

strategy and this is one of them now I
did<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:00.990> build<00:04:01.230> I<00:04:01.320> believe<00:04:01.530> for<00:04:01.650> about<00:04:01.800> three

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
did this build I believe for about three

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.460 
did this build I believe for about three
or<00:04:02.160> four<00:04:02.370> games<00:04:02.520> in<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.820> row<00:04:02.850> versus<00:04:03.390> him<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.750> he

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
or four games in a row versus him and he

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.920

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
died - in a couple times however once he

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.510 
died - in a couple times however once he
realized<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.560> was<00:04:07.770> going<00:04:08.010> for<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.280> build

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520

he's<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.760> Protoss<00:04:12.090> player<00:04:12.270> but<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.350> one<00:04:13.530> way<00:04:13.680> he

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
he's a Protoss player but the one way he

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.280 
he's a Protoss player but the one way he
countered<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.520> was<00:04:15.150> by<00:04:15.450> seeing<00:04:15.870> were<00:04:15.990> denied

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
countered it was by seeing were denied

countered it was by seeing were denied
as<00:04:16.440> was<00:04:16.590> gonna<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.920> deployed<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.549> then

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
as was gonna be deployed and then

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.910 
as was gonna be deployed and then
immediately<00:04:18.350> canceling<00:04:19.350> whatever<00:04:19.650> he<00:04:19.770> was

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
immediately canceling whatever he was

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.740 
immediately canceling whatever he was
doing<00:04:19.950> cancelling<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.820> Nexus<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.299> putting

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
doing cancelling the Nexus and putting

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.630 
doing cancelling the Nexus and putting
down<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.049> six<00:04:22.410> canons<00:04:22.800> right<00:04:23.070> around<00:04:23.370> the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
down like six canons right around the

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.250 
down like six canons right around the
nidus<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.270> seems<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.780> really<00:04:25.080> the

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
nidus and that seems to be really the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.800 
nidus and that seems to be really the
only<00:04:25.410> way<00:04:25.590> he<00:04:25.740> could<00:04:25.979> deal<00:04:26.160> with<00:04:26.310> it

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
only way he could deal with it

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.750 
only way he could deal with it
the<00:04:27.140> idea<00:04:27.410> obviously<00:04:27.590> is<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.430> you<00:04:28.520> killed

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
the idea obviously is is that you killed

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.910 
the idea obviously is is that you killed
a<00:04:28.940> nighters<00:04:29.330> worm<00:04:29.540> before<00:04:30.380> he<00:04:30.590> can<00:04:30.740> actually

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
a nighters worm before he can actually

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.310 
a nighters worm before he can actually
throw<00:04:31.400> or<00:04:32.390> before<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.750> can<00:04:32.930> actually<00:04:33.020> get<00:04:33.260> my

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
throw or before I can actually get my

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.870 
throw or before I can actually get my
Queens<00:04:33.680> out<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.010> transfuse<00:04:34.430> in<00:04:34.550> time<00:04:34.730> so

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
Queens out and transfuse in time so

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.000 
Queens out and transfuse in time so
there's<00:04:35.060> one<00:04:35.270> one<00:04:35.870> really<00:04:36.140> risky<00:04:36.470> moment<00:04:36.830> with

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
there's one one really risky moment with

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.680 
there's one one really risky moment with
this<00:04:37.160> built<00:04:37.460> where<00:04:37.940> you<00:04:38.060> need<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.510> click

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
this built where you need to click

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.290 
this built where you need to click
incredibly<00:04:39.470> fast<00:04:39.710> because<00:04:40.670> basically<00:04:40.940> you

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
incredibly fast because basically you

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.090 
incredibly fast because basically you
cannot<00:04:41.540> actually<00:04:42.170> like<00:04:42.350> click<00:04:42.620> on<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:42.830> nidus

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
cannot actually like click on the nidus

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.860 
cannot actually like click on the nidus

now<00:07:04.259> I<00:07:04.289> do<00:07:04.469> think<00:07:04.529> there<00:07:04.860> is<00:07:04.949> still<00:07:05.099> a<00:07:05.159> bit<00:07:05.400> of

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
now I do think there is still a bit of

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.999 
now I do think there is still a bit of
room<00:07:05.759> for<00:07:05.789> improvement<00:07:06.319> maybe<00:07:07.319> I<00:07:07.439> could<00:07:07.740> try

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:08.009 
room for improvement maybe I could try

00:07:08.009 --> 00:07:09.860 
room for improvement maybe I could try
and<00:07:08.249> squeeze<00:07:08.580> out<00:07:08.759> like<00:07:08.969> a<00:07:08.999> third<00:07:09.360> hatchery

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
and squeeze out like a third hatchery

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.420 
and squeeze out like a third hatchery
and<00:07:09.930> just<00:07:10.259> skip<00:07:10.469> out<00:07:10.590> on<00:07:10.650> injects<00:07:11.310> all

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
and just skip out on injects all

because the refuge's did get nerfed
pretty<00:07:19.979> hard<00:07:20.189> but<00:07:20.879> I've<00:07:20.969> also<00:07:21.090> been<00:07:21.210> thinking

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:21.449 
pretty hard but I've also been thinking

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:23.390 
pretty hard but I've also been thinking
about<00:07:21.719> maybe<00:07:21.990> incorporating<00:07:22.740> this<00:07:22.860> built<00:07:23.159> off

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
about maybe incorporating this built off

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.519 
about maybe incorporating this built off
of<00:07:23.430> three<00:07:23.819> bases<00:07:24.300> and<00:07:24.479> go<00:07:24.900> from<00:07:25.080> lurkers

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:25.529 
of three bases and go from lurkers

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:26.959 
of three bases and go from lurkers
instead<00:07:25.889> I<00:07:25.919> mean<00:07:26.159> what<00:07:26.279> would<00:07:26.430> he<00:07:26.520> do<00:07:26.639> against

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:26.969 
instead I mean what would he do against

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:28.429 
instead I mean what would he do against
lurkers<00:07:27.330> if<00:07:27.479> there's<00:07:27.659> a<00:07:27.719> couple<00:07:27.900> orcas<00:07:28.319> like

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:28.439 
lurkers if there's a couple orcas like

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:31.040 
lurkers if there's a couple orcas like
three<00:07:28.620> minutes<00:07:28.770> later<00:07:29.039> into<00:07:29.370> the<00:07:29.460> game<00:07:30.050> it's

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
three minutes later into the game it's
