most of our power usage around these

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.450 
most of our power usage around these
times<00:00:32.390> went<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.630> local<00:00:33.870> battery<00:00:34.440> shop<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
times went to the local battery shop and

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400 
times went to the local battery shop and
they<00:00:35.610> service<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.329> golf<00:00:36.690> carts<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
local area they said the very best

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.950 
local area they said the very best
batteries<00:00:40.620> they've<00:00:40.890> got<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.969> continuous<00:00:42.629> use

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
our trojan t105 switch they put in their

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
our trojan t105 switch they put in their
golf<00:00:46.500> cars<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.730> they<00:00:47.850> said<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.210> were<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
golf cars and they said they were the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
golf cars and they said they were the
best<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.170> market<00:00:49.370> they<00:00:50.370> tried<00:00:50.730> others<00:00:51.120> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
best on the market they tried others but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.090 
best on the market they tried others but
they've<00:00:51.570> always<00:00:51.780> gone<00:00:52.050> back<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> Trojans

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
they've always gone back to the Trojans

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.400 
they've always gone back to the Trojans
so<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> decided<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.629> give<00:00:54.930> those<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> whirl<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
so I decided that I give those a whirl I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.560 
so I decided that I give those a whirl I
got<00:00:58.410> really<00:00:58.680> lucky<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.820> somebody<00:01:00.359> who

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
got really lucky and I know somebody who

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
got really lucky and I know somebody who
was<00:01:00.690> getting<00:01:00.840> rid<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.530> battery<00:01:01.920> storage

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
was getting rid of the battery storage

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
was getting rid of the battery storage
unit<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> stand<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.589> putting

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
unit which is a stand for putting

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.030 
unit which is a stand for putting
batteries<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.180> connect<00:01:06.570> to

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
batteries in to connect to

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.990 
batteries in to connect to
uninterruptible<00:01:08.040> power<00:01:08.070> supplies<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
uninterruptible power supplies and the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.940 
uninterruptible power supplies and the
like<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> stand<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.600> inexpensive<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.619> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like the stand was inexpensive and I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.910 
like the stand was inexpensive and I
just<00:01:14.189> had<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.460> piece<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.909> together

haven't<00:02:24.959> had<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> chance<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.739> make<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> frames

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
haven't had a chance to make the frames

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.850 
haven't had a chance to make the frames
to<00:02:26.760> point<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.090> solar<00:02:27.330> panels<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.110> Sun<00:02:28.350> so

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
to point the solar panels at the Sun so

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.289 
to point the solar panels at the Sun so
I'd<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.640> done<00:02:29.880> as<00:02:30.000> soon<00:02:30.060> as

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
I'd like to get this done as soon as

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.410 
I'd like to get this done as soon as
possible<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.989> was<00:02:31.769> told<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.700> wet<00:02:32.940> lead

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
possible I was told that the wet lead

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.930 
possible I was told that the wet lead
acid<00:02:33.810> batteries<00:02:34.349> last<00:02:35.099> longer<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.730> give

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
acid batteries last longer and give

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.610 
acid batteries last longer and give
better<00:02:36.180> performance<00:02:36.870> than<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.290> sealed

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
better performance than the sealed

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.759 
better performance than the sealed
batteries<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.030> why<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.239> chose<00:02:39.630> them<00:02:39.900> so<00:02:40.739> I

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
batteries this is why I chose them so I

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.190 
batteries this is why I chose them so I
need<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.310> some<00:02:41.519> maintenance<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:43.019> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
need to do some maintenance I have to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.810 
need to do some maintenance I have to
keep<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.500> batteries<00:02:43.920> topped<00:02:44.250> up<00:02:44.459> all<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
keep the batteries topped up all the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.840 
keep the batteries topped up all the
time<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.410> purchased<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.590> Trojan<00:02:47.100> hydro<00:02:47.670> link

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
time I purchased the Trojan hydro link

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.300 
time I purchased the Trojan hydro link
system<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:49.049> allows<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.769> keep<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
system this allows you to keep the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.460 
system this allows you to keep the
batteries<00:02:50.730> topped<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.359> from<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.049> central

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
batteries topped up from a central

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.390 
batteries topped up from a central
filling<00:02:52.829> point

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
filling point

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.030 
filling point
this<00:02:54.299> makes<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.780> maintenance<00:02:55.230> easier<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this makes the maintenance easier and

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
this makes the maintenance easier and
there<00:02:56.370> are<00:02:56.459> indicators<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.390> tops<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:58.140> show

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
there are indicators on the tops to show

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.920 
there are indicators on the tops to show
you<00:02:58.680> when<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.070> needs<00:02:59.100> doing<00:02:59.700> if<00:03:00.570> you're

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
you when it needs doing if you're
