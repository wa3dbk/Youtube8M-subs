because these guys are self fertile I

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.390 
because these guys are self fertile I
can<00:02:58.349> actually<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.709> around<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.040> do<00:02:59.129> my<00:02:59.280> own

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
can actually go around and do my own

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.699 
can actually go around and do my own
pollinating<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.299> these<00:03:00.510> but<00:03:01.200> most<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.530> your

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
pollinating on these but most of your

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.879 
pollinating on these but most of your
apples<00:03:02.209> they<00:03:03.209> need<00:03:03.560> cross-pollination<00:03:04.560> with

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
apples they need cross-pollination with

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.009 
apples they need cross-pollination with
two<00:03:05.069> different<00:03:05.219> varieties<00:03:05.939> like<00:03:06.209> one<00:03:06.780> variety

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
two different varieties like one variety

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.490 
two different varieties like one variety
pollinating<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.889> other<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.849> so<00:03:09.719> I<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.349> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
pollinating the other and so I have to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.530 
pollinating the other and so I have to
go<00:03:10.650> around<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.310> go<00:03:11.549> from<00:03:11.700> each<00:03:11.909> tree<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.419> just

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
go around and go from each tree and just

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.909 
go around and go from each tree and just
keep<00:03:12.719> going<00:03:12.870> around<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.439> around<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.799> around

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
keep going around and around and around

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.679 
keep going around and around and around
until<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.459> until<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.000> feel<00:03:15.180> I've<00:03:15.329> got<00:03:15.540> enough

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
until I until I feel I've got enough

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.960 
until I until I feel I've got enough
pollination<00:03:16.319> going<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.799> but<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.639> a<00:03:17.669> lot<00:03:17.879> of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
pollination going on but I do a lot of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.939 
pollination going on but I do a lot of
it<00:03:18.060> with<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.919> fine<00:03:20.359> fine<00:03:21.359> paint<00:03:21.949> fine

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.330 
it with just a fine fine paint fine
paintbrush<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.970> one<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:25.159> just<00:03:26.159> go

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
paintbrush like this one I just go

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.770 
paintbrush like this one I just go
around<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:27.799> keep<00:03:28.799> calling<00:03:29.129> on<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.549> end<00:03:29.750> go<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
around and keep calling on the end go to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.090 
around and keep calling on the end go to
the<00:03:30.959> female<00:03:31.349> part<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:32.220> keep<00:03:32.430> pollinating
