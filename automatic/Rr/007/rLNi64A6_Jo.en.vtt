you<00:00:57.809> know<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.260> we've<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> deep<00:00:58.860> cup<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
you know and so we've got a deep cup and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.549 
you know and so we've got a deep cup and
we've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> angled<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.379> actually

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we've got it angled so it's actually

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
we've got it angled so it's actually
going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> spray<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.520> water<00:01:02.790> forward<00:01:03.270> just

a<00:02:46.020> bait<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.680> would<00:02:47.070> sit<00:02:47.340> tail<00:02:47.610> down<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.630> on

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
a bait that would sit tail down so on

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.810 
a bait that would sit tail down so on
the<00:02:49.020> pause<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:50.100> thing<00:02:50.310> isn't<00:02:50.490> going<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.760> be

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
the pause this thing isn't going to be

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.820 
the pause this thing isn't going to be
level<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:51.390> going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.690> tail<00:02:51.930> down<00:02:52.200> all

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
level it's going to be tail down all

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.340 
level it's going to be tail down all
that<00:02:53.130> means<00:02:53.400> is<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.850> means<00:02:53.880> more<00:02:54.300> hookups<00:02:54.750> more
