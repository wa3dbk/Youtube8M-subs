00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello dear lpt audience here speaks 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.470
 and rumble the vote from the direction and 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.240
 I thought I would take that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.670
 opportunity and will take place 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.670
 a trader briefly explain what 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.870
 next week in planetside 2 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 and maybe there is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.470
 some of you already a meter 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.609
 have two such deep little time and even 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 do not participate in the contest 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.920
 had 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.260
 Of course, we also want that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.840
 give us the opportunity to join us 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 with the mugabe plates once the opponent 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.160
 to roll over and how that works 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.170
 I explain now you see I am already 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 in the game and we have three here 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 fractions around then on friday too 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.750
 we really have to be able to find ourselves 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.210
 all have the same fractions 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.590
 currently the walls are selected 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.680
 I do not find because so cool it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.570
 has somehow funny turquoise purple 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.309
 Color casts in your logo is not good 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.670
 That's why I prefer to go to Yukon 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670
 bay 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.440
 there is also the existing that 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.719
 Of course, I do not like it 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.309
 and since I am the savior of lpc 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.259
 just appointed me even now that 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.409
 here on new conglomerate go that the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.020
 rebels in planetside 2 universe you 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.860
 So get over with us on friday 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.740
 to be able to play 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.970
 once on now competition on next and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.619
 then you have to find the right one now 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.030
 choose server because if you are not on 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.899
 then the right server will be you 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.939
 you do not find us 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.399
 the right server is in this case 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:29.229
 hear verse hessel hurst whatever 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.049
 ed the need ye seek it 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.700
 the eu server and do not forget this 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.280
 server are here in at planetside 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.259
 currently always online from 15 o'clock 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.170
 in the afternoon until 9 o'clock the next 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.149
 in the morning, that is, if you are before 15 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 go on then you do not see apple here 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.799
 but it is not offline everywhere 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.060
 But that's why we wonder about it on Fridays at 18 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.159
 We will be here on hna online 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.920
 his and Hirst is the strongest server 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.799
 in europe therefore take that too 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.530
 look for this server girl and 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.879
 click on next then you are still allowed 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.259
 choose a beautiful character 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.259
 first enter the name 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.850
 the new year from a different reason 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.220
 he is still free wonderful 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:28.680
 So here we have 12 34 different ones 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.780
 male participants and 12 34 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.030
 different female participants 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.040
 I'll take the right here that sees 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.110
 so friendly and happy 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.390
 about being allowed to play now 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:45.990
 so far, look for a picture here 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:49.110
 that also changes and there we are 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.580
 Here's the basis of our base here 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.720
 everything else 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.100
 everyone will be when they first come 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.600
 play with the same with the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.400
 same class go to start 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.640
 who's on a weapon that's good 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.570
 even two guards would be here 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.340
 that's our basis, it looks like this 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.110
 flying ships 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.300
 and a nice dome here we see 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.680
 everything is ever only safe here 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.290
 can not order opponents that is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.730
 nothing can happen here 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.959
 Here we will meet at the same time 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.910
 around the main base of the rebels 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.769
 and I'll do a thing now 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.480
 explain that we do one hundred percent 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.269
 become 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.900
 and then before the general chaos starts 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.709
 But here you go so you see terminals 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.170
 rear terminals are also again the 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.239
 but are for fliers that are here for 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.829
 Vehicles and we will get one 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.290
 organizing the vehicle is easy 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.239
 towards a terminal press and her 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.700
 Be in the menu and take it 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.739
 cheapest then that we have one here 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.120
 nonsense 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.910
 running sport click and already we are 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.459
 on a quad and with such a nonsense 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.900
 we then gather outside the base 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.900
 and then it gets sick 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.720
 set a goal and we will become one 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.950
 races drive around this goal well 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.570
 you have to be able to look in the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.940
 to be the same spot that works 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.730
 So you just choose sick 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.940
 Send a friend request the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.680
 You can do it by clicking on escape 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.180
 goes and then here on social goes up 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 social wind then comes on the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.990
 service you have to wait until he is on the 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.600
 server is on friday then you can 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.720
 simply say 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.000
 friend to friend and would then get sick 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.230
 enter and the nice that is 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.350
 Of course not because at the moment he is 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.840
 not online but on friday it will be like that 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.060
 he will be you and then into one 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.080
 Quad even into several scott 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.550
 because we want to do a whole thing 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 if that has happened then you can 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.400
 you also press on m this is the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.980
 card and you see who 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.840
 here is really a lot going on really big 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.900
 territory we are are 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.380
 right now and sick then for 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.620
 the whole place visibly put a point 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.090
 is my personal waypoint the 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.830
 But then the whole thing will be 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.630
 plates against will tour all over 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.880
 can see and we already see in here 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.740
 1850 meters 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.840
 in this direction is mine 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.970
 personal waypoint and I would like to 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.080
 Say we're doing a nice race 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.240
 out with the quads and again who 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.040
 wins in the end we will then 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.230
 probably still fast into the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.760
 collapse enemy camps and there 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.830
 do a bit of that but urge 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.640
 turn off 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.680
 that with the rubbish ever so much 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.870
 I'm already looking forward to it 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.670
 or march to see all in the same 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.430
 Direction nozzles 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.230
 that will be fun and I can 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.180
 once again briefly betrayed it then 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.340
 so different are in the broadcast we 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.140
 will play fifa 13 we still have 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.580
 one fits the floor 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.340
 Maybe some people already know 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.140
 the net bursts with salsa 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.320
 The two will be a nice match here 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:06.780
 first deliver in fifa 13 afterwards 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.870
 will we still play tetris that have 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.000
 I already made that was the wish 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.090
 from many people in the community 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.260
 have seen the let's play of not 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.720
 our number is already quite 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.720
 excited and we will be a hot one 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.600
 fight duell and eight it goes one 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.290
 show time on a planet and 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.110
 starting in the war in the war so and now 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.810
 I would look forward to 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.820
 Friday of course with you again and 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.010
 hope that all be there and 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:42.370
 I'll check it again if I'm here 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.370
 somehow go heavenward
