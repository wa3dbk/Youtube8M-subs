now<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.840> save<00:01:08.200> time<00:01:08.560> I've<00:01:08.890> already<00:01:09.130> drilled

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
now to save time I've already drilled

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.640 
now to save time I've already drilled
out<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.300> two<00:01:10.510> rivets<00:01:10.990> here<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.990> piece<00:01:14.350> just

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
out the two rivets here this piece just

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.000 
out the two rivets here this piece just
lifts<00:01:15.220> out<00:01:15.370> of<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.670> middle<00:01:16.620> you<00:01:17.620> don't<00:01:17.650> need

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
lifts out of the middle you don't need

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.590 
lifts out of the middle you don't need
that<00:01:18.220> anymore<00:01:18.280> you<00:01:19.030> don't<00:01:19.390> need<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.720> bulbs

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that anymore you don't need the bulbs

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.840 
that anymore you don't need the bulbs

where<00:01:25.090> I<00:01:25.119> drilled<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:27.190> basically<00:01:27.400> we're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
where I drilled it so basically we're

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:44.060 
where I drilled it so basically we're
just<00:01:27.970> going<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.360> cut<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.810> wires<00:01:29.050> off

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.580 

and<00:03:49.990> now<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:50.980> have<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> converted<00:03:51.880> fixture

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and now you have a converted fixture

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.960 
and now you have a converted fixture
well<00:03:53.590> basically<00:03:53.830> all<00:03:54.190> you<00:03:54.430> got<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.700> do<00:03:54.820> is

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
well basically all you got to do is

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.600 
well basically all you got to do is
screw<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.750> back<00:03:56.230> put<00:03:56.830> it<00:03:56.860> back<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.370> coach

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
screw it back put it back in the coach

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.180 
screw it back put it back in the coach
hook<00:03:58.480> up<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.810> wires<00:03:58.960> and<00:03:59.410> screw<00:03:59.890> it<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
hook up the wires and screw it to the

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:07.020 
hook up the wires and screw it to the
ceiling<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.790> happen<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.210> have<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:06.030> unit

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
ceiling if you happen to have a unit

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.260 
ceiling if you happen to have a unit
that<00:04:07.060> doesn't<00:04:07.270> have<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> switch<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.910> you<00:04:10.090> can

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
that doesn't have a switch then you can

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.100 
that doesn't have a switch then you can
just<00:04:10.480> take<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.750> jumper<00:04:11.320> wire<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:13.110> splice

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
just take a jumper wire and splice

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.460 
just take a jumper wire and splice
between<00:04:14.620> these<00:04:14.830> two<00:04:15.280> units<00:04:16.030> here<00:04:16.420> which<00:04:17.230> will

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
between these two units here which will

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.460 
between these two units here which will
allow<00:04:17.950> this<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.550> supply<00:04:18.910> power<00:04:19.630> directly<00:04:20.200> to

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
allow this to supply power directly to

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.880 
allow this to supply power directly to
the<00:04:20.590> LED<00:04:21.840> but<00:04:22.840> most<00:04:23.110> of<00:04:23.320> them<00:04:23.470> are<00:04:23.650> you

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
the LED but most of them are you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.070 
the LED but most of them are you
utilizing<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.790> switch<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:28.080> that's

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
utilizing the switch and that's

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.680 
utilizing the switch and that's
basically<00:04:29.770> how<00:04:30.040> we<00:04:30.070> do<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.610> very<00:04:30.790> simple<00:04:31.540> and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
basically how we do it very simple and

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.860 
basically how we do it very simple and
quick

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.930
