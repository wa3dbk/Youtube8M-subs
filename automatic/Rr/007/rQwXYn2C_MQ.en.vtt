holder here now you may be wondering
where<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.640> stylus<00:02:35.209> well<00:02:36.220> quite

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
where is the stylus well quite

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.400 
where is the stylus well quite
interestingly<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:38.420> device<00:02:38.840> doesn't<00:02:39.110> come

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
interestingly this device doesn't come

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.800 
interestingly this device doesn't come
with<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> stylus<00:02:40.099> built-in<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.849> think<00:02:41.510> they<00:02:41.630> did

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
with a stylus built-in I think they did

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.080 
with a stylus built-in I think they did
that<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.080> keep<00:02:42.290> down<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.890> size<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.610> indeed

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
that to keep down on the size and indeed

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.509 
that to keep down on the size and indeed
they<00:02:44.300> did<00:02:44.900> that<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.800> it's<00:02:45.950> kind<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.370> annoying

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
they did that but it's kind of annoying

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.220 
they did that but it's kind of annoying
because<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.209> have<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.540> carry<00:02:47.780> around<00:02:47.870> this

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
because you have to carry around this

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
because you have to carry around this
thing<00:02:48.470> if<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.680> want<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.890> use<00:02:48.980> a<00:02:49.010> stylus<00:02:49.489> this

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
thing if you want to use a stylus this

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.550 
thing if you want to use a stylus this
is<00:02:50.030> not<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.209> makeup<00:02:50.510> holder<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.230> thought<00:02:51.410> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
is not a makeup holder like I thought it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.800 
is not a makeup holder like I thought it
was<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:53.090> unboxing<00:02:53.739> it's<00:02:54.739> actually<00:02:55.310> a

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
was in the the unboxing it's actually a

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.750 
was in the the unboxing it's actually a
stylus<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.140> idea<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.400> carry

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
stylus and the idea is that you carry

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.090 
stylus and the idea is that you carry
this<00:02:58.970> around<00:02:59.170> either<00:03:00.170> in<00:03:00.350> your<00:03:00.500> pocket<00:03:00.920> where

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
this around either in your pocket where

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.550 
this around either in your pocket where
you<00:03:01.250> use<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.760> lanyard<00:03:02.090> loop<00:03:02.269> to<00:03:02.540> loop<00:03:02.569> it<00:03:02.900> into

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
you use the lanyard loop to loop it into

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800 
you use the lanyard loop to loop it into
this<00:03:03.769> hole<00:03:04.010> well<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.670> am<00:03:05.030> certainly<00:03:05.420> not<00:03:05.510> going

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
this hole well I am certainly not going

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.600 
this hole well I am certainly not going
to<00:03:05.959> carry<00:03:06.230> around<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.620> stylist<00:03:07.099> for<00:03:07.130> my<00:03:07.370> phone

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
to carry around a stylist for my phone

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.220 
to carry around a stylist for my phone
they're<00:03:08.150> trying<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> encourage<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.200> use

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
they're trying to encourage you to use

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.140 
they're trying to encourage you to use
your<00:03:09.380> finger<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.220> screen<00:03:10.250> or<00:03:10.790> use<00:03:11.000> the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
your finger on the screen or use the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.680 
your finger on the screen or use the
optical<00:03:11.420> joy<00:03:11.720> joystick<00:03:12.650> here<00:03:12.799> which<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.340> think

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
optical joy joystick here which I think

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.789 
optical joy joystick here which I think
really<00:03:14.690> helps<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.110> make<00:03:15.200> it<00:03:15.349> easy<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.680> navigate

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
really helps to make it easy to navigate

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.070 
really helps to make it easy to navigate
the<00:03:16.160> device<00:03:16.280> I'm<00:03:16.940> actually<00:03:17.150> not<00:03:17.599> missing<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
stylus with the I 900 here and finally I

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:23.319

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
much better than typing on an HTC
