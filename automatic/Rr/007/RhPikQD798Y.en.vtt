00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.420
 hi to all wroom readers i am 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.040
 giampiero cavaciuti son of the owner 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.599
 of gp racing 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:25.670
 the kart racing manufacturer 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.399
 team that turned out to be a surprise 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.279
 this year at the world championship that 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.610
 design 2 a sarno because why 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.530
 we started in the front row with a pilot 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.040
 Unknown quotes from our 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.649
 New Zealand top driver daniel bray 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.200
 and why we have worked this 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.160
 really hard we had no expectations 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.730
 but something has really worked for 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.430
 the right way and the team had a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.150
 feeling from start to finish bringing us 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.940
 always in the front row of qualifications 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.800
 prefinal and final march and alas the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.100
 final gave us a bad one 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.960
 surprise with an accident but dominating 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.780
 the result we got the race 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.260
 with hard work that he started from 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.680
 beginning of the year until the 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.970
 tender started and the development of the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.870
 material 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.780
 and status has been granted to all 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.380
 everyone had the chance to give the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.580
 better than themselves like the least 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.520
 my father the pilot the mechanics e 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.710
 we must also praise the great 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.640
 professionalism of the brown trainer 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 daldosso who offered us his 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.120
 powerful engines is also thanks to him is 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.540
 this is why we are now in vogue we say 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.240
 in the inter nos 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.979
 I do not think this result was 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.979
 also random because you win four 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:08.229
 marches on 5 and Saturday with the tour more 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:13.880
 fast among all 107 members is 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.090
 it was really a thrill to experience there 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.120
 I wish everyone I hope because 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 this is a medium that can be bought 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.250
 it 's nothing special we don't have 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.430
 no prototype developed 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.410
 secret of keeping us close is a 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.680
 standard chassis that took the 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.320
 own production and after the world championship e 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:42.470
 the same engines are rentable 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.570
 from our good cathedral off everything 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.170
 I hope this is all this 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.160
 also reflects in the positive 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.989
 next race 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.650
 we will be present the vs cup world 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.860
 final in Castelletto in October 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.890
 and if all goes well we should 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.190
 well figured there too see you at 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.190
 race
