okay I'm first of all I will create a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:49.940 
okay I'm first of all I will create a
ground<00:00:39.970> plate

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.440 

so

scene okay now open the rayfire floater

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.050 
scene okay now open the rayfire floater
and<00:01:27.570> also<00:01:28.570> file<00:01:28.750> change<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.400> engines<00:01:30.910> of

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
and also file change the engines of

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:43.740 
and also file change the engines of
physics<00:01:37.500> okay<00:01:39.990> um<00:01:41.430> put<00:01:42.430> objects<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.330> want<00:01:43.360> to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
physics okay um put objects you want to

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.480 
physics okay um put objects you want to
fragment<00:01:44.320> into<00:01:44.710> impact<00:01:45.220> objects<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
fragment into impact objects and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.790 
fragment into impact objects and
collision<00:01:48.490> objects<00:01:49.240> to<00:01:49.479> unyielding<00:01:50.369> objects

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.300 

change<00:01:58.610> material<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.480> class<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:02.980> put<00:02:03.980> this

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
change material to class then put this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:18.370 
change material to class then put this
to<00:02:04.640> steal

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.730 

now<00:02:19.180> activate<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.480> interactive<00:02:21.350> demolition

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
now activate the interactive demolition

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.180 
now activate the interactive demolition
change<00:02:24.740> depth<00:02:25.280> level<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:26.560> whatever<00:02:27.560> four<00:02:28.040> or

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
change depth level to whatever four or

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.670 
change depth level to whatever four or
five<00:02:28.250> what<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:28.940> want<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:30.110> depth<00:02:30.470> level

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
five what you want and the depth level

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.750 
five what you want and the depth level
is<00:02:31.130> how<00:02:31.910> many<00:02:32.180> times<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:33.400> already<00:02:34.400> broken

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
is how many times the already broken

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.450 
is how many times the already broken
fragments<00:02:35.210> will<00:02:35.750> break<00:02:36.200> again<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:39.460> material

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
fragments will break again and material

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.340 
fragments will break again and material
solidi<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:42.250> how<00:02:43.250> much<00:02:43.630> force<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:44.900> needed<00:02:45.140> to

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
solidi is how much force is needed to

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:55.890 
solidi is how much force is needed to
break<00:02:45.800> those<00:02:49.150> just<00:02:50.860> change<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:53.170> whatever

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
break those just change it to whatever

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:06.400 
break those just change it to whatever
now<00:02:56.900> go<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.440> fragmentation

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.319 

ok

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
ok

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.379 
ok
when<00:03:10.329> you're<00:03:10.480> now<00:03:10.599> fragment<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.969> get

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
when you're now fragment it with you get

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.770 
when you're now fragment it with you get
a<00:03:13.780> huge<00:03:14.469> pieces<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:17.430> they<00:03:18.430> will<00:03:18.549> break<00:03:19.090> again

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
a huge pieces but they will break again

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.920 
a huge pieces but they will break again
three<00:03:20.349> times<00:03:20.379> so<00:03:21.120> r<00:03:22.120> 4<00:03:22.359> x<00:03:25.739> f4<00:03:26.739> x<00:03:27.069> so<00:03:27.719> they<00:03:28.719> will

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
three times so r 4 x f4 x so they will

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:40.730 
three times so r 4 x f4 x so they will
get<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.590> lot<00:03:29.799> smaller<00:03:34.349> okay

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.510 

oh<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:45.050> if<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.380> want<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.800> start<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
oh and if you want to start the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.990 
oh and if you want to start the
simulation<00:03:48.530> press<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:51.740> but<00:03:52.740> if<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.460> press

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
simulation press this but if you press

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.580 
simulation press this but if you press
it<00:03:54.030> again<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.720> will<00:03:56.120> reset<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.450> keyframes<00:03:58.020> and

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.090 

yeah<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:02.160> don't<00:04:02.520> think<00:04:03.060> we<00:04:03.300> want<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.740> so<00:04:04.740> press

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
yeah I don't think we want that so press

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
and you see it's a flower keyframes just

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:25.870 
and you see it's a flower keyframes just
a<00:04:15.270> little<00:04:15.540> tip<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:21.900> could<00:04:22.170> take<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.470> while<00:04:22.590> so

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:38.560 

sup<00:04:26.880> him<00:04:27.090> is<00:04:27.800> link<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.130> description<00:04:35.780> ok

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
sup him is link is in the description ok

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.960 
sup him is link is in the description ok
now<00:04:39.570> the<00:04:39.770> simulations<00:04:40.770> done<00:04:43.460> when<00:04:44.460> we<00:04:44.490> played

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
now the simulations done when we played

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:53.450 
now the simulations done when we played
it<00:04:45.150> now<00:04:47.300> you<00:04:48.300> can<00:04:48.480> see<00:04:48.690> it<00:04:49.130> breaks<00:04:50.130> here<00:04:52.280> but<00:04:53.280> it

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
it now you can see it breaks here but it

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.280 
it now you can see it breaks here but it
don't<00:04:53.730> breaks<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.450> cuz<00:04:55.850> there<00:04:56.850> is<00:04:57.030> not<00:04:57.390> enough

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
don't breaks you cuz there is not enough

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.650 
don't breaks you cuz there is not enough
force<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.920> break<00:04:59.340> this<00:04:59.670> piece<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.450> will

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
force to break this piece and it will

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:11.610 
force to break this piece and it will
break<00:05:04.490> now<00:05:05.490> when<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.390> hits<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:07.380> ground

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.460 

you<00:05:12.620> can<00:05:12.770> see<00:05:13.330> the<00:05:14.330> other<00:05:14.480> fragments<00:05:15.260> are

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
you can see the other fragments are

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.590 
you can see the other fragments are
breaking<00:05:17.590> this
