00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
a short amount of time should get a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.600 
a short amount of time should get a
mixture<00:02:59.079> like<00:02:59.290> this<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.860> add<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> little<00:03:00.459> bit

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
mixture like this I add a little bit

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.030 
mixture like this I add a little bit
more<00:03:00.880> sugar<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.620> basically<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.010> just

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
more sugar and just basically you just

want to stir it or simmer it until the
sugar<00:03:04.870> dissolves<00:03:05.640> I<00:03:06.640> have<00:03:07.600> a<00:03:07.630> nice<00:03:08.040> mixture

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
sugar dissolves I have a nice mixture

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.280 
sugar dissolves I have a nice mixture
here<00:03:09.450> another<00:03:10.450> way<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.720> can<00:03:11.110> actually<00:03:11.410> match

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
here another way you can actually match

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.910 
here another way you can actually match
or<00:03:12.760> break<00:03:13.760> up<00:03:14.060> some<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:15.319> larger<00:03:15.680> berries

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
or break up some of the larger berries

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.729 
or break up some of the larger berries
like<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.129> strawberry<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.849> in<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> black

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.199 

let's<00:03:21.739> grab<00:03:22.159> a<00:03:22.189> fork<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.700> then<00:03:22.879> you<00:03:23.060> just

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
let's grab a fork and then you just

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.050 
let's grab a fork and then you just
stick<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:23.599> in<00:03:23.689> there<00:03:25.150> like<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.329> and<00:03:28.060> then

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
stick it in there like this and then

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.649 
stick it in there like this and then
basically<00:03:29.540> pull<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:31.579> away<00:03:31.760> just<00:03:32.299> use<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:32.599> for

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:32.659 
basically pull it away just use that for

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:34.599 
basically pull it away just use that for
the<00:03:32.900> bigger<00:03:33.140> ones<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:33.590> help<00:03:33.799> them<00:03:34.400> when

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
the bigger ones and help them when

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.220 
the bigger ones and help them when
they're<00:03:34.760> softer<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.569> just<00:03:35.959> left<00:03:36.109> the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
they're softer I just left the

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.140 
they're softer I just left the
blueberries<00:03:36.739> nice<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.220> big<00:03:37.430> it's<00:03:38.000> got<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
blueberries nice and big it's got a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.619 
blueberries nice and big it's got a
little<00:03:38.389> bit<00:03:38.540> of<00:03:39.459> chunkiness<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:41.030> them<00:03:41.209> just

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
little bit of chunkiness to them just

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.270 
little bit of chunkiness to them just
let<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.959> simmer<00:03:42.319> until<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:42.829> have<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.010> nice
