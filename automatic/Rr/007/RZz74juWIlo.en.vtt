 that the beta-carotene in vegetables 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.500
 rich in iron like broccoli help 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.020
 overcome this blockage and return available 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.869
 the iron is also wonderful

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 free radicals when the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.119
 concentration of these that the
