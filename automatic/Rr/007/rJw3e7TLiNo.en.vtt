 so we will start 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.409
 on time 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:13.009
 we know 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.159
 papers 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.159

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.079
 it explodes and like jewels 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.239
 except that staline force of three times more powerful what 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.630
 it is very very powerful 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.630
 so we have two packages then we did

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.480
 we have located his city ignition 15 minutes 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 then at 10 years of half an hour 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.500
 it is a homemade and contained black powder the earth 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400

 a floor of three groups of three big shots 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.290
 for now it's also because the bets at 5 m 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.780
 it's much more optimistic at incredible strength 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.360
