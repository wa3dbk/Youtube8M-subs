level<00:01:47.500> 1<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.829> when<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.250> first<00:01:54.549> did<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:54.850> I

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
level 1 and when I first did this I

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.429 
level 1 and when I first did this I
think<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.390> took<00:01:55.539> me<00:01:55.659> two<00:01:55.840> or<00:01:55.869> three<00:01:56.049> tries

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
think it took me two or three tries

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.080 
think it took me two or three tries
because<00:01:56.920> I<00:01:57.100> was<00:01:57.220> planning<00:01:57.460> on<00:01:57.520> like<00:01:57.670> master

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
one or whatever so that's only like a

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.870 
one or whatever so that's only like a
60%<00:02:01.090> drop<00:02:02.039> but<00:02:03.039> if<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.189> do<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.399> on<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.670> if

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.939 

and<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.020> mean<00:04:56.199> I<00:04:56.229> could<00:04:56.469> have<00:04:56.529> went<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:56.830> got

it'd be easier to show you guys that you

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.909 
it'd be easier to show you guys that you
know<00:05:02.139> you<00:05:03.129> can<00:05:03.400> get<00:05:03.669> three<00:05:03.969> stacks<00:05:04.650> just<00:05:05.650> going
