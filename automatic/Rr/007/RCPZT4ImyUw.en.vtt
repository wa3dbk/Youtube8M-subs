00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
thing that I kept thinking during the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
thing that I kept thinking during the
first<00:01:24.540> few<00:01:24.750> songs<00:01:24.930> on<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.229> album<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.650> how

first few songs on this album is how

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.469 
first few songs on this album is how
much<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.250> sounded<00:01:26.670> like<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> self-titled

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
much is sounded like the self-titled

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.990 
much is sounded like the self-titled
album<00:01:27.720> from<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.140> XX<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.159> not<00:01:29.340> necessarily<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
album from the XX it's not necessarily a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.910 
album from the XX it's not necessarily a
bad<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.869> definitely<00:01:31.020> love<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bad thing because I definitely love that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
bad thing because I definitely love that
record<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.460> when<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.670> listen<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
record but when you listen to it the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
record but when you listen to it the
parallels<00:01:33.869> are<00:01:33.869> pretty<00:01:34.350> clear<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.070> have<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
parallels are pretty clear but I have to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.920 
parallels are pretty clear but I have to
say<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> first<00:01:36.000> three<00:01:36.299> songs<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.810> album

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
say the first three songs on this album

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.620 
say the first three songs on this album
are<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:38.040> good<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.610> mood<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> awesome<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
are really good the mood is awesome and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
are really good the mood is awesome and
the<00:01:39.780> guitars<00:01:40.140> are<00:01:40.320> definitely<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> top<00:01:41.250> form

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the guitars are definitely in top form

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
the guitars are definitely in top form
all<00:01:41.850> three<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.329> them<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.630> nice<00:01:42.780> listens<00:01:43.320> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
all three of them are nice listens and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
all three of them are nice listens and
even<00:01:43.799> for<00:01:43.979> people<00:01:44.070> who<00:01:44.310> might<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.610> have<00:01:44.790> liked

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
even for people who might not have liked

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
even for people who might not have liked
that<00:01:45.180> first<00:01:45.540> album<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.110> definitely<00:01:46.619> recommend

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
that first album I definitely recommend

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
that first album I definitely recommend
you<00:01:47.280> check<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.090> very

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
you check this out it's a very

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.330 
you check this out it's a very
accessible<00:01:49.049> opening<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.680> introduction<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
accessible opening and introduction to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.950 
accessible opening and introduction to
this<00:01:50.460> band<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.210> opening<00:01:51.600> song<00:01:51.780> I'm

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
this band but that opening song I'm

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.230 
this band but that opening song I'm
really<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.470> sure<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> say<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.909> think

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
really not sure how to say this I think

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.819 
really not sure how to say this I think
they<00:01:54.329> were<00:01:54.390> listening<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.930> rock<00:01:55.170> sets<00:01:55.470> must

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
recording this song yeah the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
recording this song yeah the

doesn't<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.770> detract<00:02:02.520> from<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> song<00:02:03.119> but

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
doesn't really detract from the song but

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.850 
doesn't really detract from the song but
you<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.750> more<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.320> friendly<00:02:04.740> observation

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
but not so fast things slip up pretty

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.830 
but not so fast things slip up pretty
bad<00:02:50.890> right<00:02:51.130> around<00:02:51.370> there<00:02:51.610> both<00:02:51.970> Empire<00:02:52.510> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
bad right around there both Empire and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.960 
bad right around there both Empire and
wolves<00:02:53.290> without<00:02:53.530> teeth<00:02:53.830> are<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> bit<00:02:54.370> bland<00:02:54.730> if

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
wolves without teeth are a bit bland if

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.240 
wolves without teeth are a bit bland if
not<00:02:55.299> cliche<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:56.290> they<00:02:56.530> both<00:02:56.709> suffered<00:02:57.100> from

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
not cliche and they both suffered from

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.190 
not cliche and they both suffered from
this<00:02:57.370> really<00:02:57.819> dry<00:02:58.060> drum<00:02:58.390> sound<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.810> doesn't

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
this really dry drum sound that doesn't

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.530 
this really dry drum sound that doesn't
work<00:02:59.410> at<00:02:59.590> all<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.580> idea<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:00.910> they<00:03:01.090> put<00:03:01.299> forth

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
work at all the idea that they put forth

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.090 
work at all the idea that they put forth
on<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.750> lyrics<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.319> latter<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.620> those<00:03:02.860> two

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
on the lyrics of the latter of those two

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.680 
on the lyrics of the latter of those two
songs<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.610> feel<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.030> it's<00:03:04.209> been<00:03:04.360> done<00:03:04.660> to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
songs I feel like it's been done to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.890 
songs I feel like it's been done to
death<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.739> many<00:03:06.100> times<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.269> me<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.630> kind<00:03:07.660> of

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
death so many times and to me it kind of

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.690 
death so many times and to me it kind of
seems<00:03:08.110> like<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.440> was<00:03:08.650> crafted<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.549> be<00:03:09.670> a

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
seems like this was crafted just to be a

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.370 
seems like this was crafted just to be a
single<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.269> nothing<00:03:10.660> more<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:11.110> pretty

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
single and nothing more it's pretty

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.229 
single and nothing more it's pretty
boring<00:03:11.590> after<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.250> opening<00:03:12.489> trio<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.970> songs

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
boring after the opening trio of songs

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.060 
boring after the opening trio of songs
this<00:03:13.660> really<00:03:14.080> took<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.290> air<00:03:14.530> out<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.739> things

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
this really took the air out of things

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.860 
this really took the air out of things
it's<00:03:15.310> eight<00:03:15.489> minutes<00:03:15.820> of<00:03:15.880> mediocrity<00:03:16.209> after

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
it's eight minutes of mediocrity after

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.720 
it's eight minutes of mediocrity after
what<00:03:17.019> was<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.140> surprisingly<00:03:17.980> strong<00:03:18.340> opening

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
what was a surprisingly strong opening

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.640 
what was a surprisingly strong opening
but<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.120> will<00:03:19.329> say<00:03:19.540> they<00:03:19.720> make<00:03:19.900> up<00:03:20.049> for<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.380> very

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
but I will say they make up for it very

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.920 
but I will say they make up for it very
quickly<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.250> winter<00:03:21.609> sound<00:03:21.910> just<00:03:22.329> might<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.690> my

different<00:04:27.650> ordering<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.280> low<00:04:28.520> points<00:04:28.820> that

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
different ordering the low points that

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.490 
different ordering the low points that
you<00:04:29.030> get<00:04:29.180> wouldn't<00:04:29.540> have<00:04:29.780> been<00:04:29.930> as<00:04:30.080> obvious

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
you get wouldn't have been as obvious

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.379 
you get wouldn't have been as obvious
very<00:04:31.010> early<00:04:31.340> on<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.639> ebon<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.060> flow<00:04:32.210> this

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
very early on the ebon the flow this

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.750 
very early on the ebon the flow this
album<00:04:32.720> fall<00:04:33.020> apart<00:04:33.500> entirely<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.340> just<00:04:34.520> can't

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
album fall apart entirely you just can't

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.820 
album fall apart entirely you just can't
dig<00:04:35.090> in<00:04:35.300> and<00:04:35.479> really<00:04:35.660> stick<00:04:36.080> there<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.530> mean<00:04:36.740> if

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
dig in and really stick there I mean if

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.560 
dig in and really stick there I mean if
you<00:04:36.919> reorder<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.460> tracks<00:04:37.760> backyard<00:04:38.419> would

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
you reorder the tracks backyard would

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.090 
you reorder the tracks backyard would
have<00:04:38.690> been<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.870> fantastic<00:04:39.320> closer<00:04:39.860> but

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
have been a fantastic closer but

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.710 
have been a fantastic closer but
unfortunately<00:04:40.729> the<00:04:40.880> song<00:04:41.120> before<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.540> has<00:04:41.690> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
unfortunately the song before it has a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.390 
unfortunately the song before it has a
completely<00:04:42.229> different<00:04:42.560> style<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.010> mood<00:04:43.160> and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
completely different style and mood and

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.950 
completely different style and mood and
just<00:04:43.639> kind<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.880> shift<00:04:44.180> back<00:04:44.360> and<00:04:44.389> forth<00:04:44.570> in<00:04:44.900> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
just kind of shift back and forth in a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.810 
just kind of shift back and forth in a
bad<00:04:45.139> way<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.710> just<00:04:45.770> sort<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.160> bounces<00:04:46.610> all<00:04:46.790> over

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
bad way it just sort of bounces all over

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.640 
bad way it just sort of bounces all over
the<00:04:47.090> place<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.419> for<00:04:47.600> me<00:04:47.690> this<00:04:47.930> comes<00:04:48.199> down<00:04:48.380> to

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
the place and for me this comes down to

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.530 
the place and for me this comes down to
laziness<00:04:49.190> because<00:04:49.580> track<00:04:49.880> ordering<00:04:50.330> should

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
laziness because track ordering should

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.659 
laziness because track ordering should
never<00:04:50.900> be<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.199> problem<00:04:51.590> this<00:04:52.070> should<00:04:52.340> not<00:04:52.490> have

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
never be a problem this should not have

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.550 
never be a problem this should not have
happened<00:04:52.990> sequencing<00:04:53.990> should<00:04:54.199> just<00:04:54.380> follow

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
happened sequencing should just follow

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.409 
happened sequencing should just follow
the<00:04:54.860> feel<00:04:55.100> of<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.370> music<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:55.820> this<00:04:56.030> record

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
the feel of the music and this record

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.570 
the feel of the music and this record
doesn't<00:04:56.720> this<00:04:57.260> record<00:04:57.620> definitely<00:04:58.160> had<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.340> ton

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
doesn't this record definitely had a ton

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.740 
doesn't this record definitely had a ton
of<00:04:58.610> potential<00:04:58.970> at<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.210> beginning<00:04:59.510> and<00:04:59.720> I

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
of potential at the beginning and I

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.450 
of potential at the beginning and I
think<00:04:59.990> we're<00:05:00.139> seeing<00:05:00.410> what<00:05:00.680> of<00:05:00.830> Monsters<00:05:01.340> and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
think we're seeing what of Monsters and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.340 
think we're seeing what of Monsters and
Men<00:05:01.520> really<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.540> is<00:05:02.690> a<00:05:02.720> band<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.080> worked

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
Men really is this is a band that worked

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.159 
Men really is this is a band that worked
really<00:05:03.800> well<00:05:03.979> in<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.550> EP<00:05:05.060> format<00:05:05.540> and<00:05:05.780> not<00:05:05.930> so

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
really well in the EP format and not so

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.050 
really well in the EP format and not so
much<00:05:06.350> in<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.560> LP<00:05:07.040> format<00:05:07.490> there's<00:05:07.910> just

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
much in the LP format there's just

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.760 
much in the LP format there's just
enough<00:05:08.360> filler<00:05:08.630> on<00:05:08.840> this<00:05:08.960> album<00:05:09.110> kind<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.650> like

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
enough filler on this album kind of like

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.320 
enough filler on this album kind of like
their<00:05:09.950> last<00:05:10.220> record<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.760> you<00:05:10.820> just<00:05:11.000> say<00:05:11.120> hey

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
their last record that you just say hey

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.570 
their last record that you just say hey
why<00:05:11.810> not<00:05:11.930> put<00:05:12.169> out<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.290> bunch<00:05:12.530> of<00:05:12.620> eps<00:05:13.040> it's<00:05:13.280> fine

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
why not put out a bunch of eps it's fine

that<00:05:18.080> route<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.320> cut<00:05:18.680> some<00:05:18.860> of<00:05:18.950> these<00:05:19.010> songs

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
that route and cut some of these songs

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.010 
that route and cut some of these songs
off<00:05:19.520> this<00:05:19.880> would<00:05:20.090> have<00:05:20.210> been<00:05:20.240> a<00:05:20.600> kill<00:05:20.900> or

off this would have been a kill or

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.659 
off this would have been a kill or
