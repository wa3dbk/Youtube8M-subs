00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.260 

so<00:00:00.870> you<00:00:01.560> want<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.800> see<00:00:02.010> water<00:00:02.310> freeze<00:00:02.730> almost

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
so you want to see water freeze almost

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.830 
so you want to see water freeze almost
immediately

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
immediately

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.769 
immediately
well<00:00:04.710> here's<00:00:04.890> what<00:00:05.069> you're<00:00:05.190> gonna<00:00:05.250> need<00:00:05.779> some

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
well here's what you're gonna need some

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.860 
well here's what you're gonna need some
very<00:00:07.080> pure<00:00:07.560> water<00:00:08.300> fiji<00:00:09.300> water<00:00:09.480> has<00:00:09.690> been

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
very pure water fiji water has been

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.700 
very pure water fiji water has been
recommended<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.530> me<00:00:10.650> by<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:11.730> friend<00:00:12.150> and

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
recommended to me by a friend and

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.900 
recommended to me by a friend and
obviously<00:00:13.710> we're<00:00:13.889> going<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> need<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.519> freezer

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
obviously we're going to need a freezer

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.630 
obviously we're going to need a freezer
some<00:00:15.509> way<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> cool<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.020> down<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:17.369> i'm<00:00:17.460> going<00:00:17.580> to

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
some way to cool it down so i'm going to

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390 
some way to cool it down so i'm going to
put<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.410> bottle<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.529> water<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> freezer

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
put this bottle of water in the freezer

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.019 
put this bottle of water in the freezer
in<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> area<00:00:21.480> normally<00:00:22.199> occupied<00:00:22.740> by<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.850> ice

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
in the area normally occupied by the ice

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.460 
in the area normally occupied by the ice
cube<00:00:24.390> trays<00:00:24.630> because<00:00:24.869> i<00:00:24.960> think<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.260> might<00:00:25.439> be

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
cube trays because i think that might be

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.640 
cube trays because i think that might be
the<00:00:25.680> coldest<00:00:26.519> part<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.330> freezer<00:00:27.660> i've<00:00:28.470> got

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the coldest part of my freezer i've got

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.009 
the coldest part of my freezer i've got
two<00:00:28.890> bottles<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.939> case<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.599> doesn't

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
two bottles just in case one doesn't

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.030 
two bottles just in case one doesn't
work<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.880> now<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.390> wait<00:00:33.860> there<00:00:34.860> are

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
work and now we have to wait there are

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
work and now we have to wait there are
lots<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.670> lots<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.969> videos<00:00:36.090> showing<00:00:36.960> this

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
lots and lots of videos showing this

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.619 
lots and lots of videos showing this
phenomena<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.680> youtube<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.820> very<00:00:39.090> few<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
phenomena on youtube but very few that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.569 
phenomena on youtube but very few that
explain<00:00:40.020> how<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.710> actually<00:00:40.890> works

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
explain how it actually works

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.750 
explain how it actually works
so<00:00:41.850> i'd<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.360> take<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> minute<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
so i'd like to take a minute and do that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.400 
so i'd like to take a minute and do that
water<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.059> normally<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.870> liquid<00:00:46.260> at<00:00:46.379> room

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
water is normally a liquid at room

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
water is normally a liquid at room
temperature<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.730> water<00:00:48.149> molecules

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
temperature because the water molecules

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.479 
temperature because the water molecules
are<00:00:48.840> all<00:00:48.989> flowing<00:00:49.410> past<00:00:49.770> each<00:00:50.070> other

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
are all flowing past each other

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
are all flowing past each other
tumbling<00:00:50.850> around<00:00:51.120> each<00:00:51.300> other<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.600> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
tumbling around each other and that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.260 
tumbling around each other and that
allows<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.500> substance<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> flow<00:00:53.340> when

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
allows the substance to flow when

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
allows the substance to flow when
something<00:00:54.510> becomes<00:00:54.809> solid<00:00:55.199> its<00:00:55.829> molecules

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
something becomes solid its molecules

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.790 
something becomes solid its molecules
all<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.420> less<00:00:57.510> lock<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.170> place

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
all more or less lock into place

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.500 
all more or less lock into place
they<00:00:58.980> still<00:00:59.219> vibrate<00:00:59.789> where<00:01:00.270> they're<00:01:00.390> not

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
they still vibrate where they're not

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
they still vibrate where they're not
rolling<00:01:01.109> over<00:01:01.590> each<00:01:01.680> other<00:01:01.890> moving<00:01:02.160> past<00:01:02.489> each

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
rolling over each other moving past each

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
rolling over each other moving past each
other<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> no<00:01:03.449> longer<00:01:03.480> flow<00:01:04.049> their

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
other so they can no longer flow their

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.740 
other so they can no longer flow their
solid<00:01:04.820> now<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.970> we're<00:01:06.119> doing<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.600> is

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
solid now what we're doing here is

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
solid now what we're doing here is
supercooling<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.650> water<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.220> we're<00:01:08.369> taking

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
supercooling the water so we're taking

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
supercooling the water so we're taking
it<00:01:08.909> below<00:01:09.689> its<00:01:09.960> temperature<00:01:10.470> below<00:01:10.619> zero

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
it below its temperature below zero

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.250 
it below its temperature below zero
degrees<00:01:11.250> where<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.880> will<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.960> become

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
degrees where it will it should become

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.560 
degrees where it will it should become
ice<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:14.790> difficult<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.479> that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
ice but it's very difficult for that

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.200 
ice but it's very difficult for that
water<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> transition<00:01:16.830> without

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
water to make the transition without

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
water to make the transition without
somewhere<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.900> ice<00:01:19.470> crystal<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> start

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
somewhere for that ice crystal to start

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.899 
somewhere for that ice crystal to start
growing<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> what<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.290> need<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
growing so what we need is some kind of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.870 
growing so what we need is some kind of
nucleation<00:01:24.509> event<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.369> water<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.850> not

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
nucleation event if the water is not

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
nucleation event if the water is not
pure<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.869> impurities<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> water

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
pure the impurities in the water

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.850 
pure the impurities in the water
naturally<00:01:29.729> act<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.240> sites<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> crystal

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
naturally act as sites where the crystal

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.679 
naturally act as sites where the crystal
can<00:01:31.979> start<00:01:32.250> forming<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:33.240> why<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:33.540> very

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
can start forming that's why it's very

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
can start forming that's why it's very
important<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.290> use<00:01:34.470> very<00:01:35.310> very<00:01:35.520> pure

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
important that we use very very pure

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
important that we use very very pure
water<00:01:37.009> another<00:01:38.009> way<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.549> cause<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
water another way we can cause this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.660 
water another way we can cause this
nucleation<00:01:39.360> event<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.320> bang<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.460> water

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
nucleation event is to bang the water

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.460 
nucleation event is to bang the water
bottle<00:01:42.060> hopefully<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:42.899> cause<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> few

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
bottle hopefully that will cause a few

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.350 
bottle hopefully that will cause a few
water<00:01:43.680> molecules<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> line<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.149> right

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
water molecules to line up in the right

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.780 
water molecules to line up in the right
way<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.350> will<00:01:46.770> seed<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.340> rest<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
way and that will seed the rest of the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.499 
way and that will seed the rest of the
ice<00:01:47.909> crystal<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> let's<00:01:50.939> give<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.270> few<00:01:51.299> hours

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
ice crystal so let's give it a few hours

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.139 
ice crystal so let's give it a few hours
and<00:01:51.960> we'll<00:01:52.530> come<00:01:52.590> back<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> try<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> nucleate

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and we'll come back and try to nucleate

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.590 
and we'll come back and try to nucleate
this<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:55.530> ice<00:01:55.799> forming<00:01:56.219> event<00:01:56.520> alright<00:01:57.360> it's

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
this this ice forming event alright it's

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
this this ice forming event alright it's
taken<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.079> few<00:01:58.290> days<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.979> multiple<00:01:59.430> attempts

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
taken a few days and multiple attempts

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.270 
taken a few days and multiple attempts
but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.899> could<00:02:01.110> finally<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
but I think this could finally be it I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280 
but I think this could finally be it I
might<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> finally<00:02:03.030> created<00:02:03.659> supercooled

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
might have finally created supercooled

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.449 
might have finally created supercooled
water<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.340> let's<00:02:06.240> let's<00:02:06.840> find<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:08.340> going

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
water so let's let's find out I'm going

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.609 
water so let's let's find out I'm going
to<00:02:08.520> take<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> water<00:02:09.060> very<00:02:09.450> carefully<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
to take the water very carefully out of

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.600 
to take the water very carefully out of
the<00:02:10.679> freezer

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
the freezer

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.550 
the freezer
and<00:02:13.380> now<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.530> can<00:02:14.680> see<00:02:14.950> clearly<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
and now you can see clearly that the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.140 
and now you can see clearly that the
water<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.980> still<00:02:18.220> liquid<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:18.910> see<00:02:19.030> this

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
water is still liquid you can see this

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.930 
water is still liquid you can see this
air<00:02:19.420> bubble<00:02:19.630> floating<00:02:20.020> around<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.610> now<00:02:21.610> I'm

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
air bubble floating around and now I'm

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.200 
air bubble floating around and now I'm
going<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.800> bang<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> counter<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.670> we

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
going to bang it on the counter and we

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.060 
going to bang it on the counter and we
will<00:02:25.360> see<00:02:25.540> if<00:02:25.630> we<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:25.870> get<00:02:25.990> an<00:02:26.080> ice<00:02:26.260> crystal<00:02:26.620> to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
will see if we can get an ice crystal to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.820 
will see if we can get an ice crystal to
form<00:02:29.010> whoa<00:02:30.010> look<00:02:30.520> at<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:32.320> can<00:02:32.350> see<00:02:32.650> that

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
form whoa look at that you can see that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.560 
form whoa look at that you can see that
ice<00:02:33.040> crystal<00:02:33.490> growing<00:02:33.700> right<00:02:34.000> down<00:02:34.240> from<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
ice crystal growing right down from the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.910 
ice crystal growing right down from the
top<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:34.990> bottom<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.200> there<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.470> have<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.770> I

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
top to the bottom so there you have it I

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.860 
top to the bottom so there you have it I
was<00:02:39.250> finally<00:02:39.520> able<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:40.060> demonstrate<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
was finally able to demonstrate the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.320 
was finally able to demonstrate the
supercooled<00:02:41.380> water<00:02:41.590> phenomenon<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.610> cooled

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
supercooled water phenomenon I cooled

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.390 
supercooled water phenomenon I cooled
down<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.540> very<00:02:44.140> pure<00:02:44.410> water<00:02:44.680> in<00:02:44.890> my<00:02:45.070> freezer

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
down the very pure water in my freezer

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420 
down the very pure water in my freezer
for<00:02:45.910> two<00:02:46.630> or<00:02:46.780> three<00:02:46.960> hours<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.410> then<00:02:48.010> by

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
for two or three hours and then by

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.800 
for two or three hours and then by
banging<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.090> water<00:02:49.270> bottle<00:02:49.570> on<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> counter

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
banging the water bottle on the counter

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.860 
banging the water bottle on the counter
I<00:02:50.320> started<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.790> formation<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.630> an<00:02:52.750> ice

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
I started the formation of an ice

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.270 
I started the formation of an ice
crystal<00:02:53.140> at<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.470> top<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:53.980> bottle<00:02:54.220> of

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
crystal at the top of the bottle of

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.850 
crystal at the top of the bottle of
water<00:02:54.370> which<00:02:54.970> quickly<00:02:55.240> grew<00:02:55.660> down<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.770> the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
water which quickly grew down to the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.190 
water which quickly grew down to the
bottom
