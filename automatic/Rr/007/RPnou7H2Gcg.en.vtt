all<00:00:33.930> mine<00:00:34.399> into<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:36.140> log<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.559> he<00:00:38.489> already<00:00:38.610> had

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
wanted to try a challenge so I figured

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
wanted to try a challenge so I figured
why<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.840> seems<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:02.280> almost

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
why not this one seems like it's almost

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.179 
why not this one seems like it's almost
manageable<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:04.110> someone<00:01:04.530> who<00:01:04.650> can't<00:01:04.920> chug

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
manageable for someone who can't chug

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.359 
manageable for someone who can't chug
that<00:01:06.060> much<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.830> um<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.780> as<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.369> afterward

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
