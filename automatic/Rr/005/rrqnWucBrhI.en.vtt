00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.990
So there are so many different ways to transition
from one record to the next: you can use cues,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.670
you can use sound effects.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.890
I'm about to actually give you an example
of using a sound effect to transition from

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.990
one record to the next.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:26.960
I have a Reggae record on my right deck, like
a hip-hop-, R&amp;amp;B-type track on my left

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
deck.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:01:26.650
OK, I'm going to start with the right deck,
a Reggae song.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.750
So that was an example of using an echo or
delay as a transition, to transition from

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
the reggae record to the R&amp;amp;B hip-hop track.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.250
So many ways of doing that, so many different
effects that you can use, you can, you know,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.490
flange, whatever effects you want to use.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.960
There's even customizable effects that you
can actually tweak yourself, you know, and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.430
save the settings.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.150
You can also use sound effects, which I like
to use as well, horns, there might be some

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.140
vocal drops that I can use as a transition,
like if I'm DJ'ing for an internet radio show,

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.920
and I'm playing a hip-hop set, I might want
to use a vocal drop of someone saying my name:

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.250
"You're listening to DJ DP One, on whatever
show," and then it'll just transition into

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.900
the next song.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.230
Or sometimes, I might want to just stop the
music completely, and play a sample of something

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.250
to get the crowd, you know, revved up or whatever,
and then I'll just segue or transition into

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.250
the next song.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.530
So, there's so many ways to go about it, you
know.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.129
The golden rule is to just keep it as smooth
as possible so it's not an abrupt change.
