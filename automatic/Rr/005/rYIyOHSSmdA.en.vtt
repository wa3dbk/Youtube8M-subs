00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
radius version of it for a bigot are

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.789 
radius version of it for a bigot are
okay<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.870> it's<00:02:35.870> great<00:02:36.049> about<00:02:36.200> these<00:02:36.409> stairs

okay and it's great about these stairs

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.670 
okay and it's great about these stairs
is<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:38.540> you've<00:02:38.780> got<00:02:38.870> nice<00:02:39.049> complete<00:02:39.379> stay

mm-hmm we've got some stuff there's

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.170 
mm-hmm we've got some stuff there's
absolutely<00:03:09.379> crazy<00:03:09.769> to<00:03:09.950> build<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:11.150> our

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
absolutely crazy to build like our

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.860 
absolutely crazy to build like our
roasting<00:03:14.180> pick<00:03:14.420> on<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.750> spur<00:03:15.109> nice<00:03:16.750> with<00:03:17.750> the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
roasting pick on a spur nice with the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.800 
roasting pick on a spur nice with the
competitive<00:03:18.349> stuff<00:03:19.030> I've<00:03:20.030> actually<00:03:20.269> built<00:03:20.599> it

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
competitive stuff I've actually built it

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.129 
competitive stuff I've actually built it
into<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.109> PDS<00:03:21.590> at<00:03:21.859> this<00:03:22.040> simple<00:03:22.459> versions

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
into the PDS at this simple versions

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.059 
into the PDS at this simple versions
capable<00:03:24.139> is<00:03:24.260> up<00:03:24.440> for<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> challenge<00:03:24.709> of

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
capable is up for the challenge of

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.129 
capable is up for the challenge of
holding<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.430> crazy<00:03:25.639> stuff<00:03:26.000> they<00:03:26.840> can<00:03:27.019> turn

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
holding the crazy stuff they can turn

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:28.809 
holding the crazy stuff they can turn
off<00:03:27.290> all<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.500> complexity<00:03:28.099> go<00:03:28.280> for<00:03:28.489> a<00:03:28.519> simple

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
off all the complexity go for a simple

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.509 
off all the complexity go for a simple
version<00:03:29.000> mm-hmm<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.109> that<00:03:30.829> makes<00:03:31.010> life<00:03:31.099> very

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
version mm-hmm and that makes life very

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.129 
version mm-hmm and that makes life very
easy<00:03:31.790> for<00:03:32.090> them<00:03:32.239> so<00:03:32.569> they<00:03:32.720> didn't<00:03:33.019> get<00:03:33.079> a

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
easy for them so they didn't get a

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.860 
easy for them so they didn't get a
quality<00:03:33.680> thing<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:35.090> is<00:03:35.269> quite<00:03:35.540> functional

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
quality thing that is quite functional

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.009 
quality thing that is quite functional
and<00:03:36.530> very<00:03:37.160> easy<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.609> build<00:03:37.790> or<00:03:38.629> they<00:03:38.870> could

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
and very easy to build or they could

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.420 
and very easy to build or they could
have<00:03:39.139> something<00:03:39.319> really<00:03:39.709> complex<00:03:40.129> and

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
have something really complex and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.800 
have something really complex and
challenging<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:41.000> that's<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.419> kind<00:03:41.599> of<00:03:41.629> stuff

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
challenging if that's the kind of stuff

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.949 
challenging if that's the kind of stuff
that<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.049> scible<00:03:42.440> can<00:03:43.299> try<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.419> cater<00:03:44.569> to<00:03:44.900> me

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
that like scible can try and cater to me

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.050 
that like scible can try and cater to me
what<00:03:45.199> about<00:03:45.379> this<00:03:45.829> statue<00:03:46.160> that<00:03:46.579> I'm<00:03:46.730> filming

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
what about this statue that I'm filming

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.770 
what about this statue that I'm filming
now<00:03:48.519> yeah<00:03:49.519> this<00:03:49.760> this<00:03:50.000> was<00:03:50.209> just<00:03:50.239> me<00:03:50.540> being

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
now yeah this this was just me being

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.970 
now yeah this this was just me being
very<00:03:50.840> very<00:03:51.290> ambitious<00:03:51.430> okay<00:03:52.459> it's<00:03:53.919> seven<00:03:54.919> a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
very very ambitious okay it's seven a

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.259 
very very ambitious okay it's seven a
half<00:03:55.010> centimetres<00:03:55.730> tall

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
half centimetres tall

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.170 
half centimetres tall
mmm<00:03:56.829> if<00:03:57.829> I<00:03:57.919> recall<00:03:58.069> correctly<00:03:58.370> it's<00:03:58.819> made<00:03:59.000> of

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
mmm if I recall correctly it's made of

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.490 
mmm if I recall correctly it's made of
eleven<00:04:00.909> little<00:04:01.909> pieces<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.299> paper<00:04:02.510> shot<00:04:03.549> and

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
eleven little pieces of paper shot and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.439 
eleven little pieces of paper shot and
yeah<00:04:06.500> it's<00:04:07.099> crazy<00:04:07.280> detailed<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:08.120> actually

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
yeah it's crazy detailed it's actually

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.080 
yeah it's crazy detailed it's actually
not<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:08.959> concat<00:04:09.739> it's<00:04:09.949> just<00:04:10.099> really<00:04:10.639> tricky

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
not that concat it's just really tricky

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.339 
not that concat it's just really tricky
to<00:04:11.120> get<00:04:11.419> to<00:04:11.569> stick<00:04:11.780> together

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
to get to stick together

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.480 
to get to stick together
okay<00:04:12.949> but<00:04:13.430> as<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.060> said

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
okay but as I said

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.730 
okay but as I said
the<00:04:15.180> PDF<00:04:15.870> they<00:04:16.020> actually<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.320> a<00:04:16.350> simple

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:16.740 
the PDF they actually is a simple

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.410 
the PDF they actually is a simple
version<00:04:16.860> of<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.220> it's<00:04:17.460> only<00:04:17.580> three<00:04:18.240> pieces

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
version of this it's only three pieces

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.690 
version of this it's only three pieces
of<00:04:18.660> paper<00:04:18.780> oh<00:04:19.230> I<00:04:19.650> can't<00:04:19.980> and<00:04:20.160> very<00:04:20.370> easy<00:04:20.580> to

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
of paper oh I can't and very easy to

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.370 
of paper oh I can't and very easy to
stick<00:04:20.940> together<00:04:21.120> for<00:04:21.300> people<00:04:21.840> who<00:04:21.930> aren't<00:04:22.140> up

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
stick together for people who aren't up

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.520 
stick together for people who aren't up
for<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.680> challenge<00:04:23.040> of<00:04:24.410> variables<00:04:25.410> together

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
for the challenge of variables together

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.410 
for the challenge of variables together
with<00:04:25.860> tweezers<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.520> getting<00:04:27.000> all<00:04:27.210> that

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
with tweezers of getting all that

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.380 
with tweezers of getting all that
witching<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.490> that<00:04:29.490> also<00:04:29.640> mostly<00:04:30.060> just<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
witching so that also mostly just the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.430 
witching so that also mostly just the
skeletons<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:32.000> recently-released<00:04:33.290> terms<00:04:34.290> of
