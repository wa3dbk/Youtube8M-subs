 this is the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.930
 a marmot but it will probably not be able to do it 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.940
 around and if not only 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.659
 watch the internet 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.339

 on my head but my favorite 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.319
 around and so on now another thing 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.099
 and not agree 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.109

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:47.759
 all is 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.469
 and then Görg's spokesman it was 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.210
 We are looking for costs from the bottom up 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.499
 so as a speaker 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:55.469
 around 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.829

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.979
 all say saved 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.229
 they are now 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:14.430
 in a cache nothing Reichardt pm 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.759
 Perpetrator about 1 5 behind understand 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.139
 now there is one 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.689
 kapo / dwa cancer this fit 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.339
 and now that will be enough 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:33.559
 the thing is it has honestly shown me it is far away 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.689
 this includes 11 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.149
 because we have copied it as Fri I start here 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:44.669
 such a performance has increased and that no one is best at telling guides 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:49.429
 the election Coaching Klepsch let all urban Westner cover up 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:50.389
 midnight 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.959
 by advancing 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.520
 and now they are going Greenpeace 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.150
 our minibus is good with 1 freaks 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.609
 and now the very idea is pulling them 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.529
 So we completely off 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.529
 always to nato summit for easy way 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.219
 but what is important is in a correct code 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.549
 yes Ulrich Clement Halet in love 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.909

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.909
 Climax 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.139
 now not a very good thing you can also save so Manchester Markus 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.120
 Summer act 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.150
 Sun Sung then is the Italian Marco Fröhlich must always read well 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.289
 can and now 6 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:36.800
 Red 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.349
 now haste 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.069
 so that on it rarely at the cash register the names 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.889
 30 after recording 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.729
 I just love it 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:55.050
 On May I Jojo left Cole situation that is this is 1 Grüezi saved what 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.300
 he to say Munich Leipzig 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.639
 So a storage 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.150
 So easy is that what Herbert gave her 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:05.710
 and 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.710
 it could control more upwards 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:10.860
 in the other a child 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.229
 0 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.289
 take her Steffen Hauptmann now 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.449
 the and so far not empty spaces 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.979
 Lanz he loves Bonn then we can go in eternally 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.610
 but it is now active part 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.800
 Ernst thinks our caching to say 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.770
 that just makes you successful 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.569
 rewarded 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.720
 Now she said took me helped 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.820
 it is wood to address seventh and here you can with Wittgenstein 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.680
 insert 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.169
 questionable though 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.080
 that very 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.590
 So fish comes around me in another direction - when I'm around 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.520
 Club boss pushes it's the best Hachiko is going to get there 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.389
 now it is also in East and West 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.099
 implemented 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.050
 But what else would I ever remember the law that must be Nico 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.110
 on 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.360
 so it sounds so very complicated it is actually a cinema captain 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.619
 Stephan Block 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.619
 more is not 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:19.909
 and that it helps to measure times the area we have just entered name 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:25.609
 in itself that is really a fine thing a premiere answer so can 

00:06:25.609 --> 00:06:27.249
 very simple 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:30.150
 to such large corporation too 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.040
 makes no sense 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.280
 not that which works me much better in March so I buy 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.280
 Of course, that's what brought me a little help 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.470
 and it is enough in the eighth that it continues 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.479
 yes thank you watching 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:50.150
 if Marcel Appiah credit personality in this writing 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.999
 and 4 a lecturer 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.989
 where food dapd
