00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.259
 healthy durable beautiful materials earth 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.090
 cooked draw their qualities from clay 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.040
 which constitute them a raw material 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.780
 natural that conferred occurred the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.870
 richness and diversity of its hues 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.180
 according to his origins career visit 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.460
 of bavay clay in Normandy where we 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.170
 welcome françois absolous l'escaut 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 jean-françois what kind of clay 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 find us on this career here at 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.310
 Bavans for more than one hundred and seventy 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.920
 years we extract a wide variety 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.780
 of clay the richness of the hues of 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.390
 Terracotta materials largely depends 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.370
 components this clay the amount 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.399
 iron for example influences a lot 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.520
 the colors of red rose products 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.340
 dark to the strand the earth materials 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.739
 cooked takes full advantage of all the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.329
 richness of their original terroir 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.550
 can we even talk about products 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 local no doubt it is well 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.109
 local products the careers we 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.449
 extract them wide they are located at 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.090
 immediate proximity of factories for 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.220
 avoid unnecessary transport 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.470
 employees of the quarries of the Tuileries 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.430
 brickyards their families live to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.890
 side of our factories 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 tiles and bricks are sold in 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.450
 the regions so it's really about 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 local products at a time when 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.159
 social and economic issues are 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.570
 among the first concerns the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.229
 Terracotta is a real asset for 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.880
 employment but also for the environment 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.880
 the environment precisely what impact 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.530
 do these careers have on nature 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.780
 quarries are sensitive sites 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.250
 whose exploitation is strictly 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.820
 regulated to protect 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.430
 the environment 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.159
 career managers 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.470
 geologists the machine operators 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.439
 all work together to improve 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.189
 the exploitation on which depends the durability 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.040
 of their activity 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.439
 moreover the exploitation is done by 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.390
 phases to respect biodiversity 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.670
 and that becomes the career after 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.229
 operations 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.360
 even before starting the operation 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.299
 of the career have defined precisely 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.549
 how will it be rehabilitated and what 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.950
 will be his destination 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.020
 among the examples of destination we 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.530
 can mention the return to land 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.440
 agricultural 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.319
 a natural space the transformation into 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.090
 a recreational area or even a field of 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.590
 photovoltaic panels as you the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.890
 see these are not the solutions that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.280
 missing 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.560
 in conclusion the terracotta is a 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.160
 local production a raw material 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.830
 natural exploitation sites 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.519
 controlled a true desire to preserve 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.670
 the environment 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.620
 so many essential points to good 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.910
 take into account when choosing the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.060
 building materials of your 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.060
 House 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.730
 Oh
