00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.960 
big advantage in the beginning because
I'm<00:03:14.510> not<00:03:14.630> really<00:03:14.780> used<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:15.080> playing<00:03:15.350> for

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
I'm not really used to playing for

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.020 
I'm not really used to playing for
right<00:03:16.240> but<00:03:16.900> you<00:03:17.440> know<00:03:17.530> see<00:03:17.950> what<00:03:18.100> happens<00:03:18.370> an

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
right but you know see what happens an

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.280 
right but you know see what happens an
advantage<00:03:19.480> in<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.660> beginning<00:03:20.020> might<00:03:20.140> not

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
advantage in the beginning might not

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.440 
advantage in the beginning might not
necessarily<00:03:20.470> Chinese<00:03:21.280> like<00:03:21.460> 50,000<00:03:22.120> hands<00:03:22.300> is

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
necessarily Chinese like 50,000 hands is

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.330

a<00:03:22.540> lot<00:03:22.720> Friday's<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.410> very<00:03:23.770> very<00:03:24.070> talented

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
a lot Friday's a very very talented

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.240 
a lot Friday's a very very talented
player<00:03:24.820> frightened<00:03:25.570> self<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.110> I<00:03:26.350> like

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
player frightened self but I like

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.890 
player frightened self but I like
challenges<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.300> guess<00:03:28.420> we'll<00:03:28.660> see<00:03:28.750> what

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
challenges so I guess we'll see what

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.840 
challenges so I guess we'll see what
happens<00:03:28.990> but<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.010> are<00:03:30.160> next<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.520> line<00:03:30.670> right

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850

happens but you are next in line right
Patrick<00:03:31.150> uh<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:32.290> think<00:03:32.590> David<00:03:33.010> venome<00:03:33.340> might<00:03:33.520> be

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
Patrick uh I think David venome might be

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.960 
Patrick uh I think David venome might be
next<00:03:33.850> in<00:03:34.060> line<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.960> then<00:03:35.170> a<00:03:35.410> third<00:03:36.070> so<00:03:36.820> it'll

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
next in line and then a third so it'll

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.550 
next in line and then a third so it'll
be<00:03:37.000> really<00:03:37.330> tuned<00:03:37.690> up<00:03:37.840> by<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.110> time<00:03:38.320> it<00:03:38.470> gets

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
be really tuned up by the time it gets

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
employing online as opposed to a lot oh

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.220 
employing online as opposed to a lot oh
yeah<00:04:14.980> it<00:04:15.100> is<00:04:15.190> a<00:04:15.220> little<00:04:16.049> there's<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.109> little

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
yeah it is a little there's a little

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.539 
yeah it is a little there's a little
difference<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.739> course<00:04:17.890> because<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.340> can't

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
difference of course because you can't

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.260 
difference of course because you can't
look<00:04:18.669> at<00:04:18.790> your<00:04:19.000> phone<00:04:19.150> so<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:21.270> you

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
look at your phone so you have to you

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.640 
look at your phone so you have to you
have<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.450> figure<00:04:22.690> out<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.900> lock<00:04:23.110> on<00:04:23.290> which<00:04:23.530> are

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
have to figure out a lock on which are

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.440 
have to figure out a lock on which are
doing<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.070> how<00:04:24.130> they<00:04:24.280> play<00:04:24.520> like<00:04:24.760> what<00:04:25.330> the

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
doing and how they play like what the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.270 
doing and how they play like what the
strategy<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:25.960> what<00:04:26.350> do<00:04:26.500> how<00:04:26.740> they<00:04:26.770> place<00:04:27.100> their

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
strategy is what do how they place their

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.770 
strategy is what do how they place their
hands<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:27.880> everything<00:04:28.210> else<00:04:28.330> is<00:04:28.480> more<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.720> a

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
hands and everything else is more of a

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.640 
hands and everything else is more of a
technical<00:04:28.990> game<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.440> lot<00:04:30.960> so<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.350> guess<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
technical game a lot so that I guess the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.370 
technical game a lot so that I guess the
strategy<00:04:33.010> does<00:04:33.190> differ<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:33.580> little<00:04:33.700> bit

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
strategy does differ a little bit

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.810 
strategy does differ a little bit
because<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.770> reason<00:04:35.800> don't<00:04:36.490> know<00:04:36.610> where

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
because of that reason don't know where

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.610 
because of that reason don't know where
you're<00:04:37.330> playing<00:04:37.540> live<00:04:37.780> you<00:04:38.050> kind<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.350> look<00:04:38.440> at

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
you're playing live you kind of look at

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.560 
you're playing live you kind of look at
your<00:04:38.770> opponent<00:04:39.160> kind<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:39.970> feel<00:04:40.240> what<00:04:40.450> they're

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
your opponent kind of feel what they're

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.110 
your opponent kind of feel what they're
doing<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:41.560> can't<00:04:42.130> do<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.430> alone<00:04:42.610> while<00:04:42.940> so

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
doing you can't do that alone while so

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.580 
doing you can't do that alone while so
you<00:04:43.210> kinda<00:04:43.419> got<00:04:43.600> this<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.900> lot<00:04:44.050> more<00:04:44.169> guess<00:04:44.470> work

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
you kinda got this a lot more guess work

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.030 
you kinda got this a lot more guess work
for<00:04:44.860> me<00:04:45.010> and

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
for me and

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.090 
for me and
but<00:04:48.040> you're<00:04:48.160> only<00:04:48.310> guess<00:04:48.640> well<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.870> know<00:04:50.100> yeah

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
but you're only guess well you know yeah

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.700 
but you're only guess well you know yeah
it's<00:04:51.280> just<00:04:51.460> your<00:04:51.610> guess<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:51.820> better<00:04:52.120> than<00:04:52.420> most

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
it's just your guess is better than most

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.260 
it's just your guess is better than most
