00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.390
 polluted from são paulo do brasil 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.439
 including against a car that will give 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.880
 to run on the fringe 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.880
 We'll see how to get there first. 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.430
 where you just started the journey here in 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.720
 bridge of the remedies in the river tietê 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.880
 We 're heading towards the bridge. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.980
 Banners which will be the point of 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.990
 departure to leave the delivery 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.690
 between ovar and the car on the marginal tietê 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.760
 direction east side of sao paulo 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.080
 is a course of 12 kilometers to seven 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.080
 Daughter 's morning time 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.810
 is being towed now is ours 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.640
 boat broke a little trash 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.510
 the only way we continue to be 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.510
 towed by the noise 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.700
 it's seven in the morning we are here 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.840
 in front of the flag bridge from where 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.850
 will get out of the car 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.500
 are six boats that people who 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.720
 The race will start soon I went 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.210
 run the course of 12 kilometers 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.440
 here from the flags bridge to the bridge 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.600
 of the remedies 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.350
 where the marginal tietê meets with 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.350
 marginal pine trees 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.570
 started now even though the visit was 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.850
 very beautiful, the smell is very strong and 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.550
 early in the evening every night 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.920
 at the same time made many waves so the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.320
 people stayed very could fall or not more 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.610
 So far in the second all right and we're going 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.610
 see how you 're going to stay until the end 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.319
 now that he 's going through a 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.810
 bridge where who was in love 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.939
 Can you see, will you have people living? 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.879
 under that bridge here in this 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:42.730
 marginal is the home of the people themselves 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.400
 protect themselves there and it is very difficult to see 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.090
 how do you get access to that place 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.090
 looks like an entire family 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.880
 at this moment that we have a stop 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.530
 here in the middle of the course and you can see 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.780
 as the marginal tietê west of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.570
 white castle is completely stopped 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.000
 It's 76 now, we're just going to accelerate. 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.590
 for you to see the difference as 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.590
 really stopped traffic right there 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.010
 are now 10 to 8 we are here 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.810
 in front of the non-diamond onion has 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.730
 against the marginal pine trees running 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.340
 I just finished answering via 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.270
 marginal is completely 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.800
 congested mainly in the 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.040
 white castello 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.020
 and that was the diary's journey here 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.360
 on the river tietê 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.360
 on this working day Tuesday 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.739
 we have two great rivers that I have 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.599
 and pines 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.090
 these days may be navigable not only 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.340
 for leisure transport transport tietê 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.079
 will facilitate a lot of traffic here in 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.909
 marginal we have that a large 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.909
 channel would give standardized test and used 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.159
 to ski to paddle how was it 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.090
 old is the river has this tietê 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.599
 potential 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.449
 the view of a boat on the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:21.269
 Quick way is a boat 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.940
 It's sporting you besides the transparaná 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.320
 one is a somewhat surreal sight to right 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.330
 We put down the bridge and lives 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.949
 flags for near the imb more 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.260
 near the piqueri bridge a little 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.130
 before the bandeirantes the traffic stopped the 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.979
 boat of the others he got 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.449
 walking around for 20 and 25 minutes with the 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.240
 boat to and 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:46.490
 and so we had almost zero problem is 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.490
 which made the river navigable
