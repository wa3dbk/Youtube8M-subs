00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello and welcome wrecks 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.950
 Today we want to look like yourself 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.280
 the htc desire 610 in the playing tempo 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.139
 Rahn 2 the trigger 2 and modern combat 4 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.020
 We had a few days ago 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.150
 only the desire 816 becomes so 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.220
 Now a pretty nice comparison 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.359
 beforehand how to do the usual I have that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.980
 Of course, a new smartphone 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 will not start up any running 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.670
 apps as soon as I finish a game 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.039
 I 'll be that again too 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.599
 close before I start a new one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.289
 Of course, all players are not 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.270
 preinstalled 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.160
 but you can fight each other and temple two 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 The trigger is two free in place to 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 work east compulsory play store 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 download 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 Now we started to enjoy it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.719
 Let's go Let's start 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.870
 Temple ran two I have it at the same time 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.699
 htc desire 816 already said is not 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 the most elaborate game but we have 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 here also no high end smartphone 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.239
 but with the desire 610 he ein 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 middle class smartphone insofar will be 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.110
 that's also very interesting what we but 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.909
 again have the possibility here that is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 That's why I'm setting the sound now 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.280
 speakers rather times in the middle 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.110
 you saw it at desire 816 that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 whole was then partly so loud that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.100
 I do not understand myself anymore 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 I have something negative of course I am 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.600
 hope that comes here in the video 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.180
 reasonably well over but we want 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 now look how the desire 8 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 610 Sorry, I'm coming 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.229
 even with the names messed up like 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.439
 That's the way it strikes the desire s 816 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 we had no problems with the 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.110
 pace two should also be here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.159
 because we have the same 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.430
 processor the qs d400 quad core with 1 2 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.500
 ghz kernel then there are 1 5 gb 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.060
 RAM Yes we do here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.490
 the whole time if we go 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.079
 all not seen but as I said 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.610
 The hardware should definitely be there 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.530
 So there you should not be 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.729
 have to worry and I think you 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.229
 looks quite good the whole thing 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.990
 runs pretty smoothly we have too 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.520
 no hd resolution in the display like the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.160
 desire 8 108 116 but we have here 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.480
 the desire 610 a cow hd resolution 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.810
 so 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.790
 960 x 540 pixel there has the gpu then 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.950
 Of course, not so much to do 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.569
 so far that could be done 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.790
 you expect you too see the 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.310
 viewing angle stability of the display 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.709
 yes she is not bad but she is 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.370
 not as good as for example at 8 am 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.290
 I think this 816 is something altogether 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.709
 too bad the contrast values ​​are not synonymous 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.019
 so good 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.190
 the colors do not look that intense, though 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.190
 the performance is definitely 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.579
 neat and ever to stamp 2 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.230
 and on it goes with dead trigger 2 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.209
 should be very interesting now 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.690
 that will be more elaborate 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.849
 we also have 0 4 ghz clocking here or 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.340
 in the 0.4 gg it is different 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.180
 Clocking a lower clocking than the 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.120
 htc desire 816 to give him also 0 5 gb 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.440
 less but I have it with me 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.299
 Temperatures are what we have here 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.840
 even a lower resolution so only 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:11.120
 QHD are changed I must dare 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.700
 now and again to say that that is 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.500
 whole will not take much somewhere 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.329
 which one noticed however already immediately 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.000
 is the comparatively lower 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.099
 pixeldichte and simply the 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.760
 Viewing angle stability here, too, I have 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.410
 set the graphic details they were 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.329
 not ex works, they were on 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.030
 low as I said at Qualcomm 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.859
 snapdragon becomes 801 or 800 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.590
 meanwhile already recognized automatically 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.819
 here at a course d400 appears the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.910
 not yet the case 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.950
 now even relatively independent of 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.660
 the timing as we said we had 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.829
 different timings at the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.609
 two smartphones 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.380
 otherwise here the display does not 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.819
 Bad figure say so this time 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.370
 have also seen a few here 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.500
 small micro darker but the 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.269
 Contrast the brightness the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.069
 viewing angle stability that's easy 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.849
 not quite as good as the htc 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.810
 desire 816 but like the performance 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.910
 me relatively well 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.609
 and yes of course one also notices that 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.989
 lower pixeldichte but yes that works 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.879
 Alright I think you see 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.220
 also the display mirror much more 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.650
 when her time 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.320
 directly to the gaming video with this one 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.829
 816 comparison but that's already in 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.590
 order 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.780
 By the way, a few words to desire 610 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.870
 at the moment it should not be 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.250
 be sure to come to the free traders 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.320
 they probably will eventually 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:36.040
 in the offer have but once too 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.870
 the big network operators and then too 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.130
 first only in the color blue 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.570
 but let's wait and see 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.090
 maybe there will come the 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.680
 another so much to bettringer two me 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.050
 Apart from that, the performance is 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.760
 quite neat and last but not least 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.070
 look at us now even more modern 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.780
 combat four more closely here as well 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.210
 unfortunately the on screen keys disappear 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.910
 not with the trigger 2 already lies 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.800
 probably due to lack of customization and 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.840
 What I have just forgot to say yes 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.240
 the checker two the usa and 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.280
 Speakers also sound here 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.470
 this yes I'll tell beginners until 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.900
 middle class smartphone again 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.970
 well tell me mid-range smartphone 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.680
 I have to get her back here now 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.910
 put highway volume because I am 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.210
 otherwise not understand yourself 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.919
 So in this age class, I say now 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.310
 this is quite unique 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.980
 I find pretty cool from HTC that they 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.419
 also on the desire 610 on the colorful 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.070
 have set speakers that is not 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.710
 of course and is natural 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.600
 somewhere quite a 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.030
 quite a unique feature in the 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.919
 Compared with other smartphones these 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.080
 hardware class I say now to 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.180
 for example, a moto g that he does 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.430
 cheaper is noticeably cheaper and 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.780
 just a better display has that 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.430
 one must mention whatsoever 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.840
 now let's look at modern combat four 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.600
 hand that is already a right 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.000
 elaborate play one notes here 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.940
 also that the htc desire 610 something 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.680
 warmer but not uncomfortable 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.240
 Let's take a look at this at the beginning 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.660
 Now, there are times like there 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.880
 times framerate break-in looks here though 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:11.190
 I still have to do everything well 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.190
 honestly we want something around 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.420
 and that too seems to work pretty well 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:26.740
 Let's go forward and duck here 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.390
 us time otherwise end still a good I 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.810
 I'll go for a grenade now 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.620
 ahead 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.050
 that's already part of it 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:39.640
 the explosion was relatively fluid 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:42.340
 I have to say I like the graphics 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.930
 Of course I can only do it again 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.880
 Repeat one already realizes that the 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.020
 color representation of the display not so 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:52.240
 it's nice as the htc desire 816 it is 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.220
 the viewing angle stability is not 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.210
 so great but otherwise I think 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.250
 we saw very well 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.900
 the modern combat four, however, too 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.090
 runs relatively smoothly and there 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.890
 that's what it's all about in the end 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.290
 in conclusion, all in all 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.390
 The desire 610 is also really suitable 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.280
 good for mobile gaming performance 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.340
 is neat the graphics but synonymous 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.430
 not as good as he is at the desire 816 or 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.810
 have liked even the htc one m8 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.820
 Here again we have the stereo front 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.890
 loudspeaker as something disturbs is the 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.419
 comparatively low pixeldichte the 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.220
 nights so not particularly great 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:27.100
 viewing angle stability please excuse 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.900
 and also the color representation already 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.229
 Somewhere a little to be desired 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.120
 leaves 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:33.040
 yes people that's it again from 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.470
 this short gaming it with the htc 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.270
 desire 610 I hope you have it 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:42.330
 I like to thank you for watching 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.330
 us in this sense until next time
