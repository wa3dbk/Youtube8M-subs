technology<00:00:07.180> that<00:00:07.419> I've<00:00:07.569> been<00:00:07.720> using<00:00:07.959> in<00:00:08.259> my

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
technology that I've been using in my

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.869 
technology that I've been using in my
practice<00:00:08.679> and<00:00:09.190> which<00:00:09.370> has<00:00:09.519> completely

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:09.879 
practice and which has completely

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.199 
practice and which has completely
changed<00:00:10.179> the<00:00:10.990> way<00:00:11.019> I<00:00:11.200> practice<00:00:11.700> with<00:00:12.700> my<00:00:12.940> wound

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:13.209 
changed the way I practice with my wound

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.570 
care patients on a daily basis were
faced<00:00:16.689> with<00:00:16.810> really<00:00:17.410> complicated<00:00:18.100> wounds<00:00:18.340> as

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
faced with really complicated wounds as

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.179 
faced with really complicated wounds as
providers<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:20.199> patients<00:00:20.650> are<00:00:20.740> not<00:00:20.830> getting

providers the patients are not getting
easier<00:00:21.550> if<00:00:21.670> anything<00:00:22.090> they're<00:00:22.240> getting<00:00:22.510> more

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
easier if anything they're getting more

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.390 
easier if anything they're getting more
complicated<00:00:23.050> because<00:00:23.470> we're<00:00:23.800> seeing<00:00:24.099> him<00:00:24.279> at

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
complicated because we're seeing him at

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.919 
complicated because we're seeing him at
the<00:00:24.490> later<00:00:24.730> stages<00:00:25.150> in<00:00:25.510> their<00:00:25.630> treatment

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
the later stages in their treatment

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.460 
the later stages in their treatment
cycle<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:28.060> thing<00:00:28.210> hasn't<00:00:28.390> changed<00:00:28.570> we<00:00:29.439> still

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
cycle one thing hasn't changed we still

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.169 
cycle one thing hasn't changed we still
have<00:00:29.859> to<00:00:30.099> make<00:00:30.279> sure<00:00:30.310> that<00:00:30.550> these<00:00:30.910> patients

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
have to make sure that these patients

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.840 
have to make sure that these patients
are<00:00:31.660> treated<00:00:32.379> in<00:00:32.649> an<00:00:32.829> efficient<00:00:33.280> manner<00:00:33.430> are

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
are treated in an efficient manner are

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.410 
are treated in an efficient manner are
able<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.870> go<00:00:35.020> back<00:00:35.200> to<00:00:35.379> their<00:00:35.530> daily<00:00:35.860> living

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
able to go back to their daily living

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.240 
able to go back to their daily living
therefore<00:00:37.420> rapid<00:00:37.780> healing<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.379> an<00:00:38.649> important

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
therefore rapid healing is an important

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.930 
therefore rapid healing is an important
part<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:39.879> our<00:00:40.539> goal<00:00:40.960> to<00:00:41.620> allow<00:00:42.039> these<00:00:42.280> patients

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
part of our goal to allow these patients

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.700 
part of our goal to allow these patients
to<00:00:43.450> be<00:00:43.539> discharged<00:00:44.050> earlier<00:00:44.410> from<00:00:44.649> the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
to be discharged earlier from the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.680 
to be discharged earlier from the
hospital<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:45.520> return<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.420> their<00:00:46.539> daily

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
hospital and return to their daily

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.920 
hospital and return to their daily
function<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.879> going<00:00:49.090> from<00:00:49.329> point<00:00:49.539> A<00:00:49.719> to<00:00:49.750> point

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
function so going from point A to point

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.260 
function so going from point A to point
B<00:00:50.260> there<00:00:51.100> are<00:00:51.219> principles<00:00:51.550> that<00:00:51.879> we<00:00:52.030> still

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
B there are principles that we still

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.840 
B there are principles that we still
have<00:00:52.480> to<00:00:52.629> follow<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.980> is<00:00:54.160> we<00:00:54.280> need<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.550> start

have to follow that is we need to start

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.150 
have to follow that is we need to start
with<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.239> breeding<00:00:55.660> all<00:00:55.840> our<00:00:56.500> wounds<00:00:56.800> and

with the breeding all our wounds and

in the hospital for those procedures the
one<00:01:45.490> thing<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.850> we're<00:01:46.000> faced<00:01:46.300> with<00:01:46.570> is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
one thing that we're faced with is

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.510 
one thing that we're faced with is
getting<00:01:46.990> approval<00:01:47.680> for<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.130> negative

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
the insurance companies and that's what

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.690 
the insurance companies and that's what
ends<00:01:53.590> up<00:01:53.650> keeping<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.130> patients<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.610> the

ends up keeping the patients in the

ends up keeping the patients in the
hospital<00:01:56.070> therefore<00:01:57.070> we<00:01:57.220> decided<00:01:57.780> to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
hospital therefore we decided to

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.990 
hospital therefore we decided to
evaluate<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.410> efficacy<00:01:59.710> of<00:02:00.010> a<00:02:00.400> single

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
evaluate the efficacy of a single
