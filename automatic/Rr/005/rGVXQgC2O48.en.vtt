and<00:02:29.750> I'd<00:02:30.110> say<00:02:30.410> hold<00:02:30.770> it<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.190> about<00:02:33.069> hold<00:02:34.069> it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
and I'd say hold it for about hold it

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.020 
and I'd say hold it for about hold it
for<00:02:34.700> maybe<00:02:34.940> like<00:02:35.650> 6<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:37.010> 7<00:02:38.440> seconds<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.190> then

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
for maybe like 6 to 7 seconds and then

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:48.430 
for maybe like 6 to 7 seconds and then
no<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:43.489> want<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.380> kind<00:02:45.380> of<00:02:46.630> grab<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.930> curl<00:02:48.230> in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
no you want to kind of grab the curl in

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.120 
no you want to kind of grab the curl in
your<00:02:48.620> hand<00:02:48.920> when<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.310> take<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:49.910> out<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.890> then

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
your hand when you take it out so then

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.509 
your hand when you take it out so then
yeah<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.390> take<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.720> off<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.019> barrel<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:55.459> you

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
yeah you take it off the barrel and you

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.610 
yeah you take it off the barrel and you
bring<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.090> up<00:02:56.300> and<00:02:56.600> keep<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:56.959> curled<00:02:57.320> up<00:02:57.590> like

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
bring it up and keep it curled up like

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.610 
bring it up and keep it curled up like
this<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.370> how<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.760> was<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> barrel<00:02:59.900> then

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
this like how it was on the barrel then

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.990 
this like how it was on the barrel then
you<00:03:01.280> want<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.580> put<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:02.319> like<00:03:03.319> pin<00:03:03.800> pearl<00:03:04.220> pin<00:03:04.640> on

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
you want to put a like pin pearl pin on

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.240 
you want to put a like pin pearl pin on
it<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.900> that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.830 

yeah<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.670> want<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.030> keep<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.390> pinned<00:03:14.630> up

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
yeah so you want to keep it pinned up

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.789 
yeah so you want to keep it pinned up
like<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> I<00:03:16.730> think<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.630> reason<00:03:17.959> why<00:03:18.140> it

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
like this so I think the reason why it

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.640 
like this so I think the reason why it
will<00:03:19.220> like<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.000> have<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.269> do<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:21.440> kind

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
will like you have to do this you kind

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.930 
will like you have to do this you kind
of<00:03:21.709> have<00:03:21.829> to<00:03:21.860> let<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.220> hair<00:03:22.430> cool<00:03:22.459> down

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
of have to let the hair cool down

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.440 
of have to let the hair cool down
because<00:03:24.100> this<00:03:25.100> hair<00:03:25.400> doesn't<00:03:25.670> respond<00:03:26.209> well

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
because this hair doesn't respond well

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.600 
because this hair doesn't respond well
to<00:03:26.480> heat<00:03:26.930> that's<00:03:27.260> what<00:03:27.500> that's<00:03:28.190> what<00:03:28.430> the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
to heat that's what that's what the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.370 
to heat that's what that's what the
problem<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.120> like<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.390> doesn't<00:03:29.540> respond<00:03:30.110> well

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
problem is like it doesn't respond well

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.460 
problem is like it doesn't respond well
to<00:03:30.410> heat<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.269> it<00:03:32.269> just<00:03:32.720> doesn't<00:03:33.019> like<00:03:33.140> to<00:03:33.290> hold

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
to heat and it just doesn't like to hold

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.110 
to heat and it just doesn't like to hold
a<00:03:33.560> curl<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.890> doesn't<00:03:34.280> respond<00:03:34.610> very<00:03:34.820> well<00:03:34.940> to

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
a curl it doesn't respond very well to

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.430 
a curl it doesn't respond very well to
heat<00:03:35.840> or<00:03:36.170> curling<00:03:36.860> or<00:03:37.130> anything<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.670> that

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
heat or curling or anything like that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.930 
heat or curling or anything like that
so<00:03:39.440> what<00:03:41.620> pin<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.739> like<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.730> can

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
so what pin it like this so that it can

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.590 
so what pin it like this so that it can
cool<00:03:44.120> down<00:03:44.410> awesome<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.880> use<00:03:46.880> suave

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
did do this

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.240 
did do this
on<00:04:28.070> like<00:04:28.790> my<00:04:29.000> actual<00:04:29.240> wig<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.050> didn't<00:04:30.500> cook

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
on like my actual wig like I didn't cook

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.189 
on like my actual wig like I didn't cook
the<00:04:31.400> track<00:04:31.610> like<00:04:31.790> this<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:32.300> did<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:32.960> right<00:04:33.080> on

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
the track like this I did it right on

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.320 
the track like this I did it right on
the<00:04:33.290> wing<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.710> does<00:04:34.040> work<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:34.790> do<00:04:35.090> it

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
the wing so it does work if you do it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.170 
the wing so it does work if you do it
I'm<00:04:35.660> straight<00:04:36.020> off<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.380> head<00:04:36.560> but<00:04:37.550> because<00:04:38.150> I

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
I'm straight off the head but because I

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.490 
I'm straight off the head but because I
don't<00:04:38.600> want<00:04:38.750> to<00:04:38.840> curl<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.199> right<00:04:39.350> now<00:04:39.470> I

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
don't want to curl this right now I

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.850 
don't want to curl this right now I
decided<00:04:40.039> to<00:04:40.310> just<00:04:40.490> show<00:04:40.669> you<00:04:40.729> guys<00:04:41.090> an<00:04:41.300> example

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
decided to just show you guys an example

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.170 
decided to just show you guys an example
so<00:04:42.860> we're<00:04:43.070> gonna<00:04:43.190> wait<00:04:43.370> five<00:04:43.580> minutes<00:04:43.820> for

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
so we're gonna wait five minutes for

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570 
so we're gonna wait five minutes for
this<00:04:44.360> in<00:04:44.780> five<00:04:45.139> minutes<00:04:45.470> I'll<00:04:45.949> come<00:04:46.009> back<00:04:46.400> and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
this in five minutes I'll come back and

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.450 
this in five minutes I'll come back and
show<00:04:46.669> you<00:04:46.850> guys<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.300> result<00:04:47.630> of<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:47.870> curl

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
show you guys the result of the curl

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.070 
show you guys the result of the curl
okay<00:04:49.460> so<00:04:49.729> I<00:04:49.759> think<00:04:49.910> it's<00:04:50.240> been<00:04:50.449> about<00:04:50.750> five

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
okay so I think it's been about five

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.550 
okay so I think it's been about five
minutes<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:52.130> what<00:04:52.850> you<00:04:52.970> do<00:04:53.120> pick<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:54.139> pin<00:04:54.380> off

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
minutes so what you do pick the pin off

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.820 
minutes so what you do pick the pin off
the<00:04:54.740> curl<00:04:55.009> oh<00:04:55.509> I<00:04:56.509> hope<00:04:56.840> this<00:04:57.020> right<00:04:57.350> cuz<00:04:57.650> it's

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
the curl oh I hope this right cuz it's

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.080 
the curl oh I hope this right cuz it's
like<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.850> know<00:04:59.030> it's<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.570> Tron<00:04:59.870> arrant<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.530> think

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
like you know it's a Tron arrant I think

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
like you know it's a Tron arrant I think
sometimes<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.210> word<00:05:02.360> sometimes<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.930> doesn't

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
sometimes the word sometimes it doesn't

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.340 
sometimes the word sometimes it doesn't
but<00:05:03.410> whooping<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:06.430> undo<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> curl<00:05:07.820> and<00:05:08.350> there

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
but whooping so undo the curl and there

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.689 
but whooping so undo the curl and there
you<00:05:09.530> go<00:05:11.800> tell<00:05:12.800> me<00:05:12.949> real<00:05:13.160> don't<00:05:13.400> girl<00:05:15.580> tell<00:05:16.580> me

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
me that we're don't curl because from

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.050 
me that we're don't curl because from
what<00:05:22.970> I<00:05:23.000> see<00:05:24.099> Rhea<00:05:25.099> definitely<00:05:25.910> curl<00:05:26.410> she<00:05:27.410> do

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
what I see Rhea definitely curl she do

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.020 
what I see Rhea definitely curl she do
so<00:05:29.110> don't<00:05:30.110> like<00:05:30.259> the<00:05:30.380> people<00:05:30.530> who<00:05:31.400> say<00:05:31.610> that

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
so don't like the people who say that

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.370 
so don't like the people who say that
this<00:05:32.210> hair<00:05:32.449> did<00:05:32.630> not<00:05:32.810> curl<00:05:35.260> discourage<00:05:36.260> you

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
this hair did not curl discourage you

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.800 
this hair did not curl discourage you
from<00:05:36.410> buying<00:05:36.770> this<00:05:36.919> hair<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.880> does<00:05:38.210> curl<00:05:38.570> you

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
from buying this hair it does curl you

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.620 
from buying this hair it does curl you
just<00:05:39.020> have<00:05:39.139> to<00:05:39.289> curl<00:05:39.500> it<00:05:39.650> right<00:05:39.860> like<00:05:40.599> okay

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
just have to curl it right like okay

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.899 
just have to curl it right like okay
yeah<00:05:42.050> it<00:05:42.590> doesn't<00:05:42.830> curl<00:05:43.159> if<00:05:43.310> you<00:05:43.430> just<00:05:43.639> put<00:05:43.880> a

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
yeah it doesn't curl if you just put a

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.909 
yeah it doesn't curl if you just put a
curling<00:05:44.150> iron<00:05:44.389> on<00:05:44.690> it<00:05:44.900> you<00:05:45.500> gotta<00:05:45.680> actually

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
curling iron on it you gotta actually

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.810 
curling iron on it you gotta actually
like<00:05:46.460> take<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.479> actual<00:05:47.930> steps<00:05:48.289> to<00:05:49.070> how<00:05:49.460> it

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
like take the actual steps to how it

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.010 
like take the actual steps to how it
curls<00:05:51.610> so<00:05:52.610> I<00:05:52.639> think<00:05:52.970> this<00:05:53.570> would<00:05:53.810> be<00:05:53.870> really

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
curls so I think this would be really

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.830 
curls so I think this would be really
pretty<00:05:54.620> like<00:05:54.919> I<00:05:55.159> probably<00:05:55.820> am<00:05:56.270> gonna<00:05:56.510> ever

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
pretty like I probably am gonna ever

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.899 
pretty like I probably am gonna ever
wear<00:05:57.199> this<00:05:57.409> hair<00:05:57.740> straight<00:05:58.010> for<00:05:58.310> a<00:05:58.370> while<00:05:58.520> I'm

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
wear this hair straight for a while I'm

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.909 
wear this hair straight for a while I'm
probably<00:05:59.270> gonna<00:05:59.449> end<00:05:59.539> up<00:05:59.810> curling<00:06:00.530> this<00:06:00.740> and

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
probably gonna end up curling this and

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.790 
probably gonna end up curling this and
of<00:06:01.310> course<00:06:01.490> this<00:06:01.699> is<00:06:01.880> the<00:06:02.000> curl<00:06:02.270> that<00:06:02.590> came<00:06:03.590> out

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
of course this is the curl that came out

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.820 
of course this is the curl that came out
from<00:06:04.190> my<00:06:04.250> from<00:06:05.210> my<00:06:05.240> barrel<00:06:05.810> and<00:06:05.990> this<00:06:06.440> thing<00:06:06.680> is

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
from my from my barrel and this thing is

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.379 
from my from my barrel and this thing is
huge<00:06:07.039> like<00:06:07.430> I<00:06:08.830> don't<00:06:09.830> know<00:06:10.010> how<00:06:10.159> big<00:06:10.340> this<00:06:10.550> is<00:06:10.760> I

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
huge like I don't know how big this is I

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.750 
huge like I don't know how big this is I
want<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.229> say<00:06:12.380> like<00:06:12.530> a<00:06:12.590> two<00:06:12.889> inch<00:06:13.130> barrel<00:06:13.490> I

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
want to say like a two inch barrel I

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.219 
want to say like a two inch barrel I
don't<00:06:13.909> know<00:06:14.000> how<00:06:14.120> big<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:14.389> is<00:06:14.479> but<00:06:14.690> that's<00:06:15.139> a

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
don't know how big it is but that's a

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.800 
don't know how big it is but that's a
big<00:06:15.409> barrel<00:06:15.800> so<00:06:16.340> of<00:06:16.760> course<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.300> came<00:06:17.449> out<00:06:17.630> with

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
big barrel so of course it came out with

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.680 
big barrel so of course it came out with
a<00:06:17.840> big<00:06:18.050> curl<00:06:18.380> not<00:06:19.010> if<00:06:19.159> you<00:06:19.370> do<00:06:19.610> a<00:06:19.970> 1<00:06:20.240> inch<00:06:20.419> barrel

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
a big curl not if you do a 1 inch barrel

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.520 
a big curl not if you do a 1 inch barrel
or<00:06:21.310> smaller<00:06:22.310> than<00:06:22.729> that<00:06:23.030> barrel<00:06:23.960> of<00:06:24.169> course

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
or smaller than that barrel of course

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.649 
or smaller than that barrel of course
the<00:06:25.310> curl<00:06:25.580> is<00:06:25.669> gonna<00:06:25.820> be<00:06:25.970> a<00:06:26.000> lot<00:06:26.150> more<00:06:26.360> tighter

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
the curl is gonna be a lot more tighter

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:33.700 
the curl is gonna be a lot more tighter
and<00:06:27.220> um<00:06:28.220> just<00:06:28.449> a<00:06:29.449> lot<00:06:29.900> more<00:06:30.710> better<00:06:31.220> so<00:06:31.880> um<00:06:32.710> a

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
and um just a lot more better so um a

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.909 
and um just a lot more better so um a
lot<00:06:33.979> more<00:06:34.250> however<00:06:34.610> your<00:06:35.330> barrel<00:06:36.080> is<00:06:36.260> however

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
lot more however your barrel is however

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.730 
lot more however your barrel is however
big<00:06:37.099> your<00:06:37.250> barrel<00:06:37.580> is<00:06:37.760> so<00:06:38.750> yeah

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
big your barrel is so yeah

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.350 
big your barrel is so yeah
it<00:06:40.100> does<00:06:40.460> curl<00:06:41.380> it's<00:06:42.380> a<00:06:43.130> loose<00:06:43.430> curl<00:06:43.820> it<00:06:44.060> isn't

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
it does curl it's a loose curl it isn't

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.870

a<00:06:44.450> tight<00:06:44.780> curl<00:06:45.320> but<00:06:45.710> it<00:06:45.860> is<00:06:45.980> a<00:06:46.010> loose<00:06:46.280> curl<00:06:46.640> and

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
a tight curl but it is a loose curl and

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.600 
a tight curl but it is a loose curl and
it's<00:06:47.390> a<00:06:47.480> crop<00:06:47.720> and<00:06:48.260> that's<00:06:49.010> not<00:06:49.160> the<00:06:49.280> only<00:06:49.340> one
