 As you saw in the report, the plants 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.859
 natural alternatives are a good option for 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.540
 replace the artificial heart but 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.389
 when it comes to putting ideas into practice 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.289
 there are many doubts, especially in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.330
 relation to reporter care is seven 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.609
 zanotti visited a production area of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.279
 in the region of Campinas and now 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.689
 tips for the magic of the date not 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.779
 finish before the time 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 she has popular Brazilian names 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 as the parrot's beak area of the tail 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.719
 euphorbia pulse rhyme is considered to be 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.739
 christmas because of the living red of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 sheets 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.840
 it requires little care and remains 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 well in this period only in Ceasa Campinas 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.840
 were marketed in the months of 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 November and December 2012 350 thousand 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 glasses 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 the expectation is to increase sales by 5% 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.030
 at the end of the year 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.050
 in fact the flowers that have Christmas colors 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.500
 are the best bromeliads 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.080
 caches call out divas and asturias that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 are also well researched in 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.080
 function of being used as a tree of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.960
 Christmas 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.909
 the pines still have the lead this 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.640
 farm in santo antÃ´nio de posse is a 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.170
 of the largest producers of 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.720
 country christmas 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.150
 six hectares are filled with the tui 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.310
 Dutch 90 percent of all 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.670
 produced here comes out in this 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.820
 beyond the format and beauty they 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.369
 exude a pleasant citrus aroma 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.270
 just touch the branches to feel the 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.460
 perfume 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 The curious thing is that the name does not have much to 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 see with the plant 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.570
 in fact it originates from the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.549
 but it was the Dutch who 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.560
 introduced the species in Brazil from 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.240
 Your name is Dutch 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.369
 at this time of year size plus 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.659
 searched around one meter in height 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.170
 for decoration 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.909
 but it can reach up to two meters 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.399
 but for this and for it will be 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.520
 harnessed in the coming years it takes 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.020
 following some rules in care is 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.110
 necessary to leave the plant in a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.630
 well ventilated environment where you can 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.300
 also sun 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.850
 direct on it for about two hours in the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.520
 day and it is also important to keep the 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.340
 substrate that the land of it always damp 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.190
 how to do watering never directly in the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.980
 plant always on the substrate on the ground 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.260
 So you get a glass of water and play 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.860
 into the substrate and allow the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.860
 water it is possible to keep the tree in pots 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.920
 for up to three years after the recommended 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.710
 replanting the land on the farm 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.470
 thousands of vases follow for all 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.730
 regions of Brazil by the sensitivity of 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.220
 plant at the time of decorating less 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.750
 best for not 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.600
 overload and break the branches 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.110
 the suggestion of this floral designer are 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.060
 lightweight props such as ties 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.510
 You can buy a tie ready for you. 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:12.290
 can do at home and that it does not 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:17.060
 plant it does not hurt tui's actions 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.820
 so you see that it is quite simple and 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.920
 It gives a very beautiful Christmas effect. 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.010
 another very interesting option is 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.930
 a wire ribbon she does not squeeze plant 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.240
 then she will decorate and will not 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.560
 do not go will not hold the 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.540
 plant and will give the decoration the beauty o 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.050
 detail that we want to tour 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.450
 but the greatest danger is enlightenment if you 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.360
 want light to act you put on foot 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.690
 tree in the decoration below but he 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.250
 it is because she suffers from the heat then 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.360
 most of the pickup trucks that we 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.640
 market today will warm and 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.650
 They will end up burning and it will pass 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.650
 yours will last a lot less
