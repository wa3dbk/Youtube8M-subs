00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.910
 welcome everyone to the description you already 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:22.650
 understand what will be discussed let's 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.939
 let's start this clock 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 each component is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:39.449
 bench 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:48.600
 so here it is called here and the model points 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:54.400
 Now I will try here 10-15 cm and 10-15 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.420
 This means that the watch was bought for 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.760
 comparisons here with this watch kill and 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.610
 key 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 Well, sort of like the reviews company 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.729
 good skmei 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.310
 how would she move forward now reviews 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 good ones 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.670
 make good watches 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.750
 as if, but I chose this 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:28.150
 model poke rubber strap 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.680
 such here are holograms to here what 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.880
 numerical show here so here they are 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.780
 we 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.360
 Well, the protective film is still red 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.050
 strip on the wedge and such a hologram 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.659
 points too, all on these cogs 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.659
 or samorezika hryunova like that here 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:56.290
 mounted back cover which is of 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:01.620
 stainless steel made here here too 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.620
 such screws or bolts 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:13.370
 there is no glass here is more accurate 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.940
 not natural glass principle this is not 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.450
 interferes 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:24.230
 why is this not a logo written with this 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:29.540
 sides and from this side it is written here 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:35.420
 so that's 50 meters that is roughly speaking 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:39.110
 not too waterproof less than these 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 Well, this watch is also cheaper as it were 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.850
 then there are several 10-15 few 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.280
 modifications 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.660
 There is a modification that is completely 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.100
 black dial 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.459
 well there is one thing but i saw them kept in 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.640
 hands 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.510
 When buying this watch there is one thing but 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.800
 there if on a bright day 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.030
 then roughly it is necessary constantly 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.150
 use of illumination on light Chikoy 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.730
 little screen here you can see here you 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.730
 see yes everything is clearly visible without 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.790
 all kinds of highlights Illumination 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:22.160
 by the way here is very interesting such 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.549
 I like her 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.850
 show hour glow only numbers here 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.850
 So 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:38.600
 that is, not all wounds from the figure so here they are 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.600
 glow well and still a lot 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:53.050
 Highlighted arrows that is to say 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:54.800
 here is a double 2 like a double clock 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.590
 here by the arrow 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.850
 clock shows seconds 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.140
 minutes hours and electronically 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.540
 but electronic watch here is more 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.680
 simpler simpler in what plan means 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:16.070
 here we have in these hours by 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:22.370
 electronic clock functionality 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:25.310
 seconds month day show 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:31.970
 and the day of the week is further here 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:37.310
 stopwatch further here there is an alarm clock yes 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:42.250
 and in general, everything is here down here 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:45.979
 strip on it can be set 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.479
 sound hentai tie the private signal and 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.990
 enable alarm 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.310
 show well, of course time 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.350
 12-24 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:59.720
 that is, you can put 12 can be 24 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.200
 Here are such a watch so call and 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.130
 now look and technical 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.130
 specifications 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:47.150
 so let's take a closer look at them now 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:51.139
 it means the watch is completely black 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.610
 as well as the strap and everything except 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.090
 dial dial and here these 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.970
 the cogs they stand out along with 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.710
 inscriptions have a crown 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.500
 crown pretty easy 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.410
 open and pretty easy 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.720
 what do i say 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.950
 about 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:19.710
 waterproof next buttons 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.010
 pressed in medium hardness is not necessary 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:27.600
 say what they were bought for 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:30.900
 be visually and according to my characteristics 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.580
 arrange and this clock and this one 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.030
 clock 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:39.479
 i just want to do something between them 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:43.050
 specific choice and hold some 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:45.630
 Tests such therefore took as if two pairs 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.740
 these are watches that those that roughly 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:52.830
 budget class they are cheap so 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.020
 2 models were bought approximately 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.830
 at the same time there is plus or minus several 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:02.849
 days and want to spend small 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:06.380
 experiments with them which me more 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:08.570
 will arrange well, naturally shot the video and 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.830
 listen to your advice 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:18.180
 so we took we see what I choose 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:21.889
 that is, so here is a short video with 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:26.780
 general reference hours 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:30.909
 today we had in general everything to everyone 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.909
 thank you all good luck see you
