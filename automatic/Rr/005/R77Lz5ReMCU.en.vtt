 price of 3 dollars with 99 cents and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.310
 here we install it will give us a restart 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
 fast and we will create a new one 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.330
 new app and also a new menu of 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.030
 adjustments this tweet we need 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 of activator to be able to use it or otherwise 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.649
 pressing our home button 3 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.149
 sometimes it is very good then how can 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.340
 see here is the acute the new and as 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.590
 that has created this tweet and then 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.750
 we have simply to use and use the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 black background when we are 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 using this tweet 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.989
 we can leave the fund that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.879
 we have and here we select a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.500
 gesture to use this tip and what it is that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.149
 going to do this guy is very good with 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.800
 this tweet us doing the gesture in 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 this case I put slide to the right 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.269
 can see how he makes us in our 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.820
 device to use with one hand 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.320
 no problems and everything works 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.880
 all buttons all applications 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 all the touch works for us 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 but as if we had an iphone 5 that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.860
 we can also do it a little more 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.130
 small or larger can see more 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.380
 bigger boy to be able to use the most 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.420
 comfortably sliding from the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 little corner and that's where we can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 make bigger or smaller and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.539
 also if I for example I want 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.610
 change sides because I want to use it 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.310
 with my right hand, I'm just going 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.549
 to slide my finger here on the other side 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.079
 movement and well just like that already 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.729
 I'm going to put in my hand that I want to use it 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.740
 of this case I have it on the left 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.840
 and also as you can see below we 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.880
 offers a small menu where we 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.380
 let's press and you can see here 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.810
 we can turn up the volume 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.209
 to put it down in mute were the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.060
 notifications and the screen and also 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.459
 take a good excursion what is this 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.679
 well as you know the iphone 6 or 6 after 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.899
 they have the buttons a little too high or 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.819
 well and well like this tri that is for 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.470
 use it with one hand as it offers us here 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.560
 all the options that we would not reach 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.239
 with just one hand of the buttons even 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.010
 it is also the description 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.460
 let's understand to share it in reduced 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.050
 etc 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.030
 and as you can see then this one has to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.950
 be totally brutal for those who 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.080
 they have an iphone 6 2 and already suddenly already 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.570
 they tired of the hand the center of the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.430
 bow with one with one hand as this one 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.290
 It will be excellent and good with friends 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.300
