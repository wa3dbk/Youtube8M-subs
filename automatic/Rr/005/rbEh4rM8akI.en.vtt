00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
starting out today's countdown is the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.600 
starting out today's countdown is the
fire<00:00:41.550> evolution<00:00:42.300> flareon<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.590> me<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.040> think

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
fire evolution flareon to me I think

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
fire evolution flareon to me I think
that<00:00:44.730> flareon<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.840> underrated<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that flareon is very underrated and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.369 
that flareon is very underrated and
that's<00:00:47.250> what<00:00:47.399> makes<00:00:47.520> me<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.300> much

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
that's what makes me like it so much

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
that's what makes me like it so much

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
clariion is the one evolution that is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.200 
clariion is the one evolution that is
overlooked<00:00:51.660> by<00:00:51.949> everyone<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.610> don't<00:00:53.969> know

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
overlooked by everyone and I don't know

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
overlooked by everyone and I don't know
why<00:00:54.510> sure<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.649> dad's<00:00:55.920> aren't<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> greatest

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
why sure it's dad's aren't the greatest

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340 
why sure it's dad's aren't the greatest
and<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.300> even<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.660> me<00:00:57.719> started<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
and don't even get me started on that

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.979

jolteon<00:02:18.069> there<00:02:18.489> was<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> point<00:02:18.730> where<00:02:19.180> jolteon

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
jolteon there was a point where jolteon

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.080 
jolteon there was a point where jolteon
was<00:02:19.930> my<00:02:20.079> favorite<00:02:20.530> evolution<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.730> reason

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
was my favorite evolution and the reason

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.330 
was my favorite evolution and the reason
for<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.329> was<00:02:22.450> because<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.930> how<00:02:23.230> fast<00:02:23.620> jolteon

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
for that was because of how fast jolteon

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.630 
for that was because of how fast jolteon
is<00:02:24.720> apart<00:02:25.720> from<00:02:25.840> being<00:02:26.079> very<00:02:26.410> frail<00:02:26.769> I<00:02:27.040> think

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
is apart from being very frail I think

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.849 
is apart from being very frail I think
jolteon<00:02:28.090> is<00:02:28.239> kind<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.690> overpowered<00:02:29.230> but

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
jolteon is kind of overpowered but

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.140 
jolteon is kind of overpowered but
there's<00:02:30.370> nothing<00:02:30.640> wrong<00:02:30.790> with<00:02:30.849> being

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
there's nothing wrong with being

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.630 
there's nothing wrong with being
overpowered<00:02:31.629> sure<00:02:32.470> jolteon<00:02:33.040> may<00:02:33.160> be<00:02:33.220> frail

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
overpowered sure jolteon may be frail

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.319 
overpowered sure jolteon may be frail
but<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.629> packs<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:35.049> punch<00:02:35.260> or<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:36.430> guess<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.209> this

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
but it packs a punch or I guess in this

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.830 
but it packs a punch or I guess in this
case<00:02:37.389> a<00:02:37.900> shock<00:02:38.230> ah<00:02:39.299> I'm<00:02:40.299> sorry<00:02:40.510> about<00:02:40.810> that
