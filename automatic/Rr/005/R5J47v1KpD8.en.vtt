 today we will make baked potatoes. I invite you ! 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.560
 cut the potato in half 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.840
 Now we will boil potatoes for 5 minutes 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 add 4 tablespoons of oil to boiled potatoes 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.300
 4 cloves of garlic 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
 2 pinches of salt 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.300
 2 pinches of herbal pepper 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.860
 2 pinches of Provencal herbs 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.240
 2 pinches of sweet pepper 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.440
 - a bit of turmeric that the yellow color was. 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 and mix it all 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.300
 mix the mixed potatoes to the plate 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.800
 we will still give Provencal herbs 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.540
 sweet pepper on top 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.600
 and sprinkle with herbal pepper 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.700
 place the baking tray with potatoes in the oven 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.120
 heated to 170 Â° C 

00:01:54.974 --> 00:01:57.174
 for about 10 minutes 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.640
 our baked potatoes came out like this: 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.900

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.000
