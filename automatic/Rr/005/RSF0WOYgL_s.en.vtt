00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
the power of the fast line and this was

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.600 
the power of the fast line and this was
one<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> last<00:00:22.710> figures<00:00:23.099> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.250> released

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
one of the last figures to be released

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.810 
one of the last figures to be released
in<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.910> line<00:00:24.119> back<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> 1998<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.669> I've<00:00:26.669> got

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
in that line back in 1998 and I've got

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.800 
in that line back in 1998 and I've got
to<00:00:26.910> say<00:00:27.029> it's<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.180> pretty<00:00:27.360> cool<00:00:27.570> figure

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to say it's a pretty cool figure

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.950 
to say it's a pretty cool figure
actually<00:00:27.980> and<00:00:28.980> obviously<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.000> by<00:00:30.660> today's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
actually and obviously and by today's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
actually and obviously and by today's
standards<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.559> figure<00:00:31.860> is<00:00:31.919> quite<00:00:32.129> poor<00:00:32.369> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
standards this figure is quite poor in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.020 
standards this figure is quite poor in
terms<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> articulation<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.110> detail<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:35.030> for

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
terms of articulation in detail but for

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
terms of articulation in detail but for
the<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.629> was<00:00:36.960> probably<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.680> excellent

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
the time it was probably an excellent

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.049 
the time it was probably an excellent
figure<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:40.219> articulation<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> said<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
figure in articulation as I said it is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
figure in articulation as I said it is
prep<00:00:42.420> or<00:00:42.690> he's<00:00:42.960> got<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> Thule<00:00:43.800> neck<00:00:44.070> civil

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
prep or he's got the Thule neck civil

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.120 
prep or he's got the Thule neck civil
shoulders<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> waste<00:00:45.840> uncivil<00:00:46.380> hips<00:00:46.590> which

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
shoulders to a waste uncivil hips which

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.510 
shoulders to a waste uncivil hips which
is<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.790> know<00:00:47.820> pretty<00:00:48.120> typical<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.720> the<00:00:49.140> era

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
is you know pretty typical of the era

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.790 
is you know pretty typical of the era
and<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.970> facial<00:00:51.120> sculpt<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.380> but

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and the facial sculpt is a good one but

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.050 
and the facial sculpt is a good one but
it<00:00:52.890> doesn't<00:00:53.130> particularly<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.820> like

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
it doesn't particularly look like

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.630 
it doesn't particularly look like
Captain<00:00:54.840> Piett<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.489> could

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
Captain Piett and I think that could

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.210 
Captain Piett and I think that could
have<00:00:56.760> been<00:00:56.850> doing<00:00:57.060> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.210> better<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.070> it<00:00:59.070> does

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
have been doing a lot better and it does

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.460 
have been doing a lot better and it does
have<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.700> as<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.540> rank<00:01:00.750> code<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.320> his

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.470 
have the as you see the rank code on his

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.500 
have the as you see the rank code on his
chest<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.700> really<00:01:02.910> nicely<00:01:03.149> painted

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
chest there that's really nicely painted

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530 
chest there that's really nicely painted
and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:05.129> overall<00:01:05.339> sculpt<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.060> figure<00:01:06.329> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and the overall sculpt of this figure is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
and the overall sculpt of this figure is
it's<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.350> bad<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.280> said<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:09.149> today's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it's not bad but as I said but today's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.370 
it's not bad but as I said but today's
standards<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.530> quite<00:01:10.860> poor<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:12.229> it<00:01:13.229> does

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
standards it is quite poor and it does

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.109 
standards it is quite poor and it does
come<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.710> button<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.729> can't<00:01:14.939> say<00:01:15.060> I've

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
come with a button and I can't say I've

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.389 
come with a button and I can't say I've
ever<00:01:15.210> seen<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.960> Captain<00:01:16.560> peer<00:01:16.979> use<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.369> of

ever seen and Captain peer use one of

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.219 
ever seen and Captain peer use one of
these<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.789> movie<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.959> quite<00:01:19.109> an

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
these in the movie but it's quite an

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.599 
these in the movie but it's quite an
unusual<00:01:19.350> accessory<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.369> not<00:01:20.459> something

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
unusual accessory it's not something

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.550 
unusual accessory it's not something
we've<00:01:20.909> seen<00:01:20.939> before<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:22.020> he<00:01:22.109> does<00:01:22.289> come<00:01:22.530> up

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
we've seen before and he does come up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.480 
we've seen before and he does come up
with<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.009> blaster<00:01:23.579> pistol<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:23.969> well<00:01:25.399> so<00:01:26.399> that's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
with a blaster pistol as well so that's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
with a blaster pistol as well so that's
pretty<00:01:26.759> good<00:01:28.039> mmm<00:01:29.869> got<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.899> couple<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.499> these

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
pretty good mmm got a couple of these

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.469 
pretty good mmm got a couple of these
guys<00:01:31.859> I<00:01:32.039> guess<00:01:32.219> I<00:01:32.549> don't<00:01:32.819> see<00:01:32.969> why<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
guys I guess I don't see why you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080 
guys I guess I don't see why you
couldn't<00:01:33.630> use<00:01:33.899> these<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.200> standard<00:01:35.090> Imperial

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
couldn't use these as standard Imperial

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
couldn't use these as standard Imperial
officers<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.749> know<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.590> said<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.039> sculpt

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
officers you know as I said the sculpt

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.980 
officers you know as I said the sculpt
doesn't<00:01:38.670> particularly<00:01:38.999> like<00:01:39.240> Captain<00:01:39.779> Piett

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
doesn't particularly like Captain Piett

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.919 
doesn't particularly like Captain Piett
so<00:01:40.289> it<00:01:41.249> could<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.520> anyone<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.909> suppose<00:01:42.299> I

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.609 

understand<00:01:45.929> that<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.109> figure<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.439> quite

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
understand that this figure is quite

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.399 
understand that this figure is quite
difficult<00:01:46.889> to<00:01:47.130> track<00:01:47.340> down<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.999> if<00:01:48.959> I<00:01:49.109> nice<00:01:49.319> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
difficult to track down so if I nice to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.129 
difficult to track down so if I nice to
have<00:01:49.499> this<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:49.979> collection<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.139> it's

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
have this one in my collection and it's

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:56.289 
have this one in my collection and it's
a<00:01:52.200> great<00:01:52.319> addition<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:52.859> Imperial<00:01:53.849> Army

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.429 

that's<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.719> really<00:01:57.869> say<00:01:57.990> about<00:01:58.169> this

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
that's all I can really say about this

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.720 
that's all I can really say about this
got<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.859> honest

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.860 

we've<00:02:02.600> enjoyed<00:02:02.870> this<00:02:02.990> review<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.510> decent

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
we've enjoyed this review is a decent

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.690 
we've enjoyed this review is a decent
figure<00:02:06.290> definitely<00:02:07.040> worth<00:02:07.130> picking<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.550> if

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
figure definitely worth picking up if

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.850 
figure definitely worth picking up if
you<00:02:07.790> can<00:02:07.820> get<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.240> but<00:02:08.960> as<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.230> said<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.560> think
