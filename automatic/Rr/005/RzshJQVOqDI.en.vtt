00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:18.730 
might take a minute to cut through but

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:26.830 
might take a minute to cut through but
regular<00:01:19.730> pair<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:19.940> scissors<00:01:20.000> will<00:01:20.420> cut<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:25.840> all

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
right now you have this end you just get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.980 
right now you have this end you just get
rid<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.230> not<00:01:31.040> necessary<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.000> then

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
off there we go so now that that end is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.080 
off there we go so now that that end is
removed<00:02:04.060> put<00:02:05.060> down<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.330> scissors<00:02:07.030> now<00:02:08.030> you

hole and into the back all right and
again<00:03:35.780> as<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:36.860> were<00:03:37.040> with<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.370> three-inch

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
again as we were with the three-inch

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.540 
again as we were with the three-inch
harnesses<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.330> have<00:03:38.450> this<00:03:38.630> excess<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:40.370> just

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
harnesses you have this excess you just

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:52.860 
harnesses you have this excess you just
roll<00:03:40.790> that<00:03:41.030> up<00:03:48.310> all<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.760> way<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.090> top<00:03:51.459> and

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
roll that up all the way to the top and

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.970 
roll that up all the way to the top and
then<00:03:53.870> you<00:03:53.959> can<00:03:54.110> just<00:03:54.230> think<00:03:54.410> as<00:03:54.590> if<00:03:54.770> tight

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
then you can just think as if tight

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.580 
then you can just think as if tight
through<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.459> hole<00:03:55.640> out<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.900> other<00:03:57.019> end<00:03:57.290> and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
through the hole out the other end and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.920 
through the hole out the other end and
just<00:03:57.650> zip<00:03:58.040> tie<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.310> end<00:03:58.610> so<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.060> does<00:03:59.239> so<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
just zip tie the end so it does so the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.970 
just zip tie the end so it does so the
roll<00:04:00.110> stays<00:04:00.410> back<00:04:00.950> here<00:04:01.720> all<00:04:02.720> right<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.830> then

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
roll stays back here all right and then

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.470 
roll stays back here all right and then
I'll<00:04:04.160> show<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.370> one<00:04:04.700> more<00:04:04.880> time
