00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.760
 Hello Kalashnikov against and a chair in 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.750
 broadcast and heading 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.130
 heading I do not know which heading 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.160
 because I do not know because for me it is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 not a natural video yes it is called 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 just a certain feedback up 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 which I receive by mail and skype 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 people resent the cost of clamping 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.420
 assistant in my opinion this product 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.770
 affordable given that it is bessey 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.829
 considering that this is the same clamp 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.680
 festool only practically a yard and double 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.149
 cheaper but some reporters 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.590
 here claims that this clamp in 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.680
 two times cheaper than this 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.289
 and some even said that supposedly and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000
 3 times cheaper, I do not have this information 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.420
 possessing for this clamp in Minsk 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 paid 25 dollars possible from 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.370
 the greed of the seller depends but not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.119
 less in this video immediately want to apologize 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.260
 before all viewers without exception I 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.760
 I do not like advertising from her turn up 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.820
 90 years led 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.140
 disgust for advertising which line i dont 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.110
 I love anti-advertising 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.310
 and hate unfair advertising 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.920
 so I'm a little embarrassed of myself 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.900
 I feel because I'm in this case 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.890
 to some extent do anti-advertising from this 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.079
 clamp but that's just probably 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.220
 forced step 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.540
 show that all the same difference between 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.150
 these products it exists 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.270
 it means 1 to but it is we first only 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.810
 visual moments will talk later 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.140
 talk about practical central 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.659
 it means the central detail of this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.090
 products in my opinion this here this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.350
 hot here in this case is hot 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.119
 dark blued metal to this one 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.369
 eccentric here it is in my opinion 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.850
 the main detail of this clamp though 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.599
 here is all the details of the main thing but nonetheless 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.910
 as we can see from the thickness it is of order 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.240
 us 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.780
 up to 4 millimeter thickness here this detail 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:23.060
 she double goes to that side too 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:26.510
 the same pad now look how much 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:32.450
 the assistant now be seida 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.250
 almost 8 to 9 millimeters here it is 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 heat treatment is different 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.750
 sure that steel is completely different when 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.640
 using this case so here i am 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.220
 I think a significant difference between the two 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.700
 details 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.370
 then again, I'm really an amateur 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.370
 I will not argue but by nature 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:06.080
 processing the product here is this stick but I and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 so know if purely forged and tilted 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.170
 this is a medical fact 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.500
 here the stick is purely visually more beautiful but 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.760
 on nobler made it so loaded 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.310
 rounded and so on and so forth here 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.510
 I am told but I did not check and not for 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.550
 having yes means certain knowledge 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:34.130
 Specific I will not say but 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.570
 I suggest here that this stuff nikon 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.520
 and 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.050
 but this we will know with you a little bit later 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.080
 because I'm sure the second part 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.370
 I will release this video on practical 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.800
 firing on further what else is really well 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.110
 here plus to small but this again 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:55.000
 plus who have come together of my experiments 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:04:00.310
 at our composition chok once riveted 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.670
 Genome genome do not know how to 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.350
 then here screw is screwed but he see 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.200
 not under the head not why is he just 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.250
 twisted like a stopper i.e. it can be 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.860
 unscrew and remove from the putter 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.410
 the very mechanism is this one from the fact that I 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.300
 noticed what exactly 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.560
 striking means to mouth 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.400
 clamp of course if i had 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.760
 another one 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.800
 knock genome price 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.970
 we could talk about trends 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:41.840
 Here, but here is a special case 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.390
 so here again itâ€™s about this view. 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.620
 here is the flaw 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:52.840
 flour and wedges in the end and this but again 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.840
 i say i don't know how much it is 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:03.620
 how much is characteristic of these 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.940
 clamps means so let's see what 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.260
 managed to detect 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.510
 as you see at 0 exposed and there and 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.100
 there 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:21.950
 we rest with our thumb and look at 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:27.590
 what kind of cheek does she start 1 2 3 by 4 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:35.410
 cheeks it is fixed now we rest 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:42.880
 one finger click our clamp 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:49.720
 maybe i'm doing manipulations 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:49.720
 look again one click 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:06:00.310
 one more click here 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:15.080
 press to the end 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:17.360
 hold 1 2 3 4 that is here and 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.970
 wedged she actually because 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.830
 in addition in the fourth enough because 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.440
 until the end does not go down here it 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.300
 wedged it enough at once such 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.039
 factor 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.080
 nasty purely psychologically this time 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:33.639
 how many 23 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.389
 4 on the fourth click starts to snap 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.889
 maybe it's nothing 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.689
 maybe this and what practice will show all 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:43.960
 the rest yes well these are purely such nuances 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.909
 performances of which 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.699
 Well, stupid say yes here they are not so 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:52.610
 here is a form here is such a form though 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:57.560
 even visually yes here is this penny clip 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:07:02.599
 This she looks on more powerful than here but 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:05.900
 all other conclusions to come 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:09.740
 they will come from practice I will show in 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.949
 next video thanks for watching yet 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.190
 once I apologize to the guys who 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:18.500
 sell these products 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:21.020
 here I am probably more I need them 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.599
 product as just trying to explain 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:31.060
 the difference 

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:31.060
 Well , I apologize again Thank you for your attention
