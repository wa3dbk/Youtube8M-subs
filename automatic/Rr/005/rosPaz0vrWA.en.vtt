I think without that edge that edge is

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.339 
I think without that edge that edge is
needed<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.910> edges<00:03:33.239> wanted<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:33.989> edges

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.449 
is important right now that edge is

the emotions the moon will post Pluto

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.800 
the emotions the moon will post Pluto
tonight<00:04:02.100> which<00:04:02.400> adds<00:04:02.639> an<00:04:02.910> edge<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.209> things

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
tonight which adds an edge to things

tonight which adds an edge to things
tonight<00:04:04.799> could<00:04:05.010> really<00:04:05.310> be<00:04:05.459> something

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
tonight could really be something

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.550 
tonight could really be something
special<00:04:06.049> Venus<00:04:07.049> starting<00:04:07.349> to<00:04:07.440> make<00:04:07.530> a

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
special Venus starting to make a

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.800 
special Venus starting to make a
powerful<00:04:08.069> square<00:04:08.340> over<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.700> Mars<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.569> edge

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
powerful square over to Mars that edge

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.270 
powerful square over to Mars that edge
get<00:04:10.079> sharper<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.709> stronger<00:04:11.190> in

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
get sharper and stronger in

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.710 
get sharper and stronger in
relationships<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.090> projects<00:04:12.569> and

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
relationships and projects and

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.839 
relationships and projects and
everything<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.650> moon<00:04:13.829> opposing<00:04:14.370> Pluto<00:04:14.700> the

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
everything the moon opposing Pluto the

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.740 
everything the moon opposing Pluto the
intensity<00:04:15.450> around<00:04:15.840> things<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.709> release<00:04:17.750> it

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
intensity around things the release it

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.529 
intensity around things the release it
could<00:04:18.959> always<00:04:19.079> play<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.470> little<00:04:19.739> hard<00:04:20.099> but<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
could always play a little hard but the

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.879 
could always play a little hard but the
way<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.870> look<00:04:22.019> at<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.229> astrology<00:04:22.650> today

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
way that I look at the astrology today

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.680 
way that I look at the astrology today
there's<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.280> lot<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.520> positive<00:04:24.060> aspects<00:04:24.450> with

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
there's a lot of positive aspects with

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.260 
there's a lot of positive aspects with
just<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> negatives<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.650> being<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.039> edge

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
just the negatives of being that edge

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.940 
just the negatives of being that edge
that<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.510> think<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.990> we're<00:04:28.169> all<00:04:28.200> looking<00:04:28.560> for

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
that I think that we're all looking for

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.279 
that I think that we're all looking for
that<00:04:28.979> edge<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.700> positive<00:04:29.910> way<00:04:30.690> today<00:04:31.229> so

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
that edge in the positive way today so

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.050 
that edge in the positive way today so
this<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.590> definitely<00:04:31.710> a<00:04:32.039> day<00:04:32.190> where<00:04:32.849> the<00:04:32.940> edge

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
this is definitely a day where the edge

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.570 
this is definitely a day where the edge
I<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.510> can<00:04:33.900> be<00:04:34.050> your<00:04:34.169> best<00:04:34.289> friend<00:04:34.500> but<00:04:35.490> if

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
I think can be your best friend but if

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.700 
I think can be your best friend but if
you're<00:04:35.700> afraid<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.270> an<00:04:36.360> edge<00:04:36.510> if<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:37.470> can't

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
you're afraid of an edge if you can't

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.140 
you're afraid of an edge if you can't
handle<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.130> heat<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.580> can<00:04:38.760> handle<00:04:39.090> that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
handle the heat you can handle that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.810 
handle the heat you can handle that
sharp<00:04:39.660> razor<00:04:39.930> set<00:04:40.320> energy<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.490> know<00:04:41.610> maybe

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
sharp razor set energy you know maybe

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.040 
sharp razor set energy you know maybe
you're<00:04:42.030> going<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.210> just<00:04:42.360> want<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.630> retreat<00:04:42.930> and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
you're going to just want to retreat and

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.690 
you're going to just want to retreat and
sleep<00:04:43.440> in<00:04:43.590> your<00:04:43.680> bed<00:04:43.830> today<00:04:44.039> and<00:04:44.340> we're<00:04:44.669> you

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
sleep in your bed today and we're you

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.400 
sleep in your bed today and we're you
know<00:04:44.940> there's<00:04:45.270> an<00:04:45.419> energy<00:04:45.599> that<00:04:45.960> wants<00:04:46.289> to

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
know there's an energy that wants to

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.529 
know there's an energy that wants to
retreat<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.010> it's<00:04:47.639> I<00:04:47.760> think<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.150> balance

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
retreat and it's I think the balance

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.839 
retreat and it's I think the balance
between<00:04:48.690> being<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.320> a<00:04:49.380> very<00:04:49.650> still<00:04:50.160> water<00:04:50.490> in

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
between being in a very still water in

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.420 
between being in a very still water in
an<00:04:51.270> extreme<00:04:51.780> edge<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.229> don't<00:04:52.500> think<00:04:52.590> there's<00:04:53.340> a

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
an extreme edge I don't think there's a

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.310 
an extreme edge I don't think there's a
middle<00:04:53.669> ground<00:04:53.760> today<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.479> the<00:04:54.930> card<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
middle ground today and the card of the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.300 
middle ground today and the card of the
day<00:04:55.410> is<00:04:55.880> wow<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:57.419> always<00:04:58.229> like<00:04:58.409> this<00:04:58.560> card<00:04:58.830> the

five<00:04:59.669> of<00:04:59.909> swords<00:05:00.120> reversed

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.500 

maybe<00:05:04.230> there's<00:05:04.500> a<00:05:04.590> need<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:05.120> well<00:05:06.120> it's<00:05:06.330> so

maybe there's a need to well it's so
funny<00:05:06.750> with<00:05:06.870> this<00:05:07.020> edge<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.440> always<00:05:07.800> look<00:05:07.920> at

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
funny with this edge I always look at

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.770 
funny with this edge I always look at
this<00:05:08.100> card<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.610> man<00:05:08.820> wanting<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.330> win<00:05:09.510> and

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
this card is the man wanting to win and

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.360 
this card is the man wanting to win and
everybody's<00:05:10.140> like<00:05:10.200> okay<00:05:10.680> we're<00:05:10.890> dropping<00:05:11.250> our

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
everybody's like okay we're dropping our

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.410 
everybody's like okay we're dropping our
swords<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.750> win<00:05:12.960> you're<00:05:13.350> trying<00:05:13.650> too<00:05:13.890> hard

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
swords you win you're trying too hard

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.490 
swords you win you're trying too hard
whenever<00:05:15.420> I<00:05:15.540> pull<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:15.840> reverse<00:05:16.170> there's<00:05:16.440> a

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
whenever I pull this reverse there's a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.960 
whenever I pull this reverse there's a
part<00:05:16.740> of<00:05:16.830> us<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.010> really<00:05:17.460> needs<00:05:17.670> so<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:17.850> think

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
part of us that really needs so I think

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.030 
part of us that really needs so I think
kick<00:05:18.420> things<00:05:18.660> back<00:05:18.900> in<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.170> gear<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.830> could

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
kick things back in the gear this could

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.980 
kick things back in the gear this could
be<00:05:20.160> where<00:05:20.310> we're<00:05:20.490> kind<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.820> lazy<00:05:21.030> we're<00:05:21.660> kind

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
be where we're kind of lazy we're kind

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.590 
be where we're kind of lazy we're kind
of<00:05:22.260> not<00:05:22.500> wanting<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:23.040> enough<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.430> I<00:05:24.120> think

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
of not wanting it enough and I think

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.240 
of not wanting it enough and I think
it's<00:05:24.750> because<00:05:24.900> if<00:05:25.260> oh<00:05:25.440> we're<00:05:25.920> not<00:05:26.040> at<00:05:26.220> that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
it's because if oh we're not at that

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.770 
it's because if oh we're not at that
place<00:05:26.550> where<00:05:26.820> we<00:05:26.880> can<00:05:27.000> have<00:05:27.180> a<00:05:27.210> razor<00:05:27.450> edge

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
place where we can have a razor edge

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.260 
place where we can have a razor edge
right<00:05:28.410> now<00:05:28.470> in<00:05:28.740> our<00:05:28.800> life<00:05:29.040> we're<00:05:29.910> waiting<00:05:30.240> for

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
right now in our life we're waiting for

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.240 
right now in our life we're waiting for
that<00:05:30.600> what<00:05:31.380> if<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.560> had<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.710> tell<00:05:31.890> you<00:05:31.920> that<00:05:32.130> you

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
that what if I had to tell you that you

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.340 
that what if I had to tell you that you
could<00:05:32.400> find<00:05:32.610> that<00:05:32.760> razor<00:05:33.060> edge<00:05:33.210> right<00:05:33.780> now<00:05:33.840> and

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
could find that razor edge right now and
