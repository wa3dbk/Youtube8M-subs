one that I don't do very often i don't
really<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.760> much<00:00:26.789> as<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.240> like

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
really like it as much as I like

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
really like it as much as I like
courtyard<00:00:27.900> too<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.590> it's<00:00:28.830> still<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.039> decent

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
courtyard too but it's still a decent

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
courtyard too but it's still a decent
map<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.820> he's<00:00:30.300> gonna<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.630> doing<00:00:30.900> courtyard<00:00:31.410> it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
map so he's gonna be doing courtyard it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.229 
map so he's gonna be doing courtyard it
looks<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.099> any<00:00:32.399> four<00:00:32.759> or<00:00:32.880> five<00:00:33.059> he's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
looks like so any four or five he's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.670 
looks like so any four or five he's
doing<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> same<00:00:33.630> thing<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.050> did<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.469> we'll

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
doing the same thing that I did so we'll

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.229 
doing the same thing that I did so we'll
see<00:00:34.829> if<00:00:34.920> he<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.219> cat<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.940> catch<00:00:36.090> him

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
see if he can cat if we can catch him

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.150 
see if he can cat if we can catch him
here<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:37.200> were<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.440> girl<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> blue<00:00:37.950> dress

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here we were the girl in the blue dress

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.819 
here we were the girl in the blue dress
so<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:38.940> gonna<00:00:39.120> guess<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.420> he's<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> man<00:00:40.110> just

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
so I'm gonna guess that he's a man just

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
so I'm gonna guess that he's a man just
from<00:00:41.340> psychological<00:00:42.270> standpoint<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.110> was

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
from psychological standpoint that was

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.139 
from psychological standpoint that was
terrible<00:00:43.559> let's<00:00:44.309> go<00:00:44.460> ahead<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> mark<00:00:44.969> her

terrible let's go ahead and mark her

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.720 
terrible let's go ahead and mark her
because<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:45.840> odd<00:00:46.430> that<00:00:47.430> that

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
because that was really odd that that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
because that was really odd that that
might<00:00:47.940> have<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.360> been<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.570> little<00:00:48.870> glitch<00:00:49.410> or

might have just been a little glitch or
something<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.550> go

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
might have been a fake but I feel like

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.980 
might have been a fake but I feel like
it<00:01:41.400> he<00:01:41.820> wouldn't<00:01:42.119> fake<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.689> point<00:01:42.899> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it he wouldn't fake at this point I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.179 
it he wouldn't fake at this point I
don't<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.170> why<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> feeling

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
don't know why I just have a feeling

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
don't know why I just have a feeling
that<00:01:44.369> he<00:01:44.549> would<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.540> could<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> also<00:01:45.990> been

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that he would it could have also been

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.300 
that he would it could have also been
the<00:01:46.259> guy<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> yellow<00:01:46.710> he<00:01:47.040> could<00:01:47.220> have

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the guy in the yellow he could have

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.620 
the guy in the yellow he could have
gotten<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.610> green<00:01:47.850> although<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> seems

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
gotten a green although that seems

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.899 
gotten a green although that seems
however<00:01:49.079> unlikely<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> think<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:50.790> gonna

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
however unlikely so I think we're gonna

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999 
however unlikely so I think we're gonna
keep<00:01:51.119> our<00:01:51.270> eye<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> guy<00:01:51.960> in<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.229> green<00:01:52.560> or

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
keep our eye on the guy in the green or

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.460 
keep our eye on the guy in the green or
in<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> yellow<00:01:54.030> he<00:01:54.570> seems<00:01:54.810> really<00:01:54.899> suspicious

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
in the yellow he seems really suspicious

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.639 
in the yellow he seems really suspicious
so<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.880> going<00:01:57.030> over<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.360> statue<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.170> an

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so it's going over that statue it is an

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
so it's going over that statue it is an
eagle<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.520> we'll<00:01:59.670> keep<00:01:59.820> our<00:02:00.000> eye<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.149> that

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
eagle so we'll keep our eye on that

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.910 
eagle so we'll keep our eye on that
statue<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.110> swaps<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.649> we're<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
statue if it swaps then we're going to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.740 
statue if it swaps then we're going to
go<00:02:02.009> ahead<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> take<00:02:02.369> our<00:02:02.399> shot<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.850> him<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
go ahead and take our shot of him it

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.090 
go ahead and take our shot of him it
could<00:02:03.899> also<00:02:04.020> be<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.320> girl<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> purple<00:02:04.799> or

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
could also be this girl in the purple or

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.319 
could also be this girl in the purple or
the<00:02:05.130> girl<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.549> blue<00:02:05.579> both<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> them<00:02:06.180> were

talking<00:02:06.750> at<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> point<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> banana<00:02:07.439> bread

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
talking at the point of the banana bread

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.210 
talking at the point of the banana bread

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
of those two circles though which

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.990 
of those two circles though which
probably<00:02:12.170> wasn't<00:02:12.410> too<00:02:12.620> smart<00:02:12.740> okay<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.880> was

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
probably wasn't too smart okay that was

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.550 
probably wasn't too smart okay that was
still<00:02:14.180> normal<00:02:14.360> oh<00:02:14.570> he's<00:02:14.870> jumping<00:02:15.380> from

going back and forth between these

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.570 
going back and forth between these
statues<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.150> really<00:02:35.600> odd<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.220> kind<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.370> want<00:02:37.520> to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
statues is really odd I kind of want to

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
statues is really odd I kind of want to
take<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.790> shot<00:02:38.000> right<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:38.180> but<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.570> could

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
take the shot right now but it could

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.020 
take the shot right now but it could
just<00:02:38.900> be<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.110> normal<00:02:39.470> bug<00:02:39.920> although<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.700> seems

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
just be a normal bug although it seems

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.360 
just be a normal bug although it seems
pretty<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:41.930> seems<00:02:42.410> really<00:02:42.470> odd<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.160> point

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
pretty it seems really odd at this point

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.390 
pretty it seems really odd at this point
so<00:02:43.790> let's<00:02:44.030> just<00:02:44.209> keep<00:02:44.390> an<00:02:44.570> eye<00:02:44.690> on<00:02:44.720> him<00:02:45.160> see<00:02:46.160> if

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
so let's just keep an eye on him see if

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.490 
so let's just keep an eye on him see if
he<00:02:46.580> does<00:02:46.760> anything<00:02:46.940> too<00:02:47.390> odd<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:48.080> don't<00:02:48.260> think

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
he does anything too odd I don't think

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.960 
he does anything too odd I don't think
he<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.830> at<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.250> point<00:02:49.490> if<00:02:49.730> he<00:02:49.820> does

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
he will at this point if he does

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.760 
he will at this point if he does
anything<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.480> on<00:02:50.630> at<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:50.930> point<00:02:51.170> he's<00:02:51.530> gonna

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
anything to on at this point he's gonna

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.770 
anything to on at this point he's gonna
get<00:02:51.890> himself<00:02:52.040> caught<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.790> he<00:02:53.030> might<00:02:53.270> just<00:02:53.600> try

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
get himself caught so he might just try

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.010 
get himself caught so he might just try
and<00:02:54.080> add<00:02:54.200> time<00:02:54.530> which<00:02:55.280> ooh<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:56.180> definitely

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
and add time which ooh I definitely

over<00:05:16.139> here<00:05:16.169> and<00:05:16.410> do<00:05:16.560> this<00:05:16.710> at<00:05:16.919> the<00:05:17.010> bookcase<00:05:17.370> I

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
over here and do this at the bookcase I

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.430 
over here and do this at the bookcase I
don't<00:05:18.330> think<00:05:18.389> he's<00:05:18.600> watching<00:05:18.960> over<00:05:19.050> here<00:05:19.289> he's

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
don't think he's watching over here he's

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.870 
don't think he's watching over here he's
watching<00:05:19.770> mainly<00:05:20.070> on<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.310> side<00:05:20.550> for<00:05:20.789> some

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
watching mainly on that side for some

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.310 
watching mainly on that side for some
reason<00:05:21.180> I'm<00:05:21.270> not<00:05:21.449> sure<00:05:21.600> why<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.780> is<00:05:21.960> exactly

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
reason I'm not sure why that is exactly

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.140 
reason I'm not sure why that is exactly
I<00:05:22.650> guess<00:05:23.010> he's<00:05:23.160> just<00:05:23.190> got<00:05:23.550> his<00:05:23.580> eye<00:05:23.970> on<00:05:24.000> the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
I guess he's just got his eye on the

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.640 
I guess he's just got his eye on the
ambassador<00:05:24.780> in<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.020> bookcase<00:05:25.229> over<00:05:25.500> there

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
ambassador in the bookcase over there

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.589 
ambassador in the bookcase over there
which<00:05:26.370> could<00:05:26.580> make<00:05:26.729> it<00:05:26.789> a<00:05:26.910> bit<00:05:27.090> easier<00:05:27.240> in<00:05:27.539> the

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
which could make it a bit easier in the

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.089 
which could make it a bit easier in the
long<00:05:27.690> run<00:05:27.870> but<00:05:28.229> we'll<00:05:28.410> see<00:05:28.620> we'll<00:05:28.830> see<00:05:28.860> how

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
long run but we'll see we'll see how

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.279 
long run but we'll see we'll see how
well<00:05:29.280> he<00:05:29.460> can<00:05:29.610> do<00:05:29.760> we<00:05:30.630> do<00:05:30.720> have<00:05:30.840> to<00:05:30.960> swap<00:05:31.169> the

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
well he can do we do have to swap the

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.510 
well he can do we do have to swap the
statue<00:05:31.530> as<00:05:31.740> well<00:05:31.919> so<00:05:32.039> I<00:05:32.099> think<00:05:32.160> we'll<00:05:32.340> go<00:05:32.460> ahead

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
statue as well so I think we'll go ahead

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.279 
statue as well so I think we'll go ahead
and<00:05:32.610> do<00:05:32.760> that<00:05:32.789> right<00:05:32.970> here<00:05:33.150> because<00:05:33.990> he<00:05:34.139> hasn't

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
and do that right here because he hasn't

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.810 
and do that right here because he hasn't
he<00:05:34.680> hasn't<00:05:34.889> even<00:05:34.979> looked<00:05:35.190> over<00:05:35.460> here<00:05:35.580> hardly

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
he hasn't even looked over here hardly

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.339 
he hasn't even looked over here hardly
at<00:05:35.940> all<00:05:36.000> i<00:05:36.060> think<00:05:36.180> he<00:05:36.419> did<00:05:36.570> once<00:05:36.840> but<00:05:37.080> i<00:05:37.139> don't

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
at all i think he did once but i don't

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.930 
at all i think he did once but i don't
think<00:05:37.410> he<00:05:37.560> even<00:05:37.650> checked<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.010> statues<00:05:38.430> so<00:05:38.849> we

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
think he even checked the statues so we

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.200 
think he even checked the statues so we
should<00:05:38.970> be<00:05:39.270> good<00:05:39.300> in<00:05:39.630> swapping<00:05:39.960> this<00:05:41.210> okay

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
should be good in swapping this okay

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.760 
should be good in swapping this okay
that<00:05:42.479> was<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:42.599> pretty<00:05:42.810> pretty<00:05:43.229> bad<00:05:43.440> swap

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
that was a pretty pretty bad swap

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.040 
that was a pretty pretty bad swap
because<00:05:44.010> we<00:05:44.220> did<00:05:44.370> swap<00:05:44.610> it<00:05:44.789> for<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.030> eagle<00:05:45.660> for

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
because we did swap it for the eagle for

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.050 
because we did swap it for the eagle for
the<00:05:46.139> head<00:05:46.349> which<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.650> pretty<00:05:47.310> terrible<00:05:47.639> okay

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
the head which is pretty terrible okay

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.490 
the head which is pretty terrible okay
he<00:05:48.240> couldn't<00:05:48.539> have<00:05:48.630> seen<00:05:48.810> that<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.260> just

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
he couldn't have seen that so I just

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.690 
he couldn't have seen that so I just
kind<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.770> jumped<00:05:50.010> out<00:05:50.099> of<00:05:50.130> that<00:05:50.250> animation

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
kind of jumped out of that animation

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.189 
kind of jumped out of that animation
there<00:05:50.970> normally<00:05:51.570> I<00:05:51.599> wouldn't<00:05:51.900> have<00:05:52.020> done<00:05:52.139> that

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
there normally I wouldn't have done that

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.870 
there normally I wouldn't have done that
if<00:05:52.349> he<00:05:52.650> was<00:05:52.800> watching<00:05:52.949> us<00:05:53.220> but<00:05:53.460> I<00:05:53.490> don't<00:05:53.729> think

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
if he was watching us but I don't think

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.930 
if he was watching us but I don't think
he<00:05:54.030> was<00:05:54.210> so<00:05:54.630> we<00:05:54.750> should<00:05:54.960> be<00:05:55.080> fine<00:05:55.110> oh<00:05:55.940> it's

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
he was so we should be fine oh it's

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.580 
he was so we should be fine oh it's
watching<00:05:57.330> very<00:05:57.479> closely<00:05:57.660> oh<00:05:58.080> that<00:05:58.470> was

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
watching very closely oh that was

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.909 
watching very closely oh that was
terrible<00:05:59.599> he<00:06:00.599> didn't<00:06:01.020> catch<00:06:01.139> it<00:06:01.199> okay<00:06:01.710> that

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
terrible he didn't catch it okay that

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.529 
terrible he didn't catch it okay that
was<00:06:02.039> definitely<00:06:02.310> terrible<00:06:03.060> I<00:06:03.180> definitely

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
was definitely terrible I definitely

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.450 
was definitely terrible I definitely
stuck<00:06:03.840> my<00:06:03.990> arm<00:06:04.020> way<00:06:04.500> out<00:06:04.710> there<00:06:04.919> as<00:06:05.099> he<00:06:05.310> was

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
stuck my arm way out there as he was

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.100 
stuck my arm way out there as he was
looking<00:06:05.550> directly<00:06:05.789> at<00:06:06.120> me<00:06:06.330> but<00:06:06.720> I<00:06:06.750> think<00:06:06.810> we

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
looking directly at me but I think we

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.900 
looking directly at me but I think we
pulled<00:06:07.320> it<00:06:07.410> off<00:06:07.560> so<00:06:07.800> let's<00:06:07.949> go<00:06:08.070> ahead<00:06:08.099> and<00:06:08.280> put

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
pulled it off so let's go ahead and put

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:10.730 
pulled it off so let's go ahead and put
this<00:06:09.090> in<00:06:09.330> here<00:06:09.539> real<00:06:09.720> fast<00:06:09.750> we're<00:06:10.560> doing

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
this in here real fast we're doing

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.260 
this in here real fast we're doing
pretty<00:06:10.770> well<00:06:10.979> it's<00:06:11.340> really<00:06:11.669> hard<00:06:11.849> to<00:06:11.970> catch<00:06:12.120> us

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
pretty well it's really hard to catch us

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.629 
pretty well it's really hard to catch us
here<00:06:12.500> although<00:06:13.500> if<00:06:13.650> he<00:06:13.740> camps<00:06:14.070> the<00:06:14.160> Ambassador

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
here although if he camps the Ambassador

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.100 
here although if he camps the Ambassador
he<00:06:14.789> might<00:06:15.030> be<00:06:15.180> able<00:06:15.270> to<00:06:15.419> do<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:15.630> looks<00:06:15.900> like<00:06:16.020> you

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
he might be able to do it looks like you

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.050 
he might be able to do it looks like you
left<00:06:16.229> the<00:06:16.349> Ambassador<00:06:16.800> alone<00:06:17.039> though<00:06:17.280> so<00:06:17.849> we

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
left the Ambassador alone though so we

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.870 
left the Ambassador alone though so we
might<00:06:18.180> get<00:06:18.330> our<00:06:18.449> chance<00:06:19.250> go<00:06:20.250> ahead<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.580> plant

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
might get our chance go ahead and plant

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.600 
might get our chance go ahead and plant
that<00:06:21.120> if

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
that if

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.589
