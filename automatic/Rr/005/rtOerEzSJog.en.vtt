I<00:03:42.310> don't<00:03:42.910> even<00:03:42.970> know<00:03:43.150> what<00:03:43.240> I'm<00:03:43.330> steak

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.630 

client<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:48.019> like<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.260> grape

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.130 

not<00:03:54.640> sure<00:03:54.879> what<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.150> was<00:03:55.269> well<00:03:56.019> like<00:03:56.319> it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.710 

so<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.650> guess<00:03:59.800> in<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.250> end<00:04:00.280> even<00:04:00.819> though<00:04:01.450> it's

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
so I guess in the end even though it's

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.890 
so I guess in the end even though it's
kind<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.319> lowly<00:04:03.100> experience<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:04.240> think<00:04:04.750> and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900
