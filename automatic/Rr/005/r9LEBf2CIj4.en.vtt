video<00:00:23.590> I'm<00:00:23.680> going<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:23.860> show<00:00:24.250> you<00:00:24.280> a<00:00:24.400> tutorial

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
video I'm going to show you a tutorial

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.480 
video I'm going to show you a tutorial
how<00:00:25.090> to<00:00:25.120> parallel<00:00:25.810> wire<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.380> subwoofers<00:00:26.770> on<00:00:27.280> do

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
how to parallel wire to subwoofers on do

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.590 
how to parallel wire to subwoofers on do
a<00:00:27.840> mono<00:00:28.840> amp<00:00:29.140> or<00:00:30.070> on<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:30.670> one<00:00:30.820> channel<00:00:31.150> on<00:00:31.480> an

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
a mono amp or on to one channel on an

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.290 
a mono amp or on to one channel on an
amp<00:00:31.750> and<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.460> will<00:00:33.640> bring<00:00:33.850> down<00:00:34.060> the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
amp and this will bring down the

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.370 
amp and this will bring down the
impedance<00:00:34.870> and<00:00:35.820> also<00:00:36.820> let<00:00:37.030> you<00:00:37.210> put<00:00:37.480> more<00:00:37.690> subs

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
impedance and also let you put more subs

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.780 
impedance and also let you put more subs
on<00:00:38.620> your<00:00:38.739> amp<00:00:40.410> those<00:00:41.410> blue<00:00:41.739> eyes<00:00:41.860> those<00:00:42.250> wires

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
on your amp those blue eyes those wires

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.940 
on your amp those blue eyes those wires
actually<00:00:43.000> going<00:00:43.330> to<00:00:43.480> Maya<00:00:43.660> subject<00:00:44.170> now<00:00:44.260> I'm

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
actually going to Maya subject now I'm

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.770 
actually going to Maya subject now I'm
not<00:00:45.100> going<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.280> use<00:00:45.400> those<00:00:45.550> since<00:00:45.940> I<00:00:46.420> really

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
not going to use those since I really

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.140 
not going to use those since I really
wanted<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.050> screw<00:00:47.470> well<00:00:48.070> it<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.760> won't<00:00:48.880> screw

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
wanted to screw well it it won't screw

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.540 
wanted to screw well it it won't screw
it<00:00:49.210> up<00:00:49.270> and<00:00:49.480> it<00:00:50.170> just<00:00:50.350> be<00:00:50.500> easier<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:51.280> show<00:00:51.430> you

look like once you guys have a gun right
there<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.890> following<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:10.600> comes<00:01:10.840> from<00:01:10.960> amp

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
there and following that comes from amp

favorite blue is okay so um yeah it's
that<00:01:19.420> comes<00:01:19.659> from<00:01:19.780> that<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.140> then<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.830> will

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
that comes from that and then this will

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.780 
that comes from that and then this will
this<00:01:21.970> wire<00:01:22.180> coming<00:01:22.450> from<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.750> amp<00:01:23.790> actually

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
this wire coming from the amp actually

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.090 
this wire coming from the amp actually
hooked<00:01:25.030> directly<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:26.560> the<00:01:26.620> terminals

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
hooked directly into the terminals

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.880 
hooked directly into the terminals
positive<00:01:28.090> positive<00:01:28.270> negative<00:01:28.540> Navy<00:01:29.140> negative

positive positive negative Navy negative
and<00:01:30.430> then<00:01:31.770> okay<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:32.950> then<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.490> second<00:01:33.850> wire

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and then okay and then the second wire

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.560 
and then okay and then the second wire
will<00:01:35.200> hook<00:01:35.380> onto<00:01:35.620> that<00:01:35.830> one<00:01:36.160> in<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.180> terminal

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
will hook onto that one in the terminal

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.080 
will hook onto that one in the terminal
actually<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:39.130> just<00:01:39.340> wrap<00:01:39.520> it<00:01:39.550> around<00:01:39.730> that

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
actually you just wrap it around that

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.770 
actually you just wrap it around that
one<00:01:40.830> positive<00:01:41.830> positive<00:01:41.950> negative<00:01:42.280> negative

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
one positive positive negative negative

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.690 
one positive positive negative negative
into<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.930> terminal<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.620> then<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:51.040> then<00:01:51.370> the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
into that terminal and then and then the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.550 
into that terminal and then and then the
other<00:01:51.880> side<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.300> one<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.660> wrapped

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
other side of that one that you wrapped

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.230 
other side of that one that you wrapped
around<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:54.010> one<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.550> first<00:01:54.880> terminal

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
around that one in the first terminal

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.270 
around that one in the first terminal
you<00:01:55.810> put<00:01:55.960> in<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.140> second<00:01:56.590> terminal<00:01:56.920> right

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
you put in that second terminal right

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.900 
you put in that second terminal right

okay now I hooked up these um these

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.470 
okay now I hooked up these um these
wires<00:02:13.000> together<00:02:14.970> straight<00:02:15.970> from<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.180> amp<00:02:16.390> you

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
wires together straight from the amp you

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.960 
wires together straight from the amp you
hook<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.959> onto<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.349> second<00:02:17.709> cord<00:02:17.970> positive

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970

obviously and you plug this into the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.290 
obviously and you plug this into the
first<00:02:23.019> term<00:02:23.230> oh<00:02:23.379> um<00:02:24.220> do<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.700> first

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.340 
you will put that and second terminal
there's<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.920> lot<00:02:36.070> car<00:02:36.900> around<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.020> second

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
there's a lot car around that second

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.380 
there's a lot car around that second
terminal<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:39.160> then<00:02:39.430> once<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.760> do<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:39.940> you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
terminal and then once you do that you

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.240 
terminal and then once you do that you
know<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:41.080> have<00:02:41.170> parallel<00:02:41.740> wires<00:02:41.950> your

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
know you have parallel wires your

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.630 
know you have parallel wires your
subwoofers<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.770> it'll<00:02:44.770> drop<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.160> impedance

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
subwoofers and it'll drop the impedance

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.780 
subwoofers and it'll drop the impedance
to<00:02:46.450> half<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.840> think<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.830> if<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.160> two<00:02:48.370> four

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
to half I think so if you have two four

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.430 
to half I think so if you have two four
ohm<00:02:49.240> subs

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
ohm subs

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.570 
ohm subs
it'll<00:02:50.680> make<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.750> 2<00:02:52.750> ohms<00:02:52.930> instead<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:54.310> then<00:02:54.460> if

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
it'll make it 2 ohms instead and then if

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580 
it'll make it 2 ohms instead and then if
you<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:54.760> two<00:02:54.970> two<00:02:55.210> on<00:02:55.240> subs<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.960> it'll<00:02:56.500> make

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you have two two on subs and it'll make

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.330 
you have two two on subs and it'll make
it<00:02:56.710> 1<00:02:56.890> ohm<00:02:57.040> so<00:02:57.850> make<00:02:58.060> sure<00:02:58.270> that<00:02:59.340> there's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
it 1 ohm so make sure that there's

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.930 
it 1 ohm so make sure that there's
another<00:03:00.550> car<00:03:00.850> coming<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:04.410> your<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.890> fits<00:03:06.400> 2<00:03:06.580> 2

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
another car coming that your it fits 2 2

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.710 
another car coming that your it fits 2 2
ohms<00:03:07.150> make<00:03:07.780> sure<00:03:07.960> you<00:03:08.050> can't<00:03:08.440> fool<00:03:09.480> will<00:03:10.480> work

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
ohms make sure you can't fool will work

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.520 
ohms make sure you can't fool will work
with<00:03:10.930> 1<00:03:11.110> ohm<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:12.330> also<00:03:13.330> whenever<00:03:14.080> your<00:03:14.290> coil

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
with 1 ohm and also whenever your coil

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.650 
with 1 ohm and also whenever your coil
is<00:03:14.740> 2<00:03:14.920> 1<00:03:15.070> hours<00:03:15.220> round<00:03:15.490> together<00:03:15.630> make<00:03:16.630> sure

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
is 2 1 hours round together make sure

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.520 
is 2 1 hours round together make sure
that<00:03:16.990> your<00:03:17.740> terminals<00:03:18.670> will<00:03:18.940> take<00:03:19.570> pretty

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that your terminals will take pretty

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.770 
that your terminals will take pretty
good<00:03:21.100> gauge<00:03:21.340> wire<00:03:21.730> because<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> lot<00:03:22.750> of

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
good gauge wire because a lot of

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.460 
good gauge wire because a lot of
terminals<00:03:23.290> only<00:03:23.500> take<00:03:23.710> up<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.670> 8<00:03:24.820> page<00:03:25.320> so<00:03:26.320> yeah

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
terminals only take up to 8 page so yeah

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.680 
terminals only take up to 8 page so yeah
keep<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.800> in<00:03:26.950> mind<00:03:27.100> too<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:28.300> I<00:03:28.330> hope<00:03:28.540> this

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
keep that in mind too so I hope this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.500 
keep that in mind too so I hope this
