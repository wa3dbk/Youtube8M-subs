later and rather than being so bitter to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.950 
later and rather than being so bitter to
the<00:02:08.280> invitation<00:02:08.820> the<00:02:08.970> relation<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.780> the

you've<00:02:14.370> done<00:02:14.520> with<00:02:14.910> these<00:02:15.060> anti<00:02:15.480> dissing

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you've done with these anti dissing

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.690 
you've done with these anti dissing

topic modules is that they undergo is

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.160 
topic modules is that they undergo is
there<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:17.970> phase<00:02:18.240> shifting<00:02:18.720> general

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
there is a phase shifting general

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.260 
there is a phase shifting general

sometimes<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.720> connections<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.350> aren't

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
sometimes the connections just aren't

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.170 
sometimes the connections just aren't
very<00:02:32.340> possible

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
very possible

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.400

2000<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.970> real<00:02:39.150> question<00:02:39.540> was<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.810> actually

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
2000 the real question was is actually

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.949 
2000 the real question was is actually
how<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.770> got<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:40.950> as<00:02:41.220> quickly<00:02:41.459> as<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.700> get

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
how it got here as quickly as we get

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.930 
how it got here as quickly as we get
another<00:02:42.959> another<00:02:43.470> amazing<00:02:43.920> development<00:02:44.730> in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
another another amazing development in

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.510 
another another amazing development in
this<00:02:45.030> whole<00:02:45.209> process<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:46.290> think<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.310> were<00:02:47.400> at

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
this whole process I think you were at

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.210 
this whole process I think you were at
home<00:02:47.790> really<00:02:48.300> you<00:02:49.170> replace<00:02:49.500> those<00:02:49.739> sperm

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
home really you replace those sperm

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.790 
home really you replace those sperm
