00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.590
 hello very good to everyone I'm auxiliary 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.440
 and we are in a new video in a way 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.340
 for version 1.5 point one of 20 it 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.250
 flame ruins 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.950
 and well this mod the first thing to say is that 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.320
 I'm seeing includes ruins I said 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.619
 the word or constructions towards 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.119
 random around the world there is a balloon there 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.890
 a lighthouse is worth 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 there are many types many varieties 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.780
 what is the use of this, I do not know much 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.199
 it is very I recommend that I with more 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.199
 motorcycles 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.870
 well here I am seeing more 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.210
 constructions that can be used to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.930
 look for example to have a house a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.320
 well or things like that I know good what 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.620
 said some ruins appear a lot 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.839
 the in this version ruins this this 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.320
 I think that this is not in any way that 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.199
 well but good as you see here there is like 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.800
 a temple bursting a house we 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.690
 import 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.220
 although this seems to me to be of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.220
 normal minecraft of a village 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:19.240
 country or 4 fox a story 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.240
 Let's see 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.509
 I'll get off this applies 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:35.119
 it is not it is massive this yes the massif 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:41.259
 Well, there are like structures in shape 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.259
 of a group is a face there are faces 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.729
 with blue eyes with doors with one eye 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.729
 single 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.800
 and good as you see is pretty cool 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.440
 you can find obsidian or rock 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.830
 or 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.070
 what is it 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.340
 does not have any this that is uncle this 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.340
 makes sense 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.810
 inside 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.110
 it's simply the low 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.600
 well as you see there is a lot of variety of 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.560
 construction need many leave like 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.450
 you see but a lot here there is a tower with 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.510
 expand you can find enemies 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.879
 inside 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.150
 what a good reward, by the way 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.150
 good 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.780
 and that's it 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.270
 basically it's all that mode brings 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.940
 the odd ruin more 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.460
 and good if you liked to like 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.110
