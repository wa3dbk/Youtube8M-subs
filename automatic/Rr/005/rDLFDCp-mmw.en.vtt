00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.950
 hello hello to everyone then I decided to 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.300
 make a video tutorial on processing 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.180
 of the ring indeed of the rings you see 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.669
 here in the foreground I put on facebook 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.829
 in the various groups the photo that this 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.860
 ring that is here on the left and many TVs 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:37.420
 they have enjoyed it so much and have me 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.610
 asked for a tutorial scheme e 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.620
 so I decided to do just that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.469
 tutorial then wanted first 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.719
 to introduce you to you I decided to put a 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.289
 name for this processing a 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.000
 this ring is like this 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.500
 processing recalls a little bit also 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.739
 the bracelet I made earlier 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.010
 the games bracelet I decided to 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.949
 call joy I remembered that in 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.130
 various comments under the first video of the 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.640
 bracelet had to present a person 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.820
 named barbarian no name on his 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.619
 channel the name of his canal and hair 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.860
 his time in short, he suggested me for that 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.600
 regarding the bracelet the name soraga 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.439
 soraya is actually the la 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.759
 princess wife of the Shah of Persia 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.310
 also called the princess from 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.380
 sad eyes and barbara suggested to me 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.750
 this name because that processing is 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.090
 the bracelet was reminiscent of i 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.899
 precious Arab lace as this 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.899
 ring as I said before 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.930
 roughly the same process as the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.210
 bracelet 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.570
 in short, it remembers that processing and 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.119
 as however also its shape mi 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.909
 gives the idea valid to me too of this 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.920
 processing arabic manufacturing I decided 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.040
 to use that name 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.170
 for this ring even if I have to say the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.060
 truth I had not chosen for what 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.100
 it's about the bracelet because then I have 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.050
 started reading a little bit the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.840
 story I remembered this 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.259
 princess at the end 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.569
 forced a forced separation because 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.810
 he had no children 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.610
 then I read the story in a little bit 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.349
 details of this princess too 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.459
 of the family of the SciÃ  of Persia 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.090
 and in short it is not so happy that then 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.360
 all died of death in the end 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.000
 the two sons of the Shah are not particularly particular 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.910
 in the end they committed suicide of the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.710
 princess 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.880
 the death of the princess in short 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.090
 there is the doubt that she was killed 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.560
 in short, a little bit macabre history 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.810
 however in the end he decided to use 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.090
 this name because actually like 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.450
 said barbara remembers these lace 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.330
 arabs ok closed the speech of the name 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.860
 This floor is now baptized 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.240
 ring 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.920
 now I'll tell you a little bit about it 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.310
 workmanship at first I did 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.230
 this ring this the match 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.940
 with these 40 not knowing where 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.440
 he wanted to arrive 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.319
 then as if begun to form 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.450
 this rhombus or square to render like 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.910
 one puts it I thought I'd make a 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.370
 but another bracelet bending it in the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.660
 in the ports sideways these two corners 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.400
 he began to think that indeed 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.519
 could become a ring 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.260
 in the first case I then closed 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.750
 putting this tie in a lot 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.030
 simple with rails and then in the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.530
 I got away quietly in the second 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.680
 case wanted complicated existence 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:37.480
 because I wanted to do the same clamp 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.959
 who invented 75 people from the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.750
 cabin and that is this one here now I turn it 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.220
 with the super two so I had to do 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.190
 sideways this corner here 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.790
 then to make this band then me 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.530
 when I made the knuckle obviously 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.390
 very slowly he was creating inspiration 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.319
 this thing then I did n't do the second 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.660
 this one obviously didn't remember 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:09.220
 all the steps I said to myself ok 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:11.590
 in short I follow Campanino all the rounds and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.450
 I will succeed instead I have been quite a lot 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.160
 of time I had to dismantle at the end 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.950
 also all the work because I had done 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.750
 passage is wrong so I am 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.260
 sight bad person remember all the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.630
 steps 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.190
 so now i hope the tutor is not 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.350
 I had these problems 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.789
 I hope so with all my heart and therefore 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.590
 after all this talk 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.520
 I begin with ostrava in material that 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.740
 it is necessary then ok first of all for the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.120
 central part decided to use 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.160
 these 4 b cone of 4 mm bronze color e 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.650
 as super 2 or decided to put these 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.590
 here because I like to do a lot of poses 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:54.220
 not even contrast between them with colors 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.650
 so this is where i am color 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.720
 of how for the name written on 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:06.100
 turquoise blue pouch and knows how to rocaille 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:09.250
 these are 15 01 and then bills 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.350
 I mess this up here 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:16.470
 monster that 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:18.590
 a bronze now here it is very beautiful 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.670
 i like a lot the buys some time ago from 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.870
 crystal wishes and I must 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.360
 absolutely give me the code rr 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.480
 457 bar b 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.920
 yet this morning of course 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.110
 needle and thread 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.150
 I use this ami chi here 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.820
 always black in this case 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.770
 now I prepare for that file we begin a 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.430
 this adventure in being a guardian 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.430
 you have this ring
