00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.100
 Baptists if so much 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.029
 let's see batista70phone friends 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.279
 the covers for the g2 then we have the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.349
 the new arrivals have arrived 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.590
 slim you can see upper part 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:28.990
 lower deck uncovered let's go 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:31.420
 to insert the perfect coupling over ea 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.720
 thread remains a minimum a minimum 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.059
 opening below as you see remains 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.449
 discovered the lower part part 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.750
 side well covered even above the keys 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:47.040
 keys behind are obviously discovered 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.339
 however, the discovery remains in evidence 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.839
 camera texture remains open we have 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.940
 a minimum of protection for the 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.909
 camera because there is a bit of border 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.830
 here that avoids avoiding that goes by 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.170
 contact directly with the surfaces e 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.570
 that you can scratch the slide what 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.450
 that I've already heard how you see the cover 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.630
 does not alter practically anything 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.130
 the aesthetics of the phone we are now going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:19.929
 remove it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 let's see others we always have to ultra 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.990
 slim but we have it in black version 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.920
 we keep like no stocking over time 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.960
 is turned on well no matter ok perfect 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.049
 as you can see here it fits 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.789
 perfectly black coloring not 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.189
 transparent to which it goes to cover a little 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.829
 written in lg but in any case to one 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.469
 nice texture leader nor did I tell myself the 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.079
 camera remains covered that say 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:51.069
 absolutely very nice from this 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.170
 who uses lucio I like now let's go to 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.740
 turn it off otherwise it gives us each time 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.719
 annoyance as you see aesthetics remains 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.340
 unaffected by seeing it almost frontally 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.969
 you don't notice the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.920
 the cover that is ultra slim now let's go to 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:13.000
 see other covers 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:23.430
 sorry that crushed everything we pass 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.430
 to the back cover of a rigid type open it 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.310
 then this is the rigid one what 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.769
 I usually use it because I know that 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.579
 my own someone said that 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.910
 he had difficulty not closing 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.190
 absolutely not 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.670
 just push it on this side push 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.640
 to do well, the cover is inserted 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.390
 perfectly as you see protects 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.970
 well let's say a little bit more often 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.799
 of the ultra slim however from one 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.640
 good protection on the phone especially 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:01.030
 from scratches and still has a great 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.940
 let's say touchscreen feels good in 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.050
 hand from a very good grip is not slippery e 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.990
 then another cover of excellent workmanship 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.520
 let's see what 's a little bit 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:17.530
 more cool if in the past the term 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.900
 we talk about the linking here too we have 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.120
 really excellent 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.170
 also look at the very nice backside 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 shaped and shaped, felt and rough 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.330
 therefore also some insured rips 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.470
 we are going to insert it as we have 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.360
 inserted the rigid you can see stocking 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.760
 perfectly you can hold on well 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.640
 phone firmly open above 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.400
 open under keys behind of course 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.050
 free camera protection too 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.700
 here we have a little step of 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.739
 consequently the camera does not support 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.400
 directly on the table and has one 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.850
 very good protection now we go to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.130
 see it in another color so much 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:05.950
 moved the whole excuse would serve the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:11.489
 we see in white color de moura 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:15.130
 to open it flew of everything studied 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:19.090
 with usual I do everything live or 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:23.010
 white wing leading the same nichi texture 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.590
 let's go for a perfect hook 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.419
 fits perfectly beautiful a 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.570
 aesthetic level here too 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.400
 camera well there is a minimum of step 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.390
 that from a certain type of protection that 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.550
 to say 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.320
 excellent really good proof cover 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.060
 danilkin we certainly didn't find out to 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.200
 we therefore want to say that it is one 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.580
 warranty 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.280
 and with this long concluded a greeting 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.280
 from the batista sales area70 for 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 batista70phone 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.889
 Baptists if so much 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.889
 for the seat the circle
