00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.310
 hello welcome everyone 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 it's still pretty early in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.080
 morning and dude just a round of water 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 walked to watch or push fish 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.869
 activity cola but unfortunately I have 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.460
 cannot find any broken 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.830
 so it seems best to fish for 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.510
 a place where started where obstacle 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.500
 lie in the water and in this case it is 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.989
 the lily fels 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.910
 well i am a first kamminga i pass through 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.320
 trying and I like this episode one 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.850
 cable catch 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.850
 browse between the clogs 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.970
 the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.780
 the extent to which becomes incredibly busy 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.009
 fished a large portion and 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.720
 main body 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.009
 is substantially obstacle-free through were 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.369
 small part 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.149
 yes I am that volmer obstacles so 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.340
 sledges and fallen trees 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.950
 hang deep in the water what you often do 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.500
 see if I fish it will become a dropper 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.979
 by fish is that they retreat into 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.530
 speaking the obstacles in my book 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.460
 rods which will be available on the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.520
 vvk idea in December 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.619
 I elaborate on conditioning on one 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.440
 instinct in carp behavior 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.569
 but especially us as fishermen 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.940
 can put in in hunsford can 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.940
 and be able to catch hijackers 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.560
 hitting a cat in an empty field that is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.110
 point 1 time and hijacking that was collected 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.870
 in their lives themselves 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.280
 That is often a completely different story 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.170
 may like to use a braided 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.660
 main line not only do I have it 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.430
 excellent paid registration 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.750
 because there are few sets of children's garden 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.360
 once a is only a braided line 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.430
 also much sharper and will at once 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.580
 fish and crochet easily 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.960
 cut away through the plants 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.860
 each makes you much more likely to 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.770
 hairdresser to actually land and 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.470
 another important point is the way how 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.390
 your rods can draw a window rods 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.250
 set that up a bit higher so that I am up 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.070
 a bite 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.150
 the line is drawn to free and I 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:07.420
 also people to the line between the plants 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.400
 sinks are always those little dots 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.460
 they determine whether you actually fly 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.680
 catch or not wrong 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.410
 Another important point is that you must 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.070
 your good is under life 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.540
 flying name field are really well crocheted 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.810
 because I could just have a lot of strength and freedom 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.360
 is active or a similar line 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.630
 we will do that next time 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.630
 to treat 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 I have just arrived at a new site 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.310
 and parents in the most intimate place with 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.740
 all lilies and so it will be 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.640
 it was really beautiful just became too busy 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.140
 fished 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.850
 and I say that to the fish 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.180
 moved away from that area 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.870
 we now went to another place and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.940
 maybe i also have a little bit 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.490
 happiness because there is a who is change 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.540
 on arrival, the Mowin on this side of 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.740
 from shore and I was expecting the fish now 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.480
 sit here 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.050
 are going to prepare very quickly and we are going 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.230
 see if I just relocated on equal 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.970
 and you see it blink immediately success 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.640
 well hope it is just a little bit 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.800
 stay dry who has changed so much 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.010
 that the constant showers of red sky fall 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.510
 and seemed so good but good there you can 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.130
 of course do nothing about it 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.840
 as the framework that makes it too 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.840
 nothing out 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.090
 hijack very nice fish mousse ship 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.830
 how strong hobert is there still a nice fish 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.240
 can catch 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.570
 it just looks very good on it 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.570
 a moment 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.380
 English are now running at a very fast pace 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.260
 was very nice dove mirror who you know 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.260
 to catch and I have another sir 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.420
 look at what the farmer places physically 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.240
 Homing pigeons are in a life had nothing 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.100
 These are also fixed weather conditions 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.190
 some women are rainy 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.870
 home intimate mood on my but got 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.540
 you do not see without success 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.800
 what an amazingly beautiful scrub one of the 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.350
 old file 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.060
 well that meant doing something right 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.590
 well very nice close 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.020
 I hope you like it 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.230
 enjoyed it but we will go back with this fish 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.630
 and I hope I might see that again 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.440
 knew the next video of the language 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.440
