00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello guys and so today we have 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.450
 experimental 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.519
 the next filter is a filter skt model with 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.519
 m102 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.900
 Zhigulevsky oil filter so look 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.150
 a box like this 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.269
 list of models for which the filter 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.789
 fit car sense models here 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.529
 below so here it looks 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.529
 draw your attention to the filter 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.930
 no inscription maiden somewhere there that is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.790
 just not at all here right here 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.910
 specified address German on the right Lithuanian 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.989
 here are the phrases made in there and there 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 just not therefore it can be made 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.010
 anywhere 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.010
 open look inside 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:18.310
 look here and so he looks 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:23.369
 it means the upper part looks like here 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.570
 so you see here stuck 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.610
 rubber ring which should 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.799
 perform the role of drainage 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.049
 valve general looks so after all she 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.720
 thin very now I will explain why 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.959
 so this filter is used 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.899
 very interesting construction 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.979
 anti drainage valve such on 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.289
 Zhiguli wick when I meet 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:49.049
 for the first time, that is, look here 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:51.700
 such is the metal plate resistant 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.380
 spring here they are like that from above 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.209
 become on the edge of the filter and here 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.860
 so here it works other drainage 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:03.849
 see the valve there is such here 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.649
 his scheme of work that is actually here 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.979
 this o-ring it performs 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.090
 role well exactly how sealing 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.450
 no valve rings 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.850
 so he is thin in principle I think when 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.250
 such a design does not require it 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.620
 very tough as if this 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.310
 metal fungus was not here yet 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.900
 once you show how it works 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.859
 here and so works counter drainage 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.109
 valve in this filter 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:31.540
 that is, the principle of construction is interesting and 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.220
 moreover, I will say I have not yet met 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.069
 such a construction on Zhiguli 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.140
 filters although I came across this 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.939
 construction on the filter of another 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.739
 manufacturer and for another model but 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.019
 I repeat for Zhigulevsk filter I see 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.450
 such a design in the first counter 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.450
 drain valve means go further 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.500
 filtered coil is how she 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.500
 It looks that is basically you see 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.569
 traces of sealant made sort of like 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.090
 nothing but on the other hand with 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:07.040
 a certain amount of carelessness like this 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.870
 she looks here bypass valve 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.489
 principle is pressed with pretty decent 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.659
 effort by sensations from means looks 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.019
 full-time filter coil 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:22.349
 so here we have a plate 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.889
 pressure plate like nothing plate 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.310
 special 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:29.159
 Well, the filter housing itself with extruded 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 Lida logo and cattle in general themselves 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:34.370
 see he looks like this 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.590
 here you will see small burrs on 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:48.930
 inner surface in the top cover 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.810
 here again I repeat thin 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.510
 gasket which plays the role 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.520
 prokladochki it's well and is such 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.210
 interesting design opposite 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.550
 valve as a whole filter 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.220
 Looks like let's say on a 5-point 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.350
 a scale of 4 minus can take us three with 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.560
 plus that is, it seems to be such 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.110
 there are no punctures but on the other hand there are 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.210
 obvious moments in negligence by 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.130
 about how this valve works 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.020
 operation can not say anything 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.890
 say because the filter can see for yourself 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.900
 sawed new 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.780
 I do not know how long is enough 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:30.890
 constructions is it safe well in general 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.890
 something like this all guys thank you all now
