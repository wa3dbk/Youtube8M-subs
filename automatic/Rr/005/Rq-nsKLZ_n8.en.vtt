00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.880
 and this week we have launched a 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.080
 expansion called repair of souls that 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.910
 add a lot of new 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.639
 characteristics that players have 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.559
 been asking for a new class a new 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.900
 act the adventure mode that adds 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.330
 rewards and random missions in addition 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.339
 random dungeons also well 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.830
 All classes can level up 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.470
 60 to 70 and there are new skills 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.179
 special for all of them the way in 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.339
 that we drop objects is also 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.349
 different in repair of souls this started 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.750
 with the 2.0 patch and it's in the game 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.449
 but in repair we have continued adding 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.250
 new creation of objects in summary there 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:44.140
 many new features that make 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.969
 that the game is very fun is 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.160
 difficult to decide what feature is the 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.660
 most important of repair of souls I think 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.730
 that the one that makes the difference 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.039
 fundamental in the game is the mode 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.690
 adventure have random content that 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.120
 make changes the way you play 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.339
 you no longer play linearly as it happens with 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.589
 the story where everything he does is 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.510
 increase the difficulty in place what 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.700
 what it does is that when you get to the fifth act 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.140
 you unlock the adventure mode and start 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.980
 from there you can access the content 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.330
 random 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.330
 that we have been adding more 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.350
 and what the reward system is that 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.149
 we have taken everything you can do in 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.460
 the game well be to win monsters and 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.250
 bosses do events and so on and we've 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.350
 grouped in five for each wide if the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.970
 do you get a reward and every 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.630
 Once you leave the game and return to 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.670
 get in 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.530
 those five things are chosen again what 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.270
 which means that there is a total of 25 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.500
 different things you can do each 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 Once I speak 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.600
 it's hard to tell right now how it's going to 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.120
 evolve the game we will continue 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.890
 attentive to it and playing a lot we are 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.030
 very committed to this game and we 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.830
 love to support him 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.690
 let's listen to what the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.530
 amateurs and what they have to say in 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.450
 the future 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.860
 we read the forums we take people 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.750
 enable and we ask you to play and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.030
 tell us what they think when a 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.140
 game comes out we only have to see it and 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.670
 play it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.530
 making the changes as 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.370
 necessary there are many things that we want 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.959
 do but we have to see what happens 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.180
 the response of the users is 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.310
 fundamental for us the beta of 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 repair of souls was underway months and 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.090
 before that we had an alpha for 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.070
 family and friends for what we had to 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.900
 many people playing the game and we did 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.000
 many adjustments going on in your 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.980
 answer with the game on the street 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.980
 we will continue listening to your opinion 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.950
 Y 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.720
 now we have a all against all the 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.460
 player versus player is something that 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.650
 we've been talking about and it's something that 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.870
 The team is passionate but at the moment 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.590
 we have more plans to do so 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.590
 we will see 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.569
 I do not have a phrase for rivero the soul 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.000
 completely but I have one for the mode 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.099
 adventure from where you want and kill 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.569
 whoever you want because all of them open here 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.670
 the roads and the fans have always 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.319
 been asking for it I just want to 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.420
 go where I want and do what the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.060
 win do not make me follow me and choose a 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.610
 mission but for the full game 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.250
 maybe it would kill monsters to pass it 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.420
 well and get rewards from that goes 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.530
 all 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.630
 and the basis is randomness and killing 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.730
 monsters to get objects that's 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.620
 same in all games details 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.290
 specific to combat and other details 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.480
 change in each delivery if the game is 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.910
 basically fun with this guy 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.630
 of playability is what it really is 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.630
 interesting
