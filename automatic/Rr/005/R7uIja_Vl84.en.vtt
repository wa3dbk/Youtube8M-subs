00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
then runs along the track and you just

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.690 
then runs along the track and you just
leave<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:52.820> running<00:01:53.299> for<00:01:53.960> about<00:01:54.700> 1020

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
leave that running for about 1020

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
minutes normally and that's what then

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.990
