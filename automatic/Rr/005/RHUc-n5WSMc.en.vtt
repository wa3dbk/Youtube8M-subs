00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the variance of the weapons are also

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.310 
the variance of the weapons are also
banned<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.880> one<00:02:16.060> weapon<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.570> is<00:02:16.630> man<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.170> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
banned so one weapon that is man is the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.980

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.160 
right dragon is also banned in that
there<00:02:22.600> too<00:02:23.100> actually<00:02:24.100> I<00:02:24.130> think<00:02:24.720> three<00:02:25.720> weapons

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
there too actually I think three weapons

there too actually I think three weapons
yeah<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> think<00:02:26.800> three<00:02:27.070> weapons<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.580> also

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
yeah I think three weapons that also

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.620 
yeah I think three weapons that also
have<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:29.220> same<00:02:30.220> thing<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.670> have<00:02:30.820> re<00:02:31.300> skins

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
have that same thing to have re skins

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.960 
have that same thing to have re skins
and<00:02:31.930> variants<00:02:32.500> of<00:02:32.650> them<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.520> first<00:02:33.760> weapon

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
and variants of them so the first weapon

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.660 
and variants of them so the first weapon
is<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.300> m12<00:02:34.900> s<00:02:35.080> that's<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.650> big<00:02:35.980> shocker<00:02:36.310> I'm

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
simpler than that um so yeah that's

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.210 
simpler than that um so yeah that's
basically<00:03:34.480> how<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.900> enter<00:03:35.200> um<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.800> know<00:03:35.920> I<00:03:35.950> use

fraps<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:37.030> full<00:03:37.480> version<00:03:37.690> on<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.440> does<00:03:38.770> cost<00:03:39.070> i

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
fraps the full version on it does cost i

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.510 
fraps the full version on it does cost i
believe<00:03:39.550> 30<00:03:39.850> bucks<00:03:40.180> um<00:03:40.980> which<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.130> not<00:03:42.310> worth

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
believe 30 bucks um which is not worth

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.060 
believe 30 bucks um which is not worth
it<00:03:42.640> since<00:03:42.790> you're<00:03:42.970> only<00:03:43.000> getting<00:03:43.410> 20,000<00:03:44.410> zps

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
it since you're only getting 20,000 zps

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.310 
it since you're only getting 20,000 zps
