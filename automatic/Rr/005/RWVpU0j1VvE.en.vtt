00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:12.440
 Hello everyone 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 This time is Thank you for your purchase of the sisters whistle Usami 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:23.210
 Through the songs that are actually used in seven of the blowing way of lion dance whistle purchased in this course 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.710
 I think that I want to practice 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.009
 It is increased first finished but flowers are the seven 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.559
 It has become a 7 hole specifications 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:41.320
 A flower is a song to six six holes and seven long gesubu 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.320
 I can play both 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:51.240
 If there is a certain number of vertical and horizontal lineups, it may be the case 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:58.170
 First of all 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:01.660
 I hate anyone can get a simple sound in just the same way, lightly thin and Breakfast Association beam corner 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.470
 I would like to follow with you 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.470
 me 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:16.230
 Everyone is next time 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:17.409
 No matter where the voice is like a root palm , even if there are some techniques to reach it , if you get used to the 5 table 6 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.289
 I think fine tremor 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:31.020
 But is the first time or breath as soon as the amount is about the breath will no longer enough as one 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:31.020
 You can not use the amount of so much breath I do or give a fast narrow speed Te 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.950
 Dress good 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:46.600
 It is easier for 3 verticals to make sound 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:55.710
 It is easy to express the sound on the sideways and the expressive power is rich 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 It should be noted that I think would like to practice using the whistle Te song in this video 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.759
 The first time 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.190
 With the scale of six holes as an introduction 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:14.560
 Practice two different scales with a seven-hole scale 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:21.080
 Which a lot of Mai Shishi song of Toyama Prefecture of the two types of scale 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:25.040
 Or I think that often has to those who joined a little twist on this scale 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:29.810
 The usage of the finger is different depending on the area 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.620
 Or the location and structure of additional holes are different 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.620
 I think some songs can not be played in the rabbit gyoza dance 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:48.020
 So first, in the beginning and then practice the scale of Rokuie Tsubue 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.020
 Put your finger this way 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:58.440
 The bottom seventh hole which is not a meeting of the six- hole ax remains closed 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.860
 We hold down with little finger 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:07.440
 Please hold down with tape etc. 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.440
 Let's blow it up 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.340
 Please adjust the high sound by the strength of the go 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.620
 This is 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:11.640
 For example is the scale of the song of the main six holes of the lion Maifue 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:15.080
 In the scale of June, the ring finger of the left hand is this finger that holds down 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.220
 Basically this finger is not used 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.220
 I will try again 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:48.259
 Then practice the scale of 7 Jie whistle 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:53.690
 Seven flights at the meeting in July 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:55.840
 Naga th hole hole at the bottom will be in the open Panamax 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.660
 I do not use my little finger 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.660
 So I think that like I blew immediately 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:47.419
 Keep holding the ring finger of both hands at the meeting of the acupuncture 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.419
 Do not move 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.949
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:18.790
 The first is a six- hole scale as an introduction 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:24.889
 Practice this time of two types of sound pie in July directly below 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:28.550
 I think that I built to practice, but there is almost no difference in how to use fingers 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:34.939
 One place difference is the ring finger of the right hand 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:37.400
 Why The next time your about what such there is a difference though is what or not released Hanashika is 

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:43.460
 I would like to talk 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.880
 Though I wish I said in the beginning or have different use of the finger by region 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:52.590
 Also the finger 's hole doi 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:54.310
 If there is also a song that can not be played on the put away by short Usan stone has a different ground and Koto itself 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.600
 think 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:01.910
 That's why everyone 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:05.380
 Please let us know that we gave us Lion Dance so next time again 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.380
 See you at the second 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.700
 ni 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.580
 ran 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.910
 me 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:29.910
 I was offended by my left father
