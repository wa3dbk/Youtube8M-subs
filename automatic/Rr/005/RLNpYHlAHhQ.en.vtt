00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 

the<00:00:00.359> goal<00:00:00.570> with<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.810> project<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.530> make<00:00:01.800> it

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
the goal with this project is to make it

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.539 
the goal with this project is to make it
simple<00:00:02.580> for<00:00:02.610> anyone<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.270> start<00:00:03.650> working<00:00:04.650> with

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
simple for anyone to start working with

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.880 
simple for anyone to start working with
these<00:00:05.850> concepts<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.660> GPU<00:00:07.080> programming<00:00:07.319> even

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
these concepts of GPU programming even

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.080 
these concepts of GPU programming even
if<00:00:07.980> they've<00:00:08.130> never<00:00:08.340> programmed<00:00:08.849> in<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
if they've never programmed in the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.799 
if they've never programmed in the
traditional<00:00:09.570> way<00:00:09.630> before<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:11.480> that's<00:00:12.480> sort

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
traditional way before and that's sort

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.440 
traditional way before and that's sort
of<00:00:12.870> really<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.219> philosophical<00:00:15.000> idea<00:00:15.299> of

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
of really the the philosophical idea of

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.939 
of really the the philosophical idea of
the<00:00:15.570> project<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.320> get<00:00:16.470> people<00:00:16.500> thinking

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the project is to get people thinking

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.710 
the project is to get people thinking
about<00:00:17.340> programming<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.970> different<00:00:18.300> way<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
about programming in a different way and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.929 
about programming in a different way and
especially<00:00:19.350> by<00:00:19.680> targeting<00:00:20.160> new<00:00:20.310> programmers

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
especially by targeting new programmers

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.070 
especially by targeting new programmers
and<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.820> urgency<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:24.840> and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and so I think the urgency for me and

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.740 
and so I think the urgency for me and
doing<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.529> project<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.599> this

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
doing this project is that I think this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.230 
doing this project is that I think this
is<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> key<00:00:28.800> areas<00:00:29.340> where<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is one of the key areas where the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
is one of the key areas where the
artistic<00:00:30.779> community<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.650> contribute<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
artistic community can contribute to the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.870 
artistic community can contribute to the
computer<00:00:32.880> science<00:00:33.210> community<00:00:33.680> um<00:00:34.880> so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
computer science community um so

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.110 
computer science community um so
basically<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:38.129> know<00:00:38.250> processors<00:00:38.850> aren't

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
basically you know processors aren't

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.790 
basically you know processors aren't
getting<00:00:39.390> any<00:00:39.510> faster<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:41.149> they<00:00:42.590> you<00:00:43.590> know<00:00:43.620> we

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
getting any faster on they you know we

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500 
getting any faster on they you know we
can<00:00:43.950> push<00:00:44.129> them<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.579> faster<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.090> they're

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
can push them to go faster but they're

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.910 
can push them to go faster but they're
reaching<00:00:45.719> these<00:00:45.930> physical<00:00:46.440> limits<00:00:46.739> where

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
reaching these physical limits where

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
reaching these physical limits where
they<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.399> too<00:00:47.579> hot<00:00:47.789> or<00:00:48.090> they<00:00:48.300> require

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
they just get too hot or they require

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.119 
they just get too hot or they require
too<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.230> energy<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> new<00:00:52.500> strategy

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
too much energy on so the new strategy

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889 
too much energy on so the new strategy
for<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> past<00:00:54.000> 10<00:00:54.270> years<00:00:54.480> has<00:00:54.750> been

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
for that for the past 10 years has been

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.229 
for that for the past 10 years has been
to<00:00:54.960> make<00:00:55.260> processors<00:00:55.949> wider<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.670> sense<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
to make processors wider in a sense so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
to make processors wider in a sense so
you<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.379> processors<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.129> are

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
you just have more processors that are

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
you just have more processors that are
all<00:00:59.699> doing<00:01:00.120> their<00:01:00.989> own<00:01:01.020> thing<00:01:01.199> independently

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
all doing their own thing independently

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.650 
all doing their own thing independently
and<00:01:02.219> that's<00:01:02.340> sort<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> what<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> GPU<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.359> all

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and that's sort of what the GPU is all

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.000 
and that's sort of what the GPU is all
about<00:01:03.960> um<00:01:05.720> but<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.170> problem<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
about um but the problem with this is

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
about um but the problem with this is
that<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.729> lot<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> people<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.500> academic

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that a lot of people in the academic

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.880 
that a lot of people in the academic
computer<00:01:11.460> science<00:01:11.820> community<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.890> still

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
computer science community are still

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.390 
computer science community are still
focused<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.570> taking<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:16.619> traditional<00:01:17.250> ways

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
focused on taking the traditional ways

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.969 
focused on taking the traditional ways
of<00:01:17.610> programming<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.530> trying<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.830> get

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
of programming and trying to just get

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.770 
of programming and trying to just get
those<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.549> run<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.000> these<00:01:21.930> parallel<00:01:22.590> on

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
those to run on these parallel on

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.800 
those to run on these parallel on
systems<00:01:25.610> but<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.240> people<00:01:27.659> should

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
systems but really I think people should

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
systems but really I think people should
be<00:01:28.200> looking<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.640> well<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.299> know

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
be looking at it as well you know

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
be looking at it as well you know
everything<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:30.960> parallel<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.740> need<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.040> just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
everything is parallel we need to just

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
everything is parallel we need to just
be<00:01:32.400> thinking<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:34.229> way<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
be thinking about this in that way and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.890 
be thinking about this in that way and
like<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:35.310> was<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.759> academic<00:01:35.939> conference<00:01:36.479> two

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
like I was at an academic conference two

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.460 
like I was at an academic conference two
weeks<00:01:37.110> ago<00:01:37.310> where<00:01:38.310> um<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.930> saying<00:01:40.229> well<00:01:40.350> be

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
weeks ago where um and saying well be

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
weeks ago where um and saying well be
you<00:01:40.920> know<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.490> universe<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:41.970> parallel

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you know like the universe is parallel

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.940 
you know like the universe is parallel
right<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.020> everything's<00:01:43.500> happening

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
right like everything's happening

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.609 
right like everything's happening
everywhere<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.790> on<00:01:45.350> we<00:01:46.350> should<00:01:46.530> be

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
everywhere all the time on we should be

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.289 
everywhere all the time on we should be
thinking<00:01:46.799> about<00:01:47.009> our<00:01:47.399> programs<00:01:47.820> like<00:01:48.090> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
thinking about our programs like that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.359 
thinking about our programs like that
rather<00:01:48.600> than<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.049> very<00:01:49.320> narrow-minded<00:01:49.799> like

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
rather than this very narrow-minded like

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.069 
rather than this very narrow-minded like
do<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.960> know

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
do this do this do this do this you know

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.999 
do this do this do this do this you know
like<00:01:52.320> sequence<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.979> things<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.799> guys

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
like sequence of things on and the guys

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.700 
like sequence of things on and the guys
response<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.820> well<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.500> think

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
response was well you know I don't think

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
response was well you know I don't think
they're<00:01:59.369> very<00:01:59.399> many<00:01:59.790> people<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> world

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
they're very many people in the world

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.410 
they're very many people in the world
who<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.649> um<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.119> think

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
who can think like that um but I think

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.420 
who can think like that um but I think
that's<00:02:03.600> completely<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.560> wrong<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.189> most

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that's completely the wrong I think most

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.920 
that's completely the wrong I think most
people<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> world<00:02:06.090> think<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.719> and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
people in the world think like that and

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.080 
people in the world think like that and
it's<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.560> people<00:02:07.799> who<00:02:08.550> are<00:02:08.670> entrenched

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it's just that people who are entrenched

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.940 
it's just that people who are entrenched
in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> traditional<00:02:09.989> ways<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.319> programming

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
in the traditional ways of programming

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.890 
in the traditional ways of programming
are<00:02:11.099> very<00:02:11.310> much<00:02:11.670> caught<00:02:11.970> up<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.360> like<00:02:12.629> just

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
are very much caught up in like just

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
are very much caught up in like just
doing

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
doing

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
doing
sequences<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> things<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:16.200> know<00:02:16.319> people

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
sequences of things but you know people

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.180 
sequences of things but you know people
in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.830> arts<00:02:16.860> community<00:02:17.430> are<00:02:18.120> very<00:02:18.180> used<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
in the arts community are very used to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.210 
in the arts community are very used to
um<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:21.360> know<00:02:21.450> seeing<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.959> system<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
um you know seeing a system as the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.190 
um you know seeing a system as the
relation<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.819> all<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.150> its<00:02:24.300> parts<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.900> how<00:02:25.020> all

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
relation of all of its parts and how all

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.809 
relation of all of its parts and how all
of<00:02:25.230> them<00:02:25.530> interact<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.160> each<00:02:26.190> other<00:02:26.459> and

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
of them interact with each other and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.440 
of them interact with each other and
relate<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.600> each<00:02:27.750> other<00:02:27.900> simultaneously<00:02:28.260> on

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
relate to each other simultaneously on

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.570 
relate to each other simultaneously on
and<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.860> that's<00:02:35.040> why<00:02:35.220> i<00:02:35.250> think

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and so this is so that's why i think

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.520 
and so this is so that's why i think
that<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.910> artistic<00:02:36.420> community<00:02:36.630> could<00:02:37.140> really

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that the artistic community could really

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.550 
that the artistic community could really
on<00:02:37.880> by<00:02:38.880> getting<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.540> next<00:02:39.959> generation<00:02:40.140> of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
on by getting this next generation of

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.530 
on by getting this next generation of
programmers<00:02:41.100> thinking<00:02:41.580> about<00:02:41.850> programming

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
programmers thinking about programming

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.559 
programmers thinking about programming
in<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:42.900> way<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.319> parallel<00:02:43.950> programming

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
in this way of parallel programming

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.350 
in this way of parallel programming
could<00:02:45.569> really<00:02:45.840> contribute<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
could really contribute to on the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.830 
could really contribute to on the
computer<00:02:48.780> science<00:02:49.140> world<00:02:49.350> as<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> whole
