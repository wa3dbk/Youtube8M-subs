well first of all off the Vatican till

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.640 
well first of all off the Vatican till
the<00:00:29.939> finish<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.330> different<00:00:30.720> yeah<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.439> think

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the finish is different yeah and I think

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.990 
the finish is different yeah and I think
it's<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.830> bit<00:00:31.980> thinner<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.430> well<00:00:32.610> than<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's a bit thinner as well than the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
it's a bit thinner as well than the
previous<00:00:33.329> right<00:00:33.570> absolutely<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> little

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
previous right absolutely it's a little

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.690 
previous right absolutely it's a little
bit<00:00:34.680> thinner<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.040> what's<00:00:35.219> cool<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.579> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
bit thinner but what's cool is the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.010 
bit thinner but what's cool is the
screen<00:00:35.969> has<00:00:36.090> actually<00:00:36.450> gotten<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.840> bit

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
screen has actually gotten a little bit

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.840 
screen has actually gotten a little bit
bigger<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.590> by<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> quarter<00:00:38.340> inch<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.700> each

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
bigger about by a quarter inch on each

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.760 
bigger about by a quarter inch on each
one<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> new<00:00:40.140> matte<00:00:40.350> finish<00:00:40.739> so

feature<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.000> then<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.359> must<00:01:03.510> mean<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
