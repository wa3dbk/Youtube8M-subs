00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
a lap around the block and see which one

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.310 

so<00:01:35.500> it's<00:01:36.010> very<00:01:36.220> very<00:01:36.940> cold<00:01:37.270> dripping<00:01:38.140> all<00:01:38.290> over

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
so it's very very cold dripping all over

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.800 
so it's very very cold dripping all over
me<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:38.979> it's<00:01:39.369> not<00:01:39.729> really<00:01:40.180> doing<00:01:40.390> much<00:01:40.450> it's

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
me and it's not really doing much it's

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.230 
me and it's not really doing much it's
kind<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.560> I'm<00:01:41.710> wearing<00:01:41.979> a<00:01:42.340> thin<00:01:43.030> layer<00:01:43.180> of

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
kind of like I'm wearing a thin layer of

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.520 
kind of like I'm wearing a thin layer of
nylon<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:45.040> hopefully<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.810> better<00:01:46.930> results<00:01:47.440> in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
nylon so hopefully get better results in

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
nylon so hopefully get better results in
the<00:01:47.680> next<00:01:47.800> one

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550

much warmer than the down when wet this

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.729 
much warmer than the down when wet this
one<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.569> was<00:02:50.720> actually<00:02:51.049> stealing<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.590> heat

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
one it was actually stealing the heat

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.670 
one it was actually stealing the heat
from<00:02:52.100> me<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.310> was<00:02:52.700> warmer<00:02:53.060> with<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.360> on<00:02:53.569> this<00:02:54.380> one

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
from me I was warmer with it on this one

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.710 
from me I was warmer with it on this one
keeping<00:02:55.310> me<00:02:55.430> quite<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:55.670> bit<00:02:55.940> warmer<00:02:56.150> than<00:02:56.360> not

keeping me quite a bit warmer than not

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.210 
keeping me quite a bit warmer than not
having<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.260> it's<00:02:57.500> actually<00:02:57.890> getting<00:02:58.130> quite

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
having it it's actually getting quite

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.729 
having it it's actually getting quite
warm<00:02:58.519> so<00:02:58.819> I'd<00:02:59.630> say<00:02:59.930> that<00:02:59.959> North<00:03:00.380> Face<00:03:00.560> is

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739
