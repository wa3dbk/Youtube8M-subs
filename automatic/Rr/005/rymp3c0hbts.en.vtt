00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 Hello friends, finally finally 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.540
 spring came the sun is warm and you want 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:22.680
 something joyful and fun and this 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:24.570
 I have top 5 funniest books and with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.269
 your permission in fifth place i 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.970
 still stick one book that is not 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 quite comedic but pass 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 past it is impossible and there is very humor 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.920
 good is very thin 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.050
 I'm talking about the master and margarita on 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 Naturally book about another and and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.750
 gonna have fun for you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.390
 This is a story about love and creativity of religion. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.190
 but what's the sense of humor as thin Bulgakov 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 sneers at soviet society and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 mocks his vices no wonder the Soviet 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.789
 union this book was banned 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.340
 here you can remember the second fish 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.770
 freshness and many other subtle remarks 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.840
 Volanda personally I have the greatest delight 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.110
 always caused the appearance of it 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.650
 homeless I laughed out loud in spite of 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 the fact that the master and margarita is not quite 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.520
 comedy literature 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.450
 but read it is worth it and laugh there 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.299
 there is something 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.689
 and think laugh and mood yourself 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.479
 accurately lift a horse in 4th place 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.000
 which as a child I just adored though 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.450
 did not like to read but it is something 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.090
 awesome gregory oster bad tips 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.570
 here you can remember about his horror stories 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.369
 task book this in voice is very funny and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.560
 not to torment you with long stories 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.729
 just count a couple of these 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.399
 bad advice 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.229
 I do not understand how in childhood we 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.939
 let it read poetry 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.729
 Gregoria Oster reads should who not 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.790
 jumped out of the window with my mother's umbrella 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.100
 that dashing parachutist is not considered yet 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.649
 don't fly around like a bird on 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.670
 excited crowd not to lie to him in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:11.250
 hospital bandaged foot if all 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.290
 family swim you went to the river not 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.810
 stir mom and dad 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.359
 likely shore do not make a cry until 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.109
 no adults go to rest 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.840
 pestering 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.609
 try to drown dive into 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.760
 here are these bad tips 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:29.010
 it can be very, very long 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 fourth place well deserved as 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.870
 I'll read you one more thing 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.819
 the poem is just about the dispute in 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.180
 I think the Internet is very clear 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.209
 shows what is happening do not agree either 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.959
 why not with whom and never and who with you 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.840
 I agree those cowards call for it all 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.409
 you will begin to love and respect, and everywhere 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.909
 You shall have a full and a lot of friends on 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.849
 third place i suggest you 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.879
 go to England and swim along the Thames 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.840
 along with the novel the three in the boat not counting 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.060
 dogs 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.120
 honestly i dont fap english humor 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.760
 but this trip by thames is something 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.750
 awesome funny what did you read in it 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.239
 twice in life 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.319
 once in childhood and remember that 0 is not 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.760
 liked 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.120
 I do not know how this could happen 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.579
 probably was a very stupid child but he 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.159
 recently I was lucky I could not reread 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.519
 and I am absolutely delighted because 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.190
 that so much self-irony so many good 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.470
 pranks with this description thames england then 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.010
 time is really very good very 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.239
 funny and cult work 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.909
 I highly recommend reading 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.099
 mood rise one hundred percent and 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.229
 we come to the second place and a little bit 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.449
 we grieve because we remember terry 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:48.540
 pratchett who most recently became 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.639
 March is gone and life but we remember him 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.919
 we will only smile because 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.959
 left us a beautiful book and me 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.479
 it's really hard to choose 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.479
 any one here is probably just 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:03.479
 call the cycle a flat world which is from 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:06.629
 beginning and until the end worked interesting and 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:10.109
 incredibly funny i was starting to read 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.199
 Witches for granite going abroad then 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.939
 to arms to arms and long plunged into 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.190
 his book tory passage one of those 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.430
 authors whose easy to start reading and 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.870
 it is very difficult to quit even difficult for me 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.450
 advise some first book to 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.570
 read but let it be going for 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.790
 border and I personally read in 1 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.770
 so probably I advise you, but with 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.140
 first page you plunge into 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.080
 outgoing funny fun 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:39.560
 subtle good humor light narration 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.170
 and all the first book is 2 3 and you are there in it 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.240
 a flat world for a long, long stay 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.040
 so if you're in a flat world yet 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.490
 there were no toasts to rob a suitcase and 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.740
 meet there and if you are the kind i think 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.140
 it is worth returning your portion 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.360
 get pleasure without any 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.520
 doubt what is the first place and how are you 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.790
 understand here without any options 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.350
 no other book could be here 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.830
 by definition 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.900
 because the funniest book in all 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.440
 white light 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.570
 This 12 chairs Ilf and Petrov 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.760
 I would add a golden calf here 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.280
 be my will I put on first and 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.820
 second place on c chairs and golden 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.540
 calf 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.430
 but decided to give the first two places 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.960
 Ilf and Petrov then too and in the beginning 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.620
 I also wanted to read some quotes 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.770
 From the adventure of Ostap and Kisa, but then 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.620
 thought it made no sense than unique 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.950
 this book is one big quote 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.950
 you start reading from the first lines this 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.700
 brilliantly every line can be 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.530
 quote 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.960
 each offer can be put in 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.100
 quotes make it absolutely 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.060
 unique book 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.680
 how many times and you can reread 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.910
 set a million times and still be 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.640
 funny this book is awesome i adore it 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.190
 and Petrov and adore masses of chairs and if 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:09.260
 for some reason generally incomprehensible 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:12.830
 you did not read this book to me 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.800
 Now here is close this video about here 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.610
 Now here at this moment and read 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.260
 Ostap Bender 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:24.620
 12 chairs golden calf is the funniest 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.780
 book in the world but i remind you that this is my 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.190
 personally top based on my personal 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.050
 perceptions you can with him not 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.050
 can agree to add something 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.660
 so I will be glad if you write what 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.090
