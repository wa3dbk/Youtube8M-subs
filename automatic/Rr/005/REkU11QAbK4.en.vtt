00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
handle all of this for us so this will

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.460 
handle all of this for us so this will
either<00:01:19.610> result<00:01:19.939> in<00:01:20.150> him<00:01:20.600> dying<00:01:20.869> in<00:01:21.049> late<00:01:21.260> or

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
Darius head on this damage output is way

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.640 
Darius head on this damage output is way
too<00:01:37.549> high<00:01:37.820> instead<00:01:38.810> fight<00:01:39.170> him<00:01:39.320> when<00:01:39.560> his

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
too high instead fight him when his

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.800 
too high instead fight him when his
skills<00:01:39.920> are<00:01:40.100> on<00:01:40.130> cooldown<00:01:40.549> as<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.479> can<00:01:41.630> see

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
skills are on cooldown as you can see

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.080 
skills are on cooldown as you can see
here<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.200> see<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.009> his<00:01:43.130> attack<00:01:43.430> speed<00:01:43.729> slow<00:01:43.939> is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
here I see that his attack speed slow is

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.640 
here I see that his attack speed slow is
on<00:01:44.180> cooldown<00:01:44.390> because<00:01:44.840> he<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:45.140> used<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.500> and

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
on cooldown because he just used it and

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.289 
on cooldown because he just used it and
so<00:01:45.799> I<00:01:45.829> proceeded<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.369> fight<00:01:46.549> him<00:01:46.700> he<00:01:47.150> doesn't

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
so I proceeded to fight him he doesn't

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.700 
so I proceeded to fight him he doesn't
have<00:01:47.420> anything<00:01:47.780> against<00:01:48.200> me<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.409> I<00:01:48.500> easily

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
have anything against me and I easily
