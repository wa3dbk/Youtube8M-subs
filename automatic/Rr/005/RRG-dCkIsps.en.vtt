what's<00:00:00.329> up<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.780> it's<00:00:01.020> me<00:00:01.170> Jeremy<00:00:01.199> and<00:00:01.770> today

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and today

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.530 
what's up guys it's me Jeremy and today
I<00:00:01.979> want<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.220> talk<00:00:02.399> about<00:00:02.460> why<00:00:02.850> it's<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.149> very

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
I want to talk about why it's a very

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630 
I want to talk about why it's a very
good<00:00:03.689> idea<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:04.410> have<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> small<00:00:04.950> champion<00:00:05.430> pool

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
good idea to have a small champion pool

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.550 
good idea to have a small champion pool
at<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.029> lower<00:00:06.210> levels<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.660> play<00:00:06.930> more

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
at the lower levels of play more

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.250 
at the lower levels of play more
specifically<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.340> silver<00:00:09.059> bronze<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.840> pre

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
specifically in silver bronze and pre

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.129 
specifically in silver bronze and pre
level<00:00:10.559> 30<00:00:10.849> now<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.969> entire<00:00:12.120> concept<00:00:12.840> comes

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
level 30 now this entire concept comes

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.919 
level 30 now this entire concept comes
down<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.650> mechanics<00:00:14.219> each<00:00:15.000> champion<00:00:15.509> has<00:00:15.900> a

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
down to mechanics each champion has a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.080 
down to mechanics each champion has a
unique<00:00:16.320> set<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.590> game<00:00:16.890> mechanics<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.910> needs

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
unique set of game mechanics that needs

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.269 
unique set of game mechanics that needs
to<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.270> practiced<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.990> played<00:00:19.320> well<00:00:19.680> to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to be practiced and played well to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.250 
to be practiced and played well to
dominate<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.090> character<00:00:21.539> however

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
dominate on that character however

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.920 
dominate on that character however
rights<00:00:23.160> design<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> game<00:00:24.090> has<00:00:24.510> made<00:00:24.750> so

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
rights design of the game has made so

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.480 
rights design of the game has made so
that<00:00:24.960> every<00:00:25.350> champion<00:00:25.769> plays<00:00:26.039> fairly

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
that every champion plays fairly

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.279 
that every champion plays fairly
differently<00:00:26.910> which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.510> awesome<00:00:27.750> because<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
differently which is awesome because it

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.380 
differently which is awesome because it
makes<00:00:28.410> each<00:00:28.650> champion<00:00:28.949> very<00:00:29.369> unique<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:30.300> it

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
makes each champion very unique but it

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.999 
makes each champion very unique but it
also<00:00:30.570> makes<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.230> playing<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.769> large

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
also makes it so that playing a large

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160 
also makes it so that playing a large
amount<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.309> champions<00:00:32.820> requires<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> solid

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
amount of champions requires a solid

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.860 
amount of champions requires a solid
level<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.559> mechanics<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.280> player<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.630> fact

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
level of mechanics from player the fact

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.389 
level of mechanics from player the fact
is<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.559> players<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.100> silver

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
is is that the players that are silver

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.400 
is is that the players that are silver
or<00:00:38.579> below<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> mechanics

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
or below do not have the mechanics

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.170 
or below do not have the mechanics
necessary<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.399> play<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> large<00:00:41.850> amount<00:00:42.120> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
necessary to play a large amount of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.180 
necessary to play a large amount of
Champions<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.840> they<00:00:43.260> are<00:00:43.320> still<00:00:43.620> working<00:00:44.070> on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
Champions as they are still working on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.400 
Champions as they are still working on
developing<00:00:44.670> their<00:00:44.820> mechanics<00:00:45.300> because<00:00:46.260> of

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
developing their mechanics because of

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.520 
developing their mechanics because of
this<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.739> highly<00:00:47.579> recommend<00:00:47.840> playing<00:00:48.840> no<00:00:49.200> more

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
this I highly recommend playing no more

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.260 
this I highly recommend playing no more
than<00:00:49.739> three<00:00:50.129> champions<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.879> each<00:00:51.030> role

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
than three champions for each role

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
than three champions for each role
playing<00:00:52.199> even<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.920> or<00:00:53.039> two<00:00:53.070> champions

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
playing even just one or two champions

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
playing even just one or two champions
would<00:00:53.850> be<00:00:54.000> more<00:00:54.239> ideal<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.829> get

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
would be more ideal but that can get

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
would be more ideal but that can get
kind<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.579> boring<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.660> three

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
kind of boring so I think three

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.160 
kind of boring so I think three
champions<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> very<00:00:59.100> solid<00:00:59.520> number<00:01:00.170> playing

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
champions is a very solid number playing

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.479 
champions is a very solid number playing
a<00:01:01.289> small<00:01:01.410> amount<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.770> Champions<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.340> give

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
a small amount of Champions will give

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
a small amount of Champions will give
you<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> ability<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> focus<00:01:03.899> so

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you the ability to not have to focus so

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.719 
you the ability to not have to focus so
much<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.500> improving<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> mechanics<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
much on improving on the mechanics of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.670 
much on improving on the mechanics of
those<00:01:05.880> champions<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.930> rather<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> focus

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
those champions but rather you can focus

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
those champions but rather you can focus
on<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> things<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.340> will<00:01:08.549> improve<00:01:08.909> your

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
on the things that will improve your

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.359 
on the things that will improve your
play<00:01:09.299> overall<00:01:09.810> such<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.560> game<00:01:10.770> mechanics<00:01:11.250> like

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
play overall such as game mechanics like

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.700 
play overall such as game mechanics like
last<00:01:11.610> hitting<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.420> decision<00:01:12.960> making<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.409> game

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
last hitting or decision making and game

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
last hitting or decision making and game
smarts<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.640> just<00:01:14.820> gives<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.270> less<00:01:15.450> thing

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
smarts it just gives you one less thing

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.330 
smarts it just gives you one less thing
that<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> try<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> practice<00:01:16.530> meaning

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
that you have to try to practice meaning

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.130 
that you have to try to practice meaning
that<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> other<00:01:17.729> aspects<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> your<00:01:18.509> game<00:01:18.720> can

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that the other aspects of your game can

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.380 
that the other aspects of your game can
be<00:01:19.170> improved<00:01:19.530> much<00:01:20.220> easily<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.850> much<00:01:21.150> more

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
be improved much easily and much more

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.830 
be improved much easily and much more
efficiently<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> Jeremy<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.210> might<00:01:24.390> ask<00:01:24.540> me

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
efficiently but Jeremy you might ask me

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
efficiently but Jeremy you might ask me
doesn't<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.799> small<00:01:26.159> champion<00:01:26.670> pool<00:01:26.909> lead<00:01:27.180> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
doesn't a small champion pool lead to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.090 
doesn't a small champion pool lead to
meat<00:01:27.540> counter<00:01:27.810> picking<00:01:28.320> myself<00:01:28.470> sometimes

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
meat counter picking myself sometimes

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
meat counter picking myself sometimes
well<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.030> another<00:01:30.329> bonus<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.780> playing

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
well that's another bonus to playing

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
well that's another bonus to playing
three<00:01:31.229> champions<00:01:31.680> playing<00:01:32.310> three<00:01:32.549> champions

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
three champions playing three champions

three champions playing three champions
instead<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.600> or<00:01:33.720> two<00:01:33.869> should<00:01:34.470> give<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
instead of one or two should give you

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.980 
instead of one or two should give you
