they<00:00:35.309> think<00:00:35.370> possibly<00:00:36.300> ice<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.110> ice<00:00:37.410> will

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
they think possibly ice and ice will

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
they think possibly ice and ice will
mean<00:00:37.920> water<00:00:38.190> which<00:00:38.670> means<00:00:38.940> yeah<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> water

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320

mean water which means yeah that water
equals<00:00:40.559> life<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.489> want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> know<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
equals life so what they want to know is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
equals life so what they want to know is
if<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.360> was<00:00:42.480> ever<00:00:42.690> water<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.410> any<00:00:43.739> kind<00:00:43.920> of

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
if there was ever water on any kind of

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.220 
if there was ever water on any kind of
moon<00:00:44.309> or<00:00:44.700> planet<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> good

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
much as an SUV so we all like the moon

much as an SUV so we all like the moon
we<00:01:19.530> look<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.159> night<00:01:20.340> but<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.670> are<00:01:20.759> about

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
we look at it at night but we are about

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.990 
we look at it at night but we are about
to<00:01:20.970> hit<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> twice<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.830> quite<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.670> double

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to hit it twice with quite the double

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.760 
to hit it twice with quite the double
impact<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.630> Buzz<00:01:24.930> Aldrin<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.680> you

impact and Buzz Aldrin what are you
going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.040> thinking<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.580> happens

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
going to be thinking is that happens

what are you most interested in seeing
well<00:01:30.810> I'm<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> look

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
well I'm probably going to have to look

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.280 
well I'm probably going to have to look
at<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> replay<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:33.540> I've<00:01:33.840> never<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
at a replay because I've never be

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.740 
at a replay because I've never be
looking<00:01:34.650> at<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.030> but<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.150> very<00:01:36.420> interested

in<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:38.329> resolution<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> exactly<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.229> we've

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
in the resolution of exactly what we've

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.960 
in the resolution of exactly what we've
been<00:01:40.500> getting<00:01:40.890> from<00:01:41.100> our<00:01:41.430> satellite

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
been getting from our satellite

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
been getting from our satellite
detectors<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.200> give<00:01:43.380> us<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.619> little<00:01:43.770> bit<00:01:43.950> more

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

accurate<00:01:44.759> information<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
accurate information as to just what is

going<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.280> inching<00:04:15.760> closer<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.209> closer<00:04:16.720> it's

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
going to inching closer and closer it's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.449 
going to inching closer and closer it's
like<00:04:17.260> when<00:04:17.620> you're<00:04:17.860> in<00:04:17.950> school<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:18.400> they

like when you're in school and they

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.550 
like when you're in school and they

November I are 220 PR ken so Ryan it has
hit<00:05:12.160> and<00:05:12.490> they<00:05:12.669> have<00:05:12.850> an<00:05:12.970> infrared<00:05:13.360> picture

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
hit and they have an infrared picture

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.469 
hit and they have an infrared picture
but<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:14.949> gather<00:05:15.280> that<00:05:15.430> they're<00:05:15.729> still<00:05:16.060> waiting

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
but I gather that they're still waiting

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.860 
but I gather that they're still waiting
for<00:05:16.510> the<00:05:16.780> next<00:05:17.020> phase<00:05:17.590> which<00:05:18.100> is<00:05:18.340> the

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
for the next phase which is the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.740 
for the next phase which is the
analytical<00:05:19.870> machinery<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:20.889> thicken<00:05:21.750> that's

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
analytical machinery to thicken that's

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.120 
analytical machinery to thicken that's
right<00:05:22.870> let<00:05:23.050> me<00:05:23.080> try<00:05:23.139> to<00:05:23.320> explain<00:05:23.410> this<00:05:23.800> there's

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
right let me try to explain this there's

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.100 
right let me try to explain this there's
actually<00:05:24.550> two<00:05:24.850> impacts<00:05:25.449> the<00:05:25.720> one<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.080> just

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
actually two impacts the one that just

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.010 
actually two impacts the one that just
happened<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:26.979> the<00:05:27.580> rocket<00:05:28.030> booster<00:05:28.510> that's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
happened is the rocket booster that's

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.750 
happened is the rocket booster that's
the<00:05:29.260> thing<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.620> weighs<00:05:29.800> as<00:05:30.010> much<00:05:30.039> as<00:05:30.220> an<00:05:30.460> SUV

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
the thing that weighs as much as an SUV

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.510 
the thing that weighs as much as an SUV
that<00:05:30.910> was<00:05:31.150> the<00:05:31.389> initial<00:05:31.660> hit<00:05:32.190> behind<00:05:33.190> that

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
that was the initial hit behind that

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.969 
that was the initial hit behind that
about<00:05:34.060> four<00:05:34.389> minutes<00:05:34.720> behind<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.470> is<00:05:35.650> a

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
about four minutes behind it is a

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.550 
about four minutes behind it is a
satellite<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.789> is<00:05:37.270> going<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.080> read<00:05:38.349> that

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
satellite that is going to read that

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.830 
satellite that is going to read that
debris<00:05:38.949> scan<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.550> for<00:05:39.699> any<00:05:39.880> signs<00:05:40.240> of<00:05:40.510> the<00:05:40.720> ice

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
debris scan it for any signs of the ice

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.260 
debris scan it for any signs of the ice
and<00:05:41.229> then<00:05:41.440> that<00:05:41.680> satellite<00:05:42.250> will<00:05:42.520> also<00:05:42.910> hit<00:05:43.150> in

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
and then that satellite will also hit in

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.300 
and then that satellite will also hit in
exactly<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.870> same<00:05:43.900> spot<00:05:44.410> so<00:05:44.620> that<00:05:44.650> will<00:05:44.949> be<00:05:45.099> as

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
exactly the same spot so that will be as

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:53.850 
exactly the same spot so that will be as
we've<00:05:45.910> called<00:05:46.120> it<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.360> double<00:05:46.389> impact

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.730 

what<00:05:54.520> would<00:05:54.639> be<00:05:54.729> important<00:05:55.180> with<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:56.289> thermal

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
what would be important with the thermal

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.260 
what would be important with the thermal
is<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.009> colour<00:05:57.250> we<00:05:57.400> would<00:05:57.699> go<00:05:57.849> you<00:05:57.909> would<00:05:58.180> get

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
is the colour we would go you would get

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.689 
is the colour we would go you would get

about the fact that the moon itself has
hit<00:06:58.419> some<00:06:58.690> 50<00:06:59.169> times<00:06:59.469> a<00:06:59.650> year<00:06:59.830> I<00:06:59.889> had<00:07:00.159> no<00:07:00.310> idea

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
it has no atmosphere right there for

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.809 
it has no atmosphere right there for
everything<00:07:05.409> flying<00:07:05.830> through<00:07:06.099> space<00:07:06.129> just

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819 
everything flying through space just

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.159 
everything flying through space just
slams<00:07:07.089> into<00:07:07.389> and<00:07:07.719> there<00:07:07.839> were<00:07:07.930> a<00:07:07.960> lot<00:07:08.139> of

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
slams into and there were a lot of

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:10.230 
slams into and there were a lot of
Twitter<00:07:08.469> questions<00:07:08.919> about<00:07:09.159> a<00:07:09.190> wire<00:07:09.610> we<00:07:09.909> will

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
Twitter questions about a wire we will

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.149 
Twitter questions about a wire we will
that<00:07:10.389> harm<00:07:10.690> the<00:07:10.900> moon<00:07:11.080> and<00:07:11.349> again<00:07:11.589> your<00:07:11.919> point

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:12.159 
that harm the moon and again your point

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.519 
that harm the moon and again your point
is<00:07:12.400> no<00:07:12.610> it<00:07:12.789> gets<00:07:12.909> hit<00:07:13.210> all<00:07:13.419> the<00:07:13.599> time<00:07:13.839> by<00:07:14.139> debris

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:14.529 
is no it gets hit all the time by debris

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:15.990 
is no it gets hit all the time by debris
the<00:07:14.710> reason<00:07:15.009> we<00:07:15.159> don't<00:07:15.370> is<00:07:15.520> we<00:07:15.669> have<00:07:15.849> that

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 
the reason we don't is we have that

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.420 
the reason we don't is we have that
atmosphere<00:07:16.569> and<00:07:16.719> things<00:07:16.960> get<00:07:17.110> kind<00:07:17.830> of<00:07:17.979> burned

atmosphere and things get kind of burned
up<00:07:18.729> as<00:07:18.940> they<00:07:19.330> get<00:07:19.599> anywhere<00:07:19.930> close<00:07:19.960> to<00:07:20.199> us<00:07:20.440> but

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
up as they get anywhere close to us but

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.079 
up as they get anywhere close to us but
there<00:07:20.800> are<00:07:20.889> all<00:07:21.069> the<00:07:21.400> rocks<00:07:21.639> and<00:07:21.909> things

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620 
flying around there hitting the moon all
