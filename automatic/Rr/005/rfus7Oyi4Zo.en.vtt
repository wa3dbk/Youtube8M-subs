with<00:03:41.070> us<00:03:41.220> he<00:03:41.370> was<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.610> council<00:03:42.000> sir<00:03:42.180> and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
with us he was the council sir and

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.810 
with us he was the council sir and
apparently<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.800> stage<00:03:44.040> management<00:03:44.489> and

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
apparently the stage management and

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.070 
apparently the stage management and
management<00:03:45.060> decided<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.600> when<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> band

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
management decided that when the band

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.780 
management decided that when the band
went<00:03:46.290> out<00:03:46.410> they<00:03:46.590> didn't<00:03:46.830> want<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.010> be<00:03:47.190> seen<00:03:47.489> so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
went out they didn't want to be seen so

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.910 
went out they didn't want to be seen so
they<00:03:48.300> taped<00:03:48.600> the<00:03:48.750> back<00:03:48.900> of<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.140> guitar<00:03:49.260> up<00:03:49.650> so

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
they taped the back of the guitar up so

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.320 
they taped the back of the guitar up so
it<00:03:49.980> wouldn't<00:03:50.250> catch<00:03:50.430> any<00:03:50.670> lights<00:03:50.880> so<00:03:51.060> Randy

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
it wouldn't catch any lights so Randy

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.090 
it wouldn't catch any lights so Randy
would<00:03:51.450> go<00:03:51.630> out<00:03:51.720> with<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.989> guitar<00:03:52.050> flipped<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
would go out with the guitar flipped and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.229 
would go out with the guitar flipped and
then<00:03:53.310> when<00:03:53.400> lights<00:03:53.580> came<00:03:53.700> on<00:03:53.820> he<00:03:53.910> flipped<00:03:54.150> it

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
then when lights came on he flipped it

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.640 
then when lights came on he flipped it
over<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.510> no<00:03:54.750> one<00:03:54.870> knew<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:54.989> band<00:03:55.290> were<00:03:55.500> there
