verifiable with painful penalties for

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.750 
verifiable with painful penalties for
missing<00:06:22.960> the<00:06:22.990> targets<00:06:23.530> but<00:06:24.160> I<00:06:24.190> think<00:06:24.310> this

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
missing the targets but I think this

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.510 
missing the targets but I think this
would<00:06:25.030> produce<00:06:25.240> far<00:06:25.660> faster<00:06:25.930> results<00:06:26.380> at<00:06:26.920> much

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
would produce far faster results at much

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.030 
would produce far faster results at much
lower<00:06:27.760> cost<00:06:28.260> and<00:06:29.260> finally<00:06:29.620> we<00:06:29.710> got<00:06:29.800> a<00:06:29.860> letter

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
lower cost and finally we got a letter

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.830 
lower cost and finally we got a letter
from<00:06:30.280> someone<00:06:30.520> whose<00:06:30.820> name<00:06:30.850> I<00:06:31.210> can't<00:06:31.300> even

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.110 
from someone whose name I can't even
read<00:06:32.380> because<00:06:33.190> it<00:06:33.310> looks<00:06:33.490> like<00:06:33.670> it's<00:06:33.850> written

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
read because it looks like it's written
