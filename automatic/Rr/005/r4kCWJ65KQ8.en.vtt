now<00:00:25.100> the<00:00:25.160> way<00:00:25.340> in<00:00:25.460> which<00:00:25.550> I<00:00:25.730> did<00:00:25.940> this<00:00:26.090> was<00:00:26.330> by

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
now the way in which I did this was by

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.570 
now the way in which I did this was by
taking<00:00:26.900> four<00:00:27.140> key<00:00:27.350> aspects<00:00:27.890> of<00:00:28.010> each<00:00:28.220> car

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
taking four key aspects of each car

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.660 
taking four key aspects of each car
speed<00:00:29.240> brakes<00:00:29.740> acceleration<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:30.950> handling<00:00:31.460> I

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
speed brakes acceleration and handling I

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.480 
speed brakes acceleration and handling I
then<00:00:32.119> added<00:00:32.390> these<00:00:32.630> together<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.230> /<00:00:33.890> 4<00:00:34.310> to

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
then added these together and / 4 to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.490 
then added these together and / 4 to
work<00:00:34.670> out<00:00:34.850> an<00:00:35.000> average<00:00:35.420> score<00:00:35.630> for<00:00:35.810> each<00:00:36.110> car

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
work out an average score for each car

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.100 
work out an average score for each car
based<00:00:37.310> on<00:00:37.520> these<00:00:37.700> scores<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.180> then<00:00:38.540> ranked<00:00:38.960> each

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
based on these scores I then ranked each

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.890 
based on these scores I then ranked each
car<00:00:39.500> on<00:00:39.710> this<00:00:39.920> list<00:00:40.160> appropriately<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:41.540> before
