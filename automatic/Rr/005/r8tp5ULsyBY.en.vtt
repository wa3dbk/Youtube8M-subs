00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.049
 I'll call you back with one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.240
 new comments back and there today 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.070
 to share it again to see freud 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.600
 I have that in the last video already 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.060
 announced that it again 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.100
 want to show and last time I have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.750
 the map angeles city showed that 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 I unfortunately did not mention that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'll look at her again I'll do that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.210
 Here's a dazzle and there I have it 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.470
 a bit explained the basics and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.989
 again so likely 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.579
 to classify is in the shooter world there 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.739
 I only arrived shortly afterwards 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.120
 But more than a small forecast can 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.469
 because you do not ask 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 and today I want to come back 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.829
 especially to tell a little more about it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 which also concerns these bots here 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.730
 running around and i mean with bots now 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 not the huge titans you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 No, I really mean that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 ki-controlled players i here one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.629
 I also see them all here 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 kill and I believe that it's even 90 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.859
 if I Kilfitt this reading direction 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.320
 makes fun in any case 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.239
 to play against this bot and to everyone 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.830
 battlefield fans once again no 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.240
 Of course I will take care of that next 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.659
 again battlefield videos 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.549
 bring 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.170
 only now the actions of beta 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.090
 is outside and I really enjoy it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 I did not want to let myself be taken away 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 now make two videos because 1 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 is not enough and somehow 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.130
 I honestly have fun then 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.960
 again so free to comment somehow 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.100
 without a script but just something like that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.570
 I just remember 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 Of course you are welcome to join me 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.740
 Comments write if you like that 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.600
 want to see or if you prefer 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.549
 I wanted to see these tips video else 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.409
 always do because from time to time as a 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.119
 comment as I do here insert 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.009
 just make fun of it all 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.110
 comment and that's why I do that 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.759
 times and as I said today it should be around 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.380
 These bots are what you look like here 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.390
 and i can say this gameplay 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.720
 describes this pretty well there 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.970
 I 'm doing 51 kit of bots and I think so 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.680
 i only kill four pilots with pilots 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.810
 I mean opponent players now 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.939
 really be controlled by humans 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.170
 the pilots in this game and 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.840
 this box there are different 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.549
 They are also classed with, so to speak 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.469
 the generic term for these bots in 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.360
 Minions actually stand on each one 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.680
 so in the scoreboard and then there is 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.020
 the grunts are quite normal 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.440
 foot soldiers who have no jetpack 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.240
 rather 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.160
 you just have a weapon and 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.110
 then there is the spectral what you do 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.730
 Now that's exactly what you can do 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.240
 I can not do that at this time 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.860
 say 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.360
 as I said I have the last video 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.980
 announced I'll take that on 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.240
 friday on because unfortunately I do 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.800
 weekend is not there 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.390
 that means it probably already is 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.920
 I know what the difference is and me 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.930
 probably know it by now 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.580
 but it can not tell you yet because 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 I'm sort of in the past 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.420
 fixed session is not in the future 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.580
 where you can see it is very 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.800
 complicated explain but I guess 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.420
 you have understood that and that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.950
 pilots the players has to play 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.680
 they can have special skills 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.960
 what, of course, this jetpack in front of everyone 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.180
 things really affect you 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.220
 you can hunt wildly through the map 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.970
 objection run you can both ran 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.040
 So do it 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.720
 you can make a double jump in the air 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.450
 and the options on much more than 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.580
 This offered but I have to say I think 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.200
 this one was really good, I think so 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.030
 really good that they integrated the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.680
 because there are very many 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.840
 on the map room you can see that 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.030
 even how many pots I kill if 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.670
 I have to kill 51 of them a lot 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.200
 be and run the most of the time 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.760
 also in some groups around the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.190
 means one meets there already three or 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.780
 more on and really can be nine 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.550
 kill I think that 's it 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.739
 when it was not a new kill 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.090
 then I have the spelled missing 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.530
 I'll read that wrong then 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.300
 Sorry but I mean that was one 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.310
 and need re already a few 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.630
 kills and those bots that are easy 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.330
 so much fun because you just 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.459
 feels totally overpowering in this game 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.010
 I really do make a lot of kids 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.630
 have four opposing players in this 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.880
 round killed and I got it anyway 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.170
 as the god of the world led all the way 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.230
 honestly because it's just so much fun 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.970
 makes all this wreath or these bots 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.560
 I can only slaughter it 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.180
 Emphasize because they really are 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.010
 they do not really do that much 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.480
 but they will also have you 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.980
 just really a good chance 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 shoot down here is an enemy 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.060
 unfortunately the pilot got caught because of that 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.459
 I'm trampled on by the opponent 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.780
 Titan I definitely think so 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.150
 Pretty good that they have these bots 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.739
 It just makes it easy to install 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.900
 that you do not have that much frustration in this 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.730
 It was yes at call of duty 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.870
 then somehow so that all players even 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.239
 not that bad I have been 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.739
 Anyway, noticed that the skill level 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.850
 in this game about the parts always 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.320
 has risen further 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.940
 I mean you can now too 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.930
 Keep what you want that's mine 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.580
 view of it 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.200
 and at some point it was just 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.060
 frustrating if you do not have something 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.430
 has got you totally on 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.590
 killed and you have in this game 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.880
 just not at all yes I compare that 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.040
 now a bit with call of duty 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.630
 why i am still a battlefield channel 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.400
 yes, but I also have a lot in the past 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.840
 played call of duty and I also totally 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.190
 a lot of call of duty on this channel 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.320
 brought and therefore this is 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.600
 comparison actually appropriate and 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 now to come back one has 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.320
 Just this frustration wich you see it 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.670
 yes, how can I kill all those bots 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.130
 Now I was once again from one 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.650
 pilots killed but these pilots the 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.380
 You can easily meet the commits 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.690
 not even the most often the opponents 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.880
 walk around here are just the most part 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.190
 partly controlled by the players 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.570
 be or run around freely and before 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.920
 all things are offered here you can see 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.930
 again you just one 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.430
 can kill faster and does that 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.190
 really enjoy this game 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.630
 Of course it is not really that way 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.030
 competitive that means it is not now 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.680
 really her husband against man who 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.840
 has the best skill that is it now 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.540
 not it is just who has luck and 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.130
 just as a lot of bots are running 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.840
 the spawnen land somewhere, so to speak 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.760
 often on the map if you happen to be there 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.930
 just then you can really many 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.730
 kids do that makes it all 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.980
 Of course I say a little bit 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.140
 random moderately and then he is not like that 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.310
 suitable for the spot area like me 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.200
 see that 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.610
 People like competitive things like that 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.160
 want to play that he has not always 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.420
 necessarily to do with sport but that 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.280
 it rather something like I do now 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.900
 I've heard a game for people who 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.120
 simple and fun shooter need the 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.470
 just want to play it 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.420
 the simple packages want to do the 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.270
 So just want to have a good time 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.370
 Just because you just like I said 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.320
 little frustration one has a lot 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.000
 fun to kill at this india 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.530
 of course I had from others now 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.150
 even the opposite belongs to the 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.370
 example of the phantom gaming that holds it 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.780
 prefer that only pilots run around the 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.340
 means only man-controlled 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.990
 I can play all players 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.160
 understand but I do not need it 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.440
 Here you can see it again 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.850
 whole heap of these media they 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.500
 just stand around here and you can 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.160
 Just kill everyone and they will notice it 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.570
 not even 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.860
 It may not look that way 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.870
 exciting but it really does 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.880
 Huge fun and I can do such 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.620
 new tries on the whole if you 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.030
 now you can when you have the beta code 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.830
 maybe you can somehow 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.010
 Another one I get the die 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.300
 registration has unfortunately expired 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.730
 Otherwise, the game is also on 11 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.800
 March out if you preorder it 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.240
 volt and wanted to support me 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.650
 I have to do this now 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.360
 say because I had planned 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.820
 Of course, then I would be happy 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.130
 if you blink my mmo will use 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.170
 or my amazon link both in the 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.270
 description stand thereby you have 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.860
 no more costs but I get 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.810
 only a small part of 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.510
 Amazon for you, so to speak 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.950
 really is not expensive and has for me 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:06.300
 always worth it a bit if 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.010
 because a few people order from you 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.410
 Of course I would be glad you have to 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.180
 Of course, it's just that it's not 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.740
 once I've mentioned that comes 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.150
 always bad but i thought so 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.710
 I'll just do it now 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.120
 I hope you 'll take that from me now 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.500
 not so bad if you do not do it 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.880
 want to let it then just take it 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.800
 link from any other youtuber 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.930
 or no I have no problem at all 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.490
 with everything as it wanted to do and me 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.780
 think that already tilts today 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.850
 back to the end I wanted to 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.080
 I can now tell you more 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.670
 I will not even look 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.380
 still one or the other video too 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.940
 Keep this game open for me 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.450
 every event is as much fun as it is 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.520
 moment 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.020
 Here you can already see the game shows 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.760
 In the end, you have to do this now 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.340
 Drop ship to kill what I have never 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.020
 has done so far is somehow 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.580
 relatively heavy and you can me 

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.960
 of course, again your opinion in 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.720
 Write the comments you will find 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.740
 this box should be well loved 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.870
 let out now I have that 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.670
 he rolled quite nicely is me too 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.020
 Never happened like that and I would 

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.000
 of course, also about a rating 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:02.780
 I look forward to my name is more quest and me
