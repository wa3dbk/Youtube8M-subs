my<00:02:29.099> PC<00:02:29.700> bill<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.299> think<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.140> this

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
my PC bill I think I think that this

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.180 
my PC bill I think I think that this
card<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.250> pretty<00:02:32.640> much<00:02:32.819> all<00:02:33.690> around<00:02:34.319> card<00:02:34.769> and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
card is pretty much all around card and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.580 
card is pretty much all around card and
then<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:35.519> gonna<00:02:35.640> be<00:02:35.909> pretty<00:02:36.659> relevant<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
then it's gonna be pretty relevant for a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.440 
then it's gonna be pretty relevant for a
while<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.129> don't<00:02:38.430> worry<00:02:38.700> really<00:02:39.090> too<00:02:39.269> much

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
while I don't worry really too much

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
is pretty good by itself it's gonna be

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.339 
is pretty good by itself it's gonna be
able<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.590> run<00:03:07.799> battle<00:03:08.609> for<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> at<00:03:09.239> medium<00:03:10.109> and

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.900 
high graphics at 60 frames per second
and<00:03:13.079> I<00:03:13.379> do<00:03:13.440> aim<00:03:13.859> for<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.190> 60<00:03:14.519> frames<00:03:14.700> per

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
and I do aim for the 60 frames per

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.550 
and I do aim for the 60 frames per
second<00:03:15.390> mark<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:15.750> only<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:16.109> reason

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
second mark for only one reason

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.860 
second mark for only one reason
because<00:03:17.010> after<00:03:17.579> 60<00:03:17.940> frames<00:03:18.180> per<00:03:18.269> second<00:03:18.750> you

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
because after 60 frames per second you

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.500 
because after 60 frames per second you
can't<00:03:19.109> really<00:03:19.319> tell<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.739> difference<00:03:20.220> now<00:03:20.910> the

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
can't really tell a difference now the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
can't really tell a difference now the
last<00:03:21.780> graphics<00:03:22.290> card<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.709> my<00:03:22.799> list<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.280> a

last graphics card on my list is a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.030 
last graphics card on my list is a
Nvidia<00:03:24.209> graphics<00:03:24.450> card<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.440> I'm<00:03:25.829> not<00:03:26.010> a

Nvidia graphics card and I'm not a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.699 
Nvidia graphics card and I'm not a
biggest<00:03:26.549> fan<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:26.790> Nvidia<00:03:27.390> it's<00:03:28.170> not<00:03:28.410> like<00:03:28.590> I

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
biggest fan of Nvidia it's not like I

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.770 
biggest fan of Nvidia it's not like I
hate<00:03:28.920> them<00:03:29.190> or<00:03:29.370> anything<00:03:29.609> it's<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.419> I

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
hate them or anything it's just that I

don't really have any experience with

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.479 
don't really have any experience with
them<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.690> cards<00:03:34.079> are<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> bit<00:03:34.650> higher<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
them the cards are a bit higher but I

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.150 
them the cards are a bit higher but I
heard<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.299> lot<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.660> people<00:03:36.900> say<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.380> your

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
heard and a lot of people say that your

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.159 
heard and a lot of people say that your
performance<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:39.090> better<00:03:39.359> in<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.989> car

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
performance is better in the car

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.740 
performance is better in the car
non-water<00:03:40.530> suggests<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.220> isn't<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> best

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
non-water suggests you isn't the best

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.770 
non-water suggests you isn't the best
card<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.290> reprimand<00:03:43.669> for<00:03:44.669> those<00:03:45.150> guys<00:03:45.389> who

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780

love<00:03:46.019> Nvidia<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.760> 660ti<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.780> think<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.470> pretty

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
love Nvidia the 660ti I think is pretty

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.270 
love Nvidia the 660ti I think is pretty
much<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.880> best<00:03:51.090> mate<00:03:52.049> range<00:03:52.349> card<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:53.160> can

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
much the best mate range card you can

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.020 
much the best mate range card you can
get<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:53.430> card<00:03:53.790> around<00:03:54.650> 250<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.950> 300<00:03:56.639> dollars

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
get this card around 250 to 300 dollars

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.640 
get this card around 250 to 300 dollars
and<00:03:57.269> around<00:03:57.540> when<00:03:57.690> Black<00:03:57.900> Friday<00:03:58.169> comes<00:03:58.440> out

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and around when Black Friday comes out

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.830 
and around when Black Friday comes out
I'm<00:03:58.829> sure<00:03:58.859> it's<00:03:59.190> gonna<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.400> around<00:03:59.730> 200<00:03:59.940> card

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
I'm sure it's gonna be around 200 card

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.020 
I'm sure it's gonna be around 200 card
does<00:04:01.049> not<00:04:01.079> have<00:04:01.530> great<00:04:01.799> price<00:04:02.310> performance

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
does not have great price performance

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.020 
does not have great price performance
because<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.870> 7950<00:04:04.650> can<00:04:05.069> easily<00:04:05.880> be

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
because the 7950 can easily be

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.860 
because the 7950 can easily be
overclocked<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.620> regular<00:04:08.010> 660ti<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.840> I

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
overclocked to a regular 660ti so I

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.990 
overclocked to a regular 660ti so I
would<00:04:10.230> not<00:04:10.410> recommend<00:04:10.859> this<00:04:11.069> car<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:11.730> did

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
would not recommend this car but I did

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.539 
would not recommend this car but I did
want<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.329> put<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> Nvidia<00:04:13.230> card<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.829> this<00:04:14.220> list
