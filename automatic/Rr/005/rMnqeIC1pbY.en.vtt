00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
looking for so we just select that hit

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.410 
looking for so we just select that hit
next

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
next

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.999

now<00:02:00.420> it'll<00:02:00.810> set<00:02:01.079> up<00:02:01.109> a<00:02:01.289> passkey<00:02:01.859> which

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
now it'll set up a passkey which

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.510 
now it'll set up a passkey which
basically<00:02:02.479> sets<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.600> password<00:02:04.109> up<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.979> you're
