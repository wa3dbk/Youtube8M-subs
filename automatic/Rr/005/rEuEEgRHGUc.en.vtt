00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.980

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.070

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.430
 die I had not said I never have 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.790
 entertainment this is what I hope 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.889

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.560

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.030
 I have to mount this louis console 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.620
 he has a channel on youtube so I'm going 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.050
 to leave here down it's worth it does it with another 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.669
 girl called be gamer and usually influence 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.039
 about the English of things times quite 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.259
 interesting goes away even English 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.180
 so that the typical game in English that 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:40.650
 it has not even come out sometimes I think 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.150
 I had an avatar that I do not know if 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.949
 I finish I think so, but anyway 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.740
 has a lot of things in that channel and 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.689
 well you can spend a little time already 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.880
 you know, I think it's the least we can 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.830
 do all here why 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.440
 this this can load a lot of 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.830
 media guys 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.360
 you see 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.280
 You see tÃ©lam and my starting point like that 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.080
 that nothing I hope you liked it is 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.340
 that a good boxing is the first 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.350
 I do what I've done well but we have 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.330
 some controls I have pure entertainment 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.520
 one for each side with this one sent to 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.740
 play and today with this will play or member or 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.160
 I do not know I do not know 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:24.820
 Well nothing thanks in real Luis and in another 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.970
 video playing some 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.760
 so nothing you already know tell me what 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.980
 games you play in it when 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.330
 you have more, you see her have that way 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.320
 that nothing to sit that they are and they are 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.320
 ask for vast advantage
