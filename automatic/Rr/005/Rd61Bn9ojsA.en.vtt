00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.680
 that I have prepared for you by 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.070
 Of course, the applications that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.890
 I bring now it's the turn of a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.640
 very good application pretty showy 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.220
 nice and that gives a point that father 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.490
 from your computer 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.520
 this is for all brands and the 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:51.590
 application is called and sorry this 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.750
 application has the function of displaying 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.550
 a preview of the windows that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.360
 they are minimized but active 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.630
 in your mouth that is to say it shows you in a 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.990
 small window what the content of 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.810
 of that application or that window comes in 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.870
 minimized I'm going to show you here I have 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.940
 some applications open good 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:19.970
 see the mobile and there's that preview 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.000
 visualization that would be this and we can 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.830
 close 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.860
 and we can add a year to open a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.700
 new function of forgiveness but good that 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.700
 It is the main function 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.620
 I'm going to show you 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.620
 here I already opened what is the movie 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.480
 to close here 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.850
 and well let's do this we're going to 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.740
 to show 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.740
 what we have active 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.680
 maybe if the matrix we leave our 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.050
 our cursor on the window performs 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.000
 this function realize is the window 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.460
 on the whole screen but it's semi 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.500
 transparent then it is giving us a 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.850
 preview of what it brings the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.450
 window no 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.470
 and well here we can give us a function 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.480

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.850
