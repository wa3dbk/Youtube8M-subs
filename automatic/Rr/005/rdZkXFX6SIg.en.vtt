just went white which is good because

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.840 
just went white which is good because
that<00:02:58.880> means<00:02:59.030> it's<00:02:59.330> actually<00:02:59.690> brooding<00:03:00.490> i<00:03:01.490> did

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
that means it's actually brooding i did

notice that the windows version takes a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050 
notice that the windows version takes a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
little bit longer to send the two files

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.700 
little bit longer to send the two files
over<00:03:05.450> to<00:03:05.570> your<00:03:05.750> device<00:03:06.020> than<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.440> doesn't

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
over to your device than it doesn't

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.310 
over to your device than it doesn't
matter<00:03:06.860> as<00:03:07.070> 10<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:08.090> that's<00:03:08.360> not<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.840> big<00:03:09.140> deal

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
matter as 10 but that's not a big deal

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.870 
matter as 10 but that's not a big deal
because<00:03:09.560> as<00:03:09.830> long<00:03:09.950> as<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.220> works<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.700> doesn't

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
because as long as it works it doesn't

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.100 
because as long as it works it doesn't
really<00:03:11.090> matter<00:03:13.390> alright<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.660> once<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.959> says

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
really matter alright so once it says

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.350 
really matter alright so once it says
exiting<00:03:15.620> live<00:03:15.950> poison<00:03:16.640> that<00:03:16.940> means<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.330> is

exiting live poison that means it is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.870 
exiting live poison that means it is
finished<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.070> you<00:03:19.070> could<00:03:19.280> go<00:03:19.370> ahead<00:03:19.400> and

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
finished and you could go ahead and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.520 
finished and you could go ahead and
close<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> command<00:03:21.110> prompt<00:03:21.470> window

close that at the command prompt window

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.850 
close that at the command prompt window
and<00:03:22.010> anything<00:03:22.580> else<00:03:22.670> that<00:03:22.820> you<00:03:22.970> may<00:03:23.090> have<00:03:23.120> open

and then your iDevice is going to

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.550 
and then your iDevice is going to
continue<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.600> boot<00:03:26.810> it's<00:03:27.110> going<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.320> stick

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
continue to boot it's going to stick

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.230 
continue to boot it's going to stick
with<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.770> white<00:03:27.950> screen<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:28.790> just<00:03:29.120> don't

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
with the white screen so just don't

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.150 
with the white screen so just don't
worry<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.780> will<00:03:29.930> boot<00:03:30.200> eventually<00:03:30.709> maybe

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
worry it will boot eventually maybe

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.800 
worry it will boot eventually maybe
between<00:03:31.550> 30<00:03:31.910> seconds<00:03:32.330> to<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.450> couple<00:03:32.750> of
