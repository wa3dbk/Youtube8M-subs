00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:09.549
 Hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.730
 be very different from what I do 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.859
 usually I saw today you have faith I go 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.380
 To make you clothes like this. 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.060
 You do not know how to make a skirt with 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.650
 elastic because it is much easier to 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
 cause they can only do too 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.759
 huh 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.829
 It's actually for me to make this video myself. 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.439
 I made a lot of resistance I did not want to 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.360
 make a video talk about clothes because 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.240
 you think you have nothing better than yourself 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.010
 someone was going to get to do what this 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.360
 girl is useless but then some friends 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.730
 that this is a differential because 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.920
 the same way I can do some 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.930
 people could take reference of themselves 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.430
 do also is doing 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.640
 themselves makes page is then 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.110
 I decided to do good so let's start 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.180
 because I saw this video stayed a little 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.060
 long but I'm going to try to cut the maximum 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.430
 that I can try is to go fast 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.900
 some parts as much as you can for 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.920
 not so good that I do not like 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.820
 videos do and 70 centimeters of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.789
 fabric 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.979
 I bought a barbecue 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:24.289
 according to my waist I bought 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:26.359
 It's 62 63 64 63 then a little bit 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.640
 but you do not really need to because 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.530
 You have to get a little tight 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.909
 third, do the following, I'll go 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.749
 catch him 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.749
 so the woman would have it that way. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.299
 so I 'll do it, I'll double that. 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:48.859
 tissue ok 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.729
 He is now doubled. I work. I 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:58.099
 I'll come back like this in this girl here. 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:02:09.670
 I'm going to leave practically looks just like 

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:09.670
 I 'll leave it and I'll cut it and here 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:24.230
 although it is possible to hear it so it already leaves 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.010
 ready now I think you are going 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.420
 measure on your waist you want up 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.370
 of the navel but nobody wants a little 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:47.180
