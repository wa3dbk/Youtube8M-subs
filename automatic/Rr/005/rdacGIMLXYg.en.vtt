so I'm just hitting there now just to
give<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.280> an<00:02:38.340> example

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
give you an example

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.210 
give you an example
jump<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.290> jump<00:02:40.530> get<00:02:41.160> there<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.860> this<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.040> what

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
jump you jump get there so this is what

jump you jump get there so this is what
we<00:02:44.310> got<00:02:44.460> set<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.150> now<00:02:45.240> mass-produce

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
we got set up so we can now mass-produce

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.490 
we got set up so we can now mass-produce
our<00:02:46.080> vegetables<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.950> short<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.520> many

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
our vegetables really short so many

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.400 
our vegetables really short so many
sounds<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.710> spa<00:02:50.280> bath<00:02:50.490> going<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.090> here

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
sounds like a spa bath going on in here

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.570 
sounds like a spa bath going on in here
and<00:02:52.410> as<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.680> see<00:02:52.740> we<00:02:52.920> got<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.100> set<00:02:53.280> up<00:02:53.370> yeah

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
and as you can see we got to set up yeah

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.670 
and as you can see we got to set up yeah
our<00:02:54.000> irrigation<00:02:54.300> actually<00:02:54.840> doesn't<00:02:55.350> stream

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
our irrigation actually doesn't stream

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.020 
our irrigation actually doesn't stream
straight<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> river<00:02:56.460> we've<00:02:56.760> got<00:02:56.910> an

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
straight for the river we've got an

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.750 
straight for the river we've got an
irrigation<00:02:57.510> pipe<00:02:57.720> running<00:02:58.440> down<00:02:58.770> into<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
irrigation pipe running down into the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.580 
irrigation pipe running down into the
ground<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.330> people<00:03:01.020> can't<00:03:01.230> destroy

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
ground so people can't destroy

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.440 
ground so people can't destroy
irrigation<00:03:02.580> from<00:03:02.700> outside<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.300> building

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
irrigation from outside the building

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.570 
irrigation from outside the building
they<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.930> break<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.470> do<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.220> then

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
they have to break in to do it and then

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.860 
they have to break in to do it and then
for<00:03:05.760> example<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.150> can<00:03:06.240> just<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.510> your<00:03:06.630> crops

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
for example you can just have your crops

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.790 
for example you can just have your crops
that<00:03:06.990> grow<00:03:07.050> here<00:03:07.700> if<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.940> show<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:11.870> go<00:03:12.870> and

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
that grow here if I can show you go and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.740 
that grow here if I can show you go and
this<00:03:14.040> allows<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.820> know<00:03:14.850> are<00:03:15.660> you
