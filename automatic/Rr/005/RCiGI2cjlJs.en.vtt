00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
target I've done this with first-time

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.200 
target I've done this with first-time
shooters<00:05:59.620> that<00:06:00.430> could<00:06:00.610> barely<00:06:00.850> hit<00:06:01.120> the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
shooters that could barely hit the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.300 
shooters that could barely hit the
target<00:06:01.600> two<00:06:02.020> experienced<00:06:02.590> shooters<00:06:03.010> that

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
target two experienced shooters that

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.280 
target two experienced shooters that
would<00:06:03.460> be<00:06:03.670> hitting<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.210> target<00:06:04.570> on<00:06:04.840> that<00:06:05.050> size

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
would be hitting the target on that size

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.350 
would be hitting the target on that size
but<00:06:05.470> they'd<00:06:05.590> be<00:06:05.650> all<00:06:05.890> over<00:06:06.250> and<00:06:06.430> putting<00:06:07.150> them

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
but they'd be all over and putting them

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.910 
but they'd be all over and putting them
in<00:06:07.540> the<00:06:07.660> tight<00:06:07.840> groups<00:06:08.140> that<00:06:08.440> were<00:06:08.560> roughly

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:08.920 
in the tight groups that were roughly

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.160 
in the tight groups that were roughly
around<00:06:09.100> that<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:10.420> know<00:06:10.480> inside<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:10.840> nine

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170

that tight fifteen yards of the target
that<00:07:00.130> size<00:07:00.430> it<00:07:00.940> doesn't<00:07:01.360> matter<00:07:01.510> if<00:07:01.660> you're

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
that size it doesn't matter if you're

hitting<00:07:01.990> the<00:07:02.050> orange<00:07:02.490> and<00:07:03.490> if<00:07:03.700> you<00:07:04.000> know<00:07:04.090> you

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
hitting the orange and if you know you

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.430 
hitting the orange and if you know you
really<00:07:04.480> want<00:07:04.630> to<00:07:04.690> correct<00:07:04.900> that<00:07:05.050> it<00:07:05.200> probably

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 
really want to correct that it probably

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.810 
really want to correct that it probably
means<00:07:05.680> because<00:07:05.950> it's<00:07:06.100> an<00:07:06.190> eye<00:07:06.310> dominance

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
means because it's an eye dominance
